            <p>　　 It was a strange condition of things, the honeymoon being over, 
              and the bridesmaids gone home, when I found myself sitting down 
              in my own small house with Dora; quite thrown out of employment, 
              as I may say, in respect of the delicious old occupation of making 
              love. </p>
            <p>　　It seemed such an extraordinary thing to have Dora always there. 
              It was so unaccountable not to be obliged to go out to see her, 
              not to have any occasion to be tormenting myself about her, not 
              to have to write to her, not to be scheming and devising opportunities 
              of being alone with her. Sometimes of an evening, when I looked 
              up from my writing, and saw her seated opposite, I would lean back 
              in my chair, and think how queer it was that there we were, alone 
              together as a matter of course - nobody's business any more - all 
              the romance of our engagement put away upon a shelf, to rust - no 
              one to please but one another - one another to please, for life. 
            </p>
            <p>　　When there was a debate, and I was kept out very late, it seemed 
              so strange to me, as I was walking home, to think that Dora was 
              at home! It was such a wonderful thing, at first, to have her coming 
              softly down to talk to me as I ate my supper. It was such a stupendous 
              thing to know for certain that she put her hair in papers. It was 
              altogether such an astonishing event to see her do it! </p>
            <p>　　I doubt whether two young birds could have known less about keeping 
              house, than I and my pretty Dora did. We had a servant, of course. 
              She kept house for us. I have still a latent belief that she must 
              have been Mrs. Crupp's daughter in disguise, we had such an awful 
              time of it with Mary Anne. </p>
            <p>　　Her name was Paragon. Her nature was represented to us, when 
              we engaged her, as being feebly expressed in her name. She had a 
              written character, as large as a proclamation; and, according to 
              this document, could do everything of a domestic nature that ever 
              I heard of, and a great many things that I never did hear of. She 
              was a woman in the prime of life; of a severe countenance; and subject 
              (particularly in the arms) to a sort of perpetual measles or fiery 
              rash. She had a cousin in the Life-Guards, with such long legs that 
              he looked like the afternoon shadow of somebody else. His shell-jacket 
              was as much too little for him as he was too big for the premises. 
              He made the cottage smaller than it need have been, by being so 
              very much out of proportion to it. Besides which, the walls were 
              not thick, and, whenever he passed the evening at our house, we 
              always knew of it by hearing one continual growl in the kitchen. 
            </p>
            <p>　　Our treasure was warranted sober and honest. I am therefore willing 
              to believe that she was in a fit when we found her under the boiler; 
              and that the deficient tea-spoons were attributable to the dustman. 
            </p>
            <p>　　But she preyed upon our minds dreadfully. We felt our inexperience, 
              and were unable to help ourselves. We should have been at her mercy, 
              if she had had any; but she was a remorseless woman, and had none. 
              She was the cause of our first little quarrel. </p>
            <p>　　'My dearest life,' I said one day to Dora, 'do you think Mary 
              Anne has any idea of time?' </p>
            <p>　　'Why, Doady?' inquired Dora, looking up, innocently, from her 
              drawing. </p>
            <p>　　'My love, because it's five, and we were to have dined at four.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　Dora glanced wistfully at the clock, and hinted that she thought 
              it was too fast. </p>
            <p>　　'On the contrary, my love,' said I, referring to my watch, 'it's 
              a few minutes too slow.' </p>
            <p>　　My little wife came and sat upon my knee, to coax me to be quiet, 
              and drew a line with her pencil down the middle of my nose; but 
              I couldn't dine off that, though it was very agreeable. </p>
            <p>　　'Don't you think, my dear,' said I, 'it would be better for you 
              to remonstrate with Mary Anne?' </p>
            <p>　　'Oh no, please! I couldn't, Doady!' said Dora. </p>
            <p>　　'Why not, my love?' I gently asked. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, because I am such a little goose,' said Dora, 'and she knows 
              I am!' </p>
            <p>　　I thought this sentiment so incompatible with the establishment 
              of any system of check on Mary Anne, that I frowned a little. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, what ugly wrinkles in my bad boy's forehead!' said Dora, 
              and still being on my knee, she traced them with her pencil; putting 
              it to her rosy lips to make it mark blacker, and working at my forehead 
              with a quaint little mockery of being industrious, that quite delighted 
              me in spite of myself. </p>
            <p>　　'There's a good child,' said Dora, 'it makes its face so much 
              prettier to laugh.' 'But, my love,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'No, no! please!' cried Dora, with a kiss, 'don't be a naughty 
              Blue Beard! Don't be serious!' </p>
            <p>　　'my precious wife,' said I, 'we must be serious sometimes. Come! 
              Sit down on this chair, close beside me! Give me the pencil! There! 
              Now let us talk sensibly. You know, dear'; what a little hand it 
              was to hold, and what a tiny wedding-ring it was to see! 'You know, 
              my love, it is not exactly comfortable to have to go out without 
              one's dinner. Now, is it?' </p>
            <p>　　'N-n-no!' replied Dora, faintly. </p>
            <p>　　'My love, how you tremble!' </p>
            <p>　　'Because I KNOW you're going to scold me,' exclaimed Dora, in 
              a piteous voice. </p>
            <p>　　'My sweet, I am only going to reason.' </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, but reasoning is worse than scolding!' exclaimed Dora, in 
              despair. 'I didn't marry to be reasoned with. If you meant to reason 
              with such a poor little thing as I am, you ought to have told me 
              so, you cruel boy!' </p>
            <p>　　I tried to pacify Dora, but she turned away her face, and shook 
              her curls from side to side, and said, 'You cruel, cruel boy!' so 
              many times, that I really did not exactly know what to do: so I 
              took a few turns up and down the room in my uncertainty, and came 
              back again. </p>
            <p>　　'Dora, my darling!' </p>
            <p>　　'No, I am not your darling. Because you must be sorry that you 
              married me, or else you wouldn't reason with me!' returned Dora. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I felt so injured by the inconsequential nature of this charge, 
              that it gave me courage to be grave. </p>
            <p>　　'Now, my own Dora,' said I, 'you are very childish, and are talking 
              nonsense. You must remember, I am sure, that I was obliged to go 
              out yesterday when dinner was half over; and that, the day before, 
              I was made quite unwell by being obliged to eat underdone veal in 
              a hurry; today, I don't dine at all - and I am afraid to say how 
              long we waited for breakfast - and then the water didn't boil. I 
              don't mean to reproach you, my dear, but this is not comfortable.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, you cruel, cruel boy, to say I am a disagreeable wife!' 
              cried Dora. </p>
            <p>　　'Now, my dear Dora, you must know that I never said that!' </p>
            <p>　　'You said, I wasn't comfortable!' cried Dora. 'I said the housekeeping 
              was not comfortable!' </p>
            <p>　　'It's exactly the same thing!' cried Dora. And she evidently 
              thought so, for she wept most grievously. </p>
            <p>　　I took another turn across the room, full of love for my pretty 
              wife, and distracted by self-accusatory inclinations to knock my 
              head against the door. I sat down again, and said: </p>
            <p>　　'I am not blaming you, Dora. We have both a great deal to learn. 
              I am only trying to show you, my dear, that you must - you really 
              must' (I was resolved not to give this up) - 'accustom yourself 
              to look after Mary Anne. Likewise to act a little for yourself, 
              and me.' </p>
            <p>　　'I wonder, I do, at your making such ungrateful speeches,' sobbed 
              Dora. 'When you know that the other day, when you said you would 
              like a little bit of fish, I went out myself, miles and miles, and 
              ordered it, to surprise you.' </p>
            <p>　　'And it was very kind of you, my own darling,' said I. 'I felt 
              it so much that I wouldn't on any account have even mentioned that 
              you bought a Salmon - which was too much for two. Or that it cost 
              one pound six - which was more than we can afford.' </p>
            <p>　　'You enjoyed it very much,' sobbed Dora. 'And you said I was 
              a Mouse.' </p>
            <p>　　'And I'll say so again, my love,' I returned, 'a thousand times!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　But I had wounded Dora's soft little heart, and she was not to 
              be comforted. She was so pathetic in her sobbing and bewailing, 
              that I felt as if I had said I don't know what to hurt her. I was 
              obliged to hurry away; I was kept out late; and I felt all night 
              such pangs of remorse as made me miserable. I had the conscience 
              of an assassin, and was haunted by a vague sense of enormous wickedness. 
            </p>
            <p>　　It was two or three hours past midnight when I got home. I found 
              my aunt, in our house, sitting up for me. </p>
            <p>　　'Is anything the matter, aunt?' said I, alarmed. </p>
            <p>　　'Nothing, Trot,' she replied. 'Sit down, sit down. Little Blossom 
              has been rather out of spirits, and I have been keeping her company. 
              That's all.' </p>
            <p>　　I leaned my head upon my hand; and felt more sorry and downcast, 
              as I sat looking at the fire, than I could have supposed possible 
              so soon after the fulfilment of my brightest hopes. As I sat thinking, 
              I happened to meet my aunt's eyes, which were resting on my face. 
              There was an anxious expression in them, but it cleared directly. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I assure you, aunt,' said I, 'I have been quite unhappy myself 
              all night, to think of Dora's being so. But I had no other intention 
              than to speak to her tenderly and lovingly about our home-affairs.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　MY aunt nodded encouragement. </p>
            <p>　　'You must have patience, Trot,' said she. </p>
            <p>　　'Of course. Heaven knows I don't mean to be unreasonable, aunt!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'No, no,' said my aunt. 'But Little Blossom is a very tender 
              little blossom, and the wind must be gentle with her.' </p>
            <p>　　I thanked my good aunt, in my heart, for her tenderness towards 
              my wife; and I was sure that she knew I did. </p>
            <p>　　'Don't you think, aunt,' said I, after some further contemplation 
              of the fire, 'that you could advise and counsel Dora a little, for 
              our mutual advantage, now and then?' </p>
            <p>　　'Trot,' returned my aunt, with some emotion, 'no! Don't ask me 
              such a thing.' </p>
            <p>　　Her tone was so very earnest that I raised my eyes in surprise. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I look back on my life, child,' said my aunt, 'and I think of 
              some who are in their graves, with whom I might have been on kinder 
              terms. If I judged harshly of other people's mistakes in marriage, 
              it may have been because I had bitter reason to judge harshly of 
              my own. Let that pass. I have been a grumpy, frumpy, wayward sort 
              of a woman, a good many years. I am still, and I always shall be. 
              But you and I have done one another some good, Trot, - at all events, 
              you have done me good, my dear; and division must not come between 
              us, at this time of day.' </p>
            <p>　　'Division between us!' cried I. </p>
            <p>　　'Child, child!' said my aunt, smoothing her dress, 'how soon 
              it might come between us, or how unhappy I might make our Little 
              Blossom, if I meddled in anything, a prophet couldn't say. I want 
              our pet to like me, and be as gay as a butterfly. Remember your 
              own home, in that second marriage; and never do both me and her 
              the injury you have hinted at!' </p>
            <p>　　I comprehended, at once, that my aunt was right; and I comprehended 
              the full extent of her generous feeling towards my dear wife. </p>
            <p>　　'These are early days, Trot,' she pursued, 'and Rome was not 
              built in a day, nor in a year. You have chosen freely for yourself'; 
              a cloud passed over her face for a moment, I thought; 'and you have 
              chosen a very pretty and a very affectionate creature. It will be 
              your duty, and it will be your pleasure too - of course I know that; 
              I am not delivering a lecture - to estimate her (as you chose her) 
              by the qualities she has, and not by the qualities she may not have. 
              The latter you must develop in her, if you can. And if you cannot, 
              child,' here my aunt rubbed her nose, 'you must just accustom yourself 
              to do without 'em. But remember, my dear, your future is between 
              you two. No one can assist you; you are to work it out for yourselves. 
              This is marriage, Trot; and Heaven bless you both, in it, for a 
              pair of babes in the wood as you are!' </p>
            <p>　　My aunt said this in a sprightly way, and gave me a kiss to ratify 
              the blessing. </p>
            <p>　　'Now,' said she, 'light my little lantern, and see me into my 
              bandbox by the garden path'; for there was a communication between 
              our cottages in that direction. 'Give Betsey Trotwood's love to 
              Blossom, when you come back; and whatever you do, Trot, never dream 
              of setting Betsey up as a scarecrow, for if I ever saw her in the 
              glass, she's quite grim enough and gaunt enough in her private capacity!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　With this my aunt tied her head up in a handkerchief, with which 
              she was accustomed to make a bundle of it on such occasions; and 
              I escorted her home. As she stood in her garden, holding up her 
              little lantern to light me back, I thought her observation of me 
              had an anxious air again; but I was too much occupied in pondering 
              on what she had said, and too much impressed - for the first time, 
              in reality - by the conviction that Dora and I had indeed to work 
              out our future for ourselves, and that no one could assist us, to 
              take much notice of it. </p>
            <p>　　Dora came stealing down in her little slippers, to meet me, now 
              that I was alone; and cried upon my shoulder, and said I had been 
              hard-hearted and she had been naughty; and I said much the same 
              thing in effect, I believe; and we made it up, and agreed that our 
              first little difference was to be our last, and that we were never 
              to have another if we lived a hundred years. </p>
            <p>　　The next domestic trial we went through, was the Ordeal of Servants. 
              Mary Anne's cousin deserted into our coal-hole, and was brought 
              out, to our great amazement, by a piquet of his companions in arms, 
              who took him away handcuffed in a procession that covered our front-garden 
              with ignominy. This nerved me to get rid of Mary Anne, who went 
              so mildly, on receipt of wages, that I was surprised, until I found 
              out about the tea-spoons, and also about the little sums she had 
              borrowed in my name of the tradespeople without authority. After 
              an interval of Mrs. Kidgerbury - the oldest inhabitant of Kentish 
              Town, I believe, who went out charing, but was too feeble to execute 
              her conceptions of that art - we found another treasure, who was 
              one of the most amiable of women, but who generally made a point 
              of falling either up or down the kitchen stairs with the tray, and 
              almost plunged into the parlour, as into a bath, with the tea-things. 
              The ravages committed by this unfortunate, rendering her dismissal 
              necessary, she was succeeded (with intervals of Mrs. Kidgerbury) 
              by a long line of Incapables; terminating in a young person of genteel 
              appearance, who went to Greenwich Fair in Dora's bonnet. After whom 
              I remember nothing but an average equality of failure. </p>
            <p>　　Everybody we had anything to do with seemed to cheat us. Our 
              appearance in a shop was a signal for the damaged goods to be brought 
              out immediately. If we bought a lobster, it was full of water. All 
              our meat turned out to be tough, and there was hardly any crust 
              to our loaves. In search of the principle on which joints ought 
              to be roasted, to be roasted enough, and not too much, I myself 
              referred to the Cookery Book, and found it there established as 
              the allowance of a quarter of an hour to every pound, and say a 
              quarter over. But the principle always failed us by some curious 
              fatality, and we never could hit any medium between redness and 
              cinders. </p>
            <p>　　I had reason to believe that in accomplishing these failures 
              we incurred a far greater expense than if we had achieved a series 
              of triumphs. It appeared to me, on looking over the tradesmen's 
              books, as if we might have kept the basement storey paved with butter, 
              such was the extensive scale of our consumption of that article. 
              I don't know whether the Excise returns of the period may have exhibited 
              any increase in the demand for pepper; but if our performances did 
              not affect the market, I should say several families must have left 
              off using it. And the most wonderful fact of all was, that we never 
              had anything in the house. </p>
            <p>　　As to the washerwoman pawning the clothes, and coming in a state 
              of penitent intoxication to apologize, I suppose that might have 
              happened several times to anybody. Also the chimney on fire, the 
              parish engine, and perjury on the part of the Beadle. But I apprehend 
              that we were personally fortunate in engaging a servant with a taste 
              for cordials, who swelled our running account for porter at the 
              public-house by such inexplicable items as 'quartern rum shrub (Mrs. 
              C.)'; 'Half-quartern gin and cloves (Mrs. C.)'; 'Glass rum and peppermint 
              (Mrs. C.)' - the parentheses always referring to Dora, who was supposed, 
              it appeared on explanation, to have imbibed the whole of these refreshments. 
            </p>
            <p>　　One of our first feats in the housekeeping way was a little dinner 
              to Traddles. I met him in town, and asked him to walk out with me 
              that afternoon. He readily consenting, I wrote to Dora, saying I 
              would bring him home. It was pleasant weather, and on the road we 
              made my domestic happiness the theme of conversation. Traddles was 
              very full of it; and said, that, picturing himself with such a home, 
              and Sophy waiting and preparing for him, he could think of nothing 
              wanting to complete his bliss. </p>
            <p>　　I could not have wished for a prettier little wife at the opposite 
              end of the table, but I certainly could have wished, when we sat 
              down, for a little more room. I did not know how it was, but though 
              there were only two of us, we were at once always cramped for room, 
              and yet had always room enough to lose everything in. I suspect 
              it may have been because nothing had a place of its own, except 
              Jip's pagoda, which invariably blocked up the main thoroughfare. 
              On the present occasion, Traddles was so hemmed in by the pagoda 
              and the guitar-case, and Dora's flower-painting, and my writing-table, 
              that I had serious doubts of the possibility of his using his knife 
              and fork; but he protested, with his own good-humour, 'Oceans of 
              room, Copperfield! I assure you, Oceans!' </p>
            <p>　　There was another thing I could have wished, namely, that Jip 
              had never been encouraged to walk about the tablecloth during dinner. 
              I began to think there was something disorderly in his being there 
              at all, even if he had not been in the habit of putting his foot 
              in the salt or the melted butter. On this occasion he seemed to 
              think he was introduced expressly to keep Traddles at bay; and he 
              barked at my old friend, and made short runs at his plate, with 
              such undaunted pertinacity, that he may be said to have engrossed 
              the conversation. </p>
            <p>　　However, as I knew how tender-hearted my dear Dora was, and how 
              sensitive she would be to any slight upon her favourite, I hinted 
              no objection. For similar reasons I made no allusion to the skirmishing 
              plates upon the floor; or to the disreputable appearance of the 
              castors, which were all at sixes and sevens, and looked drunk; or 
              to the further blockade of Traddles by wandering vegetable dishes 
              and jugs. I could not help wondering in my own mind, as I contemplated 
              the boiled leg of mutton before me, previous to carving it, how 
              it came to pass that our joints of meat were of such extraordinary 
              shapes - and whether our butcher contracted for all the deformed 
              sheep that came into the world; but I kept my reflections to myself. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'My love,' said I to Dora, 'what have you got in that dish?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　I could not imagine why Dora had been making tempting little 
              faces at me, as if she wanted to kiss me. </p>
            <p>　　'Oysters, dear,' said Dora, timidly. </p>
            <p>　　'Was that YOUR thought?' said I, delighted. </p>
            <p>　　'Ye-yes, Doady,' said Dora. </p>
            <p>　　'There never was a happier one!' I exclaimed, laying down the 
              carving-knife and fork. 'There is nothing Traddles likes so much!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Ye-yes, Doady,' said Dora, 'and so I bought a beautiful little 
              barrel of them, and the man said they were very good. But I - I 
              am afraid there's something the matter with them. They don't seem 
              right.' Here Dora shook her head, and diamonds twinkled in her eyes. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'They are only opened in both shells,' said I. 'Take the top 
              one off, my love.' </p>
            <p>　　'But it won't come off!' said Dora, trying very hard, and looking 
              very much distressed. </p>
            <p>　　'Do you know, Copperfield,' said Traddles, cheerfully examining 
              the dish, 'I think it is in consequence - they are capital oysters, 
              but I think it is in consequence - of their never having been opened.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　They never had been opened; and we had no oyster-knives - and 
              couldn't have used them if we had; so we looked at the oysters and 
              ate the mutton. At least we ate as much of it as was done, and made 
              up with capers. If I had permitted him, I am satisfied that Traddles 
              would have made a perfect savage of himself, and eaten a plateful 
              of raw meat, to express enjoyment of the repast; but I would hear 
              of no such immolation on the altar of friendship, and we had a course 
              of bacon instead; there happening, by good fortune, to be cold bacon 
              in the larder. </p>
            <p>　　My poor little wife was in such affliction when she thought I 
              should be annoyed, and in such a state of joy when she found I was 
              not, that the discomfiture I had subdued, very soon vanished, and 
              we passed a happy evening; Dora sitting with her arm on my chair 
              while Traddles and I discussed a glass of wine, and taking every 
              opportunity of whispering in my ear that it was so good of me not 
              to be a cruel, cross old boy. By and by she made tea for us; which 
              it was so pretty to see her do, as if she was busying herself with 
              a set of doll's tea-things, that I was not particular about the 
              quality of the beverage. Then Traddles and I played a game or two 
              at cribbage; and Dora singing to the guitar the while, it seemed 
              to me as if our courtship and marriage were a tender dream of mine, 
              and the night when I first listened to her voice were not yet over. 
            </p>
            <p>　　When Traddles went away, and I came back into the parlour from 
              seeing him out, my wife planted her chair close to mine, and sat 
              down by my side. 'I am very sorry,' she said. 'Will you try to teach 
              me, Doady?' </p>
            <p>　　'I must teach myself first, Dora,' said I. 'I am as bad as you, 
              love.' </p>
            <p>　　'Ah! But you can learn,' she returned; 'and you are a clever, 
              clever man!' </p>
            <p>　　'Nonsense, mouse!' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'I wish,' resumed my wife, after a long silence, 'that I could 
              have gone down into the country for a whole year, and lived with 
              Agnes!' </p>
            <p>　　Her hands were clasped upon my shoulder, and her chin rested 
              on them, and her blue eyes looked quietly into mine. </p>
            <p>　　'Why so?' I asked. </p>
            <p>　　'I think she might have improved me, and I think I might have 
              learned from her,' said Dora. </p>
            <p>　　'All in good time, my love. Agnes has had her father to take 
              care of for these many years, you should remember. Even when she 
              was quite a child, she was the Agnes whom we know,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Will you call me a name I want you to call me?' inquired Dora, 
              without moving. </p>
            <p>　　'What is it?' I asked with a smile. </p>
            <p>　　'It's a stupid name,' she said, shaking her curls for a moment. 
              'Child-wife.' </p>
            <p>　　I laughingly asked my child-wife what her fancy was in desiring 
              to be so called. She answered without moving, otherwise than as 
              the arm I twined about her may have brought her blue eyes nearer 
              to me: </p>
            <p>　　'I don't mean, you silly fellow, that you should use the name 
              instead of Dora. I only mean that you should think of me that way. 
              When you are going to be angry with me, say to yourself, &quot;it's 
              only my child-wife!&quot; When I am very disappointing, say, &quot;I 
              knew, a long time ago, that she would make but a child-wife!&quot; 
              When you miss what I should like to be, and I think can never be, 
              say, &quot;still my foolish child-wife loves me!&quot; For indeed 
              I do.' </p>
            <p>　　I had not been serious with her; having no idea until now, that 
              she was serious herself. But her affectionate nature was so happy 
              in what I now said to her with my whole heart, that her face became 
              a laughing one before her glittering eyes were dry. She was soon 
              my child-wife indeed; sitting down on the floor outside the Chinese 
              House, ringing all the little bells one after another, to punish 
              Jip for his recent bad behaviour; while Jip lay blinking in the 
              doorway with his head out, even too lazy to be teased. </p>
            <p>　　This appeal of Dora's made a strong impression on me. I look 
              back on the time I write of; I invoke the innocent figure that I 
              dearly loved, to come out from the mists and shadows of the past, 
              and turn its gentle head towards me once again; and I can still 
              declare that this one little speech was constantly in my memory. 
              I may not have used it to the best account; I was young and inexperienced; 
              but I never turned a deaf ear to its artless pleading. </p>
            <p>　　Dora told me, shortly afterwards, that she was going to be a 
              wonderful housekeeper. Accordingly, she polished the tablets, pointed 
              the pencil, bought an immense account-book, carefully stitched up 
              with a needle and thread all the leaves of the Cookery Book which 
              Jip had torn, and made quite a desperate little attempt 'to be good', 
              as she called it. But the figures had the old obstinate propensity 
              - they WOULD NOT add up. When she had entered two or three laborious 
              items in the account-book, Jip would walk over the page, wagging 
              his tail, and smear them all out. Her own little right-hand middle 
              finger got steeped to the very bone in ink; and I think that was 
              the only decided result obtained. </p>
            <p>　　Sometimes, of an evening, when I was at home and at work - for 
              I wrote a good deal now, and was beginning in a small way to be 
              known as a writer - I would lay down my pen, and watch my child-wife 
              trying to be good. First of all, she would bring out the immense 
              account-book, and lay it down upon the table, with a deep sigh. 
              Then she would open it at the place where Jip had made it illegible 
              last night, and call Jip up, to look at his misdeeds. This would 
              occasion a diversion in Jip's favour, and some inking of his nose, 
              perhaps, as a penalty. Then she would tell Jip to lie down on the 
              table instantly, 'like a lion' - which was one of his tricks, though 
              I cannot say the likeness was striking - and, if he were in an obedient 
              humour, he would obey. Then she would take up a pen, and begin to 
              write, and find a hair in it. Then she would take up another pen, 
              and begin to write, and find that it spluttered. Then she would 
              take up another pen, and begin to write, and say in a low voice, 
              'Oh, it's a talking pen, and will disturb Doady!' And then she would 
              give it up as a bad job, and put the account-book away, after pretending 
              to crush the lion with it. </p>
            <p>　　Or, if she were in a very sedate and serious state of mind, she 
              would sit down with the tablets, and a little basket of bills and 
              other documents, which looked more like curl-papers than anything 
              else, and endeavour to get some result out of them. After severely 
              comparing one with another, and making entries on the tablets, and 
              blotting them out, and counting all the fingers of her left hand 
              over and over again, backwards and forwards, she would be so vexed 
              and discouraged, and would look so unhappy, that it gave me pain 
              to see her bright face clouded - and for me! - and I would go softly 
              to her, and say: </p>
            <p>　　'What's the matter, Dora?' </p>
            <p>　　Dora would look up hopelessly, and reply, 'They won't come right. 
              They make my head ache so. And they won't do anything I want!' </p>
            <p>　　Then I would say, 'Now let us try together. Let me show you, 
              Dora.' </p>
            <p>　　Then I would commence a practical demonstration, to which Dora 
              would pay profound attention, perhaps for five minutes; when she 
              would begin to be dreadfully tired, and would lighten the subject 
              by curling my hair, or trying the effect of my face with my shirt-collar 
              turned down. If I tacitly checked this playfulness, and persisted, 
              she would look so scared and disconsolate, as she became more and 
              more bewildered, that the remembrance of her natural gaiety when 
              I first strayed into her path, and of her being my child-wife, would 
              come reproachfully upon me; and I would lay the pencil down, and 
              call for the guitar. </p>
            <p>　　I had a great deal of work to do, and had many anxieties, but 
              the same considerations made me keep them to myself. I am far from 
              sure, now, that it was right to do this, but I did it for my child-wife's 
              sake. I search my breast, and I commit its secrets, if I know them, 
              without any reservation to this paper. The old unhappy loss or want 
              of something had, I am conscious, some place in my heart; but not 
              to the embitterment of my life. When I walked alone in the fine 
              weather, and thought of the summer days when all the air had been 
              filled with my boyish enchantment, I did miss something of the realization 
              of my dreams; but I thought it was a softened glory of the Past, 
              which nothing could have thrown upon the present time. I did feel, 
              sometimes, for a little while, that I could have wished my wife 
              had been my counsellor; had had more character and purpose, to sustain 
              me and improve me by; had been endowed with power to fill up the 
              void which somewhere seemed to be about me; but I felt as if this 
              were an unearthly consummation of my happiness, that never had been 
              meant to be, and never could have been. </p>
            <p>　　I was a boyish husband as to years. I had known the softening 
              influence of no other sorrows or experiences than those recorded 
              in these leaves. If I did any wrong, as I may have done much, I 
              did it in mistaken love, and in my want of wisdom. I write the exact 
              truth. It would avail me nothing to extenuate it now. </p>
            <p>　　Thus it was that I took upon myself the toils and cares of our 
              life, and had no partner in them. We lived much as before, in reference 
              to our scrambling household arrangements; but I had got used to 
              those, and Dora I was pleased to see was seldom vexed now. She was 
              bright and cheerful in the old childish way, loved me dearly, and 
              was happy with her old trifles. </p>
            <p>　　When the debates were heavy - I mean as to length, not quality, 
              for in the last respect they were not often otherwise - and I went 
              home late, Dora would never rest when she heard my footsteps, but 
              would always come downstairs to meet me. When my evenings were unoccupied 
              by the pursuit for which I had qualified myself with so much pains, 
              and I was engaged in writing at home, she would sit quietly near 
              me, however late the hour, and be so mute, that I would often think 
              she had dropped asleep. But generally, when I raised my head, I 
              saw her blue eyes looking at me with the quiet attention of which 
              I have already spoken. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, what a weary boy!' said Dora one night, when I met her eyes 
              as I was shutting up my desk. </p>
            <p>　　'What a weary girl!' said I. 'That's more to the purpose. You 
              must go to bed another time, my love. It's far too late for you.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'No, don't send me to bed!' pleaded Dora, coming to my side. 
              'Pray, don't do that!' </p>
            <p>　　'Dora!' To my amazement she was sobbing on my neck. 'Not well, 
              my dear! not happy!' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes! quite well, and very happy!' said Dora. 'But say you'll 
              let me stop, and see you write.' </p>
            <p>　　'Why, what a sight for such bright eyes at midnight!' I replied. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Are they bright, though?' returned Dora, laughing. 'I'm so glad 
              they're bright.' 'Little Vanity!' said I. </p>
            <p>　　But it was not vanity; it was only harmless delight in my admiration. 
              I knew that very well, before she told me so. </p>
            <p>　　'If you think them pretty, say I may always stop, and see you 
              write!' said Dora. 'Do you think them pretty?' </p>
            <p>　　'Very pretty.' </p>
            <p>　　'Then let me always stop and see you write.' </p>
            <p>　　'I am afraid that won't improve their brightness, Dora.' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, it will! Because, you clever boy, you'll not forget me 
              then, while you are full of silent fancies. Will you mind it, if 
              I say something very, very silly? - more than usual?' inquired Dora, 
              peeping over my shoulder into my face. </p>
            <p>　　'What wonderful thing is that?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Please let me hold the pens,' said Dora. 'I want to have something 
              to do with all those many hours when you are so industrious. May 
              I hold the pens?' </p>
            <p>　　The remembrance of her pretty joy when I said yes, brings tears 
              into my eyes. The next time I sat down to write, and regularly afterwards, 
              she sat in her old place, with a spare bundle of pens at her side. 
              Her triumph in this connexion with my work, and her delight when 
              I wanted a new pen - which I very often feigned to do - suggested 
              to me a new way of pleasing my child-wife. I occasionally made a 
              pretence of wanting a page or two of manuscript copied. Then Dora 
              was in her glory. The preparations she made for this great work, 
              the aprons she put on, the bibs she borrowed from the kitchen to 
              keep off the ink, the time she took, the innumerable stoppages she 
              made to have a laugh with Jip as if he understood it all, her conviction 
              that her work was incomplete unless she signed her name at the end, 
              and the way in which she would bring it to me, like a school-copy, 
              and then, when I praised it, clasp me round the neck, are touching 
              recollections to me, simple as they might appear to other men. </p>
            <p>　　She took possession of the keys soon after this, and went jingling 
              about the house with the whole bunch in a little basket, tied to 
              her slender waist. I seldom found that the places to which they 
              belonged were locked, or that they were of any use except as a plaything 
              for Jip - but Dora was pleased, and that pleased me. She was quite 
              satisfied that a good deal was effected by this make-belief of housekeeping; 
              and was as merry as if we had been keeping a baby-house, for a joke. 
            </p>
            <p>　　So we went on. Dora was hardly less affectionate to my aunt than 
              to me, and often told her of the time when she was afraid she was 
              'a cross old thing'. I never saw my aunt unbend more systematically 
              to anyone. She courted Jip, though Jip never responded; listened, 
              day after day, to the guitar, though I am afraid she had no taste 
              for music; never attacked the Incapables, though the temptation 
              must have been severe; went wonderful distances on foot to purchase, 
              as surprises, any trifles that she found out Dora wanted; and never 
              came in by the garden, and missed her from the room, but she would 
              call out, at the foot of the stairs, in a voice that sounded cheerfully 
              all over the house: </p>
            <p>　　'Where's Little Blossom?' </p>

            <div align="center"><b>Mr. MICAWBER'S TRANSACTIONS </b> </div>
            <p>　　 This is not the time at which I am to enter on the state of 
              my mind beneath its load of sorrow. I came to think that the Future 
              was walled up before me, that the energy and action of my life were 
              at an end, that I never could find any refuge but in the grave. 
              I came to think so, I say, but not in the first shock of my grief. 
              It slowly grew to that. If the events I go on to relate, had not 
              thickened around me, in the beginning to confuse, and in the end 
              to augment, my affliction, it is possible (though I think not probable), 
              that I might have fallen at once into this condition. As it was, 
              an interval occurred before I fully knew my own distress; an interval, 
              in which I even supposed that its sharpest pangs were past; and 
              when my mind could soothe itself by resting on all that was most 
              innocent and beautiful, in the tender story that was closed for 
              ever. </p>
            <p>　　When it was first proposed that I should go abroad, or how it 
              came to be agreed among us that I was to seek the restoration of 
              my peace in change and travel, I do not, even now, distinctly know. 
              The spirit of Agnes so pervaded all we thought, and said, and did, 
              in that time of sorrow, that I assume I may refer the project to 
              her influence. But her influence was so quiet that I know no more. 
            </p>
            <p>　　And now, indeed, I began to think that in my old association 
              of her with the stained-glass window in the church, a prophetic 
              foreshadowing of what she would be to me, in the calamity that was 
              to happen in the fullness of time, had found a way into my mind. 
              In all that sorrow, from the moment, never to be forgotten, when 
              she stood before me with her upraised hand, she was like a sacred 
              presence in my lonely house. When the Angel of Death alighted there, 
              my child-wife fell asleep - they told me so when I could bear to 
              hear it - on her bosom, with a smile. From my swoon, I first awoke 
              to a consciousness of her compassionate tears, her words of hope 
              and peace, her gentle face bending down as from a purer region nearer 
              Heaven, over my undisciplined heart, and softening its pain. </p>
            <p>　　Let me go on. </p>
            <p>　　I was to go abroad. That seemed to have been determined among 
              us from the first. The ground now covering all that could perish 
              of my departed wife, I waited only for what Mr. Micawber called 
              the 'final pulverization of Heep'; and for the departure of the 
              emigrants. </p>
            <p>　　At the request of Traddles, most affectionate and devoted of 
              friends in my trouble, we returned to Canterbury: I mean my aunt, 
              Agnes, and I. We proceeded by appointment straight to Mr. Micawber's 
              house; where, and at Mr. Wickfield's, my friend had been labouring 
              ever since our explosive meeting. When poor Mrs. Micawber saw me 
              come in, in my black clothes, she was sensibly affected. There was 
              a great deal of good in Mrs. Micawber's heart, which had not been 
              dunned out of it in all those many years. </p>
            <p>　　'Well, Mr. and Mrs. Micawber,' was my aunt's first salutation 
              after we were seated. 'Pray, have you thought about that emigration 
              proposal of mine?' </p>
            <p>　　'My dear madam,' returned Mr. Micawber, 'perhaps I cannot better 
              express the conclusion at which Mrs. Micawber, your humble servant, 
              and I may add our children, have jointly and severally arrived, 
              than by borrowing the language of an illustrious poet, to reply 
              that our Boat is on the shore, and our Bark is on the sea.' </p>
            <p>　　'That's right,' said my aunt. 'I augur all sort of good from 
              your sensible decision.' </p>
            <p>　　'Madam, you do us a great deal of honour,' he rejoined. He then 
              referred to a memorandum. 'With respect to the pecuniary assistance 
              enabling us to launch our frail canoe on the ocean of enterprise, 
              I have reconsidered that important business-point; and would beg 
              to propose my notes of hand - drawn, it is needless to stipulate, 
              on stamps of the amounts respectively required by the various Acts 
              of Parliament applying to such securities - at eighteen, twenty-four, 
              and thirty months. The proposition I originally submitted, was twelve, 
              eighteen, and twenty-four; but I am apprehensive that such an arrangement 
              might not allow sufficient time for the requisite amount of - Something 
              - to turn up. We might not,' said Mr. Micawber, looking round the 
              room as if it represented several hundred acres of highly cultivated 
              land, 'on the first responsibility becoming due, have been successful 
              in our harvest, or we might not have got our harvest in. Labour, 
              I believe, is sometimes difficult to obtain in that portion of our 
              colonial possessions where it will be our lot to combat with the 
              teeming soil.' </p>
            <p>　　'Arrange it in any way you please, sir,' said my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　'Madam,' he replied, 'Mrs. Micawber and myself are deeply sensible 
              of the very considerate kindness of our friends and patrons. What 
              I wish is, to be perfectly business-like, and perfectly punctual. 
              Turning over, as we are about to turn over, an entirely new leaf; 
              and falling back, as we are now in the act of falling back, for 
              a Spring of no common magnitude; it is important to my sense of 
              self-respect, besides being an example to my son, that these arrangements 
              should be concluded as between man and man.' </p>
            <p>　　I don't know that Mr. Micawber attached any meaning to this last 
              phrase; I don't know that anybody ever does, or did; but he appeared 
              to relish it uncommonly, and repeated, with an impressive cough, 
              'as between man and man'. </p>
            <p>　　'I propose,' said Mr. Micawber, 'Bills - a convenience to the 
              mercantile world, for which, I believe, we are originally indebted 
              to the Jews, who appear to me to have had a devilish deal too much 
              to do with them ever since - because they are negotiable. But if 
              a Bond, or any other description of security, would be preferred, 
              I should be happy to execute any such instrument. As between man 
              and man.' </p>
            <p>　　MY aunt observed, that in a case where both parties were willing 
              to agree to anything, she took it for granted there would be no 
              difficulty in settling this point. Mr. Micawber was of her opinion. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'In reference to our domestic preparations, madam,' said Mr. 
              Micawber, with some pride, 'for meeting the destiny to which we 
              are now understood to be self-devoted, I beg to report them. My 
              eldest daughter attends at five every morning in a neighbouring 
              establishment, to acquire the process - if process it may be called 
              - of milking cows. My younger children are instructed to observe, 
              as closely as circumstances will permit, the habits of the pigs 
              and poultry maintained in the poorer parts of this city: a pursuit 
              from which they have, on two occasions, been brought home, within 
              an inch of being run over. I have myself directed some attention, 
              during the past week, to the art of baking; and my son Wilkins has 
              issued forth with a walking-stick and driven cattle, when permitted, 
              by the rugged hirelings who had them in charge, to render any voluntary 
              service in that direction - which I regret to say, for the credit 
              of our nature, was not often; he being generally warned, with imprecations, 
              to desist.' </p>
            <p>　　'All very right indeed,' said my aunt, encouragingly. 'Mrs. Micawber 
              has been busy, too, I have no doubt.' </p>
            <p>　　'My dear madam,' returned Mrs. Micawber, with her business-like 
              air. 'I am free to confess that I have not been actively engaged 
              in pursuits immediately connected with cultivation or with stock, 
              though well aware that both will claim my attention on a foreign 
              shore. Such opportunities as I have been enabled to alienate from 
              my domestic duties, I have devoted to corresponding at some length 
              with my family. For I own it seems to me, my dear Mr. Copperfield,' 
              said Mrs. Micawber, who always fell back on me, I suppose from old 
              habit, to whomsoever else she might address her discourse at starting, 
              'that the time is come when the past should be buried in oblivion; 
              when my family should take Mr. Micawber by the hand, and Mr. Micawber 
              should take my family by the hand; when the lion should lie down 
              with the lamb, and my family be on terms with Mr. Micawber.' </p>
            <p>　　I said I thought so too. </p>
            <p>　　'This, at least, is the light, my dear Mr. Copperfield,' pursued 
              Mrs. Micawber, 'in which I view the subject. When I lived at home 
              with my papa and mama, my papa was accustomed to ask, when any point 
              was under discussion in our limited circle, &quot;In what light 
              does my Emma view the subject?&quot; That my papa was too partial, 
              I know; still, on such a point as the frigid coldness which has 
              ever subsisted between Mr. Micawber and my family, I necessarily 
              have formed an opinion, delusive though it may be.' </p>
            <p>　　'No doubt. Of course you have, ma'am,' said my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　'Precisely so,' assented Mrs. Micawber. 'Now, I may be wrong 
              in my conclusions; it is very likely that I am, but my individual 
              impression is, that the gulf between my family and Mr. Micawber 
              may be traced to an apprehension, on the part of my family, that 
              Mr. Micawber would require pecuniary accommodation. I cannot help 
              thinking,' said Mrs. Micawber, with an air of deep sagacity, 'that 
              there are members of my family who have been apprehensive that Mr. 
              Micawber would solicit them for their names. - I do not mean to 
              be conferred in Baptism upon our children, but to be inscribed on 
              Bills of Exchange, and negotiated in the Money Market.' </p>
            <p>　　The look of penetration with which Mrs. Micawber announced this 
              discovery, as if no one had ever thought of it before, seemed rather 
              to astonish my aunt; who abruptly replied, 'Well, ma'am, upon the 
              whole, I shouldn't wonder if you were right!' </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Micawber being now on the eve of casting off the pecuniary 
              shackles that have so long enthralled him,' said Mrs. Micawber, 
              'and of commencing a new career in a country where there is sufficient 
              range for his abilities, - which, in my opinion, is exceedingly 
              important; Mr. Micawber's abilities peculiarly requiring space, 
              - it seems to me that my family should signalize the occasion by 
              coming forward. What I could wish to see, would be a meeting between 
              Mr. Micawber and my family at a festive entertainment, to be given 
              at my family's expense; where Mr. Micawber's health and prosperity 
              being proposed, by some leading member of my family, Mr. Micawber 
              might have an opportunity of developing his views.' </p>
            <p>　　'My dear,' said Mr. Micawber, with some heat, 'it may be better 
              for me to state distinctly, at once, that if I were to develop my 
              views to that assembled group, they would possibly be found of an 
              offensive nature: my impression being that your family are, in the 
              aggregate, impertinent Snobs; and, in detail, unmitigated Ruffians.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Micawber,' said Mrs. Micawber, shaking her head, 'no! You have 
              never understood them, and they have never understood you.' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber coughed. </p>
            <p>　　'They have never understood you, Micawber,' said his wife. 'They 
              may be incapable of it. If so, that is their misfortune. I can pity 
              their misfortune.' </p>
            <p>　　'I am extremely sorry, my dear Emma,' said Mr. Micawber, relenting, 
              'to have been betrayed into any expressions that might, even remotely, 
              have the appearance of being strong expressions. All I would say 
              is, that I can go abroad without your family coming forward to favour 
              me, - in short, with a parting Shove of their cold shoulders; and 
              that, upon the whole, I would rather leave England with such impetus 
              as I possess, than derive any acceleration of it from that quarter. 
              At the same time, my dear, if they should condescend to reply to 
              your communications - which our joint experience renders most improbable 
              - far be it from me to be a barrier to your wishes.' </p>
            <p>　　The matter being thus amicably settled, Mr. Micawber gave Mrs. 
              Micawber his arm, and glancing at the heap of books and papers lying 
              before Traddles on the table, said they would leave us to ourselves; 
              which they ceremoniously did. </p>
            <p>　　'My dear Copperfield,' said Traddles, leaning back in his chair 
              when they were gone, and looking at me with an affection that made 
              his eyes red, and his hair all kinds of shapes, 'I don't make any 
              excuse for troubling you with business, because I know you are deeply 
              interested in it, and it may divert your thoughts. My dear boy, 
              I hope you are not worn out?' </p>
            <p>　　'I am quite myself,' said I, after a pause. 'We have more cause 
              to think of my aunt than of anyone. You know how much she has done.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Surely, surely,' answered Traddles. 'Who can forget it!' </p>
            <p>　　'But even that is not all,' said I. 'During the last fortnight, 
              some new trouble has vexed her; and she has been in and out of London 
              every day. Several times she has gone out early, and been absent 
              until evening. Last night, Traddles, with this journey before her, 
              it was almost midnight before she came home. You know what her consideration 
              for others is. She will not tell me what has happened to distress 
              her.' </p>
            <p>　　My aunt, very pale, and with deep lines in her face, sat immovable 
              until I had finished; when some stray tears found their way to her 
              cheeks, and she put her hand on mine. </p>
            <p>　　'It's nothing, Trot; it's nothing. There will be no more of it. 
              You shall know by and by. Now Agnes, my dear, let us attend to these 
              affairs.' </p>
            <p>　　'I must do Mr. Micawber the justice to say,' Traddles began, 
              'that although he would appear not to have worked to any good account 
              for himself, he is a most untiring man when he works for other people. 
              I never saw such a fellow. If he always goes on in the same way, 
              he must be, virtually, about two hundred years old, at present. 
              The heat into which he has been continually putting himself; and 
              the distracted and impetuous manner in which he has been diving, 
              day and night, among papers and books; to say nothing of the immense 
              number of letters he has written me between this house and Mr. Wickfield's, 
              and often across the table when he has been sitting opposite, and 
              might much more easily have spoken; is quite extraordinary.' </p>
            <p>　　'Letters!' cried my aunt. 'I believe he dreams in letters!' </p>
            <p>　　'There's Mr. Dick, too,' said Traddles, 'has been doing wonders! 
              As soon as he was released from overlooking Uriah Heep, whom he 
              kept in such charge as I never saw exceeded, he began to devote 
              himself to Mr. Wickfield. And really his anxiety to be of use in 
              the investigations we have been making, and his real usefulness 
              in extracting, and copying, and fetching, and carrying, have been 
              quite stimulating to us.' </p>
            <p>　　'Dick is a very remarkable man,' exclaimed my aunt; 'and I always 
              said he was. Trot, you know it.' </p>
            <p>　　'I am happy to say, Miss Wickfield,' pursued Traddles, at once 
              with great delicacy and with great earnestness, 'that in your absence 
              Mr. Wickfield has considerably improved. Relieved of the incubus 
              that had fastened upon him for so long a time, and of the dreadful 
              apprehensions under which he had lived, he is hardly the same person. 
              At times, even his impaired power of concentrating his memory and 
              attention on particular points of business, has recovered itself 
              very much; and he has been able to assist us in making some things 
              clear, that we should have found very difficult indeed, if not hopeless, 
              without him. But what I have to do is to come to results; which 
              are short enough; not to gossip on all the hopeful circumstances 
              I have observed, or I shall never have done.' His natural manner 
              and agreeable simplicity made it transparent that he said this to 
              put us in good heart, and to enable Agnes to hear her father mentioned 
              with greater confidence; but it was not the less pleasant for that. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Now, let me see,' said Traddles, looking among the papers on 
              the table. 'Having counted our funds, and reduced to order a great 
              mass of unintentional confusion in the first place, and of wilful 
              confusion and falsification in the second, we take it to be clear 
              that Mr. Wickfield might now wind up his business, and his agency-trust, 
              and exhibit no deficiency or defalcation whatever.' </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, thank Heaven!' cried Agnes, fervently. </p>
            <p>　　'But,' said Traddles, 'the surplus that would be left as his 
              means of support - and I suppose the house to be sold, even in saying 
              this - would be so small, not exceeding in all probability some 
              hundreds of pounds, that perhaps, Miss Wickfield, it would be best 
              to consider whether he might not retain his agency of the estate 
              to which he has so long been receiver. His friends might advise 
              him, you know; now he is free. You yourself, Miss Wickfield - Copperfield 
              - I -' </p>
            <p>　　'I have considered it, Trotwood,' said Agnes, looking to me, 
              'and I feel that it ought not to be, and must not be; even on the 
              recommendation of a friend to whom I am so grateful, and owe so 
              much.' </p>
            <p>　　'I will not say that I recommend it,' observed Traddles. 'I think 
              it right to suggest it. No more.' </p>
            <p>　　'I am happy to hear you say so,' answered Agnes, steadily, 'for 
              it gives me hope, almost assurance, that we think alike. Dear Mr. 
              Traddles and dear Trotwood, papa once free with honour, what could 
              I wish for! I have always aspired, if I could have released him 
              from the toils in which he was held, to render back some little 
              portion of the love and care I owe him, and to devote my life to 
              him. It has been, for years, the utmost height of my hopes. To take 
              our future on myself, will be the next great happiness - the next 
              to his release from all trust and responsibility - that I can know.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Have you thought how, Agnes?' </p>
            <p>　　'Often! I am not afraid, dear Trotwood. I am certain of success. 
              So many people know me here, and think kindly of me, that I am certain. 
              Don't mistrust me. Our wants are not many. If I rent the dear old 
              house, and keep a school, I shall be useful and happy.' </p>
            <p>　　The calm fervour of her cheerful voice brought back so vividly, 
              first the dear old house itself, and then my solitary home, that 
              my heart was too full for speech. Traddles pretended for a little 
              while to be busily looking among the papers. </p>
            <p>　　'Next, Miss Trotwood,' said Traddles, 'that property of yours.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Well, sir,' sighed my aunt. 'All I have got to say about it 
              is, that if it's gone, I can bear it; and if it's not gone, I shall 
              be glad to get it back.' </p>
            <p>　　'It was originally, I think, eight thousand pounds, Consols?' 
              said Traddles. </p>
            <p>　　'Right!' replied my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　'I can't account for more than five,' said Traddles, with an 
              air of perplexity. </p>
            <p>　　'- thousand, do you mean?' inquired my aunt, with uncommon composure, 
              'or pounds?' </p>
            <p>　　'Five thousand pounds,' said Traddles. </p>
            <p>　　'It was all there was,' returned my aunt. 'I sold three, myself. 
              One, I paid for your articles, Trot, my dear; and the other two 
              I have by me. When I lost the rest, I thought it wise to say nothing 
              about that sum, but to keep it secretly for a rainy day. I wanted 
              to see how you would come out of the trial, Trot; and you came out 
              nobly - persevering, self-reliant, self-denying! So did Dick. Don't 
              speak to me, for I find my nerves a little shaken!' </p>
            <p>　　Nobody would have thought so, to see her sitting upright, with 
              her arms folded; but she had wonderful self-command. </p>
            <p>　　'Then I am delighted to say,' cried Traddles, beaming with joy, 
              'that we have recovered the whole money!' </p>
            <p>　　'Don't congratulate me, anybody!' exclaimed my aunt. 'How so, 
              sir?' </p>
            <p>　　'You believed it had been misappropriated by Mr. Wickfield?' 
              said Traddles. </p>
            <p>　　'Of course I did,' said my aunt, 'and was therefore easily silenced. 
              Agnes, not a word!' </p>
            <p>　　'And indeed,' said Traddles, 'it was sold, by virtue of the power 
              of management he held from you; but I needn't say by whom sold, 
              or on whose actual signature. It was afterwards pretended to Mr. 
              Wickfield, by that rascal, - and proved, too, by figures, - that 
              he had possessed himself of the money (on general instructions, 
              he said) to keep other deficiencies and difficulties from the light. 
              Mr. Wickfield, being so weak and helpless in his hands as to pay 
              you, afterwards, several sums of interest on a pretended principal 
              which he knew did not exist, made himself, unhappily, a party to 
              the fraud.' </p>
            <p>　　'And at last took the blame upon himself,' added my aunt; 'and 
              wrote me a mad letter, charging himself with robbery, and wrong 
              unheard of. Upon which I paid him a visit early one morning, called 
              for a candle, burnt the letter, and told him if he ever could right 
              me and himself, to do it; and if he couldn't, to keep his own counsel 
              for his daughter's sake. - If anybody speaks to me, I'll leave the 
              house!' </p>
            <p>　　We all remained quiet; Agnes covering her face. </p>
            <p>　　'Well, my dear friend,' said my aunt, after a pause, 'and you 
              have really extorted the money back from him?' </p>
            <p>　　'Why, the fact is,' returned Traddles, 'Mr. Micawber had so completely 
              hemmed him in, and was always ready with so many new points if an 
              old one failed, that he could not escape from us. A most remarkable 
              circumstance is, that I really don't think he grasped this sum even 
              so much for the gratification of his avarice, which was inordinate, 
              as in the hatred he felt for Copperfield. He said so to me, plainly. 
              He said he would even have spent as much, to baulk or injure Copperfield.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Ha!' said my aunt, knitting her brows thoughtfully, and glancing 
              at Agnes. 'And what's become of him?' </p>
            <p>　　'I don't know. He left here,' said Traddles, 'with his mother, 
              who had been clamouring, and beseeching, and disclosing, the whole 
              time. They went away by one of the London night coaches, and I know 
              no more about him; except that his malevolence to me at parting 
              was audacious. He seemed to consider himself hardly less indebted 
              to me, than to Mr. Micawber; which I consider (as I told him) quite 
              a compliment.' </p>
            <p>　　'Do you suppose he has any money, Traddles?' I asked. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh dear, yes, I should think so,' he replied, shaking his head, 
              seriously. 'I should say he must have pocketed a good deal, in one 
              way or other. But, I think you would find, Copperfield, if you had 
              an opportunity of observing his course, that money would never keep 
              that man out of mischief. He is such an incarnate hypocrite, that 
              whatever object he pursues, he must pursue crookedly. It's his only 
              compensation for the outward restraints he puts upon himself. Always 
              creeping along the ground to some small end or other, he will always 
              magnify every object in the way; and consequently will hate and 
              suspect everybody that comes, in the most innocent manner, between 
              him and it. So the crooked courses will become crookeder, at any 
              moment, for the least reason, or for none. It's only necessary to 
              consider his history here,' said Traddles, 'to know that.' </p>
            <p>　　'He's a monster of meanness!' said my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　'Really I don't know about that,' observed Traddles thoughtfully. 
              'Many people can be very mean, when they give their minds to it.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'And now, touching Mr. Micawber,' said my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　'Well, really,' said Traddles, cheerfully, 'I must, once more, 
              give Mr. Micawber high praise. But for his having been so patient 
              and persevering for so long a time, we never could have hoped to 
              do anything worth speaking of. And I think we ought to consider 
              that Mr. Micawber did right, for right's sake, when we reflect what 
              terms he might have made with Uriah Heep himself, for his silence.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I think so too,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Now, what would you give him?' inquired my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh! Before you come to that,' said Traddles, a little disconcerted, 
              'I am afraid I thought it discreet to omit (not being able to carry 
              everything before me) two points, in making this lawless adjustment 
              - for it's perfectly lawless from beginning to end - of a difficult 
              affair. Those I.O.U.'s, and so forth, which Mr. Micawber gave him 
              for the advances he had -' </p>
            <p>　　'Well! They must be paid,' said my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, but I don't know when they may be proceeded on, or where 
              they are,' rejoined Traddles, opening his eyes; 'and I anticipate, 
              that, between this time and his departure, Mr. Micawber will be 
              constantly arrested, or taken in execution.' </p>
            <p>　　'Then he must be constantly set free again, and taken out of 
              execution,' said my aunt. 'What's the amount altogether?' </p>
            <p>　　'Why, Mr. Micawber has entered the transactions - he calls them 
              transactions - with great form, in a book,' rejoined Traddles, smiling; 
              'and he makes the amount a hundred and three pounds, five.' </p>
            <p>　　'Now, what shall we give him, that sum included?' said my aunt. 
              'Agnes, my dear, you and I can talk about division of it afterwards. 
              What should it be? Five hundred pounds?' </p>
            <p>　　Upon this, Traddles and I both struck in at once. We both recommended 
              a small sum in money, and the payment, without stipulation to Mr. 
              Micawber, of the Uriah claims as they came in. We proposed that 
              the family should have their passage and their outfit, and a hundred 
              pounds; and that Mr. Micawber's arrangement for the repayment of 
              the advances should be gravely entered into, as it might be wholesome 
              for him to suppose himself under that responsibility. To this, I 
              added the suggestion, that I should give some explanation of his 
              character and history to Mr. Peggotty, who I knew could be relied 
              on; and that to Mr. Peggotty should be quietly entrusted the discretion 
              of advancing another hundred. I further proposed to interest Mr. 
              Micawber in Mr. Peggotty, by confiding so much of Mr. Peggotty's 
              story to him as I might feel justified in relating, or might think 
              expedient; and to endeavour to bring each of them to bear upon the 
              other, for the common advantage. We all entered warmly into these 
              views; and I may mention at once, that the principals themselves 
              did so, shortly afterwards, with perfect good will and harmony. 
            </p>
            <p>　　Seeing that Traddles now glanced anxiously at my aunt again, 
              I reminded him of the second and last point to which he had adverted. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'You and your aunt will excuse me, Copperfield, if I touch upon 
              a painful theme, as I greatly fear I shall,' said Traddles, hesitating; 
              'but I think it necessary to bring it to your recollection. On the 
              day of Mr. Micawber's memorable denunciation a threatening allusion 
              was made by Uriah Heep to your aunt's - husband.' </p>
            <p>　　My aunt, retaining her stiff position, and apparent composure, 
              assented with a nod. </p>
            <p>　　'Perhaps,' observed Traddles, 'it was mere purposeless impertinence?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'No,' returned my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　'There was - pardon me - really such a person, and at all in 
              his power?' hinted Traddles. </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, my good friend,' said my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　Traddles, with a perceptible lengthening of his face, explained 
              that he had not been able to approach this subject; that it had 
              shared the fate of Mr. Micawber's liabilities, in not being comprehended 
              in the terms he had made; that we were no longer of any authority 
              with Uriah Heep; and that if he could do us, or any of us, any injury 
              or annoyance, no doubt he would. </p>
            <p>　　My aunt remained quiet; until again some stray tears found their 
              way to her cheeks. 'You are quite right,' she said. 'It was very 
              thoughtful to mention it.' </p>
            <p>　　'Can I - or Copperfield - do anything?' asked Traddles, gently. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Nothing,' said my aunt. 'I thank you many times. Trot, my dear, 
              a vain threat! Let us have Mr. and Mrs. Micawber back. And don't 
              any of you speak to me!' With that she smoothed her dress, and sat, 
              with her upright carriage, looking at the door. </p>
            <p>　　'Well, Mr. and Mrs. Micawber!' said my aunt, when they entered. 
              'We have been discussing your emigration, with many apologies to 
              you for keeping you out of the room so long; and I'll tell you what 
              arrangements we propose.' </p>
            <p>　　These she explained to the unbounded satisfaction of the family, 
              - children and all being then present, - and so much to the awakening 
              of Mr. Micawber's punctual habits in the opening stage of all bill 
              transactions, that he could not be dissuaded from immediately rushing 
              out, in the highest spirits, to buy the stamps for his notes of 
              hand. But, his joy received a sudden check; for within five minutes, 
              he returned in the custody of a sheriff 's officer, informing us, 
              in a flood of tears, that all was lost. We, being quite prepared 
              for this event, which was of course a proceeding of Uriah Heep's, 
              soon paid the money; and in five minutes more Mr. Micawber was seated 
              at the table, filling up the stamps with an expression of perfect 
              joy, which only that congenial employment, or the making of punch, 
              could impart in full completeness to his shining face. To see him 
              at work on the stamps, with the relish of an artist, touching them 
              like pictures, looking at them sideways, taking weighty notes of 
              dates and amounts in his pocket-book, and contemplating them when 
              finished, with a high sense of their precious value, was a sight 
              indeed. </p>
            <p>　　'Now, the best thing you can do, sir, if you'll allow me to advise 
              you,' said my aunt, after silently observing him, 'is to abjure 
              that occupation for evermore.' </p>
            <p>　　'Madam,' replied Mr. Micawber, 'it is my intention to register 
              such a vow on the virgin page of the future. Mrs. Micawber will 
              attest it. I trust,' said Mr. Micawber, solemnly, 'that my son Wilkins 
              will ever bear in mind, that he had infinitely better put his fist 
              in the fire, than use it to handle the serpents that have poisoned 
              the life-blood of his unhappy parent!' Deeply affected, and changed 
              in a moment to the image of despair, Mr. Micawber regarded the serpents 
              with a look of gloomy abhorrence (in which his late admiration of 
              them was not quite subdued), folded them up and put them in his 
              pocket. </p>
            <p>　　This closed the proceedings of the evening. We were weary with 
              sorrow and fatigue, and my aunt and I were to return to London on 
              the morrow. It was arranged that the Micawbers should follow us, 
              after effecting a sale of their goods to a broker; that Mr. Wickfield's 
              affairs should be brought to a settlement, with all convenient speed, 
              under the direction of Traddles; and that Agnes should also come 
              to London, pending those arrangements. We passed the night at the 
              old house, which, freed from the presence of the Heeps, seemed purged 
              of a disease; and I lay in my old room, like a shipwrecked wanderer 
              come home. </p>
            <p>　　We went back next day to my aunt's house - not to mine- and when 
              she and I sat alone, as of old, before going to bed, she said: </p>
            <p>　　'Trot, do you really wish to know what I have had upon my mind 
              lately?' </p>
            <p>　　'Indeed I do, aunt. If there ever was a time when I felt unwilling 
              that you should have a sorrow or anxiety which I could not share, 
              it is now.' </p>
            <p>　　'You have had sorrow enough, child,' said my aunt, affectionately, 
              'without the addition of my little miseries. I could have no other 
              motive, Trot, in keeping anything from you.' </p>
            <p>　　'I know that well,' said I. 'But tell me now.' </p>
            <p>　　'Would you ride with me a little way tomorrow morning?' asked 
              my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　'Of course.' </p>
            <p>　　'At nine,' said she. 'I'll tell you then, my dear.' </p>
            <p>　　At nine, accordingly, we went out in a little chariot, and drove 
              to London. We drove a long way through the streets, until we came 
              to one of the large hospitals. Standing hard by the building was 
              a plain hearse. The driver recognized my aunt, and, in obedience 
              to a motion of her hand at the window, drove slowly off; we following. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'You understand it now, Trot,' said my aunt. 'He is gone!' </p>
            <p>　　'Did he die in the hospital?' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes.' </p>
            <p>　　She sat immovable beside me; but, again I saw the stray tears 
              on her face. </p>
            <p>　　'He was there once before,' said my aunt presently. 'He was ailing 
              a long time - a shattered, broken man, these many years. When he 
              knew his state in this last illness, he asked them to send for me. 
              He was sorry then. Very sorry.' </p>
            <p>　　'You went, I know, aunt.' </p>
            <p>　　'I went. I was with him a good deal afterwards.' </p>
            <p>　　'He died the night before we went to Canterbury?' said I. My 
              aunt nodded. 'No one can harm him now,' she said. 'It was a vain 
              threat.' </p>
            <p>　　We drove away, out of town, to the churchyard at Hornsey. 'Better 
              here than in the streets,' said my aunt. 'He was born here.' </p>
            <p>　　We alighted; and followed the plain coffin to a corner I remember 
              well, where the service was read consigning it to the dust. </p>
            <p>　　'Six-and-thirty years ago, this day, my dear,' said my aunt, 
              as we walked back to the chariot, 'I was married. God forgive us 
              all!' We took our seats in silence; and so she sat beside me for 
              a long time, holding my hand. At length she suddenly burst into 
              tears, and said: </p>
            <p>　　'He was a fine-looking man when I married him, Trot - and he 
              was sadly changed!' </p>
            <p>　　It did not last long. After the relief of tears, she soon became 
              composed, and even cheerful. Her nerves were a little shaken, she 
              said, or she would not have given way to it. God forgive us all! 
            </p>
            <p>　　So we rode back to her little cottage at Highgate, where we found 
              the following short note, which had arrived by that morning's post 
              from Mr. Micawber: </p>
            <p>　　 'Canterbury, </p>
            <p>　　 'Friday. </p>
            <p>　　'My dear Madam, and Copperfield, </p>
            <p>　　'The fair land of promise lately looming on the horizon is again 
              enveloped in impenetrable mists, and for ever withdrawn from the 
              eyes of a drifting wretch whose Doom is sealed! </p>
            <p>　　'Another writ has been issued (in His Majesty's High Court of 
              King's Bench at Westminster), in another cause of HEEP V. MICAWBER, 
              and the defendant in that cause is the prey of the sheriff having 
              legal jurisdiction in this bailiwick. </p>
            <p>　　 'Now's the day, and now's the hour, See the front of battle 
              lower, See approach proud EDWARD'S power - Chains and slavery! </p>
            <p>　　'Consigned to which, and to a speedy end (for mental torture 
              is not supportable beyond a certain point, and that point I feel 
              I have attained), my course is run. Bless you, bless you! Some future 
              traveller, visiting, from motives of curiosity, not unmingled, let 
              us hope, with sympathy, the place of confinement allotted to debtors 
              in this city, may, and I trust will, Ponder, as he traces on its 
              wall, inscribed with a rusty nail, 'The obscure initials, </p>
            <p>　　 'W. M. </p>
            <p>　　'P.S. I re-open this to say that our common friend, Mr. Thomas 
              Traddles (who has not yet left us, and is looking extremely well), 
              has paid the debt and costs, in the noble name of Miss Trotwood; 
              and that myself and family are at the height of earthly bliss.'

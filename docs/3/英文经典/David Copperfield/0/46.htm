            </div>
            <p>　　 It was some time now, since I had left the Doctor. Living in 
              his neighbourhood, I saw him frequently; and we all went to his 
              house on two or three occasions to dinner or tea. The Old Soldier 
              was in permanent quarters under the Doctor's roof. She was exactly 
              the same as ever, and the same immortal butterflies hovered over 
              her cap. </p>
            <p>　　Like some other mothers, whom I have known in the course of my 
              life, Mrs. Markleham was far more fond of pleasure than her daughter 
              was. She required a great deal of amusement, and, like a deep old 
              soldier, pretended, in consulting her own inclinations, to be devoting 
              herself to her child. The Doctor's desire that Annie should be entertained, 
              was therefore particularly acceptable to this excellent parent; 
              who expressed unqualified approval of his discretion. </p>
            <p>　　I have no doubt, indeed, that she probed the Doctor's wound without 
              knowing it. Meaning nothing but a certain matured frivolity and 
              selfishness, not always inseparable from full-blown years, I think 
              she confirmed him in his fear that he was a constraint upon his 
              young wife, and that there was no congeniality of feeling between 
              them, by so strongly commending his design of lightening the load 
              of her life. </p>
            <p>　　'My dear soul,' she said to him one day when I was present, 'you 
              know there is no doubt it would be a little pokey for Annie to be 
              always shut up here.' </p>
            <p>　　The Doctor nodded his benevolent head. 'When she comes to her 
              mother's age,' said Mrs. Markleham, with a flourish of her fan, 
              'then it'll be another thing. You might put ME into a Jail, with 
              genteel society and a rubber, and I should never care to come out. 
              But I am not Annie, you know; and Annie is not her mother.' </p>
            <p>　　'Surely, surely,' said the Doctor. </p>
            <p>　　'You are the best of creatures - no, I beg your pardon!' for 
              the Doctor made a gesture of deprecation, 'I must say before your 
              face, as I always say behind your back, you are the best of creatures; 
              but of course you don't - now do you? - enter into the same pursuits 
              and fancies as Annie?' </p>
            <p>　　'No,' said the Doctor, in a sorrowful tone. </p>
            <p>　　'No, of course not,' retorted the Old Soldier. 'Take your Dictionary, 
              for example. What a useful work a Dictionary is! What a necessary 
              work! The meanings of words! Without Doctor Johnson, or somebody 
              of that sort, we might have been at this present moment calling 
              an Italian-iron, a bedstead. But we can't expect a Dictionary - 
              especially when it's making - to interest Annie, can we?' </p>
            <p>　　The Doctor shook his head. </p>
            <p>　　'And that's why I so much approve,' said Mrs. Markleham, tapping 
              him on the shoulder with her shut-up fan, 'of your thoughtfulness. 
              It shows that you don't expect, as many elderly people do expect, 
              old heads on young shoulders. You have studied Annie's character, 
              and you understand it. That's what I find so charming!' </p>
            <p>　　Even the calm and patient face of Doctor Strong expressed some 
              little sense of pain, I thought, under the infliction of these compliments. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Therefore, my dear Doctor,' said the Old Soldier, giving him 
              several affectionate taps, 'you may command me, at all times and 
              seasons. Now, do understand that I am entirely at your service. 
              I am ready to go with Annie to operas, concerts, exhibitions, all 
              kinds of places; and you shall never find that I am tired. Duty, 
              my dear Doctor, before every consideration in the universe!' </p>
            <p>　　She was as good as her word. She was one of those people who 
              can bear a great deal of pleasure, and she never flinched in her 
              perseverance in the cause. She seldom got hold of the newspaper 
              (which she settled herself down in the softest chair in the house 
              to read through an eye-glass, every day, for two hours), but she 
              found out something that she was certain Annie would like to see. 
              It was in vain for Annie to protest that she was weary of such things. 
              Her mother's remonstrance always was, 'Now, my dear Annie, I am 
              sure you know better; and I must tell you, my love, that you are 
              not making a proper return for the kindness of Doctor Strong.' </p>
            <p>　　This was usually said in the Doctor's presence, and appeared 
              to me to constitute Annie's principal inducement for withdrawing 
              her objections when she made any. But in general she resigned herself 
              to her mother, and went where the Old Soldier would. </p>
            <p>　　It rarely happened now that Mr. Maldon accompanied them. Sometimes 
              my aunt and Dora were invited to do so, and accepted the invitation. 
              Sometimes Dora only was asked. The time had been, when I should 
              have been uneasy in her going; but reflection on what had passed 
              that former night in the Doctor's study, had made a change in my 
              mistrust. I believed that the Doctor was right, and I had no worse 
              suspicions. </p>
            <p>　　My aunt rubbed her nose sometimes when she happened to be alone 
              with me, and said she couldn't make it out; she wished they were 
              happier; she didn't think our military friend (so she always called 
              the Old Soldier) mended the matter at all. My aunt further expressed 
              her opinion, 'that if our military friend would cut off those butterflies, 
              and give 'em to the chimney-sweepers for May-day, it would look 
              like the beginning of something sensible on her part.' </p>
            <p>　　But her abiding reliance was on Mr. Dick. That man had evidently 
              an idea in his head, she said; and if he could only once pen it 
              up into a corner, which was his great difficulty, he would distinguish 
              himself in some extraordinary manner. </p>
            <p>　　Unconscious of this prediction, Mr. Dick continued to occupy 
              precisely the same ground in reference to the Doctor and to Mrs. 
              Strong. He seemed neither to advance nor to recede. He appeared 
              to have settled into his original foundation, like a building; and 
              I must confess that my faith in his ever Moving, was not much greater 
              than if he had been a building. </p>
            <p>　　But one night, when I had been married some months, Mr. Dick 
              put his head into the parlour, where I was writing alone (Dora having 
              gone out with my aunt to take tea with the two little birds), and 
              said, with a significant cough: </p>
            <p>　　'You couldn't speak to me without inconveniencing yourself, Trotwood, 
              I am afraid?' </p>
            <p>　　'Certainly, Mr. Dick,' said I; 'come in!' </p>
            <p>　　'Trotwood,' said Mr. Dick, laying his finger on the side of his 
              nose, after he had shaken hands with me. 'Before I sit down, I wish 
              to make an observation. You know your aunt?' </p>
            <p>　　'A little,' I replied. </p>
            <p>　　'She is the most wonderful woman in the world, sir!' </p>
            <p>　　After the delivery of this communication, which he shot out of 
              himself as if he were loaded with it, Mr. Dick sat down with greater 
              gravity than usual, and looked at me. </p>
            <p>　　'Now, boy,' said Mr. Dick, 'I am going to put a question to you.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'As many as you please,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'What do you consider me, sir?' asked Mr. Dick, folding his arms. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'A dear old friend,' said I. 'Thank you, Trotwood,' returned 
              Mr. Dick, laughing, and reaching across in high glee to shake hands 
              with me. 'But I mean, boy,' resuming his gravity, 'what do you consider 
              me in this respect?' touching his forehead. </p>
            <p>　　I was puzzled how to answer, but he helped me with a word. </p>
            <p>　　'Weak?' said Mr. Dick. </p>
            <p>　　'Well,' I replied, dubiously. 'Rather so.' </p>
            <p>　　'Exactly!' cried Mr. Dick, who seemed quite enchanted by my reply. 
              'That is, Trotwood, when they took some of the trouble out of you-know-who's 
              head, and put it you know where, there was a -' Mr. Dick made his 
              two hands revolve very fast about each other a great number of times, 
              and then brought them into collision, and rolled them over and over 
              one another, to express confusion. 'There was that sort of thing 
              done to me somehow. Eh?' </p>
            <p>　　I nodded at him, and he nodded back again. </p>
            <p>　　'In short, boy,' said Mr. Dick, dropping his voice to a whisper, 
              'I am simple.' </p>
            <p>　　I would have qualified that conclusion, but he stopped me. </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, I am! She pretends I am not. She won't hear of it; but 
              I am. I know I am. If she hadn't stood my friend, sir, I should 
              have been shut up, to lead a dismal life these many years. But I'll 
              provide for her! I never spend the copying money. I put it in a 
              box. I have made a will. I'll leave it all to her. She shall be 
              rich - noble!' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Dick took out his pocket-handkerchief, and wiped his eyes. 
              He then folded it up with great care, pressed it smooth between 
              his two hands, put it in his pocket, and seemed to put my aunt away 
              with it. </p>
            <p>　　'Now you are a scholar, Trotwood,' said Mr. Dick. 'You are a 
              fine scholar. You know what a learned man, what a great man, the 
              Doctor is. You know what honour he has always done me. Not proud 
              in his wisdom. Humble, humble - condescending even to poor Dick, 
              who is simple and knows nothing. I have sent his name up, on a scrap 
              of paper, to the kite, along the string, when it has been in the 
              sky, among the larks. The kite has been glad to receive it, sir, 
              and the sky has been brighter with it.' </p>
            <p>　　I delighted him by saying, most heartily, that the Doctor was 
              deserving of our best respect and highest esteem. </p>
            <p>　　'And his beautiful wife is a star,' said Mr. Dick. 'A shining 
              star. I have seen her shine, sir. But,' bringing his chair nearer, 
              and laying one hand upon my knee - 'clouds, sir - clouds.' </p>
            <p>　　I answered the solicitude which his face expressed, by conveying 
              the same expression into my own, and shaking my head. </p>
            <p>　　'What clouds?' said Mr. Dick. </p>
            <p>　　He looked so wistfully into my face, and was so anxious to understand, 
              that I took great pains to answer him slowly and distinctly, as 
              I might have entered on an explanation to a child. </p>
            <p>　　'There is some unfortunate division between them,' I replied. 
              'Some unhappy cause of separation. A secret. It may be inseparable 
              from the discrepancy in their years. It may have grown up out of 
              almost nothing.' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Dick, who had told off every sentence with a thoughtful nod, 
              paused when I had done, and sat considering, with his eyes upon 
              my face, and his hand upon my knee. </p>
            <p>　　'Doctor not angry with her, Trotwood?' he said, after some time. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'No. Devoted to her.' </p>
            <p>　　'Then, I have got it, boy!' said Mr. Dick. </p>
            <p>　　The sudden exultation with which he slapped me on the knee, and 
              leaned back in his chair, with his eyebrows lifted up as high as 
              he could possibly lift them, made me think him farther out of his 
              wits than ever. He became as suddenly grave again, and leaning forward 
              as before, said - first respectfully taking out his pocket-handkerchief, 
              as if it really did represent my aunt: </p>
            <p>　　'Most wonderful woman in the world, Trotwood. Why has she done 
              nothing to set things right?' </p>
            <p>　　'Too delicate and difficult a subject for such interference,' 
              I replied. </p>
            <p>　　'Fine scholar,' said Mr. Dick, touching me with his finger. 'Why 
              has HE done nothing?' </p>
            <p>　　'For the same reason,' I returned. </p>
            <p>　　'Then, I have got it, boy!' said Mr. Dick. And he stood up before 
              me, more exultingly than before, nodding his head, and striking 
              himself repeatedly upon the breast, until one might have supposed 
              that he had nearly nodded and struck all the breath out of his body. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'A poor fellow with a craze, sir,' said Mr. Dick, 'a simpleton, 
              a weak-minded person - present company, you know!' striking himself 
              again, 'may do what wonderful people may not do. I'll bring them 
              together, boy. I'll try. They'll not blame me. They'll not object 
              to me. They'll not mind what I do, if it's wrong. I'm only Mr. Dick. 
              And who minds Dick? Dick's nobody! Whoo!' He blew a slight, contemptuous 
              breath, as if he blew himself away. </p>
            <p>　　It was fortunate he had proceeded so far with his mystery, for 
              we heard the coach stop at the little garden gate, which brought 
              my aunt and Dora home. </p>
            <p>　　'Not a word, boy!' he pursued in a whisper; 'leave all the blame 
              with Dick - simple Dick - mad Dick. I have been thinking, sir, for 
              some time, that I was getting it, and now I have got it. After what 
              you have said to me, I am sure I have got it. All right!' Not another 
              word did Mr. Dick utter on the subject; but he made a very telegraph 
              of himself for the next half-hour (to the great disturbance of my 
              aunt's mind), to enjoin inviolable secrecy on me. </p>
            <p>　　To my surprise, I heard no more about it for some two or three 
              weeks, though I was sufficiently interested in the result of his 
              endeavours; descrying a strange gleam of good sense - I say nothing 
              of good feeling, for that he always exhibited - in the conclusion 
              to which he had come. At last I began to believe, that, in the flighty 
              and unsettled state of his mind, he had either forgotten his intention 
              or abandoned it. </p>
            <p>　　One fair evening, when Dora was not inclined to go out, my aunt 
              and I strolled up to the Doctor's cottage. It was autumn, when there 
              were no debates to vex the evening air; and I remember how the leaves 
              smelt like our garden at Blunderstone as we trod them under foot, 
              and how the old, unhappy feeling, seemed to go by, on the sighing 
              wind. </p>
            <p>　　It was twilight when we reached the cottage. Mrs. Strong was 
              just coming out of the garden, where Mr. Dick yet lingered, busy 
              with his knife, helping the gardener to point some stakes. The Doctor 
              was engaged with someone in his study; but the visitor would be 
              gone directly, Mrs. Strong said, and begged us to remain and see 
              him. We went into the drawing-room with her, and sat down by the 
              darkening window. There was never any ceremony about the visits 
              of such old friends and neighbours as we were. </p>
            <p>　　We had not sat here many minutes, when Mrs. Markleham, who usually 
              contrived to be in a fuss about something, came bustling in, with 
              her newspaper in her hand, and said, out of breath, 'My goodness 
              gracious, Annie, why didn't you tell me there was someone in the 
              Study!' </p>
            <p>　　'My dear mama,' she quietly returned, 'how could I know that 
              you desired the information?' </p>
            <p>　　'Desired the information!' said Mrs. Markleham, sinking on the 
              sofa. 'I never had such a turn in all my life!' </p>
            <p>　　'Have you been to the Study, then, mama?' asked Annie. </p>
            <p>　　'BEEN to the Study, my dear!' she returned emphatically. 'Indeed 
              I have! I came upon the amiable creature - if you'll imagine my 
              feelings, Miss Trotwood and David - in the act of making his will.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　Her daughter looked round from the window quickly. </p>
            <p>　　'In the act, my dear Annie,' repeated Mrs. Markleham, spreading 
              the newspaper on her lap like a table-cloth, and patting her hands 
              upon it, 'of making his last Will and Testament. The foresight and 
              affection of the dear! I must tell you how it was. I really must, 
              in justice to the darling - for he is nothing less! - tell you how 
              it was. Perhaps you know, Miss Trotwood, that there is never a candle 
              lighted in this house, until one's eyes are literally falling out 
              of one's head with being stretched to read the paper. And that there 
              is not a chair in this house, in which a paper can be what I call, 
              read, except one in the Study. This took me to the Study, where 
              I saw a light. I opened the door. In company with the dear Doctor 
              were two professional people, evidently connected with the law, 
              and they were all three standing at the table: the darling Doctor 
              pen in hand. &quot;This simply expresses then,&quot; said the Doctor 
              - Annie, my love, attend to the very words - &quot;this simply expresses 
              then, gentlemen, the confidence I have in Mrs. Strong, and gives 
              her all unconditionally?&quot; One of the professional people replied, 
              &quot;And gives her all unconditionally.&quot; Upon that, with the 
              natural feelings of a mother, I said, &quot;Good God, I beg your 
              pardon!&quot; fell over the door-step, and came away through the 
              little back passage where the pantry is.' </p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Strong opened the window, and went out into the verandah, 
              where she stood leaning against a pillar. </p>
            <p>　　'But now isn't it, Miss Trotwood, isn't it, David, invigorating,' 
              said Mrs. Markleham, mechanically following her with her eyes, 'to 
              find a man at Doctor Strong's time of life, with the strength of 
              mind to do this kind of thing? It only shows how right I was. I 
              said to Annie, when Doctor Strong paid a very flattering visit to 
              myself, and made her the subject of a declaration and an offer, 
              I said, &quot;My dear, there is no doubt whatever, in my opinion, 
              with reference to a suitable provision for you, that Doctor Strong 
              will do more than he binds himself to do.&quot;' </p>
            <p>　　Here the bell rang, and we heard the sound of the visitors' feet 
              as they went out. </p>
            <p>　　'It's all over, no doubt,' said the Old Soldier, after listening; 
              'the dear creature has signed, sealed, and delivered, and his mind's 
              at rest. Well it may be! What a mind! Annie, my love, I am going 
              to the Study with my paper, for I am a poor creature without news. 
              Miss Trotwood, David, pray come and see the Doctor.' </p>
            <p>　　I was conscious of Mr. Dick's standing in the shadow of the room, 
              shutting up his knife, when we accompanied her to the Study; and 
              of my aunt's rubbing her nose violently, by the way, as a mild vent 
              for her intolerance of our military friend; but who got first into 
              the Study, or how Mrs. Markleham settled herself in a moment in 
              her easy-chair, or how my aunt and I came to be left together near 
              the door (unless her eyes were quicker than mine, and she held me 
              back), I have forgotten, if I ever knew. But this I know, - that 
              we saw the Doctor before he saw us, sitting at his table, among 
              the folio volumes in which he delighted, resting his head calmly 
              on his hand. That, in the same moment, we saw Mrs. Strong glide 
              in, pale and trembling. That Mr. Dick supported her on his arm. 
              That he laid his other hand upon the Doctor's arm, causing him to 
              look up with an abstracted air. That, as the Doctor moved his head, 
              his wife dropped down on one knee at his feet, and, with her hands 
              imploringly lifted, fixed upon his face the memorable look I had 
              never forgotten. That at this sight Mrs. Markleham dropped the newspaper, 
              and stared more like a figure-head intended for a ship to be called 
              The Astonishment, than anything else I can think of. </p>
            <p>　　The gentleness of the Doctor's manner and surprise, the dignity 
              that mingled with the supplicating attitude of his wife, the amiable 
              concern of Mr. Dick, and the earnestness with which my aunt said 
              to herself, 'That man mad!' (triumphantly expressive of the misery 
              from which she had saved him) - I see and hear, rather than remember, 
              as I write about it. </p>
            <p>　　'Doctor!' said Mr. Dick. 'What is it that's amiss? Look here!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Annie!' cried the Doctor. 'Not at my feet, my dear!' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes!' she said. 'I beg and pray that no one will leave the room! 
              Oh, my husband and father, break this long silence. Let us both 
              know what it is that has come between us!' </p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Markleham, by this time recovering the power of speech, 
              and seeming to swell with family pride and motherly indignation, 
              here exclaimed, 'Annie, get up immediately, and don't disgrace everybody 
              belonging to you by humbling yourself like that, unless you wish 
              to see me go out of my mind on the spot!' </p>
            <p>　　'Mama!' returned Annie. 'Waste no words on me, for my appeal 
              is to my husband, and even you are nothing here.' </p>
            <p>　　'Nothing!' exclaimed Mrs. Markleham. 'Me, nothing! The child 
              has taken leave of her senses. Please to get me a glass of water!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　I was too attentive to the Doctor and his wife, to give any heed 
              to this request; and it made no impression on anybody else; so Mrs. 
              Markleham panted, stared, and fanned herself. </p>
            <p>　　'Annie!' said the Doctor, tenderly taking her in his hands. 'My 
              dear! If any unavoidable change has come, in the sequence of time, 
              upon our married life, you are not to blame. The fault is mine, 
              and only mine. There is no change in my affection, admiration, and 
              respect. I wish to make you happy. I truly love and honour you. 
              Rise, Annie, pray!' </p>
            <p>　　But she did not rise. After looking at him for a little while, 
              she sank down closer to him, laid her arm across his knee, and dropping 
              her head upon it, said: </p>
            <p>　　'If I have any friend here, who can speak one word for me, or 
              for my husband in this matter; if I have any friend here, who can 
              give a voice to any suspicion that my heart has sometimes whispered 
              to me; if I have any friend here, who honours my husband, or has 
              ever cared for me, and has anything within his knowledge, no matter 
              what it is, that may help to mediate between us, I implore that 
              friend to speak!' </p>
            <p>　　There was a profound silence. After a few moments of painful 
              hesitation, I broke the silence. </p>
            <p>　　'Mrs. Strong,' I said, 'there is something within my knowledge, 
              which I have been earnestly entreated by Doctor Strong to conceal, 
              and have concealed until tonight. But, I believe the time has come 
              when it would be mistaken faith and delicacy to conceal it any longer, 
              and when your appeal absolves me from his injunction.' </p>
            <p>　　She turned her face towards me for a moment, and I knew that 
              I was right. I could not have resisted its entreaty, if the assurance 
              that it gave me had been less convincing. </p>
            <p>　　'Our future peace,' she said, 'may be in your hands. I trust 
              it confidently to your not suppressing anything. I know beforehand 
              that nothing you, or anyone, can tell me, will show my husband's 
              noble heart in any other light than one. Howsoever it may seem to 
              you to touch me, disregard that. I will speak for myself, before 
              him, and before God afterwards.' </p>
            <p>　　Thus earnestly besought, I made no reference to the Doctor for 
              his permission, but, without any other compromise of the truth than 
              a little softening of the coarseness of Uriah Heep, related plainly 
              what had passed in that same room that night. The staring of Mrs. 
              Markleham during the whole narration, and the shrill, sharp interjections 
              with which she occasionally interrupted it, defy description. </p>
            <p>　　When I had finished, Annie remained, for some few moments, silent, 
              with her head bent down, as I have described. Then, she took the 
              Doctor's hand (he was sitting in the same attitude as when we had 
              entered the room), and pressed it to her breast, and kissed it. 
              Mr. Dick softly raised her; and she stood, when she began to speak, 
              leaning on him, and looking down upon her husband - from whom she 
              never turned her eyes. </p>
            <p>　　'All that has ever been in my mind, since I was married,' she 
              said in a low, submissive, tender voice, 'I will lay bare before 
              you. I could not live and have one reservation, knowing what I know 
              now.' </p>
            <p>　　'Nay, Annie,' said the Doctor, mildly, 'I have never doubted 
              you, my child. There is no need; indeed there is no need, my dear.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'There is great need,' she answered, in the same way, 'that I 
              should open my whole heart before the soul of generosity and truth, 
              whom, year by year, and day by day, I have loved and venerated more 
              and more, as Heaven knows!' </p>
            <p>　　'Really,' interrupted Mrs. Markleham, 'if I have any discretion 
              at all -' </p>
            <p>　　('Which you haven't, you Marplot,' observed my aunt, in an indignant 
              whisper.) </p>
            <p>　　- 'I must be permitted to observe that it cannot be requisite 
              to enter into these details.' </p>
            <p>　　'No one but my husband can judge of that, mama,' said Annie without 
              removing her eyes from his face, 'and he will hear me. If I say 
              anything to give you pain, mama, forgive me. I have borne pain first, 
              often and long, myself.' </p>
            <p>　　'Upon my word!' gasped Mrs. Markleham. </p>
            <p>　　'When I was very young,' said Annie, 'quite a little child, my 
              first associations with knowledge of any kind were inseparable from 
              a patient friend and teacher - the friend of my dead father - who 
              was always dear to me. I can remember nothing that I know, without 
              remembering him. He stored my mind with its first treasures, and 
              stamped his character upon them all. They never could have been, 
              I think, as good as they have been to me, if I had taken them from 
              any other hands.' </p>
            <p>　　'Makes her mother nothing!' exclaimed Mrs. Markleham. </p>
            <p>　　'Not so mama,' said Annie; 'but I make him what he was. I must 
              do that. As I grew up, he occupied the same place still. I was proud 
              of his interest: deeply, fondly, gratefully attached to him. I looked 
              up to him, I can hardly describe how - as a father, as a guide, 
              as one whose praise was different from all other praise, as one 
              in whom I could have trusted and confided, if I had doubted all 
              the world. You know, mama, how young and inexperienced I was, when 
              you presented him before me, of a sudden, as a lover.' </p>
            <p>　　'I have mentioned the fact, fifty times at least, to everybody 
              here!' said Mrs. Markleham. </p>
            <p>　　('Then hold your tongue, for the Lord's sake, and don't mention 
              it any more!' muttered my aunt.) </p>
            <p>　　'It was so great a change: so great a loss, I felt it, at first,' 
              said Annie, still preserving the same look and tone, 'that I was 
              agitated and distressed. I was but a girl; and when so great a change 
              came in the character in which I had so long looked up to him, I 
              think I was sorry. But nothing could have made him what he used 
              to be again; and I was proud that he should think me so worthy, 
              and we were married.' '- At Saint Alphage, Canterbury,' observed 
              Mrs. Markleham. </p>
            <p>　　('Confound the woman!' said my aunt, 'she WON'T be quiet!') </p>
            <p>　　'I never thought,' proceeded Annie, with a heightened colour, 
              'of any worldly gain that my husband would bring to me. My young 
              heart had no room in its homage for any such poor reference. Mama, 
              forgive me when I say that it was you who first presented to my 
              mind the thought that anyone could wrong me, and wrong him, by such 
              a cruel suspicion.' </p>
            <p>　　'Me!' cried Mrs. Markleham. </p>
            <p>　　('Ah! You, to be sure!' observed my aunt, 'and you can't fan 
              it away, my military friend!') </p>
            <p>　　'It was the first unhappiness of my new life,' said Annie. 'It 
              was the first occasion of every unhappy moment I have known. These 
              moments have been more, of late, than I can count; but not - my 
              generous husband! - not for the reason you suppose; for in my heart 
              there is not a thought, a recollection, or a hope, that any power 
              could separate from you!' </p>
            <p>　　She raised her eyes, and clasped her hands, and looked as beautiful 
              and true, I thought, as any Spirit. The Doctor looked on her, henceforth, 
              as steadfastly as she on him. </p>
            <p>　　'Mama is blameless,' she went on, 'of having ever urged you for 
              herself, and she is blameless in intention every way, I am sure, 
              - but when I saw how many importunate claims were pressed upon you 
              in my name; how you were traded on in my name; how generous you 
              were, and how Mr. Wickfield, who had your welfare very much at heart, 
              resented it; the first sense of my exposure to the mean suspicion 
              that my tenderness was bought - and sold to you, of all men on earth 
              - fell upon me like unmerited disgrace, in which I forced you to 
              participate. I cannot tell you what it was - mama cannot imagine 
              what it was - to have this dread and trouble always on my mind, 
              yet know in my own soul that on my marriage-day I crowned the love 
              and honour of my life!' </p>
            <p>　　'A specimen of the thanks one gets,' cried Mrs. Markleham, in 
              tears, 'for taking care of one's family! I wish I was a Turk!' </p>
            <p>　　('I wish you were, with all my heart - and in your native country!' 
              said my aunt.) </p>
            <p>　　'It was at that time that mama was most solicitous about my Cousin 
              Maldon. I had liked him': she spoke softly, but without any hesitation: 
              'very much. We had been little lovers once. If circumstances had 
              not happened otherwise, I might have come to persuade myself that 
              I really loved him, and might have married him, and been most wretched. 
              There can be no disparity in marriage like unsuitability of mind 
              and purpose.' </p>
            <p>　　I pondered on those words, even while I was studiously attending 
              to what followed, as if they had some particular interest, or some 
              strange application that I could not divine. 'There can be no disparity 
              in marriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose' -'no disparity 
              in marriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose.' </p>
            <p>　　'There is nothing,' said Annie, 'that we have in common. I have 
              long found that there is nothing. If I were thankful to my husband 
              for no more, instead of for so much, I should be thankful to him 
              for having saved me from the first mistaken impulse of my undisciplined 
              heart.' </p>
            <p>　　She stood quite still, before the Doctor, and spoke with an earnestness 
              that thrilled me. Yet her voice was just as quiet as before. </p>
            <p>　　'When he was waiting to be the object of your munificence, so 
              freely bestowed for my sake, and when I was unhappy in the mercenary 
              shape I was made to wear, I thought it would have become him better 
              to have worked his own way on. I thought that if I had been he, 
              I would have tried to do it, at the cost of almost any hardship. 
              But I thought no worse of him, until the night of his departure 
              for India. That night I knew he had a false and thankless heart. 
              I saw a double meaning, then, in Mr. Wickfield's scrutiny of me. 
              I perceived, for the first time, the dark suspicion that shadowed 
              my life.' </p>
            <p>　　'Suspicion, Annie!' said the Doctor. 'No, no, no!' </p>
            <p>　　'In your mind there was none, I know, my husband!' she returned. 
              'And when I came to you, that night, to lay down all my load of 
              shame and grief, and knew that I had to tell that, underneath your 
              roof, one of my own kindred, to whom you had been a benefactor, 
              for the love of me, had spoken to me words that should have found 
              no utterance, even if I had been the weak and mercenary wretch he 
              thought me - my mind revolted from the taint the very tale conveyed. 
              It died upon my lips, and from that hour till now has never passed 
              them.' </p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Markleham, with a short groan, leaned back in her easy-chair; 
              and retired behind her fan, as if she were never coming out any 
              more. </p>
            <p>　　'I have never, but in your presence, interchanged a word with 
              him from that time; then, only when it has been necessary for the 
              avoidance of this explanation. Years have passed since he knew, 
              from me, what his situation here was. The kindnesses you have secretly 
              done for his advancement, and then disclosed to me, for my surprise 
              and pleasure, have been, you will believe, but aggravations of the 
              unhappiness and burden of my secret.' </p>
            <p>　　She sunk down gently at the Doctor's feet, though he did his 
              utmost to prevent her; and said, looking up, tearfully, into his 
              face: </p>
            <p>　　'Do not speak to me yet! Let me say a little more! Right or wrong, 
              if this were to be done again, I think I should do just the same. 
              You never can know what it was to be devoted to you, with those 
              old associations; to find that anyone could be so hard as to suppose 
              that the truth of my heart was bartered away, and to be surrounded 
              by appearances confirming that belief. I was very young, and had 
              no adviser. Between mama and me, in all relating to you, there was 
              a wide division. If I shrunk into myself, hiding the disrespect 
              I had undergone, it was because I honoured you so much, and so much 
              wished that you should honour me!' </p>
            <p>　　'Annie, my pure heart!' said the Doctor, 'my dear girl!' </p>
            <p>　　'A little more! a very few words more! I used to think there 
              were so many whom you might have married, who would not have brought 
              such charge and trouble on you, and who would have made your home 
              a worthier home. I used to be afraid that I had better have remained 
              your pupil, and almost your child. I used to fear that I was so 
              unsuited to your learning and wisdom. If all this made me shrink 
              within myself (as indeed it did), when I had that to tell, it was 
              still because I honoured you so much, and hoped that you might one 
              day honour me.' </p>
            <p>　　'That day has shone this long time, Annie,' said the Doctor, 
              and can have but one long night, my dear.' </p>
            <p>　　'Another word! I afterwards meant - steadfastly meant, and purposed 
              to myself - to bear the whole weight of knowing the unworthiness 
              of one to whom you had been so good. And now a last word, dearest 
              and best of friends! The cause of the late change in you, which 
              I have seen with so much pain and sorrow, and have sometimes referred 
              to my old apprehension - at other times to lingering suppositions 
              nearer to the truth - has been made clear tonight; and by an accident 
              I have also come to know, tonight, the full measure of your noble 
              trust in me, even under that mistake. I do not hope that any love 
              and duty I may render in return, will ever make me worthy of your 
              priceless confidence; but with all this knowledge fresh upon me, 
              I can lift my eyes to this dear face, revered as a father's, loved 
              as a husband's, sacred to me in my childhood as a friend's, and 
              solemnly declare that in my lightest thought I have never wronged 
              you; never wavered in the love and the fidelity I owe you!' </p>
            <p>　　She had her arms around the Doctor's neck, and he leant his head 
              down over her, mingling his grey hair with her dark brown tresses. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, hold me to your heart, my husband! Never cast me out! Do 
              not think or speak of disparity between us, for there is none, except 
              in all my many imperfections. Every succeeding year I have known 
              this better, as I have esteemed you more and more. Oh, take me to 
              your heart, my husband, for my love was founded on a rock, and it 
              endures!' </p>
            <p>　　In the silence that ensued, my aunt walked gravely up to Mr. 
              Dick, without at all hurrying herself, and gave him a hug and a 
              sounding kiss. And it was very fortunate, with a view to his credit, 
              that she did so; for I am confident that I detected him at that 
              moment in the act of making preparations to stand on one leg, as 
              an appropriate expression of delight. </p>
            <p>　　'You are a very remarkable man, Dick!' said my aunt, with an 
              air of unqualified approbation; 'and never pretend to be anything 
              else, for I know better!' </p>
            <p>　　With that, my aunt pulled him by the sleeve, and nodded to me; 
              and we three stole quietly out of the room, and came away. </p>
            <p>　　'That's a settler for our military friend, at any rate,' said 
              my aunt, on the way home. 'I should sleep the better for that, if 
              there was nothing else to be glad of!' </p>
            <p>　　'She was quite overcome, I am afraid,' said Mr. Dick, with great 
              commiseration. </p>
            <p>　　'What! Did you ever see a crocodile overcome?' inquired my aunt. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I don't think I ever saw a crocodile,' returned Mr. Dick, mildly. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'There never would have been anything the matter, if it hadn't 
              been for that old Animal,' said my aunt, with strong emphasis. 'It's 
              very much to be wished that some mothers would leave their daughters 
              alone after marriage, and not be so violently affectionate. They 
              seem to think the only return that can be made them for bringing 
              an unfortunate young woman into the world - God bless my soul, as 
              if she asked to be brought, or wanted to come! - is full liberty 
              to worry her out of it again. What are you thinking of, Trot?' </p>
            <p>　　I was thinking of all that had been said. My mind was still running 
              on some of the expressions used. 'There can be no disparity in marriage 
              like unsuitability of mind and purpose.' 'The first mistaken impulse 
              of an undisciplined heart.' 'My love was founded on a rock.' But 
              we were at home; and the trodden leaves were lying under-foot, and 
              the autumn wind was blowing. </p>

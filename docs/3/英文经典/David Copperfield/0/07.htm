            <div align="center"><b>I ENLARGE MY CIRCLE OF ACQUAINTANCE </b> </div>
            <p>　　 I HAD led this life about a month, when the man with the wooden 
              leg began to stump about with a mop and a bucket of water, from 
              which I inferred that preparations were making to receive Mr. Creakle 
              and the boys. I was not mistaken; for the mop came into the schoolroom 
              before long, and turned out Mr. Mell and me, who lived where we 
              could, and got on how we could, for some days, during which we were 
              always in the way of two or three young women, who had rarely shown 
              themselves before, and were so continually in the midst of dust 
              that I sneezed almost as much as if Salem House had been a great 
              snuff-box. </p>
            <p>　　One day I was informed by Mr. Mell that Mr. Creakle would be 
              home that evening. In the evening, after tea, I heard that he was 
              come. Before bedtime, I was fetched by the man with the wooden leg 
              to appear before him. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Creakle's part of the house was a good deal more comfortable 
              than ours, and he had a snug bit of garden that looked pleasant 
              after the dusty playground, which was such a desert in miniature, 
              that I thought no one but a camel, or a dromedary, could have felt 
              at home in it. It seemed to me a bold thing even to take notice 
              that the passage looked comfortable, as I went on my way, trembling, 
              to Mr. Creakle's presence: which so abashed me, when I was ushered 
              into it, that I hardly saw Mrs. Creakle or Miss Creakle (who were 
              both there, in the parlour), or anything but Mr. Creakle, a stout 
              gentleman with a bunch of watch-chain and seals, in an arm-chair, 
              with a tumbler and bottle beside him. </p>
            <p>　　'So!' said Mr. Creakle. 'This is the young gentleman whose teeth 
              are to be filed! Turn him round.' </p>
            <p>　　The wooden-legged man turned me about so as to exhibit the placard; 
              and having afforded time for a full survey of it, turned me about 
              again, with my face to Mr. Creakle, and posted himself at Mr. Creakle's 
              side. Mr. Creakle's face was fiery, and his eyes were small, and 
              deep in his head; he had thick veins in his forehead, a little nose, 
              and a large chin. He was bald on the top of his head; and had some 
              thin wet-looking hair that was just turning grey, brushed across 
              each temple, so that the two sides interlaced on his forehead. But 
              the circumstance about him which impressed me most, was, that he 
              had no voice, but spoke in a whisper. The exertion this cost him, 
              or the consciousness of talking in that feeble way, made his angry 
              face so much more angry, and his thick veins so much thicker, when 
              he spoke, that I am not surprised, on looking back, at this peculiarity 
              striking me as his chief one. 'Now,' said Mr. Creakle. 'What's the 
              report of this boy?' </p>
            <p>　　'There's nothing against him yet,' returned the man with the 
              wooden leg. 'There has been no opportunity.' </p>
            <p>　　I thought Mr. Creakle was disappointed. I thought Mrs. and Miss 
              Creakle (at whom I now glanced for the first time, and who were, 
              both, thin and quiet) were not disappointed. </p>
            <p>　　'Come here, sir!' said Mr. Creakle, beckoning to me. </p>
            <p>　　'Come here!' said the man with the wooden leg, repeating the 
              gesture. </p>
            <p>　　'I have the happiness of knowing your father-in-law,' whispered 
              Mr. Creakle, taking me by the ear; 'and a worthy man he is, and 
              a man of a strong character. He knows me, and I know him. Do YOU 
              know me? Hey?' said Mr. Creakle, pinching my ear with ferocious 
              playfulness. </p>
            <p>　　'Not yet, sir,' I said, flinching with the pain. </p>
            <p>　　'Not yet? Hey?' repeated Mr. Creakle. 'But you will soon. Hey?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'You will soon. Hey?' repeated the man with the wooden leg. I 
              afterwards found that he generally acted, with his strong voice, 
              as Mr. Creakle's interpreter to the boys. </p>
            <p>　　I was very much frightened, and said, I hoped so, if he pleased. 
              I felt, all this while, as if my ear were blazing; he pinched it 
              so hard. </p>
            <p>　　'I'll tell you what I am,' whispered Mr. Creakle, letting it 
              go at last, with a screw at parting that brought the water into 
              my eyes. 'I'm a Tartar.' </p>
            <p>　　'A Tartar,' said the man with the wooden leg. </p>
            <p>　　'When I say I'll do a thing, I do it,' said Mr. Creakle; 'and 
              when I say I will have a thing done, I will have it done.' </p>
            <p>　　'- Will have a thing done, I will have it done,' repeated the 
              man with the wooden leg. </p>
            <p>　　'I am a determined character,' said Mr. Creakle. 'That's what 
              I am. I do my duty. That's what I do. My flesh and blood' - he looked 
              at Mrs. Creakle as he said this - 'when it rises against me, is 
              not my flesh and blood. I discard it. Has that fellow' - to the 
              man with the wooden leg -'been here again?' </p>
            <p>　　'No,' was the answer. </p>
            <p>　　'No,' said Mr. Creakle. 'He knows better. He knows me. Let him 
              keep away. I say let him keep away,' said Mr. Creakle, striking 
              his hand upon the table, and looking at Mrs. Creakle, 'for he knows 
              me. Now you have begun to know me too, my young friend, and you 
              may go. Take him away.' </p>
            <p>　　I was very glad to be ordered away, for Mrs. and Miss Creakle 
              were both wiping their eyes, and I felt as uncomfortable for them 
              as I did for myself. But I had a petition on my mind which concerned 
              me so nearly, that I couldn't help saying, though I wondered at 
              my own courage: </p>
            <p>　　'If you please, sir -' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Creakle whispered, 'Hah! What's this?' and bent his eyes 
              upon me, as if he would have burnt me up with them. </p>
            <p>　　'If you please, sir,' I faltered, 'if I might be allowed (I am 
              very sorry indeed, sir, for what I did) to take this writing off, 
              before the boys come back -' </p>
            <p>　　Whether Mr. Creakle was in earnest, or whether he only did it 
              to frighten me, I don't know, but he made a burst out of his chair, 
              before which I precipitately retreated, without waiting for the 
              escort Of the man with the wooden leg, and never once stopped until 
              I reached my own bedroom, where, finding I was not pursued, I went 
              to bed, as it was time, and lay quaking, for a couple of hours. 
            </p>
            <p>　　Next morning Mr. Sharp came back. Mr. Sharp was the first master, 
              and superior to Mr. Mell. Mr. Mell took his meals with the boys, 
              but Mr. Sharp dined and supped at Mr. Creakle's table. He was a 
              limp, delicate-looking gentleman, I thought, with a good deal of 
              nose, and a way of carrying his head on one side, as if it were 
              a little too heavy for him. His hair was very smooth and wavy; but 
              I was informed by the very first boy who came back that it was a 
              wig (a second-hand one HE said), and that Mr. Sharp went out every 
              Saturday afternoon to get it curled. </p>
            <p>　　It was no other than Tommy Traddles who gave me this piece of 
              intelligence. He was the first boy who returned. He introduced himself 
              by informing me that I should find his name on the right- hand corner 
              of the gate, over the top-bolt; upon that I said, 'Traddles?' to 
              which he replied, 'The same,' and then he asked me for a full account 
              of myself and family. </p>
            <p>　　It was a happy circumstance for me that Traddles came back first. 
              He enjoyed my placard so much, that he saved me from the embarrassment 
              of either disclosure or concealment, by presenting me to every other 
              boy who came back, great or small, immediately on his arrival, in 
              this form of introduction, 'Look here! Here's a game!' Happily, 
              too, the greater part of the boys came back low-spirited, and were 
              not so boisterous at my expense as I had expected. Some of them 
              certainly did dance about me like wild Indians, and the greater 
              part could not resist the temptation of pretending that I was a 
              dog, and patting and soothing me, lest I should bite, and saying, 
              'Lie down, sir!' and calling me Towzer. This was naturally confusing, 
              among so many strangers, and cost me some tears, but on the whole 
              it was much better than I had anticipated. </p>
            <p>　　I was not considered as being formally received into the school, 
              however, until J. Steerforth arrived. Before this boy, who was reputed 
              to be a great scholar, and was very good-looking, and at least half-a-dozen 
              years my senior, I was carried as before a magistrate. He inquired, 
              under a shed in the playground, into the particulars of my punishment, 
              and was pleased to express his opinion that it was 'a jolly shame'; 
              for which I became bound to him ever afterwards. </p>
            <p>　　'What money have you got, Copperfield?' he said, walking aside 
              with me when he had disposed of my affair in these terms. I told 
              him seven shillings. </p>
            <p>　　'You had better give it to me to take care of,' he said. 'At 
              least, you can if you like. You needn't if you don't like.' </p>
            <p>　　I hastened to comply with his friendly suggestion, and opening 
              Peggotty's purse, turned it upside down into his hand. </p>
            <p>　　'Do you want to spend anything now?' he asked me. </p>
            <p>　　'No thank you,' I replied. </p>
            <p>　　'You can, if you like, you know,' said Steerforth. 'Say the word.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'No, thank you, sir,' I repeated. </p>
            <p>　　'Perhaps you'd like to spend a couple of shillings or so, in 
              a bottle of currant wine by and by, up in the bedroom?' said Steerforth. 
              'You belong to my bedroom, I find.' </p>
            <p>　　It certainly had not occurred to me before, but I said, Yes, 
              I should like that. </p>
            <p>　　'Very good,' said Steerforth. 'You'll be glad to spend another 
              shilling or so, in almond cakes, I dare say?' </p>
            <p>　　I said, Yes, I should like that, too. </p>
            <p>　　'And another shilling or so in biscuits, and another in fruit, 
              eh?' said Steerforth. 'I say, young Copperfield, you're going it!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　I smiled because he smiled, but I was a little troubled in my 
              mind, too. </p>
            <p>　　'Well!' said Steerforth. 'We must make it stretch as far as we 
              can; that's all. I'll do the best in my power for you. I can go 
              out when I like, and I'll smuggle the prog in.' With these words 
              he put the money in his pocket, and kindly told me not to make myself 
              uneasy; he would take care it should be all right. He was as good 
              as his word, if that were all right which I had a secret misgiving 
              was nearly all wrong - for I feared it was a waste of my mother's 
              two half-crowns - though I had preserved the piece of paper they 
              were wrapped in: which was a precious saving. When we went upstairs 
              to bed, he produced the whole seven shillings'worth, and laid it 
              out on my bed in the moonlight, saying: </p>
            <p>　　'There you are, young Copperfield, and a royal spread you've 
              got.' </p>
            <p>　　I couldn't think of doing the honours of the feast, at my time 
              of life, while he was by; my hand shook at the very thought of it. 
              I begged him to do me the favour of presiding; and my request being 
              seconded by the other boys who were in that room, he acceded to 
              it, and sat upon my pillow, handing round the viands - with perfect 
              fairness, I must say - and dispensing the currant wine in a little 
              glass without a foot, which was his own property. As to me, I sat 
              on his left hand, and the rest were grouped about us, on the nearest 
              beds and on the floor. </p>
            <p>　　How well I recollect our sitting there, talking in whispers; 
              or their talking, and my respectfully listening, I ought rather 
              to say; the moonlight falling a little way into the room, through 
              the window, painting a pale window on the floor, and the greater 
              part of us in shadow, except when Steerforth dipped a match into 
              a phosphorus-box, when he wanted to look for anything on the board, 
              and shed a blue glare over us that was gone directly! A certain 
              mysterious feeling, consequent on the darkness, the secrecy of the 
              revel, and the whisper in which everything was said, steals over 
              me again, and I listen to all they tell me with a vague feeling 
              of solemnity and awe, which makes me glad that they are all so near, 
              and frightens me (though I feign to laugh) when Traddles pretends 
              to see a ghost in the corner. </p>
            <p>　　I heard all kinds of things about the school and all belonging 
              to it. I heard that Mr. Creakle had not preferred his claim to being 
              a Tartar without reason; that he was the sternest and most severe 
              of masters; that he laid about him, right and left, every day of 
              his life, charging in among the boys like a trooper, and slashing 
              away, unmercifully. That he knew nothing himself, but the art of 
              slashing, being more ignorant (J. Steerforth said) than the lowest 
              boy in the school; that he had been, a good many years ago, a small 
              hop-dealer in the Borough, and had taken to the schooling business 
              after being bankrupt in hops, and making away with Mrs. Creakle's 
              money. With a good deal more of that sort, which I wondered how 
              they knew. </p>
            <p>　　I heard that the man with the wooden leg, whose name was Tungay, 
              was an obstinate barbarian who had formerly assisted in the hop 
              business, but had come into the scholastic line with Mr. Creakle, 
              in consequence, as was supposed among the boys, of his having broken 
              his leg in Mr. Creakle's service, and having done a deal of dishonest 
              work for him, and knowing his secrets. I heard that with the single 
              exception of Mr. Creakle, Tungay considered the whole establishment, 
              masters and boys, as his natural enemies, and that the only delight 
              of his life was to be sour and malicious. I heard that Mr. Creakle 
              had a son, who had not been Tungay's friend, and who, assisting 
              in the school, had once held some remonstrance with his father on 
              an occasion when its discipline was very cruelly exercised, and 
              was supposed, besides, to have protested against his father's usage 
              of his mother. I heard that Mr. Creakle had turned him out of doors, 
              in consequence; and that Mrs. and Miss Creakle had been in a sad 
              way, ever since. </p>
            <p>　　But the greatest wonder that I heard of Mr. Creakle was, there 
              being one boy in the school on whom he never ventured to lay a hand, 
              and that boy being J. Steerforth. Steerforth himself confirmed this 
              when it was stated, and said that he should like to begin to see 
              him do it. On being asked by a mild boy (not me) how he would proceed 
              if he did begin to see him do it, he dipped a match into his phosphorus-box 
              on purpose to shed a glare over his reply, and said he would commence 
              by knocking him down with a blow on the forehead from the seven-and-sixpenny 
              ink-bottle that was always on the mantelpiece. We sat in the dark 
              for some time, breathless. </p>
            <p>　　I heard that Mr. Sharp and Mr. Mell were both supposed to be 
              wretchedly paid; and that when there was hot and cold meat for dinner 
              at Mr. Creakle's table, Mr. Sharp was always expected to say he 
              preferred cold; which was again corroborated by J. Steerforth, the 
              only parlour-boarder. I heard that Mr. Sharp's wig didn't fit him; 
              and that he needn't be so 'bounceable' - somebody else said 'bumptious' 
              - about it, because his own red hair was very plainly to be seen 
              behind. </p>
            <p>　　I heard that one boy, who was a coal-merchant's son, came as 
              a set-off against the coal-bill, and was called, on that account, 
              'Exchange or Barter' - a name selected from the arithmetic book 
              as expressing this arrangement. I heard that the table beer was 
              a robbery of parents, and the pudding an imposition. I heard that 
              Miss Creakle was regarded by the school in general as being in love 
              with Steerforth; and I am sure, as I sat in the dark, thinking of 
              his nice voice, and his fine face, and his easy manner, and his 
              curling hair, I thought it very likely. I heard that Mr. Mell was 
              not a bad sort of fellow, but hadn't a sixpence to bless himself 
              with; and that there was no doubt that old Mrs. Mell, his mother, 
              was as poor as job. I thought of my breakfast then, and what had 
              sounded like 'My Charley!' but I was, I am glad to remember, as 
              mute as a mouse about it. </p>
            <p>　　The hearing of all this, and a good deal more, outlasted the 
              banquet some time. The greater part of the guests had gone to bed 
              as soon as the eating and drinking were over; and we, who had remained 
              whispering and listening half-undressed, at last betook ourselves 
              to bed, too. 'Good night, young Copperfield,' said Steerforth. 'I'll 
              take care of you.' 'You're very kind,' I gratefully returned. 'I 
              am very much obliged to you.' </p>
            <p>　　'You haven't got a sister, have you?' said Steerforth, yawning. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'No,' I answered. 'That's a pity,' said Steerforth. 'If you had 
              had one, I should think she would have been a pretty, timid, little, 
              bright-eyed sort of girl. I should have liked to know her. Good 
              night, young Copperfield.' </p>
            <p>　　'Good night, sir,' I replied. </p>
            <p>　　I thought of him very much after I went to bed, and raised myself, 
              I recollect, to look at him where he lay in the moonlight, with 
              his handsome face turned up, and his head reclining easily on his 
              arm. He was a person of great power in my eyes; that was, of course, 
              the reason of my mind running on him. No veiled future dimly glanced 
              upon him in the moonbeams. There was no shadowy picture of his footsteps, 
              in the garden that I dreamed of walking in all night. </p>

            <p>　　 My school-days! The silent gliding on of my existence - the 
              unseen, unfelt progress of my life - from childhood up to youth! 
              Let me think, as I look back upon that flowing water, now a dry 
              channel overgrown with leaves, whether there are any marks along 
              its course, by which I can remember how it ran. </p>
            <p>　　A moment, and I occupy my place in the Cathedral, where we all 
              went together, every Sunday morning, assembling first at school 
              for that purpose. The earthy smell, the sunless air, the sensation 
              of the world being shut out, the resounding of the organ through 
              the black and white arched galleries and aisles, are wings that 
              take me back, and hold me hovering above those days, in a half-sleeping 
              and half-waking dream. </p>
            <p>　　I am not the last boy in the school. I have risen in a few months, 
              over several heads. But the first boy seems to me a mighty creature, 
              dwelling afar off, whose giddy height is unattainable. Agnes says 
              'No,' but I say 'Yes,' and tell her that she little thinks what 
              stores of knowledge have been mastered by the wonderful Being, at 
              whose place she thinks I, even I, weak aspirant, may arrive in time. 
              He is not my private friend and public patron, as Steerforth was, 
              but I hold him in a reverential respect. I chiefly wonder what he'll 
              be, when he leaves Doctor Strong's, and what mankind will do to 
              maintain any place against him. </p>
            <p>　　But who is this that breaks upon me? This is Miss Shepherd, whom 
              I love. </p>
            <p>　　Miss Shepherd is a boarder at the Misses Nettingalls' establishment. 
              I adore Miss Shepherd. She is a little girl, in a spencer, with 
              a round face and curly flaxen hair. The Misses Nettingalls' young 
              ladies come to the Cathedral too. I cannot look upon my book, for 
              I must look upon Miss Shepherd. When the choristers chaunt, I hear 
              Miss Shepherd. In the service I mentally insert Miss Shepherd's 
              name - I put her in among the Royal Family. At home, in my own room, 
              I am sometimes moved to cry out, 'Oh, Miss Shepherd!' in a transport 
              of love. </p>
            <p>　　For some time, I am doubtful of Miss Shepherd's feelings, but, 
              at length, Fate being propitious, we meet at the dancing-school. 
              I have Miss Shepherd for my partner. I touch Miss Shepherd's glove, 
              and feel a thrill go up the right arm of my jacket, and come out 
              at my hair. I say nothing to Miss Shepherd, but we understand each 
              other. Miss Shepherd and myself live but to be united. </p>
            <p>　　Why do I secretly give Miss Shepherd twelve Brazil nuts for a 
              present, I wonder? They are not expressive of affection, they are 
              difficult to pack into a parcel of any regular shape, they are hard 
              to crack, even in room doors, and they are oily when cracked; yet 
              I feel that they are appropriate to Miss Shepherd. Soft, seedy biscuits, 
              also, I bestow upon Miss Shepherd; and oranges innumerable. Once, 
              I kiss Miss Shepherd in the cloak-room. Ecstasy! What are my agony 
              and indignation next day, when I hear a flying rumour that the Misses 
              Nettingall have stood Miss Shepherd in the stocks for turning in 
              her toes! </p>
            <p>　　Miss Shepherd being the one pervading theme and vision of my 
              life, how do I ever come to break with her? I can't conceive. And 
              yet a coolness grows between Miss Shepherd and myself. Whispers 
              reach me of Miss Shepherd having said she wished I wouldn't stare 
              so, and having avowed a preference for Master Jones - for Jones! 
              a boy of no merit whatever! The gulf between me and Miss Shepherd 
              widens. At last, one day, I meet the Misses Nettingalls' establishment 
              out walking. Miss Shepherd makes a face as she goes by, and laughs 
              to her companion. All is over. The devotion of a life - it seems 
              a life, it is all the same - is at an end; Miss Shepherd comes out 
              of the morning service, and the Royal Family know her no more. </p>
            <p>　　I am higher in the school, and no one breaks my peace. I am not 
              at all polite, now, to the Misses Nettingalls' young ladies, and 
              shouldn't dote on any of them, if they were twice as many and twenty 
              times as beautiful. I think the dancing-school a tiresome affair, 
              and wonder why the girls can't dance by themselves and leave us 
              alone. I am growing great in Latin verses, and neglect the laces 
              of my boots. Doctor Strong refers to me in public as a promising 
              young scholar. Mr. Dick is wild with joy, and my aunt remits me 
              a guinea by the next post. </p>
            <p>　　The shade of a young butcher rises, like the apparition of an 
              armed head in Macbeth. Who is this young butcher? He is the terror 
              of the youth of Canterbury. There is a vague belief abroad, that 
              the beef suet with which he anoints his hair gives him unnatural 
              strength, and that he is a match for a man. He is a broad-faced, 
              bull-necked, young butcher, with rough red cheeks, an ill-conditioned 
              mind, and an injurious tongue. His main use of this tongue, is, 
              to disparage Doctor Strong's young gentlemen. He says, publicly, 
              that if they want anything he'll give it 'em. He names individuals 
              among them (myself included), whom he could undertake to settle 
              with one hand, and the other tied behind him. He waylays the smaller 
              boys to punch their unprotected heads, and calls challenges after 
              me in the open streets. For these sufficient reasons I resolve to 
              fight the butcher. </p>
            <p>　　It is a summer evening, down in a green hollow, at the corner 
              of a wall. I meet the butcher by appointment. I am attended by a 
              select body of our boys; the butcher, by two other butchers, a young 
              publican, and a sweep. The preliminaries are adjusted, and the butcher 
              and myself stand face to face. In a moment the butcher lights ten 
              thousand candles out of my left eyebrow. In another moment, I don't 
              know where the wall is, or where I am, or where anybody is. I hardly 
              know which is myself and which the butcher, we are always in such 
              a tangle and tussle, knocking about upon the trodden grass. Sometimes 
              I see the butcher, bloody but confident; sometimes I see nothing, 
              and sit gasping on my second's knee; sometimes I go in at the butcher 
              madly, and cut my knuckles open against his face, without appearing 
              to discompose him at all. At last I awake, very queer about the 
              head, as from a giddy sleep, and see the butcher walking off, congratulated 
              by the two other butchers and the sweep and publican, and putting 
              on his coat as he goes; from which I augur, justly, that the victory 
              is his. </p>
            <p>　　I am taken home in a sad plight, and I have beef-steaks put to 
              my eyes, and am rubbed with vinegar and brandy, and find a great 
              puffy place bursting out on my upper lip, which swells immoderately. 
              For three or four days I remain at home, a very ill-looking subject, 
              with a green shade over my eyes; and I should be very dull, but 
              that Agnes is a sister to me, and condoles with me, and reads to 
              me, and makes the time light and happy. Agnes has my confidence 
              completely, always; I tell her all about the butcher, and the wrongs 
              he has heaped upon me; she thinks I couldn't have done otherwise 
              than fight the butcher, while she shrinks and trembles at my having 
              fought him. </p>
            <p>　　Time has stolen on unobserved, for Adams is not the head-boy 
              in the days that are come now, nor has he been this many and many 
              a day. Adams has left the school so long, that when he comes back, 
              on a visit to Doctor Strong, there are not many there, besides myself, 
              who know him. Adams is going to be called to the bar almost directly, 
              and is to be an advocate, and to wear a wig. I am surprised to find 
              him a meeker man than I had thought, and less imposing in appearance. 
              He has not staggered the world yet, either; for it goes on (as well 
              as I can make out) pretty much the same as if he had never joined 
              it. </p>
            <p>　　A blank, through which the warriors of poetry and history march 
              on in stately hosts that seem to have no end - and what comes next! 
              I am the head-boy, now! I look down on the line of boys below me, 
              with a condescending interest in such of them as bring to my mind 
              the boy I was myself, when I first came there. That little fellow 
              seems to be no part of me; I remember him as something left behind 
              upon the road of life - as something I have passed, rather than 
              have actually been - and almost think of him as of someone else. 
            </p>
            <p>　　And the little girl I saw on that first day at Mr. Wickfield's, 
              where is she? Gone also. In her stead, the perfect likeness of the 
              picture, a child likeness no more, moves about the house; and Agnes 
              - my sweet sister, as I call her in my thoughts, my counsellor and 
              friend, the better angel of the lives of all who come within her 
              calm, good, self-denying influence - is quite a woman. </p>
            <p>　　What other changes have come upon me, besides the changes in 
              my growth and looks, and in the knowledge I have garnered all this 
              while? I wear a gold watch and chain, a ring upon my little finger, 
              and a long-tailed coat; and I use a great deal of bear's grease 
              - which, taken in conjunction with the ring, looks bad. Am I in 
              love again? I am. I worship the eldest Miss Larkins. </p>
            <p>　　The eldest Miss Larkins is not a little girl. She is a tall, 
              dark, black-eyed, fine figure of a woman. The eldest Miss Larkins 
              is not a chicken; for the youngest Miss Larkins is not that, and 
              the eldest must be three or four years older. Perhaps the eldest 
              Miss Larkins may be about thirty. My passion for her is beyond all 
              bounds. </p>
            <p>　　The eldest Miss Larkins knows officers. It is an awful thing 
              to bear. I see them speaking to her in the street. I see them cross 
              the way to meet her, when her bonnet (she has a bright taste in 
              bonnets) is seen coming down the pavement, accompanied by her sister's 
              bonnet. She laughs and talks, and seems to like it. I spend a good 
              deal of my own spare time in walking up and down to meet her. If 
              I can bow to her once in the day (I know her to bow to, knowing 
              Mr. Larkins), I am happier. I deserve a bow now and then. The raging 
              agonies I suffer on the night of the Race Ball, where I know the 
              eldest Miss Larkins will be dancing with the military, ought to 
              have some compensation, if there be even-handed justice in the world. 
            </p>
            <p>　　My passion takes away my appetite, and makes me wear my newest 
              silk neckerchief continually. I have no relief but in putting on 
              my best clothes, and having my boots cleaned over and over again. 
              I seem, then, to be worthier of the eldest Miss Larkins. Everything 
              that belongs to her, or is connected with her, is precious to me. 
              Mr. Larkins (a gruff old gentleman with a double chin, and one of 
              his eyes immovable in his head) is fraught with interest to me. 
              When I can't meet his daughter, I go where I am likely to meet him. 
              To say 'How do you do, Mr. Larkins? Are the young ladies and all 
              the family quite well?' seems so pointed, that I blush. </p>
            <p>　　I think continually about my age. Say I am seventeen, and say 
              that seventeen is young for the eldest Miss Larkins, what of that? 
              Besides, I shall be one-and-twenty in no time almost. I regularly 
              take walks outside Mr. Larkins's house in the evening, though it 
              cuts me to the heart to see the officers go in, or to hear them 
              up in the drawing-room, where the eldest Miss Larkins plays the 
              harp. I even walk, on two or three occasions, in a sickly, spoony 
              manner, round and round the house after the family are gone to bed, 
              wondering which is the eldest Miss Larkins's chamber (and pitching, 
              I dare say now, on Mr. Larkins's instead); wishing that a fire would 
              burst out; that the assembled crowd would stand appalled; that I, 
              dashing through them with a ladder, might rear it against her window, 
              save her in my arms, go back for something she had left behind, 
              and perish in the flames. For I am generally disinterested in my 
              love, and think I could be content to make a figure before Miss 
              Larkins, and expire. </p>
            <p>　　Generally, but not always. Sometimes brighter visions rise before 
              me. When I dress (the occupation of two hours), for a great ball 
              given at the Larkins's (the anticipation of three weeks), I indulge 
              my fancy with pleasing images. I picture myself taking courage to 
              make a declaration to Miss Larkins. I picture Miss Larkins sinking 
              her head upon my shoulder, and saying, 'Oh, Mr. Copperfield, can 
              I believe my ears!' I picture Mr. Larkins waiting on me next morning, 
              and saying, 'My dear Copperfield, my daughter has told me all. Youth 
              is no objection. Here are twenty thousand pounds. Be happy!' I picture 
              my aunt relenting, and blessing us; and Mr. Dick and Doctor Strong 
              being present at the marriage ceremony. I am a sensible fellow, 
              I believe - I believe, on looking back, I mean - and modest I am 
              sure; but all this goes on notwithstanding. I repair to the enchanted 
              house, where there are lights, chattering, music, flowers, officers 
              (I am sorry to see), and the eldest Miss Larkins, a blaze of beauty. 
              She is dressed in blue, with blue flowers in her hair - forget-me-nots 
              - as if SHE had any need to wear forget-me-nots. It is the first 
              really grown-up party that I have ever been invited to, and I am 
              a little uncomfortable; for I appear not to belong to anybody, and 
              nobody appears to have anything to say to me, except Mr. Larkins, 
              who asks me how my schoolfellows are, which he needn't do, as I 
              have not come there to be insulted. </p>
            <p>　　But after I have stood in the doorway for some time, and feasted 
              my eyes upon the goddess of my heart, she approaches me - she, the 
              eldest Miss Larkins! - and asks me pleasantly, if I dance? </p>
            <p>　　I stammer, with a bow, 'With you, Miss Larkins.' </p>
            <p>　　'With no one else?' inquires Miss Larkins. </p>
            <p>　　'I should have no pleasure in dancing with anyone else.' </p>
            <p>　　Miss Larkins laughs and blushes (or I think she blushes), and 
              says, 'Next time but one, I shall be very glad.' </p>
            <p>　　The time arrives. 'It is a waltz, I think,' Miss Larkins doubtfully 
              observes, when I present myself. 'Do you waltz? If not, Captain 
              Bailey -' </p>
            <p>　　But I do waltz (pretty well, too, as it happens), and I take 
              Miss Larkins out. I take her sternly from the side of Captain Bailey. 
              He is wretched, I have no doubt; but he is nothing to me. I have 
              been wretched, too. I waltz with the eldest Miss Larkins! I don't 
              know where, among whom, or how long. I only know that I swim about 
              in space, with a blue angel, in a state of blissful delirium, until 
              I find myself alone with her in a little room, resting on a sofa. 
              She admires a flower (pink camellia japonica, price half-a-crown), 
              in my button-hole. I give it her, and say: </p>
            <p>　　'I ask an inestimable price for it, Miss Larkins.' </p>
            <p>　　'Indeed! What is that?' returns Miss Larkins. </p>
            <p>　　'A flower of yours, that I may treasure it as a miser does gold.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'You're a bold boy,' says Miss Larkins. 'There.' </p>
            <p>　　She gives it me, not displeased; and I put it to my lips, and 
              then into my breast. Miss Larkins, laughing, draws her hand through 
              my arm, and says, 'Now take me back to Captain Bailey.' </p>
            <p>　　I am lost in the recollection of this delicious interview, and 
              the waltz, when she comes to me again, with a plain elderly gentleman 
              who has been playing whist all night, upon her arm, and says: </p>
            <p>　　'Oh! here is my bold friend! Mr. Chestle wants to know you, Mr. 
              Copperfield.' </p>
            <p>　　I feel at once that he is a friend of the family, and am much 
              gratified. </p>
            <p>　　'I admire your taste, sir,' says Mr. Chestle. 'It does you credit. 
              I suppose you don't take much interest in hops; but I am a pretty 
              large grower myself; and if you ever like to come over to our neighbourhood 
              - neighbourhood of Ashford - and take a run about our place, -we 
              shall be glad for you to stop as long as you like.' </p>
            <p>　　I thank Mr. Chestle warmly, and shake hands. I think I am in 
              a happy dream. I waltz with the eldest Miss Larkins once again. 
              She says I waltz so well! I go home in a state of unspeakable bliss, 
              and waltz in imagination, all night long, with my arm round the 
              blue waist of my dear divinity. For some days afterwards, I am lost 
              in rapturous reflections; but I neither see her in the street, nor 
              when I call. I am imperfectly consoled for this disappointment by 
              the sacred pledge, the perished flower. </p>
            <p>　　'Trotwood,' says Agnes, one day after dinner. 'Who do you think 
              is going to be married tomorrow? Someone you admire.' </p>
            <p>　　'Not you, I suppose, Agnes?' </p>
            <p>　　'Not me!' raising her cheerful face from the music she is copying. 
              'Do you hear him, Papa? - The eldest Miss Larkins.' </p>
            <p>　　'To - to Captain Bailey?' I have just enough power to ask. </p>
            <p>　　'No; to no Captain. To Mr. Chestle, a hop-grower.' </p>
            <p>　　I am terribly dejected for about a week or two. I take off my 
              ring, I wear my worst clothes, I use no bear's grease, and I frequently 
              lament over the late Miss Larkins's faded flower. Being, by that 
              time, rather tired of this kind of life, and having received new 
              provocation from the butcher, I throw the flower away, go out with 
              the butcher, and gloriously defeat him. </p>
            <p>　　This, and the resumption of my ring, as well as of the bear's 
              grease in moderation, are the last marks I can discern, now, in 
              my progress to seventeen. </p>

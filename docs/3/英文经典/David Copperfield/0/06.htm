            <p>　　 We might have gone about half a mile, and my pocket-handkerchief 
              was quite wet through, when the carrier stopped short. Looking out 
              to ascertain for what, I saw, to MY amazement, Peggotty burst from 
              a hedge and climb into the cart. She took me in both her arms, and 
              squeezed me to her stays until the pressure on my nose was extremely 
              painful, though I never thought of that till afterwards when I found 
              it very tender. Not a single word did Peggotty speak. Releasing 
              one of her arms, she put it down in her pocket to the elbow, and 
              brought out some paper bags of cakes which she crammed into my pockets, 
              and a purse which she put into my hand, but not one word did she 
              say. After another and a final squeeze with both arms, she got down 
              from the cart and ran away; and, my belief is, and has always been, 
              without a solitary button on her gown. I picked up one, of several 
              that were rolling about, and treasured it as a keepsake for a long 
              time. </p>
            <p>　　The carrier looked at me, as if to inquire if she were coming 
              back. I shook my head, and said I thought not. 'Then come up,' said 
              the carrier to the lazy horse; who came up accordingly. </p>
            <p>　　Having by this time cried as much as I possibly could, I began 
              to think it was of no use crying any more, especially as neither 
              Roderick Random, nor that Captain in the Royal British Navy, had 
              ever cried, that I could remember, in trying situations. The carrier, 
              seeing me in this resolution, proposed that my pocket- handkerchief 
              should be spread upon the horse's back to dry. I thanked him, and 
              assented; and particularly small it looked, under those circumstances. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I had now leisure to examine the purse. It was a stiff leather 
              purse, with a snap, and had three bright shillings in it, which 
              Peggotty had evidently polished up with whitening, for my greater 
              delight. But its most precious contents were two half-crowns folded 
              together in a bit of paper, on which was written, in my mother's 
              hand, 'For Davy. With my love.' I was so overcome by this, that 
              I asked the carrier to be so good as to reach me my pocket-handkerchief 
              again; but he said he thought I had better do without it, and I 
              thought I really had, so I wiped my eyes on my sleeve and stopped 
              myself. </p>
            <p>　　For good, too; though, in consequence of my previous emotions, 
              I was still occasionally seized with a stormy sob. After we had 
              jogged on for some little time, I asked the carrier if he was going 
              all the way. </p>
            <p>　　'All the way where?' inquired the carrier. </p>
            <p>　　'There,' I said. </p>
            <p>　　'Where's there?' inquired the carrier. </p>
            <p>　　'Near London,' I said. </p>
            <p>　　'Why that horse,' said the carrier, jerking the rein to point 
              him out, 'would be deader than pork afore he got over half the ground.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Are you only going to Yarmouth then?' I asked. </p>
            <p>　　'That's about it,' said the carrier. 'And there I shall take 
              you to the stage-cutch, and the stage-cutch that'll take you to 
              - wherever it is.' </p>
            <p>　　As this was a great deal for the carrier (whose name was Mr. 
              Barkis) to say - he being, as I observed in a former chapter, of 
              a phlegmatic temperament, and not at all conversational - I offered 
              him a cake as a mark of attention, which he ate at one gulp, exactly 
              like an elephant, and which made no more impression on his big face 
              than it would have done on an elephant's. </p>
            <p>　　'Did SHE make 'em, now?' said Mr. Barkis, always leaning forward, 
              in his slouching way, on the footboard of the cart with an arm on 
              each knee. </p>
            <p>　　'Peggotty, do you mean, sir?' </p>
            <p>　　'Ah!' said Mr. Barkis. 'Her.' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes. She makes all our pastry, and does all our cooking.' </p>
            <p>　　'Do she though?' said Mr. Barkis. He made up his mouth as if 
              to whistle, but he didn't whistle. He sat looking at the horse's 
              ears, as if he saw something new there; and sat so, for a considerable 
              time. By and by, he said: </p>
            <p>　　'No sweethearts, I b'lieve?' </p>
            <p>　　'Sweetmeats did you say, Mr. Barkis?' For I thought he wanted 
              something else to eat, and had pointedly alluded to that description 
              of refreshment. </p>
            <p>　　'Hearts,' said Mr. Barkis. 'Sweet hearts; no person walks with 
              her!' </p>
            <p>　　'With Peggotty?' </p>
            <p>　　'Ah!' he said. 'Her.' </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, no. She never had a sweetheart.' </p>
            <p>　　'Didn't she, though!' said Mr. Barkis. </p>
            <p>　　Again he made up his mouth to whistle, and again he didn't whistle, 
              but sat looking at the horse's ears. </p>
            <p>　　'So she makes,' said Mr. Barkis, after a long interval of reflection, 
              'all the apple parsties, and doos all the cooking, do she?' </p>
            <p>　　I replied that such was the fact. </p>
            <p>　　'Well. I'll tell you what,' said Mr. Barkis. 'P'raps you might 
              be writin' to her?' </p>
            <p>　　'I shall certainly write to her,' I rejoined. </p>
            <p>　　'Ah!' he said, slowly turning his eyes towards me. 'Well! If 
              you was writin' to her, p'raps you'd recollect to say that Barkis 
              was willin'; would you?' </p>
            <p>　　'That Barkis is willing,' I repeated, innocently. 'Is that all 
              the message?' </p>
            <p>　　'Ye-es,' he said, considering. 'Ye-es. Barkis is willin'.' </p>
            <p>　　'But you will be at Blunderstone again tomorrow, Mr. Barkis,' 
              I said, faltering a little at the idea of my being far away from 
              it then, and could give your own message so much better.' </p>
            <p>　　As he repudiated this suggestion, however, with a jerk of his 
              head, and once more confirmed his previous request by saying, with 
              profound gravity, 'Barkis is willin'. That's the message,' I readily 
              undertook its transmission. While I was waiting for the coach in 
              the hotel at Yarmouth that very afternoon, I procured a sheet of 
              paper and an inkstand, and wrote a note to Peggotty, which ran thus: 
              'My dear Peggotty. I have come here safe. Barkis is willing. My 
              love to mama. Yours affectionately. P.S. He says he particularly 
              wants you to know - BARKIS IS WILLING.' </p>
            <p>　　When I had taken this commission on myself prospectively, Mr. 
              Barkis relapsed into perfect silence; and I, feeling quite worn 
              out by all that had happened lately, lay down on a sack in the cart 
              and fell asleep. I slept soundly until we got to Yarmouth; which 
              was so entirely new and strange to me in the inn-yard to which we 
              drove, that I at once abandoned a latent hope I had had of meeting 
              with some of Mr. Peggotty's family there, perhaps even with little 
              Em'ly herself. </p>
            <p>　　The coach was in the yard, shining very much all over, but without 
              any horses to it as yet; and it looked in that state as if nothing 
              was more unlikely than its ever going to London. I was thinking 
              this, and wondering what would ultimately become of my box, which 
              Mr. Barkis had put down on the yard-pavement by the pole (he having 
              driven up the yard to turn his cart), and also what would ultimately 
              become of me, when a lady looked out of a bow-window where some 
              fowls and joints of meat were hanging up, and said: </p>
            <p>　　'Is that the little gentleman from Blunderstone?' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, ma'am,' I said. </p>
            <p>　　'What name?' inquired the lady. </p>
            <p>　　'Copperfield, ma'am,' I said. </p>
            <p>　　'That won't do,' returned the lady. 'Nobody's dinner is paid 
              for here, in that name.' </p>
            <p>　　'Is it Murdstone, ma'am?' I said. </p>
            <p>　　'If you're Master Murdstone,' said the lady, 'why do you go and 
              give another name, first?' </p>
            <p>　　I explained to the lady how it was, who than rang a bell, and 
              called out, 'William! show the coffee-room!' upon which a waiter 
              came running out of a kitchen on the opposite side of the yard to 
              show it, and seemed a good deal surprised when he was only to show 
              it to me. </p>
            <p>　　It was a large long room with some large maps in it. I doubt 
              if I could have felt much stranger if the maps had been real foreign 
              countries, and I cast away in the middle of them. I felt it was 
              taking a liberty to sit down, with my cap in my hand, on the corner 
              of the chair nearest the door; and when the waiter laid a cloth 
              on purpose for me, and put a set of castors on it, I think I must 
              have turned red all over with modesty. </p>
            <p>　　He brought me some chops, and vegetables, and took the covers 
              off in such a bouncing manner that I was afraid I must have given 
              him some offence. But he greatly relieved my mind by putting a chair 
              for me at the table, and saying, very affably, 'Now, six-foot! come 
              on!' </p>
            <p>　　I thanked him, and took my seat at the board; but found it extremely 
              difficult to handle my knife and fork with anything like dexterity, 
              or to avoid splashing myself with the gravy, while he was standing 
              opposite, staring so hard, and making me blush in the most dreadful 
              manner every time I caught his eye. After watching me into the second 
              chop, he said: </p>
            <p>　　'There's half a pint of ale for you. Will you have it now?' </p>
            <p>　　I thanked him and said, 'Yes.' Upon which he poured it out of 
              a jug into a large tumbler, and held it up against the light, and 
              made it look beautiful. </p>
            <p>　　'My eye!' he said. 'It seems a good deal, don't it?' </p>
            <p>　　'It does seem a good deal,' I answered with a smile. For it was 
              quite delightful to me, to find him so pleasant. He was a twinkling-eyed, 
              pimple-faced man, with his hair standing upright all over his head; 
              and as he stood with one arm a-kimbo, holding up the glass to the 
              light with the other hand, he looked quite friendly. </p>
            <p>　　'There was a gentleman here, yesterday,' he said - 'a stout gentleman, 
              by the name of Topsawyer - perhaps you know him?' </p>
            <p>　　'No,' I said, 'I don't think -' </p>
            <p>　　'In breeches and gaiters, broad-brimmed hat, grey coat, speckled 
              choker,' said the waiter. </p>
            <p>　　'No,' I said bashfully, 'I haven't the pleasure -' </p>
            <p>　　'He came in here,' said the waiter, looking at the light through 
              the tumbler, 'ordered a glass of this ale - WOULD order it - I told 
              him not - drank it, and fell dead. It was too old for him. It oughtn't 
              to be drawn; that's the fact.' </p>
            <p>　　I was very much shocked to hear of this melancholy accident, 
              and said I thought I had better have some water. </p>
            <p>　　'Why you see,' said the waiter, still looking at the light through 
              the tumbler, with one of his eyes shut up, 'our people don't like 
              things being ordered and left. It offends 'em. But I'll drink it, 
              if you like. I'm used to it, and use is everything. I don't think 
              it'll hurt me, if I throw my head back, and take it off quick. Shall 
              I?' </p>
            <p>　　I replied that he would much oblige me by drinking it, if he 
              thought he could do it safely, but by no means otherwise. When he 
              did throw his head back, and take it off quick, I had a horrible 
              fear, I confess, of seeing him meet the fate of the lamented Mr. 
              Topsawyer, and fall lifeless on the carpet. But it didn't hurt him. 
              On the contrary, I thought he seemed the fresher for it. </p>
            <p>　　'What have we got here?' he said, putting a fork into my dish. 
              'Not chops?' </p>
            <p>　　'Chops,' I said. </p>
            <p>　　'Lord bless my soul!' he exclaimed, 'I didn't know they were 
              chops. Why, a chop's the very thing to take off the bad effects 
              of that beer! Ain't it lucky?' </p>
            <p>　　So he took a chop by the bone in one hand, and a potato in the 
              other, and ate away with a very good appetite, to my extreme satisfaction. 
              He afterwards took another chop, and another potato; and after that, 
              another chop and another potato. When we had done, he brought me 
              a pudding, and having set it before me, seemed to ruminate, and 
              to become absent in his mind for some moments. </p>
            <p>　　'How's the pie?' he said, rousing himself. </p>
            <p>　　'It's a pudding,' I made answer. </p>
            <p>　　'Pudding!' he exclaimed. 'Why, bless me, so it is! What!' looking 
              at it nearer. 'You don't mean to say it's a batter-pudding!' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, it is indeed.' </p>
            <p>　　'Why, a batter-pudding,' he said, taking up a table-spoon, 'is 
              my favourite pudding! Ain't that lucky? Come on, little 'un, and 
              let's see who'll get most.' </p>
            <p>　　The waiter certainly got most. He entreated me more than once 
              to come in and win, but what with his table-spoon to my tea-spoon, 
              his dispatch to my dispatch, and his appetite to my appetite, I 
              was left far behind at the first mouthful, and had no chance with 
              him. I never saw anyone enjoy a pudding so much, I think; and he 
              laughed, when it was all gone, as if his enjoyment of it lasted 
              still. </p>
            <p>　　Finding him so very friendly and companionable, it was then that 
              I asked for the pen and ink and paper, to write to Peggotty. He 
              not only brought it immediately, but was good enough to look over 
              me while I wrote the letter. When I had finished it, he asked me 
              where I was going to school. </p>
            <p>　　I said, 'Near London,' which was all I knew. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh! my eye!' he said, looking very low-spirited, 'I am sorry 
              for that.' </p>
            <p>　　'Why?' I asked him. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, Lord!' he said, shaking his head, 'that's the school where 
              they broke the boy's ribs - two ribs - a little boy he was. I should 
              say he was - let me see - how old are you, about?' </p>
            <p>　　I told him between eight and nine. </p>
            <p>　　'That's just his age,' he said. 'He was eight years and six months 
              old when they broke his first rib; eight years and eight months 
              old when they broke his second, and did for him.' </p>
            <p>　　I could not disguise from myself, or from the waiter, that this 
              was an uncomfortable coincidence, and inquired how it was done. 
              His answer was not cheering to my spirits, for it consisted of two 
              dismal words, 'With whopping.' </p>
            <p>　　The blowing of the coach-horn in the yard was a seasonable diversion, 
              which made me get up and hesitatingly inquire, in the mingled pride 
              and diffidence of having a purse (which I took out of my pocket), 
              if there were anything to pay. </p>
            <p>　　'There's a sheet of letter-paper,' he returned. 'Did you ever 
              buy a sheet of letter-paper?' </p>
            <p>　　I could not remember that I ever had. </p>
            <p>　　'It's dear,' he said, 'on account of the duty. Threepence. That's 
              the way we're taxed in this country. There's nothing else, except 
              the waiter. Never mind the ink. I lose by that.' </p>
            <p>　　'What should you - what should I - how much ought I to - what 
              would it be right to pay the waiter, if you please?' I stammered, 
              blushing. </p>
            <p>　　'If I hadn't a family, and that family hadn't the cowpock,' said 
              the waiter, 'I wouldn't take a sixpence. If I didn't support a aged 
              pairint, and a lovely sister,' - here the waiter was greatly agitated 
              - 'I wouldn't take a farthing. If I had a good place, and was treated 
              well here, I should beg acceptance of a trifle, instead of taking 
              of it. But I live on broken wittles - and I sleep on the coals' 
              - here the waiter burst into tears. </p>
            <p>　　I was very much concerned for his misfortunes, and felt that 
              any recognition short of ninepence would be mere brutality and hardness 
              of heart. Therefore I gave him one of my three bright shillings, 
              which he received with much humility and veneration, and spun up 
              with his thumb, directly afterwards, to try the goodness of. </p>
            <p>　　It was a little disconcerting to me, to find, when I was being 
              helped up behind the coach, that I was supposed to have eaten all 
              the dinner without any assistance. I discovered this, from overhearing 
              the lady in the bow-window say to the guard, 'Take care of that 
              child, George, or he'll burst!' and from observing that the women-servants 
              who were about the place came out to look and giggle at me as a 
              young phenomenon. My unfortunate friend the waiter, who had quite 
              recovered his spirits, did not appear to be disturbed by this, but 
              joined in the general admiration without being at all confused. 
              If I had any doubt of him, I suppose this half awakened it; but 
              I am inclined to believe that with the simple confidence of a child, 
              and the natural reliance of a child upon superior years (qualities 
              I am very sorry any children should prematurely change for worldly 
              wisdom), I had no serious mistrust of him on the whole, even then. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I felt it rather hard, I must own, to be made, without deserving 
              it, the subject of jokes between the coachman and guard as to the 
              coach drawing heavy behind, on account of my sitting there, and 
              as to the greater expediency of my travelling by waggon. The story 
              of my supposed appetite getting wind among the outside passengers, 
              they were merry upon it likewise; and asked me whether I was going 
              to be paid for, at school, as two brothers or three, and whether 
              I was contracted for, or went upon the regular terms; with other 
              pleasant questions. But the worst of it was, that I knew I should 
              be ashamed to eat anything, when an opportunity offered, and that, 
              after a rather light dinner, I should remain hungry all night - 
              for I had left my cakes behind, at the hotel, in my hurry. My apprehensions 
              were realized. When we stopped for supper I couldn't muster courage 
              to take any, though I should have liked it very much, but sat by 
              the fire and said I didn't want anything. This did not save me from 
              more jokes, either; for a husky-voiced gentleman with a rough face, 
              who had been eating out of a sandwich-box nearly all the way, except 
              when he had been drinking out of a bottle, said I was like a boa-constrictor 
              who took enough at one meal to last him a long time; after which, 
              he actually brought a rash out upon himself with boiled beef. </p>

              IT </b> </div>
            <p>　　 I know enough of the world now, to have almost lost the capacity 
              of being much surprised by anything; but it is matter of some surprise 
              to me, even now, that I can have been so easily thrown away at such 
              an age. A child of excellent abilities, and with strong powers of 
              observation, quick, eager, delicate, and soon hurt bodily or mentally, 
              it seems wonderful to me that nobody should have made any sign in 
              my behalf. But none was made; and I became, at ten years old, a 
              little labouring hind in the service of Murdstone and Grinby. </p>
            <p>　　Murdstone and Grinby's warehouse was at the waterside. It was 
              down in Blackfriars. Modern improvements have altered the place; 
              but it was the last house at the bottom of a narrow street, curving 
              down hill to the river, with some stairs at the end, where people 
              took boat. It was a crazy old house with a wharf of its own, abutting 
              on the water when the tide was in, and on the mud when the tide 
              was out, and literally overrun with rats. Its panelled rooms, discoloured 
              with the dirt and smoke of a hundred years, I dare say; its decaying 
              floors and staircase; the squeaking and scuffling of the old grey 
              rats down in the cellars; and the dirt and rottenness of the place; 
              are things, not of many years ago, in my mind, but of the present 
              instant. They are all before me, just as they were in the evil hour 
              when I went among them for the first time, with my trembling hand 
              in Mr. Quinion's. </p>
            <p>　　Murdstone and Grinby's trade was among a good many kinds of people, 
              but an important branch of it was the supply of wines and spirits 
              to certain packet ships. I forget now where they chiefly went, but 
              I think there were some among them that made voyages both to the 
              East and West Indies. I know that a great many empty bottles were 
              one of the consequences of this traffic, and that certain men and 
              boys were employed to examine them against the light, and reject 
              those that were flawed, and to rinse and wash them. When the empty 
              bottles ran short, there were labels to be pasted on full ones, 
              or corks to be fitted to them, or seals to be put upon the corks, 
              or finished bottles to be packed in casks. All this work was my 
              work, and of the boys employed upon it I was one. </p>
            <p>　　There were three or four of us, counting me. My working place 
              was established in a corner of the warehouse, where Mr. Quinion 
              could see me, when he chose to stand up on the bottom rail of his 
              stool in the counting-house, and look at me through a window above 
              the desk. Hither, on the first morning of my so auspiciously beginning 
              life on my own account, the oldest of the regular boys was summoned 
              to show me my business. His name was Mick Walker, and he wore a 
              ragged apron and a paper cap. He informed me that his father was 
              a bargeman, and walked, in a black velvet head-dress, in the Lord 
              Mayor's Show. He also informed me that our principal associate would 
              be another boy whom he introduced by the - to me - extraordinary 
              name of Mealy Potatoes. I discovered, however, that this youth had 
              not been christened by that name, but that it had been bestowed 
              upon him in the warehouse, on account of his complexion, which was 
              pale or mealy. Mealy's father was a waterman, who had the additional 
              distinction of being a fireman, and was engaged as such at one of 
              the large theatres; where some young relation of Mealy's - I think 
              his little sister - did Imps in the Pantomimes. </p>
            <p>　　No words can express the secret agony of my soul as I sunk into 
              this companionship; compared these henceforth everyday associates 
              with those of my happier childhood - not to say with Steerforth, 
              Traddles, and the rest of those boys; and felt my hopes of growing 
              up to be a learned and distinguished man, crushed in my bosom. The 
              deep remembrance of the sense I had, of being utterly without hope 
              now; of the shame I felt in my position; of the misery it was to 
              my young heart to believe that day by day what I had learned, and 
              thought, and delighted in, and raised my fancy and my emulation 
              up by, would pass away from me, little by little, never to be brought 
              back any more; cannot be written. As often as Mick Walker went away 
              in the course of that forenoon, I mingled my tears with the water 
              in which I was washing the bottles; and sobbed as if there were 
              a flaw in my own breast, and it were in danger of bursting. </p>
            <p>　　The counting-house clock was at half past twelve, and there was 
              general preparation for going to dinner, when Mr. Quinion tapped 
              at the counting-house window, and beckoned to me to go in. I went 
              in, and found there a stoutish, middle-aged person, in a brown surtout 
              and black tights and shoes, with no more hair upon his head (which 
              was a large one, and very shining) than there is upon an egg, and 
              with a very extensive face, which he turned full upon me. His clothes 
              were shabby, but he had an imposing shirt-collar on. He carried 
              a jaunty sort of a stick, with a large pair of rusty tassels to 
              it; and a quizzing-glass hung outside his coat, - for ornament, 
              I afterwards found, as he very seldom looked through it, and couldn't 
              see anything when he did. </p>
            <p>　　'This,' said Mr. Quinion, in allusion to myself, 'is he.' </p>
            <p>　　'This,' said the stranger, with a certain condescending roll 
              in his voice, and a certain indescribable air of doing something 
              genteel, which impressed me very much, 'is Master Copperfield. I 
              hope I see you well, sir?' </p>
            <p>　　I said I was very well, and hoped he was. I was sufficiently 
              ill at ease, Heaven knows; but it was not in my nature to complain 
              much at that time of my life, so I said I was very well, and hoped 
              he was. </p>
            <p>　　'I am,' said the stranger, 'thank Heaven, quite well. I have 
              received a letter from Mr. Murdstone, in which he mentions that 
              he would desire me to receive into an apartment in the rear of my 
              house, which is at present unoccupied - and is, in short, to be 
              let as a - in short,' said the stranger, with a smile and in a burst 
              of confidence, 'as a bedroom - the young beginner whom I have now 
              the pleasure to -' and the stranger waved his hand, and settled 
              his chin in his shirt-collar. </p>
            <p>　　'This is Mr. Micawber,' said Mr. Quinion to me. </p>
            <p>　　'Ahem!' said the stranger, 'that is my name.' </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Micawber,' said Mr. Quinion, 'is known to Mr. Murdstone. 
              He takes orders for us on commission, when he can get any. He has 
              been written to by Mr. Murdstone, on the subject of your lodgings, 
              and he will receive you as a lodger.' </p>
            <p>　　'My address,' said Mr. Micawber, 'is Windsor Terrace, City Road. 
              I - in short,' said Mr. Micawber, with the same genteel air, and 
              in another burst of confidence - 'I live there.' </p>
            <p>　　I made him a bow. </p>
            <p>　　'Under the impression,' said Mr. Micawber, 'that your peregrinations 
              in this metropolis have not as yet been extensive, and that you 
              might have some difficulty in penetrating the arcana of the Modern 
              Babylon in the direction of the City Road, - in short,' said Mr. 
              Micawber, in another burst of confidence, 'that you might lose yourself 
              - I shall be happy to call this evening, and install you in the 
              knowledge of the nearest way.' </p>
            <p>　　I thanked him with all my heart, for it was friendly in him to 
              offer to take that trouble. </p>
            <p>　　'At what hour,' said Mr. Micawber, 'shall I -' </p>
            <p>　　'At about eight,' said Mr. Quinion. </p>
            <p>　　'At about eight,' said Mr. Micawber. 'I beg to wish you good 
              day, Mr. Quinion. I will intrude no longer.' </p>
            <p>　　So he put on his hat, and went out with his cane under his arm: 
              very upright, and humming a tune when he was clear of the counting-house. 
            </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Quinion then formally engaged me to be as useful as I could 
              in the warehouse of Murdstone and Grinby, at a salary, I think, 
              of six shillings a week. I am not clear whether it was six or seven. 
              I am inclined to believe, from my uncertainty on this head, that 
              it was six at first and seven afterwards. He paid me a week down 
              (from his own pocket, I believe), and I gave Mealy sixpence out 
              of it to get my trunk carried to Windsor Terrace that night: it 
              being too heavy for my strength, small as it was. I paid sixpence 
              more for my dinner, which was a meat pie and a turn at a neighbouring 
              pump; and passed the hour which was allowed for that meal, in walking 
              about the streets. </p>
            <p>　　At the appointed time in the evening, Mr. Micawber reappeared. 
              I washed my hands and face, to do the greater honour to his gentility, 
              and we walked to our house, as I suppose I must now call it, together; 
              Mr. Micawber impressing the name of streets, and the shapes of corner 
              houses upon me, as we went along, that I might find my way back, 
              easily, in the morning. </p>
            <p>　　Arrived at this house in Windsor Terrace (which I noticed was 
              shabby like himself, but also, like himself, made all the show it 
              could), he presented me to Mrs. Micawber, a thin and faded lady, 
              not at all young, who was sitting in the parlour (the first floor 
              was altogether unfurnished, and the blinds were kept down to delude 
              the neighbours), with a baby at her breast. This baby was one of 
              twins; and I may remark here that I hardly ever, in all my experience 
              of the family, saw both the twins detached from Mrs. Micawber at 
              the same time. One of them was always taking refreshment. </p>
            <p>　　There were two other children; Master Micawber, aged about four, 
              and Miss Micawber, aged about three. These, and a dark-complexioned 
              young woman, with a habit of snorting, who was servant to the family, 
              and informed me, before half an hour had expired, that she was 'a 
              Orfling', and came from St. Luke's workhouse, in the neighbourhood, 
              completed the establishment. My room was at the top of the house, 
              at the back: a close chamber; stencilled all over with an ornament 
              which my young imagination represented as a blue muffin; and very 
              scantily furnished. </p>
            <p>　　'I never thought,' said Mrs. Micawber, when she came up, twin 
              and all, to show me the apartment, and sat down to take breath, 
              'before I was married, when I lived with papa and mama, that I should 
              ever find it necessary to take a lodger. But Mr. Micawber being 
              in difficulties, all considerations of private feeling must give 
              way.' </p>
            <p>　　I said: 'Yes, ma'am.' </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Micawber's difficulties are almost overwhelming just at 
              present,' said Mrs. Micawber; 'and whether it is possible to bring 
              him through them, I don't know. When I lived at home with papa and 
              mama, I really should have hardly understood what the word meant, 
              in the sense in which I now employ it, but experientia does it, 
              - as papa used to say.' </p>
            <p>　　I cannot satisfy myself whether she told me that Mr. Micawber 
              had been an officer in the Marines, or whether I have imagined it. 
              I only know that I believe to this hour that he WAS in the Marines 
              once upon a time, without knowing why. He was a sort of town traveller 
              for a number of miscellaneous houses, now; but made little or nothing 
              of it, I am afraid. </p>
            <p>　　'If Mr. Micawber's creditors will not give him time,' said Mrs. 
              Micawber, 'they must take the consequences; and the sooner they 
              bring it to an issue the better. Blood cannot be obtained from a 
              stone, neither can anything on account be obtained at present (not 
              to mention law expenses) from Mr. Micawber.' </p>
            <p>　　I never can quite understand whether my precocious self-dependence 
              confused Mrs. Micawber in reference to my age, or whether she was 
              so full of the subject that she would have talked about it to the 
              very twins if there had been nobody else to communicate with, but 
              this was the strain in which she began, and she went on accordingly 
              all the time I knew her. </p>
            <p>　　Poor Mrs. Micawber! She said she had tried to exert herself, 
              and so, I have no doubt, she had. The centre of the street door 
              was perfectly covered with a great brass-plate, on which was engraved 
              'Mrs. Micawber's Boarding Establishment for Young Ladies': but I 
              never found that any young lady had ever been to school there; or 
              that any young lady ever came, or proposed to come; or that the 
              least preparation was ever made to receive any young lady. The only 
              visitors I ever saw, or heard of, were creditors. THEY used to come 
              at all hours, and some of them were quite ferocious. One dirty-faced 
              man, I think he was a boot-maker, used to edge himself into the 
              passage as early as seven o'clock in the morning, and call up the 
              stairs to Mr. Micawber - 'Come! You ain't out yet, you know. Pay 
              us, will you? Don't hide, you know; that's mean. I wouldn't be mean 
              if I was you. Pay us, will you? You just pay us, d'ye hear? Come!' 
              Receiving no answer to these taunts, he would mount in his wrath 
              to the words 'swindlers' and 'robbers'; and these being ineffectual 
              too, would sometimes go to the extremity of crossing the street, 
              and roaring up at the windows of the second floor, where he knew 
              Mr. Micawber was. At these times, Mr. Micawber would be transported 
              with grief and mortification, even to the length (as I was once 
              made aware by a scream from his wife) of making motions at himself 
              with a razor; but within half-an-hour afterwards, he would polish 
              up his shoes with extraordinary pains, and go out, humming a tune 
              with a greater air of gentility than ever. Mrs. Micawber was quite 
              as elastic. I have known her to be thrown into fainting fits by 
              the king's taxes at three o'clock, and to eat lamb chops, breaded, 
              and drink warm ale (paid for with two tea-spoons that had gone to 
              the pawnbroker's) at four. On one occasion, when an execution had 
              just been put in, coming home through some chance as early as six 
              o'clock, I saw her lying (of course with a twin) under the grate 
              in a swoon, with her hair all torn about her face; but I never knew 
              her more cheerful than she was, that very same night, over a veal 
              cutlet before the kitchen fire, telling me stories about her papa 
              and mama, and the company they used to keep. </p>
            <p>　　In this house, and with this family, I passed my leisure time. 
              My own exclusive breakfast of a penny loaf and a pennyworth of milk, 
              I provided myself. I kept another small loaf, and a modicum of cheese, 
              on a particular shelf of a particular cupboard, to make my supper 
              on when I came back at night. This made a hole in the six or seven 
              shillings, I know well; and I was out at the warehouse all day, 
              and had to support myself on that money all the week. From Monday 
              morning until Saturday night, I had no advice, no counsel, no encouragement, 
              no consolation, no assistance, no support, of any kind, from anyone, 
              that I can call to mind, as I hope to go to heaven! </p>
            <p>　　I was so young and childish, and so little qualified - how could 
              I be otherwise? - to undertake the whole charge of my own existence, 
              that often, in going to Murdstone and Grinby's, of a morning, I 
              could not resist the stale pastry put out for sale at half-price 
              at the pastrycooks' doors, and spent in that the money I should 
              have kept for my dinner. Then, I went without my dinner, or bought 
              a roll or a slice of pudding. I remember two pudding shops, between 
              which I was divided, according to my finances. One was in a court 
              close to St. Martin's Church - at the back of the church, - which 
              is now removed altogether. The pudding at that shop was made of 
              currants, and was rather a special pudding, but was dear, twopennyworth 
              not being larger than a pennyworth of more ordinary pudding. A good 
              shop for the latter was in the Strand - somewhere in that part which 
              has been rebuilt since. It was a stout pale pudding, heavy and flabby, 
              and with great flat raisins in it, stuck in whole at wide distances 
              apart. It came up hot at about my time every day, and many a day 
              did I dine off it. When I dined regularly and handsomely, I had 
              a saveloy and a penny loaf, or a fourpenny plate of red beef from 
              a cook's shop; or a plate of bread and cheese and a glass of beer, 
              from a miserable old public-house opposite our place of business, 
              called the Lion, or the Lion and something else that I have forgotten. 
              Once, I remember carrying my own bread (which I had brought from 
              home in the morning) under my arm, wrapped in a piece of paper, 
              like a book, and going to a famous alamode beef-house near Drury 
              Lane, and ordering a 'small plate' of that delicacy to eat with 
              it. What the waiter thought of such a strange little apparition 
              coming in all alone, I don't know; but I can see him now, staring 
              at me as I ate my dinner, and bringing up the other waiter to look. 
              I gave him a halfpenny for himself, and I wish he hadn't taken it. 
            </p>
            <p>　　We had half-an-hour, I think, for tea. When I had money enough, 
              I used to get half-a-pint of ready-made coffee and a slice of bread 
              and butter. When I had none, I used to look at a venison shop in 
              Fleet Street; or I have strolled, at such a time, as far as Covent 
              Garden Market, and stared at the pineapples. I was fond of wandering 
              about the Adelphi, because it was a mysterious place, with those 
              dark arches. I see myself emerging one evening from some of these 
              arches, on a little public-house close to the river, with an open 
              space before it, where some coal-heavers were dancing; to look at 
              whom I sat down upon a bench. I wonder what they thought of me! 
            </p>
            <p>　　I was such a child, and so little, that frequently when I went 
              into the bar of a strange public-house for a glass of ale or porter, 
              to moisten what I had had for dinner, they were afraid to give it 
              me. I remember one hot evening I went into the bar of a public-house, 
              and said to the landlord: 'What is your best - your very best - 
              ale a glass?' For it was a special occasion. I don't know what. 
              It may have been my birthday. </p>
            <p>　　'Twopence-halfpenny,' says the landlord, 'is the price of the 
              Genuine Stunning ale.' </p>
            <p>　　'Then,' says I, producing the money, 'just draw me a glass of 
              the Genuine Stunning, if you please, with a good head to it.' </p>
            <p>　　The landlord looked at me in return over the bar, from head to 
              foot, with a strange smile on his face; and instead of drawing the 
              beer, looked round the screen and said something to his wife. She 
              came out from behind it, with her work in her hand, and joined him 
              in surveying me. Here we stand, all three, before me now. The landlord 
              in his shirt-sleeves, leaning against the bar window-frame; his 
              wife looking over the little half-door; and I, in some confusion, 
              looking up at them from outside the partition. They asked me a good 
              many questions; as, what my name was, how old I was, where I lived, 
              how I was employed, and how I came there. To all of which, that 
              I might commit nobody, I invented, I am afraid, appropriate answers. 
              They served me with the ale, though I suspect it was not the Genuine 
              Stunning; and the landlord's wife, opening the little half-door 
              of the bar, and bending down, gave me my money back, and gave me 
              a kiss that was half admiring and half compassionate, but all womanly 
              and good, I am sure. </p>
            <p>　　I know I do not exaggerate, unconsciously and unintentionally, 
              the scantiness of my resources or the difficulties of my life. I 
              know that if a shilling were given me by Mr. Quinion at any time, 
              I spent it in a dinner or a tea. I know that I worked, from morning 
              until night, with common men and boys, a shabby child. I know that 
              I lounged about the streets, insufficiently and unsatisfactorily 
              fed. I know that, but for the mercy of God, I might easily have 
              been, for any care that was taken of me, a little robber or a little 
              vagabond. </p>
            <p>　　Yet I held some station at Murdstone and Grinby's too. Besides 
              that Mr. Quinion did what a careless man so occupied, and dealing 
              with a thing so anomalous, could, to treat me as one upon a different 
              footing from the rest, I never said, to man or boy, how it was that 
              I came to be there, or gave the least indication of being sorry 
              that I was there. That I suffered in secret, and that I suffered 
              exquisitely, no one ever knew but I. How much I suffered, it is, 
              as I have said already, utterly beyond my power to tell. But I kept 
              my own counsel, and I did my work. I knew from the first, that, 
              if I could not do my work as well as any of the rest, I could not 
              hold myself above slight and contempt. I soon became at least as 
              expeditious and as skilful as either of the other boys. Though perfectly 
              familiar with them, my conduct and manner were different enough 
              from theirs to place a space between us. They and the men generally 
              spoke of me as 'the little gent', or 'the young Suffolker.' A certain 
              man named Gregory, who was foreman of the packers, and another named 
              Tipp, who was the carman, and wore a red jacket, used to address 
              me sometimes as 'David': but I think it was mostly when we were 
              very confidential, and when I had made some efforts to entertain 
              them, over our work, with some results of the old readings; which 
              were fast perishing out of my remembrance. Mealy Potatoes uprose 
              once, and rebelled against my being so distinguished; but Mick Walker 
              settled him in no time. </p>
            <p>　　My rescue from this kind of existence I considered quite hopeless, 
              and abandoned, as such, altogether. I am solemnly convinced that 
              I never for one hour was reconciled to it, or was otherwise than 
              miserably unhappy; but I bore it; and even to Peggotty, partly for 
              the love of her and partly for shame, never in any letter (though 
              many passed between us) revealed the truth. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber's difficulties were an addition to the distressed 
              state of my mind. In my forlorn state I became quite attached to 
              the family, and used to walk about, busy with Mrs. Micawber's calculations 
              of ways and means, and heavy with the weight of Mr. Micawber's debts. 
              On a Saturday night, which was my grand treat, - partly because 
              it was a great thing to walk home with six or seven shillings in 
              my pocket, looking into the shops and thinking what such a sum would 
              buy, and partly because I went home early, - Mrs. Micawber would 
              make the most heart-rending confidences to me; also on a Sunday 
              morning, when I mixed the portion of tea or coffee I had bought 
              over-night, in a little shaving-pot, and sat late at my breakfast. 
              It was nothing at all unusual for Mr. Micawber to sob violently 
              at the beginning of one of these Saturday night conversations, and 
              sing about jack's delight being his lovely Nan, towards the end 
              of it. I have known him come home to supper with a flood of tears, 
              and a declaration that nothing was now left but a jail; and go to 
              bed making a calculation of the expense of putting bow-windows to 
              the house, 'in case anything turned up', which was his favourite 
              expression. And Mrs. Micawber was just the same. </p>
            <p>　　A curious equality of friendship, originating, I suppose, in 
              our respective circumstances, sprung up between me and these people, 
              notwithstanding the ludicrous disparity in our years. But I never 
              allowed myself to be prevailed upon to accept any invitation to 
              eat and drink with them out of their stock (knowing that they got 
              on badly with the butcher and baker, and had often not too much 
              for themselves), until Mrs. Micawber took me into her entire confidence. 
              This she did one evening as follows: </p>
            <p>　　'Master Copperfield,' said Mrs. Micawber, 'I make no stranger 
              of you, and therefore do not hesitate to say that Mr. Micawber's 
              difficulties are coming to a crisis.' </p>
            <p>　　It made me very miserable to hear it, and I looked at Mrs. Micawber's 
              red eyes with the utmost sympathy. </p>
            <p>　　'With the exception of the heel of a Dutch cheese - which is 
              not adapted to the wants of a young family' - said Mrs. Micawber, 
              'there is really not a scrap of anything in the larder. I was accustomed 
              to speak of the larder when I lived with papa and mama, and I use 
              the word almost unconsciously. What I mean to express is, that there 
              is nothing to eat in the house.' </p>
            <p>　　'Dear me!' I said, in great concern. </p>
            <p>　　I had two or three shillings of my week's money in my pocket 
              - from which I presume that it must have been on a Wednesday night 
              when we held this conversation - and I hastily produced them, and 
              with heartfelt emotion begged Mrs. Micawber to accept of them as 
              a loan. But that lady, kissing me, and making me put them back in 
              my pocket, replied that she couldn't think of it. </p>
            <p>　　'No, my dear Master Copperfield,' said she, 'far be it from my 
              thoughts! But you have a discretion beyond your years, and can render 
              me another kind of service, if you will; and a service I will thankfully 
              accept of.' </p>
            <p>　　I begged Mrs. Micawber to name it. </p>
            <p>　　'I have parted with the plate myself,' said Mrs. Micawber. 'Six 
              tea, two salt, and a pair of sugars, I have at different times borrowed 
              money on, in secret, with my own hands. But the twins are a great 
              tie; and to me, with my recollections, of papa and mama, these transactions 
              are very painful. There are still a few trifles that we could part 
              with. Mr. Micawber's feelings would never allow him to dispose of 
              them; and Clickett' - this was the girl from the workhouse - 'being 
              of a vulgar mind, would take painful liberties if so much confidence 
              was reposed in her. Master Copperfield, if I might ask you -' </p>
            <p>　　I understood Mrs. Micawber now, and begged her to make use of 
              me to any extent. I began to dispose of the more portable articles 
              of property that very evening; and went out on a similar expedition 
              almost every morning, before I went to Murdstone and Grinby's. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber had a few books on a little chiffonier, which he 
              called the library; and those went first. I carried them, one after 
              another, to a bookstall in the City Road - one part of which, near 
              our house, was almost all bookstalls and bird shops then - and sold 
              them for whatever they would bring. The keeper of this bookstall, 
              who lived in a little house behind it, used to get tipsy every night, 
              and to be violently scolded by his wife every morning. More than 
              once, when I went there early, I had audience of him in a turn-up 
              bedstead, with a cut in his forehead or a black eye, bearing witness 
              to his excesses over-night (I am afraid he was quarrelsome in his 
              drink), and he, with a shaking hand, endeavouring to find the needful 
              shillings in one or other of the pockets of his clothes, which lay 
              upon the floor, while his wife, with a baby in her arms and her 
              shoes down at heel, never left off rating him. Sometimes he had 
              lost his money, and then he would ask me to call again; but his 
              wife had always got some - had taken his, I dare say, while he was 
              drunk - and secretly completed the bargain on the stairs, as we 
              went down together. At the pawnbroker's shop, too, I began to be 
              very well known. The principal gentleman who officiated behind the 
              counter, took a good deal of notice of me; and often got me, I recollect, 
              to decline a Latin noun or adjective, or to conjugate a Latin verb, 
              in his ear, while he transacted my business. After all these occasions 
              Mrs. Micawber made a little treat, which was generally a supper; 
              and there was a peculiar relish in these meals which I well remember. 
            </p>
            <p>　　At last Mr. Micawber's difficulties came to a crisis, and he 
              was arrested early one morning, and carried over to the King's Bench 
              Prison in the Borough. He told me, as he went out of the house, 
              that the God of day had now gone down upon him - and I really thought 
              his heart was broken and mine too. But I heard, afterwards, that 
              he was seen to play a lively game at skittles, before noon. </p>
            <p>　　On the first Sunday after he was taken there, I was to go and 
              see him, and have dinner with him. I was to ask my way to such a 
              place, and just short of that place I should see such another place, 
              and just short of that I should see a yard, which I was to cross, 
              and keep straight on until I saw a turnkey. All this I did; and 
              when at last I did see a turnkey (poor little fellow that I was!), 
              and thought how, when Roderick Random was in a debtors' prison, 
              there was a man there with nothing on him but an old rug, the turnkey 
              swam before my dimmed eyes and my beating heart. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber was waiting for me within the gate, and we went 
              up to his room (top story but one), and cried very much. He solemnly 
              conjured me, I remember, to take warning by his fate; and to observe 
              that if a man had twenty pounds a-year for his income, and spent 
              nineteen pounds nineteen shillings and sixpence, he would be happy, 
              but that if he spent twenty pounds one he would be miserable. After 
              which he borrowed a shilling of me for porter, gave me a written 
              order on Mrs. Micawber for the amount, and put away his pocket-handkerchief, 
              and cheered up. </p>
            <p>　　We sat before a little fire, with two bricks put within the rusted 
              grate, one on each side, to prevent its burning too many coals; 
              until another debtor, who shared the room with Mr. Micawber, came 
              in from the bakehouse with the loin of mutton which was our joint-stock 
              repast. Then I was sent up to 'Captain Hopkins' in the room overhead, 
              with Mr. Micawber's compliments, and I was his young friend, and 
              would Captain Hopkins lend me a knife and fork. </p>
            <p>　　Captain Hopkins lent me the knife and fork, with his compliments 
              to Mr. Micawber. There was a very dirty lady in his little room, 
              and two wan girls, his daughters, with shock heads of hair. I thought 
              it was better to borrow Captain Hopkins's knife and fork, than Captain 
              Hopkins's comb. The Captain himself was in the last extremity of 
              shabbiness, with large whiskers, and an old, old brown great-coat 
              with no other coat below it. I saw his bed rolled up in a corner; 
              and what plates and dishes and pots he had, on a shelf; and I divined 
              (God knows how) that though the two girls with the shock heads of 
              hair were Captain Hopkins's children, the dirty lady was not married 
              to Captain Hopkins. My timid station on his threshold was not occupied 
              more than a couple of minutes at most; but I came down again with 
              all this in my knowledge, as surely as the knife and fork were in 
              my hand. </p>
            <p>　　There was something gipsy-like and agreeable in the dinner, after 
              all. I took back Captain Hopkins's knife and fork early in the afternoon, 
              and went home to comfort Mrs. Micawber with an account of my visit. 
              She fainted when she saw me return, and made a little jug of egg-hot 
              afterwards to console us while we talked it over. </p>
            <p>　　I don't know how the household furniture came to be sold for 
              the family benefit, or who sold it, except that I did not. Sold 
              it was, however, and carried away in a van; except the bed, a few 
              chairs, and the kitchen table. With these possessions we encamped, 
              as it were, in the two parlours of the emptied house in Windsor 
              Terrace; Mrs. Micawber, the children, the Orfling, and myself; and 
              lived in those rooms night and day. I have no idea for how long, 
              though it seems to me for a long time. At last Mrs. Micawber resolved 
              to move into the prison, where Mr. Micawber had now secured a room 
              to himself. So I took the key of the house to the landlord, who 
              was very glad to get it; and the beds were sent over to the King's 
              Bench, except mine, for which a little room was hired outside the 
              walls in the neighbourhood of that Institution, very much to my 
              satisfaction, since the Micawbers and I had become too used to one 
              another, in our troubles, to part. The Orfling was likewise accommodated 
              with an inexpensive lodging in the same neighbourhood. Mine was 
              a quiet back-garret with a sloping roof, commanding a pleasant prospect 
              of a timberyard; and when I took possession of it, with the reflection 
              that Mr. Micawber's troubles had come to a crisis at last, I thought 
              it quite a paradise. </p>
            <p>　　All this time I was working at Murdstone and Grinby's in the 
              same common way, and with the same common companions, and with the 
              same sense of unmerited degradation as at first. But I never, happily 
              for me no doubt, made a single acquaintance, or spoke to any of 
              the many boys whom I saw daily in going to the warehouse, in coming 
              from it, and in prowling about the streets at meal-times. I led 
              the same secretly unhappy life; but I led it in the same lonely, 
              self-reliant manner. The only changes I am conscious of are, firstly, 
              that I had grown more shabby, and secondly, that I was now relieved 
              of much of the weight of Mr. and Mrs. Micawber's cares; for some 
              relatives or friends had engaged to help them at their present pass, 
              and they lived more comfortably in the prison than they had lived 
              for a long while out of it. I used to breakfast with them now, in 
              virtue of some arrangement, of which I have forgotten the details. 
              I forget, too, at what hour the gates were opened in the morning, 
              admitting of my going in; but I know that I was often up at six 
              o'clock, and that my favourite lounging-place in the interval was 
              old London Bridge, where I was wont to sit in one of the stone recesses, 
              watching the people going by, or to look over the balustrades at 
              the sun shining in the water, and lighting up the golden flame on 
              the top of the Monument. The Orfling met me here sometimes, to be 
              told some astonishing fictions respecting the wharves and the Tower; 
              of which I can say no more than that I hope I believed them myself. 
              In the evening I used to go back to the prison, and walk up and 
              down the parade with Mr. Micawber; or play casino with Mrs. Micawber, 
              and hear reminiscences of her papa and mama. Whether Mr. Murdstone 
              knew where I was, I am unable to say. I never told them at Murdstone 
              and Grinby's. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber's affairs, although past their crisis, were very 
              much involved by reason of a certain 'Deed', of which I used to 
              hear a great deal, and which I suppose, now, to have been some former 
              composition with his creditors, though I was so far from being clear 
              about it then, that I am conscious of having confounded it with 
              those demoniacal parchments which are held to have, once upon a 
              time, obtained to a great extent in Germany. At last this document 
              appeared to be got out of the way, somehow; at all events it ceased 
              to be the rock-ahead it had been; and Mrs. Micawber informed me 
              that 'her family' had decided that Mr. Micawber should apply for 
              his release under the Insolvent Debtors Act, which would set him 
              free, she expected, in about six weeks. </p>
            <p>　　'And then,' said Mr. Micawber, who was present, 'I have no doubt 
              I shall, please Heaven, begin to be beforehand with the world, and 
              to live in a perfectly new manner, if - in short, if anything turns 
              up.' </p>
            <p>　　By way of going in for anything that might be on the cards, I 
              call to mind that Mr. Micawber, about this time, composed a petition 
              to the House of Commons, praying for an alteration in the law of 
              imprisonment for debt. I set down this remembrance here, because 
              it is an instance to myself of the manner in which I fitted my old 
              books to my altered life, and made stories for myself, out of the 
              streets, and out of men and women; and how some main points in the 
              character I shall unconsciously develop, I suppose, in writing my 
              life, were gradually forming all this while. </p>
            <p>　　There was a club in the prison, in which Mr. Micawber, as a gentleman, 
              was a great authority. Mr. Micawber had stated his idea of this 
              petition to the club, and the club had strongly approved of the 
              same. Wherefore Mr. Micawber (who was a thoroughly good-natured 
              man, and as active a creature about everything but his own affairs 
              as ever existed, and never so happy as when he was busy about something 
              that could never be of any profit to him) set to work at the petition, 
              invented it, engrossed it on an immense sheet of paper, spread it 
              out on a table, and appointed a time for all the club, and all within 
              the walls if they chose, to come up to his room and sign it. </p>
            <p>　　When I heard of this approaching ceremony, I was so anxious to 
              see them all come in, one after another, though I knew the greater 
              part of them already, and they me, that I got an hour's leave of 
              absence from Murdstone and Grinby's, and established myself in a 
              corner for that purpose. As many of the principal members of the 
              club as could be got into the small room without filling it, supported 
              Mr. Micawber in front of the petition, while my old friend Captain 
              Hopkins (who had washed himself, to do honour to so solemn an occasion) 
              stationed himself close to it, to read it to all who were unacquainted 
              with its contents. The door was then thrown open, and the general 
              population began to come in, in a long file: several waiting outside, 
              while one entered, affixed his signature, and went out. To everybody 
              in succession, Captain Hopkins said: 'Have you read it?' - 'No.' 
              - 'Would you like to hear it read?' If he weakly showed the least 
              disposition to hear it, Captain Hopkins, in a loud sonorous voice, 
              gave him every word of it. The Captain would have read it twenty 
              thousand times, if twenty thousand people would have heard him, 
              one by one. I remember a certain luscious roll he gave to such phrases 
              as 'The people's representatives in Parliament assembled,' 'Your 
              petitioners therefore humbly approach your honourable house,' 'His 
              gracious Majesty's unfortunate subjects,' as if the words were something 
              real in his mouth, and delicious to taste; Mr. Micawber, meanwhile, 
              listening with a little of an author's vanity, and contemplating 
              (not severely) the spikes on the opposite wall. </p>
            <p>　　As I walked to and fro daily between Southwark and Blackfriars, 
              and lounged about at meal-times in obscure streets, the stones of 
              which may, for anything I know, be worn at this moment by my childish 
              feet, I wonder how many of these people were wanting in the crowd 
              that used to come filing before me in review again, to the echo 
              of Captain Hopkins's voice! When my thoughts go back, now, to that 
              slow agony of my youth, I wonder how much of the histories I invented 
              for such people hangs like a mist of fancy over well-remembered 
              facts! When I tread the old ground, I do not wonder that I seem 
              to see and pity, going on before me, an innocent romantic boy, making 
              his imaginative world out of such strange experiences and sordid 
              things! </p>

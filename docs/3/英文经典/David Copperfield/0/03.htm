            <p>　　 The first objects that assume a distinct presence before me, 
              as I look far back, into the blank of my infancy, are my mother 
              with her pretty hair and youthful shape, and Peggotty with no shape 
              at all, and eyes so dark that they seemed to darken their whole 
              neighbourhood in her face, and cheeks and arms so hard and red that 
              I wondered the birds didn't peck her in preference to apples. </p>
            <p>　　I believe I can remember these two at a little distance apart, 
              dwarfed to my sight by stooping down or kneeling on the floor, and 
              I going unsteadily from the one to the other. I have an impression 
              on my mind which I cannot distinguish from actual remembrance, of 
              the touch of Peggotty's forefinger as she used to hold it out to 
              me, and of its being roughened by needlework, like a pocket nutmeg-grater. 
            </p>
            <p>　　This may be fancy, though I think the memory of most of us can 
              go farther back into such times than many of us suppose; just as 
              I believe the power of observation in numbers of very young children 
              to be quite wonderful for its closeness and accuracy. Indeed, I 
              think that most grown men who are remarkable in this respect, may 
              with greater propriety be said not to have lost the faculty, than 
              to have acquired it; the rather, as I generally observe such men 
              to retain a certain freshness, and gentleness, and capacity of being 
              pleased, which are also an inheritance they have preserved from 
              their childhood. </p>
            <p>　　I might have a misgiving that I am 'meandering' in stopping to 
              say this, but that it brings me to remark that I build these conclusions, 
              in part upon my own experience of myself; and if it should appear 
              from anything I may set down in this narrative that I was a child 
              of close observation, or that as a man I have a strong memory of 
              my childhood, I undoubtedly lay claim to both of these characteristics. 
            </p>
            <p>　　Looking back, as I was saying, into the blank of my infancy, 
              the first objects I can remember as standing out by themselves from 
              a confusion of things, are my mother and Peggotty. What else do 
              I remember? Let me see. </p>
            <p>　　 There comes out of the cloud, our house - not new to me, but 
              quite familiar, in its earliest remembrance. On the ground-floor 
              is Peggotty's kitchen, opening into a back yard; with a pigeon-house 
              on a pole, in the centre, without any pigeons in it; a great dog- 
              kennel in a corner, without any dog; and a quantity of fowls that 
              look terribly tall to me, walking about, in a menacing and ferocious 
              manner. There is one cock who gets upon a post to crow, and seems 
              to take particular notice of me as I look at him through the kitchen 
              window, who makes me shiver, he is so fierce. Of the geese outside 
              the side-gate who come waddling after me with their long necks stretched 
              out when I go that way, I dream at night: as a man environed by 
              wild beasts might dream of lions. </p>
            <p>　　Here is a long passage - what an enormous perspective I make 
              of it! - leading from Peggotty's kitchen to the front door. A dark 
              store-room opens out of it, and that is a place to be run past at 
              night; for I don't know what may be among those tubs and jars and 
              old tea-chests, when there is nobody in there with a dimly-burning 
              light, letting a mouldy air come out of the door, in which there 
              is the smell of soap, pickles, pepper, candles, and coffee, all 
              at one whiff. Then there are the two parlours: the parlour in which 
              we sit of an evening, my mother and I and Peggotty - for Peggotty 
              is quite our companion, when her work is done and we are alone - 
              and the best parlour where we sit on a Sunday; grandly, but not 
              so comfortably. There is something of a doleful air about that room 
              to me, for Peggotty has told me - I don't know when, but apparently 
              ages ago - about my father's funeral, and the company having their 
              black cloaks put on. One Sunday night my mother reads to Peggotty 
              and me in there, how Lazarus was raised up from the dead. And I 
              am so frightened that they are afterwards obliged to take me out 
              of bed, and show me the quiet churchyard out of the bedroom window, 
              with the dead all lying in their graves at rest, below the solemn 
              moon. </p>
            <p>　　There is nothing half so green that I know anywhere, as the grass 
              of that churchyard; nothing half so shady as its trees; nothing 
              half so quiet as its tombstones. The sheep are feeding there, when 
              I kneel up, early in the morning, in my little bed in a closet within 
              my mother's room, to look out at it; and I see the red light shining 
              on the sun-dial, and think within myself, 'Is the sun-dial glad, 
              I wonder, that it can tell the time again?' </p>
            <p>　　Here is our pew in the church. What a high-backed pew! With a 
              window near it, out of which our house can be seen, and IS seen 
              many times during the morning's service, by Peggotty, who likes 
              to make herself as sure as she can that it's not being robbed, or 
              is not in flames. But though Peggotty's eye wanders, she is much 
              offended if mine does, and frowns to me, as I stand upon the seat, 
              that I am to look at the clergyman. But I can't always look at him 
              - I know him without that white thing on, and I am afraid of his 
              wondering why I stare so, and perhaps stopping the service to inquire 
              - and what am I to do? It's a dreadful thing to gape, but I must 
              do something. I look at my mother, but she pretends not to see me. 
              I look at a boy in the aisle, and he makes faces at me. I look at 
              the sunlight coming in at the open door through the porch, and there 
              I see a stray sheep - I don't mean a sinner, but mutton - half making 
              up his mind to come into the church. I feel that if I looked at 
              him any longer, I might be tempted to say something out loud; and 
              what would become of me then! I look up at the monumental tablets 
              on the wall, and try to think of Mr. Bodgers late of this parish, 
              and what the feelings of Mrs. Bodgers must have been, when affliction 
              sore, long time Mr. Bodgers bore, and physicians were in vain. I 
              wonder whether they called in Mr. Chillip, and he was in vain; and 
              if so, how he likes to be reminded of it once a week. I look from 
              Mr. Chillip, in his Sunday neckcloth, to the pulpit; and think what 
              a good place it would be to play in, and what a castle it would 
              make, with another boy coming up the stairs to attack it, and having 
              the velvet cushion with the tassels thrown down on his head. In 
              time my eyes gradually shut up; and, from seeming to hear the clergyman 
              singing a drowsy song in the heat, I hear nothing, until I fall 
              off the seat with a crash, and am taken out, more dead than alive, 
              by Peggotty. </p>
            <p>　　And now I see the outside of our house, with the latticed bedroom-windows 
              standing open to let in the sweet-smelling air, and the ragged old 
              rooks'-nests still dangling in the elm-trees at the bottom of the 
              front garden. Now I am in the garden at the back, beyond the yard 
              where the empty pigeon-house and dog-kennel are - a very preserve 
              of butterflies, as I remember it, with a high fence, and a gate 
              and padlock; where the fruit clusters on the trees, riper and richer 
              than fruit has ever been since, in any other garden, and where my 
              mother gathers some in a basket, while I stand by, bolting furtive 
              gooseberries, and trying to look unmoved. A great wind rises, and 
              the summer is gone in a moment. We are playing in the winter twilight, 
              dancing about the parlour. When my mother is out of breath and rests 
              herself in an elbow-chair, I watch her winding her bright curls 
              round her fingers, and straitening her waist, and nobody knows better 
              than I do that she likes to look so well, and is proud of being 
              so pretty. </p>
            <p>　　That is among my very earliest impressions. That, and a sense 
              that we were both a little afraid of Peggotty, and submitted ourselves 
              in most things to her direction, were among the first opinions - 
              if they may be so called - that I ever derived from what I saw. 
            </p>
            <p>　　Peggotty and I were sitting one night by the parlour fire, alone. 
              I had been reading to Peggotty about crocodiles. I must have read 
              very perspicuously, or the poor soul must have been deeply interested, 
              for I remember she had a cloudy impression, after I had done, that 
              they were a sort of vegetable. I was tired of reading, and dead 
              sleepy; but having leave, as a high treat, to sit up until my mother 
              came home from spending the evening at a neighbour's, I would rather 
              have died upon my post (of course) than have gone to bed. I had 
              reached that stage of sleepiness when Peggotty seemed to swell and 
              grow immensely large. I propped my eyelids open with my two forefingers, 
              and looked perseveringly at her as she sat at work; at the little 
              bit of wax-candle she kept for her thread - how old it looked, being 
              so wrinkled in all directions! - at the little house with a thatched 
              roof, where the yard-measure lived; at her work-box with a sliding 
              lid, with a view of St. Paul's Cathedral (with a pink dome) painted 
              on the top; at the brass thimble on her finger; at herself, whom 
              I thought lovely. I felt so sleepy, that I knew if I lost sight 
              of anything for a moment, I was gone. </p>
            <p>　　'Peggotty,' says I, suddenly, 'were you ever married?' </p>
            <p>　　'Lord, Master Davy,' replied Peggotty. 'What's put marriage in 
              your head?' </p>
            <p>　　She answered with such a start, that it quite awoke me. And then 
              she stopped in her work, and looked at me, with her needle drawn 
              out to its thread's length. </p>
            <p>　　'But WERE you ever married, Peggotty?' says I. 'You are a very 
              handsome woman, an't you?' </p>
            <p>　　I thought her in a different style from my mother, certainly; 
              but of another school of beauty, I considered her a perfect example. 
              There was a red velvet footstool in the best parlour, on which my 
              mother had painted a nosegay. The ground-work of that stool, and 
              Peggotty's complexion appeared to me to be one and the same thing. 
              The stool was smooth, and Peggotty was rough, but that made no difference. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Me handsome, Davy!' said Peggotty. 'Lawk, no, my dear! But what 
              put marriage in your head?' </p>
            <p>　　'I don't know! - You mustn't marry more than one person at a 
              time, may you, Peggotty?' </p>
            <p>　　'Certainly not,' says Peggotty, with the promptest decision. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'But if you marry a person, and the person dies, why then you 
              may marry another person, mayn't you, Peggotty?' </p>
            <p>　　'YOU MAY,' says Peggotty, 'if you choose, my dear. That's a matter 
              of opinion.' </p>
            <p>　　'But what is your opinion, Peggotty?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　I asked her, and looked curiously at her, because she looked 
              so curiously at me. </p>
            <p>　　'My opinion is,' said Peggotty, taking her eyes from me, after 
              a little indecision and going on with her work, 'that I never was 
              married myself, Master Davy, and that I don't expect to be. That's 
              all I know about the subject.' </p>
            <p>　　'You an't cross, I suppose, Peggotty, are you?' said I, after 
              sitting quiet for a minute. </p>
            <p>　　I really thought she was, she had been so short with me; but 
              I was quite mistaken: for she laid aside her work (which was a stocking 
              of her own), and opening her arms wide, took my curly head within 
              them, and gave it a good squeeze. I know it was a good squeeze, 
              because, being very plump, whenever she made any little exertion 
              after she was dressed, some of the buttons on the back of her gown 
              flew off. And I recollect two bursting to the opposite side of the 
              parlour, while she was hugging me. </p>
            <p>　　'Now let me hear some more about the Crorkindills,' said Peggotty, 
              who was not quite right in the name yet, 'for I an't heard half 
              enough.' </p>
            <p>　　I couldn't quite understand why Peggotty looked so queer, or 
              why she was so ready to go back to the crocodiles. However, we returned 
              to those monsters, with fresh wakefulness on my part, and we left 
              their eggs in the sand for the sun to hatch; and we ran away from 
              them, and baffled them by constantly turning, which they were unable 
              to do quickly, on account of their unwieldy make; and we went into 
              the water after them, as natives, and put sharp pieces of timber 
              down their throats; and in short we ran the whole crocodile gauntlet. 
              I did, at least; but I had my doubts of Peggotty, who was thoughtfully 
              sticking her needle into various parts of her face and arms, all 
              the time. </p>
            <p>　　We had exhausted the crocodiles, and begun with the alligators, 
              when the garden-bell rang. We went out to the door; and there was 
              my mother, looking unusually pretty, I thought, and with her a gentleman 
              with beautiful black hair and whiskers, who had walked home with 
              us from church last Sunday. </p>
            <p>　　As my mother stooped down on the threshold to take me in her 
              arms and kiss me, the gentleman said I was a more highly privileged 
              little fellow than a monarch - or something like that; for my later 
              understanding comes, I am sensible, to my aid here. </p>
            <p>　　'What does that mean?' I asked him, over her shoulder. </p>
            <p>　　He patted me on the head; but somehow, I didn't like him or his 
              deep voice, and I was jealous that his hand should touch my mother's 
              in touching me - which it did. I put it away, as well as I could. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, Davy!' remonstrated my mother. </p>
            <p>　　'Dear boy!' said the gentleman. 'I cannot wonder at his devotion!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　I never saw such a beautiful colour on my mother's face before. 
              She gently chid me for being rude; and, keeping me close to her 
              shawl, turned to thank the gentleman for taking so much trouble 
              as to bring her home. She put out her hand to him as she spoke, 
              and, as he met it with his own, she glanced, I thought, at me. </p>
            <p>　　'Let us say &quot;good night&quot;, my fine boy,' said the gentleman, 
              when he had bent his head - I saw him! - over my mother's little 
              glove. </p>
            <p>　　'Good night!' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Come! Let us be the best friends in the world!' said the gentleman, 
              laughing. 'Shake hands!' My right hand was in my mother's left, 
              so I gave him the other. </p>
            <p>　　'Why, that's the Wrong hand, Davy!' laughed the gentleman. </p>
            <p>　　MY mother drew my right hand forward, but I was resolved, for 
              my former reason, not to give it him, and I did not. I gave him 
              the other, and he shook it heartily, and said I was a brave fellow, 
              and went away. </p>
            <p>　　At this minute I see him turn round in the garden, and give us 
              a last look with his ill-omened black eyes, before the door was 
              shut. </p>
            <p>　　Peggotty, who had not said a word or moved a finger, secured 
              the fastenings instantly, and we all went into the parlour. My mother, 
              contrary to her usual habit, instead of coming to the elbow-chair 
              by the fire, remained at the other end of the room, and sat singing 
              to herself. </p>
            <p>　　- 'Hope you have had a pleasant evening, ma'am,' said Peggotty, 
              standing as stiff as a barrel in the centre of the room, with a 
              candlestick in her hand. </p>
            <p>　　'Much obliged to you, Peggotty,' returned my mother, in a cheerful 
              voice, 'I have had a VERY pleasant evening.' </p>
            <p>　　'A stranger or so makes an agreeable change,' suggested Peggotty. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'A very agreeable change, indeed,' returned my mother. </p>
            <p>　　Peggotty continuing to stand motionless in the middle of the 
              room, and my mother resuming her singing, I fell asleep, though 
              I was not so sound asleep but that I could hear voices, without 
              hearing what they said. When I half awoke from this uncomfortable 
              doze, I found Peggotty and my mother both in tears, and both talking. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Not such a one as this, Mr. Copperfield wouldn't have liked,' 
              said Peggotty. 'That I say, and that I swear!' </p>
            <p>　　'Good Heavens!' cried my mother, 'you'll drive me mad! Was ever 
              any poor girl so ill-used by her servants as I am! Why do I do myself 
              the injustice of calling myself a girl? Have I never been married, 
              Peggotty?' </p>
            <p>　　'God knows you have, ma'am,' returned Peggotty. 'Then, how can 
              you dare,' said my mother - 'you know I don't mean how can you dare, 
              Peggotty, but how can you have the heart - to make me so uncomfortable 
              and say such bitter things to me, when you are well aware that I 
              haven't, out of this place, a single friend to turn to?' </p>
            <p>　　'The more's the reason,' returned Peggotty, 'for saying that 
              it won't do. No! That it won't do. No! No price could make it do. 
              No!' - I thought Peggotty would have thrown the candlestick away, 
              she was so emphatic with it. </p>
            <p>　　'How can you be so aggravating,' said my mother, shedding more 
              tears than before, 'as to talk in such an unjust manner! How can 
              you go on as if it was all settled and arranged, Peggotty, when 
              I tell you over and over again, you cruel thing, that beyond the 
              commonest civilities nothing has passed! You talk of admiration. 
              What am I to do? If people are so silly as to indulge the sentiment, 
              is it my fault? What am I to do, I ask you? Would you wish me to 
              shave my head and black my face, or disfigure myself with a burn, 
              or a scald, or something of that sort? I dare say you would, Peggotty. 
              I dare say you'd quite enjoy it.' </p>
            <p>　　Peggotty seemed to take this aspersion very much to heart, I 
              thought. </p>
            <p>　　'And my dear boy,' cried my mother, coming to the elbow-chair 
              in which I was, and caressing me, 'my own little Davy! Is it to 
              be hinted to me that I am wanting in affection for my precious treasure, 
              the dearest little fellow that ever was!' </p>
            <p>　　'Nobody never went and hinted no such a thing,' said Peggotty. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'You did, Peggotty!' returned my mother. 'You know you did. What 
              else was it possible to infer from what you said, you unkind creature, 
              when you know as well as I do, that on his account only last quarter 
              I wouldn't buy myself a new parasol, though that old green one is 
              frayed the whole way up, and the fringe is perfectly mangy? You 
              know it is, Peggotty. You can't deny it.' Then, turning affectionately 
              to me, with her cheek against mine, 'Am I a naughty mama to you, 
              Davy? Am I a nasty, cruel, selfish, bad mama? Say I am, my child; 
              say &quot;yes&quot;, dear boy, and Peggotty will love you; and Peggotty's 
              love is a great deal better than mine, Davy. I don't love you at 
              all, do I?' </p>
            <p>　　At this, we all fell a-crying together. I think I was the loudest 
              of the party, but I am sure we were all sincere about it. I was 
              quite heart-broken myself, and am afraid that in the first transports 
              of wounded tenderness I called Peggotty a 'Beast'. That honest creature 
              was in deep affliction, I remember, and must have become quite buttonless 
              on the occasion; for a little volley of those explosives went off, 
              when, after having made it up with my mother, she kneeled down by 
              the elbow-chair, and made it up with me. </p>
            <p>　　We went to bed greatly dejected. My sobs kept waking me, for 
              a long time; and when one very strong sob quite hoisted me up in 
              bed, I found my mother sitting on the coverlet, and leaning over 
              me. I fell asleep in her arms, after that, and slept soundly. </p>
            <p>　　Whether it was the following Sunday when I saw the gentleman 
              again, or whether there was any greater lapse of time before he 
              reappeared, I cannot recall. I don't profess to be clear about dates. 
              But there he was, in church, and he walked home with us afterwards. 
              He came in, too, to look at a famous geranium we had, in the parlour-window. 
              It did not appear to me that he took much notice of it, but before 
              he went he asked my mother to give him a bit of the blossom. She 
              begged him to choose it for himself, but he refused to do that - 
              I could not understand why - so she plucked it for him, and gave 
              it into his hand. He said he would never, never part with it any 
              more; and I thought he must be quite a fool not to know that it 
              would fall to pieces in a day or two. </p>
            <p>　　Peggotty began to be less with us, of an evening, than she had 
              always been. My mother deferred to her very much - more than usual, 
              it occurred to me - and we were all three excellent friends; still 
              we were different from what we used to be, and were not so comfortable 
              among ourselves. Sometimes I fancied that Peggotty perhaps objected 
              to my mother's wearing all the pretty dresses she had in her drawers, 
              or to her going so often to visit at that neighbour's; but I couldn't, 
              to my satisfaction, make out how it was. </p>
            <p>　　Gradually, I became used to seeing the gentleman with the black 
              whiskers. I liked him no better than at first, and had the same 
              uneasy jealousy of him; but if I had any reason for it beyond a 
              child's instinctive dislike, and a general idea that Peggotty and 
              I could make much of my mother without any help, it certainly was 
              not THE reason that I might have found if I had been older. No such 
              thing came into my mind, or near it. I could observe, in little 
              pieces, as it were; but as to making a net of a number of these 
              pieces, and catching anybody in it, that was, as yet, beyond me. 
            </p>
            <p>　　One autumn morning I was with my mother in the front garden, 
              when Mr. Murdstone - I knew him by that name now - came by, on horseback. 
              He reined up his horse to salute my mother, and said he was going 
              to Lowestoft to see some friends who were there with a yacht, and 
              merrily proposed to take me on the saddle before him if I would 
              like the ride. </p>
            <p>　　The air was so clear and pleasant, and the horse seemed to like 
              the idea of the ride so much himself, as he stood snorting and pawing 
              at the garden-gate, that I had a great desire to go. So I was sent 
              upstairs to Peggotty to be made spruce; and in the meantime Mr. 
              Murdstone dismounted, and, with his horse's bridle drawn over his 
              arm, walked slowly up and down on the outer side of the sweetbriar 
              fence, while my mother walked slowly up and down on the inner to 
              keep him company. I recollect Peggotty and I peeping out at them 
              from my little window; I recollect how closely they seemed to be 
              examining the sweetbriar between them, as they strolled along; and 
              how, from being in a perfectly angelic temper, Peggotty turned cross 
              in a moment, and brushed my hair the wrong way, excessively hard. 
            </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Murdstone and I were soon off, and trotting along on the 
              green turf by the side of the road. He held me quite easily with 
              one arm, and I don't think I was restless usually; but I could not 
              make up my mind to sit in front of him without turning my head sometimes, 
              and looking up in his face. He had that kind of shallow black eye 
              - I want a better word to express an eye that has no depth in it 
              to be looked into - which, when it is abstracted, seems from some 
              peculiarity of light to be disfigured, for a moment at a time, by 
              a cast. Several times when I glanced at him, I observed that appearance 
              with a sort of awe, and wondered what he was thinking about so closely. 
              His hair and whiskers were blacker and thicker, looked at so near, 
              than even I had given them credit for being. A squareness about 
              the lower part of his face, and the dotted indication of the strong 
              black beard he shaved close every day, reminded me of the wax-work 
              that had travelled into our neighbourhood some half-a-year before. 
              This, his regular eyebrows, and the rich white, and black, and brown, 
              of his complexion - confound his complexion, and his memory! - made 
              me think him, in spite of my misgivings, a very handsome man. I 
              have no doubt that my poor dear mother thought him so too. </p>
            <p>　　We went to an hotel by the sea, where two gentlemen were smoking 
              cigars in a room by themselves. Each of them was lying on at least 
              four chairs, and had a large rough jacket on. In a corner was a 
              heap of coats and boat-cloaks, and a flag, all bundled up together. 
            </p>
            <p>　　They both rolled on to their feet in an untidy sort of manner, 
              when we came in, and said, 'Halloa, Murdstone! We thought you were 
              dead!' </p>
            <p>　　'Not yet,' said Mr. Murdstone. </p>
            <p>　　'And who's this shaver?' said one of the gentlemen, taking hold 
              of me. </p>
            <p>　　'That's Davy,' returned Mr. Murdstone. </p>
            <p>　　'Davy who?' said the gentleman. 'Jones?' </p>
            <p>　　'Copperfield,' said Mr. Murdstone. </p>
            <p>　　'What! Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield's encumbrance?' cried the 
              gentleman. 'The pretty little widow?' </p>
            <p>　　'Quinion,' said Mr. Murdstone, 'take care, if you please. Somebody's 
              sharp.' </p>
            <p>　　'Who is?' asked the gentleman, laughing. I looked up, quickly; 
              being curious to know. </p>
            <p>　　'Only Brooks of Sheffield,' said Mr. Murdstone. </p>
            <p>　　I was quite relieved to find that it was only Brooks of Sheffield; 
              for, at first, I really thought it was I. </p>
            <p>　　There seemed to be something very comical in the reputation of 
              Mr. Brooks of Sheffield, for both the gentlemen laughed heartily 
              when he was mentioned, and Mr. Murdstone was a good deal amused 
              also. After some laughing, the gentleman whom he had called Quinion, 
              said: </p>
            <p>　　'And what is the opinion of Brooks of Sheffield, in reference 
              to the projected business?' </p>
            <p>　　'Why, I don't know that Brooks understands much about it at present,' 
              replied Mr. Murdstone; 'but he is not generally favourable, I believe.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　There was more laughter at this, and Mr. Quinion said he would 
              ring the bell for some sherry in which to drink to Brooks. This 
              he did; and when the wine came, he made me have a little, with a 
              biscuit, and, before I drank it, stand up and say, 'Confusion to 
              Brooks of Sheffield!' The toast was received with great applause, 
              and such hearty laughter that it made me laugh too; at which they 
              laughed the more. In short, we quite enjoyed ourselves. </p>
            <p>　　We walked about on the cliff after that, and sat on the grass, 
              and looked at things through a telescope - I could make out nothing 
              myself when it was put to my eye, but I pretended I could - and 
              then we came back to the hotel to an early dinner. All the time 
              we were out, the two gentlemen smoked incessantly - which, I thought, 
              if I might judge from the smell of their rough coats, they must 
              have been doing, ever since the coats had first come home from the 
              tailor's. I must not forget that we went on board the yacht, where 
              they all three descended into the cabin, and were busy with some 
              papers. I saw them quite hard at work, when I looked down through 
              the open skylight. They left me, during this time, with a very nice 
              man with a very large head of red hair and a very small shiny hat 
              upon it, who had got a cross-barred shirt or waistcoat on, with 
              'Skylark' in capital letters across the chest. I thought it was 
              his name; and that as he lived on board ship and hadn't a street 
              door to put his name on, he put it there instead; but when I called 
              him Mr. Skylark, he said it meant the vessel. </p>
            <p>　　I observed all day that Mr. Murdstone was graver and steadier 
              than the two gentlemen. They were very gay and careless. They joked 
              freely with one another, but seldom with him. It appeared to me 
              that he was more clever and cold than they were, and that they regarded 
              him with something of my own feeling. I remarked that, once or twice 
              when Mr. Quinion was talking, he looked at Mr. Murdstone sideways, 
              as if to make sure of his not being displeased; and that once when 
              Mr. Passnidge (the other gentleman) was in high spirits, he trod 
              upon his foot, and gave him a secret caution with his eyes, to observe 
              Mr. Murdstone, who was sitting stern and silent. Nor do I recollect 
              that Mr. Murdstone laughed at all that day, except at the Sheffield 
              joke - and that, by the by, was his own. </p>
            <p>　　We went home early in the evening. It was a very fine evening, 
              and my mother and he had another stroll by the sweetbriar, while 
              I was sent in to get my tea. When he was gone, my mother asked me 
              all about the day I had had, and what they had said and done. I 
              mentioned what they had said about her, and she laughed, and told 
              me they were impudent fellows who talked nonsense - but I knew it 
              pleased her. I knew it quite as well as I know it now. I took the 
              opportunity of asking if she was at all acquainted with Mr. Brooks 
              of Sheffield, but she answered No, only she supposed he must be 
              a manufacturer in the knife and fork way. </p>
            <p>　　Can I say of her face - altered as I have reason to remember 
              it, perished as I know it is - that it is gone, when here it comes 
              before me at this instant, as distinct as any face that I may choose 
              to look on in a crowded street? Can I say of her innocent and girlish 
              beauty, that it faded, and was no more, when its breath falls on 
              my cheek now, as it fell that night? Can I say she ever changed, 
              when my remembrance brings her back to life, thus only; and, truer 
              to its loving youth than I have been, or man ever is, still holds 
              fast what it cherished then? </p>
            <p>　　I write of her just as she was when I had gone to bed after this 
              talk, and she came to bid me good night. She kneeled down playfully 
              by the side of the bed, and laying her chin upon her hands, and 
              laughing, said: </p>
            <p>　　'What was it they said, Davy? Tell me again. I can't believe 
              it.' </p>
            <p>　　'&quot;Bewitching -&quot;' I began. </p>
            <p>　　My mother put her hands upon my lips to stop me. </p>
            <p>　　'It was never bewitching,' she said, laughing. 'It never could 
              have been bewitching, Davy. Now I know it wasn't!' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, it was. &quot;Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield&quot;,' I repeated 
              stoutly. 'And, &quot;pretty.&quot;' </p>
            <p>　　'No, no, it was never pretty. Not pretty,' interposed my mother, 
              laying her fingers on my lips again. </p>
            <p>　　'Yes it was. &quot;Pretty little widow.&quot;' </p>
            <p>　　'What foolish, impudent creatures!' cried my mother, laughing 
              and covering her face. 'What ridiculous men! An't they? Davy dear 
              -' </p>
            <p>　　'Well, Ma.' </p>
            <p>　　'Don't tell Peggotty; she might be angry with them. I am dreadfully 
              angry with them myself; but I would rather Peggotty didn't know.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　I promised, of course; and we kissed one another over and over 
              again, and I soon fell fast asleep. </p>
            <p>　　It seems to me, at this distance of time, as if it were the next 
              day when Peggotty broached the striking and adventurous proposition 
              I am about to mention; but it was probably about two months afterwards. 
            </p>
            <p>　　We were sitting as before, one evening (when my mother was out 
              as before), in company with the stocking and the yard-measure, and 
              the bit of wax, and the box with St. Paul's on the lid, and the 
              crocodile book, when Peggotty, after looking at me several times, 
              and opening her mouth as if she were going to speak, without doing 
              it - which I thought was merely gaping, or I should have been rather 
              alarmed - said coaxingly: </p>
            <p>　　'Master Davy, how should you like to go along with me and spend 
              a fortnight at my brother's at Yarmouth? Wouldn't that be a treat?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Is your brother an agreeable man, Peggotty?' I inquired, provisionally. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, what an agreeable man he is!' cried Peggotty, holding up 
              her hands. 'Then there's the sea; and the boats and ships; and the 
              fishermen; and the beach; and Am to play with -' </p>
            <p>　　Peggotty meant her nephew Ham, mentioned in my first chapter; 
              but she spoke of him as a morsel of English Grammar. </p>
            <p>　　I was flushed by her summary of delights, and replied that it 
              would indeed be a treat, but what would my mother say? </p>
            <p>　　'Why then I'll as good as bet a guinea,' said Peggotty, intent 
              upon my face, 'that she'll let us go. I'll ask her, if you like, 
              as soon as ever she comes home. There now!' </p>
            <p>　　'But what's she to do while we're away?' said I, putting my small 
              elbows on the table to argue the point. 'She can't live by herself.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　If Peggotty were looking for a hole, all of a sudden, in the 
              heel of that stocking, it must have been a very little one indeed, 
              and not worth darning. </p>
            <p>　　'I say! Peggotty! She can't live by herself, you know.' </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, bless you!' said Peggotty, looking at me again at last. 
              'Don't you know? She's going to stay for a fortnight with Mrs. Grayper. 
              Mrs. Grayper's going to have a lot of company.' </p>
            <p>　　Oh! If that was it, I was quite ready to go. I waited, in the 
              utmost impatience, until my mother came home from Mrs. Grayper's 
              (for it was that identical neighbour), to ascertain if we could 
              get leave to carry out this great idea. Without being nearly so 
              much surprised as I had expected, my mother entered into it readily; 
              and it was all arranged that night, and my board and lodging during 
              the visit were to be paid for. </p>
            <p>　　The day soon came for our going. It was such an early day that 
              it came soon, even to me, who was in a fever of expectation, and 
              half afraid that an earthquake or a fiery mountain, or some other 
              great convulsion of nature, might interpose to stop the expedition. 
              We were to go in a carrier's cart, which departed in the morning 
              after breakfast. I would have given any money to have been allowed 
              to wrap myself up over-night, and sleep in my hat and boots. </p>
            <p>　　It touches me nearly now, although I tell it lightly, to recollect 
              how eager I was to leave my happy home; to think how little I suspected 
              what I did leave for ever. </p>
            <p>　　I am glad to recollect that when the carrier's cart was at the 
              gate, and my mother stood there kissing me, a grateful fondness 
              for her and for the old place I had never turned my back upon before, 
              made me cry. I am glad to know that my mother cried too, and that 
              I felt her heart beat against mine. </p>
            <p>　　I am glad to recollect that when the carrier began to move, my 
              mother ran out at the gate, and called to him to stop, that she 
              might kiss me once more. I am glad to dwell upon the earnestness 
              and love with which she lifted up her face to mine, and did so. 
            </p>
            <p>　　As we left her standing in the road, Mr. Murdstone came up to 
              where she was, and seemed to expostulate with her for being so moved. 
              I was looking back round the awning of the cart, and wondered what 
              business it was of his. Peggotty, who was also looking back on the 
              other side, seemed anything but satisfied; as the face she brought 
              back in the cart denoted. </p>
            <p>　　I sat looking at Peggotty for some time, in a reverie on this 
              supposititious case: whether, if she were employed to lose me like 
              the boy in the fairy tale, I should be able to track my way home 
              again by the buttons she would shed. </p>

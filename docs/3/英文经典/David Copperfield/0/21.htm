            <p>　　 When the chambermaid tapped at my door at eight o'clock, and 
              informed me that my shaving-water was outside, I felt severely the 
              having no occasion for it, and blushed in my bed. The suspicion 
              that she laughed too, when she said it, preyed upon my mind all 
              the time I was dressing; and gave me, I was conscious, a sneaking 
              and guilty air when I passed her on the staircase, as I was going 
              down to breakfast. I was so sensitively aware, indeed, of being 
              younger than I could have wished, that for some time I could not 
              make up my mind to pass her at all, under the ignoble circumstances 
              of the case; but, hearing her there with a broom, stood peeping 
              out of window at King Charles on horseback, surrounded by a maze 
              of hackney-coaches, and looking anything but regal in a drizzling 
              rain and a dark-brown fog, until I was admonished by the waiter 
              that the gentleman was waiting for me. </p>
            <p>　　It was not in the coffee-room that I found Steerforth expecting 
              me, but in a snug private apartment, red-curtained and Turkey-carpeted, 
              where the fire burnt bright, and a fine hot breakfast was set forth 
              on a table covered with a clean cloth; and a cheerful miniature 
              of the room, the fire, the breakfast, Steerforth, and all, was shining 
              in the little round mirror over the sideboard. I was rather bashful 
              at first, Steerforth being so self-possessed, and elegant, and superior 
              to me in all respects (age included); but his easy patronage soon 
              put that to rights, and made me quite at home. I could not enough 
              admire the change he had wrought in the Golden Cross; or compare 
              the dull forlorn state I had held yesterday, with this morning's 
              comfort and this morning's entertainment. As to the waiter's familiarity, 
              it was quenched as if it had never been. He attended on us, as I 
              may say, in sackcloth and ashes. </p>
            <p>　　'Now, Copperfield,' said Steerforth, when we were alone, 'I should 
              like to hear what you are doing, and where you are going, and all 
              about you. I feel as if you were my property.' Glowing with pleasure 
              to find that he had still this interest in me, I told him how my 
              aunt had proposed the little expedition that I had before me, and 
              whither it tended. </p>
            <p>　　'As you are in no hurry, then,' said Steerforth, 'come home with 
              me to Highgate, and stay a day or two. You will be pleased with 
              my mother - she is a little vain and prosy about me, but that you 
              can forgive her - and she will be pleased with you.' </p>
            <p>　　'I should like to be as sure of that, as you are kind enough 
              to say you are,' I answered, smiling. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh!' said Steerforth, 'everyone who likes me, has a claim on 
              her that is sure to be acknowledged.' </p>
            <p>　　'Then I think I shall be a favourite,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Good!' said Steerforth. 'Come and prove it. We will go and see 
              the lions for an hour or two - it's something to have a fresh fellow 
              like you to show them to, Copperfield - and then we'll journey out 
              to Highgate by the coach.' </p>
            <p>　　I could hardly believe but that I was in a dream, and that I 
              should wake presently in number forty-four, to the solitary box 
              in the coffee-room and the familiar waiter again. After I had written 
              to my aunt and told her of my fortunate meeting with my admired 
              old schoolfellow, and my acceptance of his invitation, we went out 
              in a hackney-chariot, and saw a Panorama and some other sights, 
              and took a walk through the Museum, where I could not help observing 
              how much Steerforth knew, on an infinite variety of subjects, and 
              of how little account he seemed to make his knowledge. </p>
            <p>　　'You'll take a high degree at college, Steerforth,' said I, 'if 
              you have not done so already; and they will have good reason to 
              be proud of you.' </p>
            <p>　　'I take a degree!' cried Steerforth. 'Not I! my dear Daisy - 
              will you mind my calling you Daisy?' </p>
            <p>　　'Not at all!' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'That's a good fellow! My dear Daisy,' said Steerforth, laughing. 
              'I have not the least desire or intention to distinguish myself 
              in that way. I have done quite sufficient for my purpose. I find 
              that I am heavy company enough for myself as I am.' </p>
            <p>　　'But the fame -' I was beginning. </p>
            <p>　　'You romantic Daisy!' said Steerforth, laughing still more heartily: 
              'why should I trouble myself, that a parcel of heavy-headed fellows 
              may gape and hold up their hands? Let them do it at some other man. 
              There's fame for him, and he's welcome to it.' </p>
            <p>　　I was abashed at having made so great a mistake, and was glad 
              to change the subject. Fortunately it was not difficult to do, for 
              Steerforth could always pass from one subject to another with a 
              carelessness and lightness that were his own. </p>
            <p>　　Lunch succeeded to our sight-seeing, and the short winter day 
              wore away so fast, that it was dusk when the stage-coach stopped 
              with us at an old brick house at Highgate on the summit of the hill. 
              An elderly lady, though not very far advanced in years, with a proud 
              carriage and a handsome face, was in the doorway as we alighted; 
              and greeting Steerforth as 'My dearest James,' folded him in her 
              arms. To this lady he presented me as his mother, and she gave me 
              a stately welcome. </p>
            <p>　　It was a genteel old-fashioned house, very quiet and orderly. 
              From the windows of my room I saw all London lying in the distance 
              like a great vapour, with here and there some lights twinkling through 
              it. I had only time, in dressing, to glance at the solid furniture, 
              the framed pieces of work (done, I supposed, by Steerforth's mother 
              when she was a girl), and some pictures in crayons of ladies with 
              powdered hair and bodices, coming and going on the walls, as the 
              newly-kindled fire crackled and sputtered, when I was called to 
              dinner. </p>
            <p>　　There was a second lady in the dining-room, of a slight short 
              figure, dark, and not agreeable to look at, but with some appearance 
              of good looks too, who attracted my attention: perhaps because I 
              had not expected to see her; perhaps because I found myself sitting 
              opposite to her; perhaps because of something really remarkable 
              in her. She had black hair and eager black eyes, and was thin, and 
              had a scar upon her lip. It was an old scar - I should rather call 
              it seam, for it was not discoloured, and had healed years ago - 
              which had once cut through her mouth, downward towards the chin, 
              but was now barely visible across the table, except above and on 
              her upper lip, the shape of which it had altered. I concluded in 
              my own mind that she was about thirty years of age, and that she 
              wished to be married. She was a little dilapidated - like a house 
              - with having been so long to let; yet had, as I have said, an appearance 
              of good looks. Her thinness seemed to be the effect of some wasting 
              fire within her, which found a vent in her gaunt eyes. </p>
            <p>　　She was introduced as Miss Dartle, and both Steerforth and his 
              mother called her Rosa. I found that she lived there, and had been 
              for a long time Mrs. Steerforth's companion. It appeared to me that 
              she never said anything she wanted to say, outright; but hinted 
              it, and made a great deal more of it by this practice. For example, 
              when Mrs. Steerforth observed, more in jest than earnest, that she 
              feared her son led but a wild life at college, Miss Dartle put in 
              thus: </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, really? You know how ignorant I am, and that I only ask 
              for information, but isn't it always so? I thought that kind of 
              life was on all hands understood to be - eh?' 'It is education for 
              a very grave profession, if you mean that, Rosa,' Mrs. Steerforth 
              answered with some coldness. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh! Yes! That's very true,' returned Miss Dartle. 'But isn't 
              it, though? - I want to be put right, if I am wrong - isn't it, 
              really?' </p>
            <p>　　'Really what?' said Mrs. Steerforth. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh! You mean it's not!' returned Miss Dartle. 'Well, I'm very 
              glad to hear it! Now, I know what to do! That's the advantage of 
              asking. I shall never allow people to talk before me about wastefulness 
              and profligacy, and so forth, in connexion with that life, any more.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'And you will be right,' said Mrs. Steerforth. 'My son's tutor 
              is a conscientious gentleman; and if I had not implicit reliance 
              on my son, I should have reliance on him.' </p>
            <p>　　'Should you?' said Miss Dartle. 'Dear me! Conscientious, is he? 
              Really conscientious, now?' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, I am convinced of it,' said Mrs. Steerforth. </p>
            <p>　　'How very nice!' exclaimed Miss Dartle. 'What a comfort! Really 
              conscientious? Then he's not - but of course he can't be, if he's 
              really conscientious. Well, I shall be quite happy in my opinion 
              of him, from this time. You can't think how it elevates him in my 
              opinion, to know for certain that he's really conscientious!' </p>
            <p>　　Her own views of every question, and her correction of everything 
              that was said to which she was opposed, Miss Dartle insinuated in 
              the same way: sometimes, I could not conceal from myself, with great 
              power, though in contradiction even of Steerforth. An instance happened 
              before dinner was done. Mrs. Steerforth speaking to me about my 
              intention of going down into Suffolk, I said at hazard how glad 
              I should be, if Steerforth would only go there with me; and explaining 
              to him that I was going to see my old nurse, and Mr. Peggotty's 
              family, I reminded him of the boatman whom he had seen at school. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Oh! That bluff fellow!' said Steerforth. 'He had a son with 
              him, hadn't he?' </p>
            <p>　　'No. That was his nephew,' I replied; 'whom he adopted, though, 
              as a son. He has a very pretty little niece too, whom he adopted 
              as a daughter. In short, his house - or rather his boat, for he 
              lives in one, on dry land - is full of people who are objects of 
              his generosity and kindness. You would be delighted to see that 
              household.' </p>
            <p>　　'Should I?' said Steerforth. 'Well, I think I should. I must 
              see what can be done. It would be worth a journey (not to mention 
              the pleasure of a journey with you, Daisy), to see that sort of 
              people together, and to make one of 'em.' </p>
            <p>　　My heart leaped with a new hope of pleasure. But it was in reference 
              to the tone in which he had spoken of 'that sort of people', that 
              Miss Dartle, whose sparkling eyes had been watchful of us, now broke 
              in again. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, but, really? Do tell me. Are they, though?' she said. </p>
            <p>　　'Are they what? And are who what?' said Steerforth. </p>
            <p>　　'That sort of people. - Are they really animals and clods, and 
              beings of another order? I want to know SO much.' </p>
            <p>　　'Why, there's a pretty wide separation between them and us,' 
              said Steerforth, with indifference. 'They are not to be expected 
              to be as sensitive as we are. Their delicacy is not to be shocked, 
              or hurt easily. They are wonderfully virtuous, I dare say - some 
              people contend for that, at least; and I am sure I don't want to 
              contradict them - but they have not very fine natures, and they 
              may be thankful that, like their coarse rough skins, they are not 
              easily wounded.' </p>
            <p>　　'Really!' said Miss Dartle. 'Well, I don't know, now, when I 
              have been better pleased than to hear that. It's so consoling! It's 
              such a delight to know that, when they suffer, they don't feel! 
              Sometimes I have been quite uneasy for that sort of people; but 
              now I shall just dismiss the idea of them, altogether. Live and 
              learn. I had my doubts, I confess, but now they're cleared up. I 
              didn't know, and now I do know, and that shows the advantage of 
              asking - don't it?' </p>
            <p>　　I believed that Steerforth had said what he had, in jest, or 
              to draw Miss Dartle out; and I expected him to say as much when 
              she was gone, and we two were sitting before the fire. But he merely 
              asked me what I thought of her. </p>
            <p>　　'She is very clever, is she not?' I asked. </p>
            <p>　　'Clever! She brings everything to a grindstone,' said Steerforth, 
              and sharpens it, as she has sharpened her own face and figure these 
              years past. She has worn herself away by constant sharpening. She 
              is all edge.' </p>
            <p>　　'What a remarkable scar that is upon her lip!' I said. </p>
            <p>　　Steerforth's face fell, and he paused a moment. </p>
            <p>　　'Why, the fact is,' he returned, 'I did that.' </p>
            <p>　　'By an unfortunate accident!' </p>
            <p>　　'No. I was a young boy, and she exasperated me, and I threw a 
              hammer at her. A promising young angel I must have been!' I was 
              deeply sorry to have touched on such a painful theme, but that was 
              useless now. </p>
            <p>　　'She has borne the mark ever since, as you see,' said Steerforth; 
              'and she'll bear it to her grave, if she ever rests in one - though 
              I can hardly believe she will ever rest anywhere. She was the motherless 
              child of a sort of cousin of my father's. He died one day. My mother, 
              who was then a widow, brought her here to be company to her. She 
              has a couple of thousand pounds of her own, and saves the interest 
              of it every year, to add to the principal. There's the history of 
              Miss Rosa Dartle for you.' </p>
            <p>　　'And I have no doubt she loves you like a brother?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Humph!' retorted Steerforth, looking at the fire. 'Some brothers 
              are not loved over much; and some love - but help yourself, Copperfield! 
              We'll drink the daisies of the field, in compliment to you; and 
              the lilies of the valley that toil not, neither do they spin, in 
              compliment to me - the more shame for me!' A moody smile that had 
              overspread his features cleared off as he said this merrily, and 
              he was his own frank, winning self again. </p>
            <p>　　I could not help glancing at the scar with a painful interest 
              when we went in to tea. It was not long before I observed that it 
              was the most susceptible part of her face, and that, when she turned 
              pale, that mark altered first, and became a dull, lead-coloured 
              streak, lengthening out to its full extent, like a mark in invisible 
              ink brought to the fire. There was a little altercation between 
              her and Steerforth about a cast of the dice at back gammon - when 
              I thought her, for one moment, in a storm of rage; and then I saw 
              it start forth like the old writing on the wall. </p>
            <p>　　It was no matter of wonder to me to find Mrs. Steerforth devoted 
              to her son. She seemed to be able to speak or think about nothing 
              else. She showed me his picture as an infant, in a locket, with 
              some of his baby-hair in it; she showed me his picture as he had 
              been when I first knew him; and she wore at her breast his picture 
              as he was now. All the letters he had ever written to her, she kept 
              in a cabinet near her own chair by the fire; and she would have 
              read me some of them, and I should have been very glad to hear them 
              too, if he had not interposed, and coaxed her out of the design. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'It was at Mr. Creakle's, my son tells me, that you first became 
              acquainted,' said Mrs. Steerforth, as she and I were talking at 
              one table, while they played backgammon at another. 'Indeed, I recollect 
              his speaking, at that time, of a pupil younger than himself who 
              had taken his fancy there; but your name, as you may suppose, has 
              not lived in my memory.' </p>
            <p>　　'He was very generous and noble to me in those days, I assure 
              you, ma'am,' said I, 'and I stood in need of such a friend. I should 
              have been quite crushed without him.' </p>
            <p>　　'He is always generous and noble,' said Mrs. Steerforth, proudly. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I subscribed to this with all my heart, God knows. She knew I 
              did; for the stateliness of her manner already abated towards me, 
              except when she spoke in praise of him, and then her air was always 
              lofty. </p>
            <p>　　'It was not a fit school generally for my son,' said she; 'far 
              from it; but there were particular circumstances to be considered 
              at the time, of more importance even than that selection. My son's 
              high spirit made it desirable that he should be placed with some 
              man who felt its superiority, and would be content to bow himself 
              before it; and we found such a man there.' </p>
            <p>　　I knew that, knowing the fellow. And yet I did not despise him 
              the more for it, but thought it a redeeming quality in him if he 
              could be allowed any grace for not resisting one so irresistible 
              as Steerforth. </p>
            <p>　　'My son's great capacity was tempted on, there, by a feeling 
              of voluntary emulation and conscious pride,' the fond lady went 
              on to say. 'He would have risen against all constraint; but he found 
              himself the monarch of the place, and he haughtily determined to 
              be worthy of his station. It was like himself.' </p>
            <p>　　I echoed, with all my heart and soul, that it was like himself. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'So my son took, of his own will, and on no compulsion, to the 
              course in which he can always, when it is his pleasure, outstrip 
              every competitor,' she pursued. 'My son informs me, Mr. Copperfield, 
              that you were quite devoted to him, and that when you met yesterday 
              you made yourself known to him with tears of joy. I should be an 
              affected woman if I made any pretence of being surprised by my son's 
              inspiring such emotions; but I cannot be indifferent to anyone who 
              is so sensible of his merit, and I am very glad to see you here, 
              and can assure you that he feels an unusual friendship for you, 
              and that you may rely on his protection.' </p>
            <p>　　Miss Dartle played backgammon as eagerly as she did everything 
              else. If I had seen her, first, at the board, I should have fancied 
              that her figure had got thin, and her eyes had got large, over that 
              pursuit, and no other in the world. But I am very much mistaken 
              if she missed a word of this, or lost a look of mine as I received 
              it with the utmost pleasure, and honoured by Mrs. Steerforth's confidence, 
              felt older than I had done since I left Canterbury. </p>
            <p>　　When the evening was pretty far spent, and a tray of glasses 
              and decanters came in, Steerforth promised, over the fire, that 
              he would seriously think of going down into the country with me. 
              There was no hurry, he said; a week hence would do; and his mother 
              hospitably said the same. While we were talking, he more than once 
              called me Daisy; which brought Miss Dartle out again. </p>
            <p>　　'But really, Mr. Copperfield,' she asked, 'is it a nickname? 
              And why does he give it you? Is it - eh? - because he thinks you 
              young and innocent? I am so stupid in these things.' </p>
            <p>　　I coloured in replying that I believed it was. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh!' said Miss Dartle. 'Now I am glad to know that! I ask for 
              information, and I am glad to know it. He thinks you young and innocent; 
              and so you are his friend. Well, that's quite delightful!' </p>
            <p>　　She went to bed soon after this, and Mrs. Steerforth retired 
              too. Steerforth and I, after lingering for half-an-hour over the 
              fire, talking about Traddles and all the rest of them at old Salem 
              House, went upstairs together. Steerforth's room was next to mine, 
              and I went in to look at it. It was a picture of comfort, full of 
              easy-chairs, cushions and footstools, worked by his mother's hand, 
              and with no sort of thing omitted that could help to render it complete. 
              Finally, her handsome features looked down on her darling from a 
              portrait on the wall, as if it were even something to her that her 
              likeness should watch him while he slept. </p>
            <p>　　I found the fire burning clear enough in my room by this time, 
              and the curtains drawn before the windows and round the bed, giving 
              it a very snug appearance. I sat down in a great chair upon the 
              hearth to meditate on my happiness; and had enjoyed the contemplation 
              of it for some time, when I found a likeness of Miss Dartle looking 
              eagerly at me from above the chimney-piece. </p>
            <p>　　It was a startling likeness, and necessarily had a startling 
              look. The painter hadn't made the scar, but I made it; and there 
              it was, coming and going; now confined to the upper lip as I had 
              seen it at dinner, and now showing the whole extent of the wound 
              inflicted by the hammer, as I had seen it when she was passionate. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I wondered peevishly why they couldn't put her anywhere else 
              instead of quartering her on me. To get rid of her, I undressed 
              quickly, extinguished my light, and went to bed. But, as I fell 
              asleep, I could not forget that she was still there looking, 'Is 
              it really, though? I want to know'; and when I awoke in the night, 
              I found that I was uneasily asking all sorts of people in my dreams 
              whether it really was or not - without knowing what I meant. </p>

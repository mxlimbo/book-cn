            <p>　　 It was a wonderfully fine thing to have that lofty castle to 
              myself, and to feel, when I shut my outer door, like Robinson Crusoe, 
              when he had got into his fortification, and pulled his ladder up 
              after him. It was a wonderfully fine thing to walk about town with 
              the key of my house in my pocket, and to know that I could ask any 
              fellow to come home, and make quite sure of its being inconvenient 
              to nobody, if it were not so to me. It was a wonderfully fine thing 
              to let myself in and out, and to come and go without a word to anyone, 
              and to ring Mrs. Crupp up, gasping, from the depths of the earth, 
              when I wanted her - and when she was disposed to come. All this, 
              I say, was wonderfully fine; but I must say, too, that there were 
              times when it was very dreary. </p>
            <p>　　It was fine in the morning, particularly in the fine mornings. 
              It looked a very fresh, free life, by daylight: still fresher, and 
              more free, by sunlight. But as the day declined, the life seemed 
              to go down too. I don't know how it was; it seldom looked well by 
              candle-light. I wanted somebody to talk to, then. I missed Agnes. 
              I found a tremendous blank, in the place of that smiling repository 
              of my confidence. Mrs. Crupp appeared to be a long way off. I thought 
              about my predecessor, who had died of drink and smoke; and I could 
              have wished he had been so good as to live, and not bother me with 
              his decease. </p>
            <p>　　After two days and nights, I felt as if I had lived there for 
              a year, and yet I was not an hour older, but was quite as much tormented 
              by my own youthfulness as ever. </p>
            <p>　　Steerforth not yet appearing, which induced me to apprehend that 
              he must be ill, I left the Commons early on the third day, and walked 
              out to Highgate. Mrs. Steerforth was very glad to see me, and said 
              that he had gone away with one of his Oxford friends to see another 
              who lived near St. Albans, but that she expected him to return tomorrow. 
              I was so fond of him, that I felt quite jealous of his Oxford friends. 
            </p>
            <p>　　As she pressed me to stay to dinner, I remained, and I believe 
              we talked about nothing but him all day. I told her how much the 
              people liked him at Yarmouth, and what a delightful companion he 
              had been. Miss Dartle was full of hints and mysterious questions, 
              but took a great interest in all our proceedings there, and said, 
              'Was it really though?' and so forth, so often, that she got everything 
              out of me she wanted to know. Her appearance was exactly what I 
              have described it, when I first saw her; but the society of the 
              two ladies was so agreeable, and came so natural to me, that I felt 
              myself falling a little in love with her. I could not help thinking, 
              several times in the course of the evening, and particularly when 
              I walked home at night, what delightful company she would be in 
              Buckingham Street. </p>
            <p>　　I was taking my coffee and roll in the morning, before going 
              to the Commons - and I may observe in this place that it is surprising 
              how much coffee Mrs. Crupp used, and how weak it was, considering 
              - when Steerforth himself walked in, to my unbounded joy. </p>
            <p>　　'My dear Steerforth,' cried I, 'I began to think I should never 
              see you again!' </p>
            <p>　　'I was carried off, by force of arms,' said Steerforth, 'the 
              very next morning after I got home. Why, Daisy, what a rare old 
              bachelor you are here!' </p>
            <p>　　I showed him over the establishment, not omitting the pantry, 
              with no little pride, and he commended it highly. 'I tell you what, 
              old boy,' he added, 'I shall make quite a town-house of this place, 
              unless you give me notice to quit.' </p>
            <p>　　This was a delightful hearing. I told him if he waited for that, 
              he would have to wait till doomsday. </p>
            <p>　　'But you shall have some breakfast!' said I, with my hand on 
              the bell-rope, 'and Mrs. Crupp shall make you some fresh coffee, 
              and I'll toast you some bacon in a bachelor's Dutch-oven, that I 
              have got here.' </p>
            <p>　　'No, no!' said Steerforth. 'Don't ring! I can't! I am going to 
              breakfast with one of these fellows who is at the Piazza Hotel, 
              in Covent Garden.' </p>
            <p>　　'But you'll come back to dinner?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'I can't, upon my life. There's nothing I should like better, 
              but I must remain with these two fellows. We are all three off together 
              tomorrow morning.' </p>
            <p>　　'Then bring them here to dinner,' I returned. 'Do you think they 
              would come?' </p>
            <p>　　'Oh! they would come fast enough,' said Steerforth; 'but we should 
              inconvenience you. You had better come and dine with us somewhere.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　I would not by any means consent to this, for it occurred to 
              me that I really ought to have a little house-warming, and that 
              there never could be a better opportunity. I had a new pride in 
              my rooms after his approval of them, and burned with a desire to 
              develop their utmost resources. I therefore made him promise positively 
              in the names of his two friends, and we appointed six o'clock as 
              the dinner-hour. </p>
            <p>　　When he was gone, I rang for Mrs. Crupp, and acquainted her with 
              my desperate design. Mrs. Crupp said, in the first place, of course 
              it was well known she couldn't be expected to wait, but she knew 
              a handy young man, who she thought could be prevailed upon to do 
              it, and whose terms would be five shillings, and what I pleased. 
              I said, certainly we would have him. Next Mrs. Crupp said it was 
              clear she couldn't be in two places at once (which I felt to be 
              reasonable), and that 'a young gal' stationed in the pantry with 
              a bedroom candle, there never to desist from washing plates, would 
              be indispensable. I said, what would be the expense of this young 
              female? and Mrs. Crupp said she supposed eighteenpence would neither 
              make me nor break me. I said I supposed not; and THAT was settled. 
              Then Mrs. Crupp said, Now about the dinner. </p>
            <p>　　It was a remarkable instance of want of forethought on the part 
              of the ironmonger who had made Mrs. Crupp's kitchen fireplace, that 
              it was capable of cooking nothing but chops and mashed potatoes. 
              As to a fish-kittle, Mrs. Crupp said, well! would I only come and 
              look at the range? She couldn't say fairer than that. Would I come 
              and look at it? As I should not have been much the wiser if I HAD 
              looked at it, I declined, and said, 'Never mind fish.' But Mrs. 
              Crupp said, Don't say that; oysters was in, why not them? So THAT 
              was settled. Mrs. Crupp then said what she would recommend would 
              be this. A pair of hot roast fowls - from the pastry-cook's; a dish 
              of stewed beef, with vegetables - from the pastry-cook's; two little 
              corner things, as a raised pie and a dish of kidneys - from the 
              pastrycook's; a tart, and (if I liked) a shape of jelly - from the 
              pastrycook's. This, Mrs. Crupp said, would leave her at full liberty 
              to concentrate her mind on the potatoes, and to serve up the cheese 
              and celery as she could wish to see it done. </p>
            <p>　　I acted on Mrs. Crupp's opinion, and gave the order at the pastry-cook's 
              myself. Walking along the Strand, afterwards, and observing a hard 
              mottled substance in the window of a ham and beef shop, which resembled 
              marble, but was labelled 'Mock Turtle', I went in and bought a slab 
              of it, which I have since seen reason to believe would have sufficed 
              for fifteen people. This preparation, Mrs. Crupp, after some difficulty, 
              consented to warm up; and it shrunk so much in a liquid state, that 
              we found it what Steerforth called 'rather a tight fit' for four. 
            </p>
            <p>　　These preparations happily completed, I bought a little dessert 
              in Covent Garden Market, and gave a rather extensive order at a 
              retail wine-merchant's in that vicinity. When I came home in the 
              afternoon, and saw the bottles drawn up in a square on the pantry 
              floor, they looked so numerous (though there were two missing, which 
              made Mrs. Crupp very uncomfortable), that I was absolutely frightened 
              at them. </p>
            <p>　　One of Steerforth's friends was named Grainger, and the other 
              Markham. They were both very gay and lively fellows; Grainger, something 
              older than Steerforth; Markham, youthful-looking, and I should say 
              not more than twenty. I observed that the latter always spoke of 
              himself indefinitely, as 'a man', and seldom or never in the first 
              person singular. </p>
            <p>　　'A man might get on very well here, Mr. Copperfield,' said Markham 
              - meaning himself. </p>
            <p>　　'It's not a bad situation,' said I, 'and the rooms are really 
              commodious.' </p>
            <p>　　'I hope you have both brought appetites with you?' said Steerforth. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Upon my honour,' returned Markham, 'town seems to sharpen a 
              man's appetite. A man is hungry all day long. A man is perpetually 
              eating.' </p>
            <p>　　Being a little embarrassed at first, and feeling much too young 
              to preside, I made Steerforth take the head of the table when dinner 
              was announced, and seated myself opposite to him. Everything was 
              very good; we did not spare the wine; and he exerted himself so 
              brilliantly to make the thing pass off well, that there was no pause 
              in our festivity. I was not quite such good company during dinner 
              as I could have wished to be, for my chair was opposite the door, 
              and my attention was distracted by observing that the handy young 
              man went out of the room very often, and that his shadow always 
              presented itself, immediately afterwards, on the wall of the entry, 
              with a bottle at its mouth. The 'young gal' likewise occasioned 
              me some uneasiness: not so much by neglecting to wash the plates, 
              as by breaking them. For being of an inquisitive disposition, and 
              unable to confine herself (as her positive instructions were) to 
              the pantry, she was constantly peering in at us, and constantly 
              imagining herself detected; in which belief, she several times retired 
              upon the plates (with which she had carefully paved the floor), 
              and did a great deal of destruction. </p>
            <p>　　These, however, were small drawbacks, and easily forgotten when 
              the cloth was cleared, and the dessert put on the table; at which 
              period of the entertainment the handy young man was discovered to 
              be speechless. Giving him private directions to seek the society 
              of Mrs. Crupp, and to remove the 'young gal' to the basement also, 
              I abandoned myself to enjoyment. </p>
            <p>　　I began, by being singularly cheerful and light-hearted; all 
              sorts of half-forgotten things to talk about, came rushing into 
              my mind, and made me hold forth in a most unwonted manner. I laughed 
              heartily at my own jokes, and everybody else's; called Steerforth 
              to order for not passing the wine; made several engagements to go 
              to Oxford; announced that I meant to have a dinner-party exactly 
              like that, once a week, until further notice; and madly took so 
              much snuff out of Grainger's box, that I was obliged to go into 
              the pantry, and have a private fit of sneezing ten minutes long. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I went on, by passing the wine faster and faster yet, and continually 
              starting up with a corkscrew to open more wine, long before any 
              was needed. I proposed Steerforth's health. I said he was my dearest 
              friend, the protector of my boyhood, and the companion of my prime. 
              I said I was delighted to propose his health. I said I owed him 
              more obligations than I could ever repay, and held him in a higher 
              admiration than I could ever express. I finished by saying, 'I'll 
              give you Steerforth! God bless him! Hurrah!' We gave him three times 
              three, and another, and a good one to finish with. I broke my glass 
              in going round the table to shake hands with him, and I said (in 
              two words) 'Steerforth - you'retheguidingstarofmyexistence.' </p>
            <p>　　I went on, by finding suddenly that somebody was in the middle 
              of a song. Markham was the singer, and he sang 'When the heart of 
              a man is depressed with care'. He said, when he had sung it, he 
              would give us 'Woman!' I took objection to that, and I couldn't 
              allow it. I said it was not a respectful way of proposing the toast, 
              and I would never permit that toast to be drunk in my house otherwise 
              than as 'The Ladies!' I was very high with him, mainly I think because 
              I saw Steerforth and Grainger laughing at me - or at him - or at 
              both of us. He said a man was not to be dictated to. I said a man 
              was. He said a man was not to be insulted, then. I said he was right 
              there - never under my roof, where the Lares were sacred, and the 
              laws of hospitality paramount. He said it was no derogation from 
              a man's dignity to confess that I was a devilish good fellow. I 
              instantly proposed his health. </p>
            <p>　　Somebody was smoking. We were all smoking. I was smoking, and 
              trying to suppress a rising tendency to shudder. Steerforth had 
              made a speech about me, in the course of which I had been affected 
              almost to tears. I returned thanks, and hoped the present company 
              would dine with me tomorrow, and the day after - each day at five 
              o'clock, that we might enjoy the pleasures of conversation and society 
              through a long evening. I felt called upon to propose an individual. 
              I would give them my aunt. Miss Betsey Trotwood, the best of her 
              sex! </p>
            <p>　　Somebody was leaning out of my bedroom window, refreshing his 
              forehead against the cool stone of the parapet, and feeling the 
              air upon his face. It was myself. I was addressing myself as 'Copperfield', 
              and saying, 'Why did you try to smoke? You might have known you 
              couldn't do it.' Now, somebody was unsteadily contemplating his 
              features in the looking-glass. That was I too. I was very pale in 
              the looking-glass; my eyes had a vacant appearance; and my hair 
              - only my hair, nothing else - looked drunk. </p>
            <p>　　Somebody said to me, 'Let us go to the theatre, Copperfield!' 
              There was no bedroom before me, but again the jingling table covered 
              with glasses; the lamp; Grainger on my right hand, Markham on my 
              left, and Steerforth opposite - all sitting in a mist, and a long 
              way off. The theatre? To be sure. The very thing. Come along! But 
              they must excuse me if I saw everybody out first, and turned the 
              lamp off - in case of fire. </p>
            <p>　　Owing to some confusion in the dark, the door was gone. I was 
              feeling for it in the window-curtains, when Steerforth, laughing, 
              took me by the arm and led me out. We went downstairs, one behind 
              another. Near the bottom, somebody fell, and rolled down. Somebody 
              else said it was Copperfield. I was angry at that false report, 
              until, finding myself on my back in the passage, I began to think 
              there might be some foundation for it. </p>
            <p>　　A very foggy night, with great rings round the lamps in the streets! 
              There was an indistinct talk of its being wet. I considered it frosty. 
              Steerforth dusted me under a lamp-post, and put my hat into shape, 
              which somebody produced from somewhere in a most extraordinary manner, 
              for I hadn't had it on before. Steerforth then said, 'You are all 
              right, Copperfield, are you not?' and I told him, 'Neverberrer.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　A man, sitting in a pigeon-hole-place, looked out of the fog, 
              and took money from somebody, inquiring if I was one of the gentlemen 
              paid for, and appearing rather doubtful (as I remember in the glimpse 
              I had of him) whether to take the money for me or not. Shortly afterwards, 
              we were very high up in a very hot theatre, looking down into a 
              large pit, that seemed to me to smoke; the people with whom it was 
              crammed were so indistinct. There was a great stage, too, looking 
              very clean and smooth after the streets; and there were people upon 
              it, talking about something or other, but not at all intelligibly. 
              There was an abundance of bright lights, and there was music, and 
              there were ladies down in the boxes, and I don't know what more. 
              The whole building looked to me as if it were learning to swim; 
              it conducted itself in such an unaccountable manner, when I tried 
              to steady it. </p>
            <p>　　On somebody's motion, we resolved to go downstairs to the dress-boxes, 
              where the ladies were. A gentleman lounging, full dressed, on a 
              sofa, with an opera-glass in his hand, passed before my view, and 
              also my own figure at full length in a glass. Then I was being ushered 
              into one of these boxes, and found myself saying something as I 
              sat down, and people about me crying 'Silence!' to somebody, and 
              ladies casting indignant glances at me, and - what! yes! - Agnes, 
              sitting on the seat before me, in the same box, with a lady and 
              gentleman beside her, whom I didn't know. I see her face now, better 
              than I did then, I dare say, with its indelible look of regret and 
              wonder turned upon me. </p>
            <p>　　'Agnes!' I said, thickly, 'Lorblessmer! Agnes!' </p>
            <p>　　'Hush! Pray!' she answered, I could not conceive why. 'You disturb 
              the company. Look at the stage!' </p>
            <p>　　I tried, on her injunction, to fix it, and to hear something 
              of what was going on there, but quite in vain. I looked at her again 
              by and by, and saw her shrink into her corner, and put her gloved 
              hand to her forehead. </p>
            <p>　　'Agnes!' I said. 'I'mafraidyou'renorwell.' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, yes. Do not mind me, Trotwood,' she returned. 'Listen! 
              Are you going away soon?' </p>
            <p>　　'Amigoarawaysoo?' I repeated. </p>
            <p>　　'Yes.' </p>
            <p>　　I had a stupid intention of replying that I was going to wait, 
              to hand her downstairs. I suppose I expressed it, somehow; for after 
              she had looked at me attentively for a little while, she appeared 
              to understand, and replied in a low tone: </p>
            <p>　　'I know you will do as I ask you, if I tell you I am very earnest 
              in it. Go away now, Trotwood, for my sake, and ask your friends 
              to take you home.' </p>
            <p>　　She had so far improved me, for the time, that though I was angry 
              with her, I felt ashamed, and with a short 'Goori!' (which I intended 
              for 'Good night!') got up and went away. They followed, and I stepped 
              at once out of the box-door into my bedroom, where only Steerforth 
              was with me, helping me to undress, and where I was by turns telling 
              him that Agnes was my sister, and adjuring him to bring the corkscrew, 
              that I might open another bottle of wine. </p>
            <p>　　How somebody, lying in my bed, lay saying and doing all this 
              over again, at cross purposes, in a feverish dream all night - the 
              bed a rocking sea that was never still! How, as that somebody slowly 
              settled down into myself, did I begin to parch, and feel as if my 
              outer covering of skin were a hard board; my tongue the bottom of 
              an empty kettle, furred with long service, and burning up over a 
              slow fire; the palms of my hands, hot plates of metal which no ice 
              could cool! </p>
            <p>　　But the agony of mind, the remorse, and shame I felt when I became 
              conscious next day! My horror of having committed a thousand offences 
              I had forgotten, and which nothing could ever expiate - my recollection 
              of that indelible look which Agnes had given me - the torturing 
              impossibility of communicating with her, not knowing, Beast that 
              I was, how she came to be in London, or where she stayed - my disgust 
              of the very sight of the room where the revel had been held - my 
              racking head - the smell of smoke, the sight of glasses, the impossibility 
              of going out, or even getting up! Oh, what a day it was! </p>
            <p>　　Oh, what an evening, when I sat down by my fire to a basin of 
              mutton broth, dimpled all over with fat, and thought I was going 
              the way of my predecessor, and should succeed to his dismal story 
              as well as to his chambers, and had half a mind to rush express 
              to Dover and reveal all! What an evening, when Mrs. Crupp, coming 
              in to take away the broth-basin, produced one kidney on a cheese-plate 
              as the entire remains of yesterday's feast, and I was really inclined 
              to fall upon her nankeen breast and say, in heartfelt penitence, 
              'Oh, Mrs. Crupp, Mrs. Crupp, never mind the broken meats! I am very 
              miserable!' - only that I doubted, even at that pass, if Mrs. Crupp 
              were quite the sort of woman to confide in! </p>

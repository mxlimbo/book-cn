            <p>　　I began the next day with another dive into the Roman bath, and 
              then started for Highgate. I was not dispirited now. I was not afraid 
              of the shabby coat, and had no yearnings after gallant greys. My 
              whole manner of thinking of our late misfortune was changed. What 
              I had to do, was, to show my aunt that her past goodness to me had 
              not been thrown away on an insensible, ungrateful object. What I 
              had to do, was, to turn the painful discipline of my younger days 
              to account, by going to work with a resolute and steady heart. What 
              I had to do, was, to take my woodman's axe in my hand, and clear 
              my own way through the forest of difficulty, by cutting down the 
              trees until I came to Dora. And I went on at a mighty rate, as if 
              it could be done by walking. </p>
            <p>　　When I found myself on the familiar Highgate road, pursuing such 
              a different errand from that old one of pleasure, with which it 
              was associated, it seemed as if a complete change had come on my 
              whole life. But that did not discourage me. With the new life, came 
              new purpose, new intention. Great was the labour; priceless the 
              reward. Dora was the reward, and Dora must be won. </p>
            <p>　　I got into such a transport, that I felt quite sorry my coat 
              was not a little shabby already. I wanted to be cutting at those 
              trees in the forest of difficulty, under circumstances that should 
              prove my strength. I had a good mind to ask an old man, in wire 
              spectacles, who was breaking stones upon the road, to lend me his 
              hammer for a little while, and let me begin to beat a path to Dora 
              out of granite. I stimulated myself into such a heat, and got so 
              out of breath, that I felt as if I had been earning I don't know 
              how much. </p>
            <p>　　In this state, I went into a cottage that I saw was to let, and 
              examined it narrowly, - for I felt it necessary to be practical. 
              It would do for me and Dora admirably: with a little front garden 
              for Jip to run about in, and bark at the tradespeople through the 
              railings, and a capital room upstairs for my aunt. I came out again, 
              hotter and faster than ever, and dashed up to Highgate, at such 
              a rate that I was there an hour too early; and, though I had not 
              been, should have been obliged to stroll about to cool myself, before 
              I was at all presentable. </p>
            <p>　　My first care, after putting myself under this necessary course 
              of preparation, was to find the Doctor's house. It was not in that 
              part of Highgate where Mrs. Steerforth lived, but quite on the opposite 
              side of the little town. When I had made this discovery, I went 
              back, in an attraction I could not resist, to a lane by Mrs. Steerforth's, 
              and looked over the corner of the garden wall. His room was shut 
              up close. The conservatory doors were standing open, and Rosa Dartle 
              was walking, bareheaded, with a quick, impetuous step, up and down 
              a gravel walk on one side of the lawn. She gave me the idea of some 
              fierce thing, that was dragging the length of its chain to and fro 
              upon a beaten track, and wearing its heart out. </p>
            <p>　　I came softly away from my place of observation, and avoiding 
              that part of the neighbourhood, and wishing I had not gone near 
              it, strolled about until it was ten o'clock. The church with the 
              slender spire, that stands on the top of the hill now, was not there 
              then to tell me the time. An old red-brick mansion, used as a school, 
              was in its place; and a fine old house it must have been to go to 
              school at, as I recollect it. </p>
            <p>　　When I approached the Doctor's cottage - a pretty old place, 
              on which he seemed to have expended some money, if I might judge 
              from the embellishments and repairs that had the look of being just 
              completed - I saw him walking in the garden at the side, gaiters 
              and all, as if he had never left off walking since the days of my 
              pupilage. He had his old companions about him, too; for there were 
              plenty of high trees in the neighbourhood, and two or three rooks 
              were on the grass, looking after him, as if they had been written 
              to about him by the Canterbury rooks, and were observing him closely 
              in consequence. </p>
            <p>　　Knowing the utter hopelessness of attracting his attention from 
              that distance, I made bold to open the gate, and walk after him, 
              so as to meet him when he should turn round. When he did, and came 
              towards me, he looked at me thoughtfully for a few moments, evidently 
              without thinking about me at all; and then his benevolent face expressed 
              extraordinary pleasure, and he took me by both hands. </p>
            <p>　　'Why, my dear Copperfield,' said the Doctor, 'you are a man! 
              How do you do? I am delighted to see you. My dear Copperfield, how 
              very much you have improved! You are quite - yes - dear me!' </p>
            <p>　　I hoped he was well, and Mrs. Strong too. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh dear, yes!' said the Doctor; 'Annie's quite well, and she'll 
              be delighted to see you. You were always her favourite. She said 
              so, last night, when I showed her your letter. And - yes, to be 
              sure - you recollect Mr. Jack Maldon, Copperfield?' </p>
            <p>　　'Perfectly, sir.' </p>
            <p>　　'Of course,' said the Doctor. 'To be sure. He's pretty well, 
              too.' </p>
            <p>　　'Has he come home, sir?' I inquired. </p>
            <p>　　'From India?' said the Doctor. 'Yes. Mr. Jack Maldon couldn't 
              bear the climate, my dear. Mrs. Markleham - you have not forgotten 
              Mrs. Markleham?' </p>
            <p>　　Forgotten the Old Soldier! And in that short time! </p>
            <p>　　'Mrs. Markleham,' said the Doctor, 'was quite vexed about him, 
              poor thing; so we have got him at home again; and we have bought 
              him a little Patent place, which agrees with him much better.' I 
              knew enough of Mr. Jack Maldon to suspect from this account that 
              it was a place where there was not much to do, and which was pretty 
              well paid. The Doctor, walking up and down with his hand on my shoulder, 
              and his kind face turned encouragingly to mine, went on: </p>
            <p>　　'Now, my dear Copperfield, in reference to this proposal of yours. 
              It's very gratifying and agreeable to me, I am sure; but don't you 
              think you could do better? You achieved distinction, you know, when 
              you were with us. You are qualified for many good things. You have 
              laid a foundation that any edifice may be raised upon; and is it 
              not a pity that you should devote the spring-time of your life to 
              such a poor pursuit as I can offer?' </p>
            <p>　　I became very glowing again, and, expressing myself in a rhapsodical 
              style, I am afraid, urged my request strongly; reminding the Doctor 
              that I had already a profession. </p>
            <p>　　'Well, well,' said the Doctor, 'that's true. Certainly, your 
              having a profession, and being actually engaged in studying it, 
              makes a difference. But, my good young friend, what's seventy pounds 
              a year?' </p>
            <p>　　'It doubles our income, Doctor Strong,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Dear me!' replied the Doctor. 'To think of that! Not that I 
              mean to say it's rigidly limited to seventy pounds a-year, because 
              I have always contemplated making any young friend I might thus 
              employ, a present too. Undoubtedly,' said the Doctor, still walking 
              me up and down with his hand on my shoulder. 'I have always taken 
              an annual present into account.' </p>
            <p>　　'My dear tutor,' said I (now, really, without any nonsense), 
              'to whom I owe more obligations already than I ever can acknowledge 
              -' </p>
            <p>　　'No, no,' interposed the Doctor. 'Pardon me!' </p>
            <p>　　'If you will take such time as I have, and that is my mornings 
              and evenings, and can think it worth seventy pounds a year, you 
              will do me such a service as I cannot express.' </p>
            <p>　　'Dear me!' said the Doctor, innocently. 'To think that so little 
              should go for so much! Dear, dear! And when you can do better, you 
              will? On your word, now?' said the Doctor, - which he had always 
              made a very grave appeal to the honour of us boys. </p>
            <p>　　'On my word, sir!' I returned, answering in our old school manner. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Then be it so,' said the Doctor, clapping me on the shoulder, 
              and still keeping his hand there, as we still walked up and down. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'And I shall be twenty times happier, sir,' said I, with a little 
              - I hope innocent - flattery, 'if my employment is to be on the 
              Dictionary.' </p>
            <p>　　The Doctor stopped, smilingly clapped me on the shoulder again, 
              and exclaimed, with a triumph most delightful to behold, as if I 
              had penetrated to the profoundest depths of mortal sagacity, 'My 
              dear young friend, you have hit it. It IS the Dictionary!' </p>
            <p>　　How could it be anything else! His pockets were as full of it 
              as his head. It was sticking out of him in all directions. He told 
              me that since his retirement from scholastic life, he had been advancing 
              with it wonderfully; and that nothing could suit him better than 
              the proposed arrangements for morning and evening work, as it was 
              his custom to walk about in the daytime with his considering cap 
              on. His papers were in a little confusion, in consequence of Mr. 
              Jack Maldon having lately proffered his occasional services as an 
              amanuensis, and not being accustomed to that occupation; but we 
              should soon put right what was amiss, and go on swimmingly. Afterwards, 
              when we were fairly at our work, I found Mr. Jack Maldon's efforts 
              more troublesome to me than I had expected, as he had not confined 
              himself to making numerous mistakes, but had sketched so many soldiers, 
              and ladies' heads, over the Doctor's manuscript, that I often became 
              involved in labyrinths of obscurity. </p>
            <p>　　The Doctor was quite happy in the prospect of our going to work 
              together on that wonderful performance, and we settled to begin 
              next morning at seven o'clock. We were to work two hours every morning, 
              and two or three hours every night, except on Saturdays, when I 
              was to rest. On Sundays, of course, I was to rest also, and I considered 
              these very easy terms. </p>
            <p>　　Our plans being thus arranged to our mutual satisfaction, the 
              Doctor took me into the house to present me to Mrs. Strong, whom 
              we found in the Doctor's new study, dusting his books, - a freedom 
              which he never permitted anybody else to take with those sacred 
              favourites. </p>
            <p>　　They had postponed their breakfast on my account, and we sat 
              down to table together. We had not been seated long, when I saw 
              an approaching arrival in Mrs. Strong's face, before I heard any 
              sound of it. A gentleman on horseback came to the gate, and leading 
              his horse into the little court, with the bridle over his arm, as 
              if he were quite at home, tied him to a ring in the empty coach-house 
              wall, and came into the breakfast parlour, whip in hand. It was 
              Mr. Jack Maldon; and Mr. Jack Maldon was not at all improved by 
              India, I thought. I was in a state of ferocious virtue, however, 
              as to young men who were not cutting down trees in the forest of 
              difficulty; and my impression must be received with due allowance. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Jack!' said the Doctor. 'Copperfield!' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Jack Maldon shook hands with me; but not very warmly, I believed; 
              and with an air of languid patronage, at which I secretly took great 
              umbrage. But his languor altogether was quite a wonderful sight; 
              except when he addressed himself to his cousin Annie. 'Have you 
              breakfasted this morning, Mr. Jack?' said the Doctor. </p>
            <p>　　'I hardly ever take breakfast, sir,' he replied, with his head 
              thrown back in an easy-chair. 'I find it bores me.' </p>
            <p>　　'Is there any news today?' inquired the Doctor. </p>
            <p>　　'Nothing at all, sir,' replied Mr. Maldon. 'There's an account 
              about the people being hungry and discontented down in the North, 
              but they are always being hungry and discontented somewhere.' </p>
            <p>　　The Doctor looked grave, and said, as though he wished to change 
              the subject, 'Then there's no news at all; and no news, they say, 
              is good news.' </p>
            <p>　　'There's a long statement in the papers, sir, about a murder,' 
              observed Mr. Maldon. 'But somebody is always being murdered, and 
              I didn't read it.' </p>
            <p>　　A display of indifference to all the actions and passions of 
              mankind was not supposed to be such a distinguished quality at that 
              time, I think, as I have observed it to be considered since. I have 
              known it very fashionable indeed. I have seen it displayed with 
              such success, that I have encountered some fine ladies and gentlemen 
              who might as well have been born caterpillars. Perhaps it impressed 
              me the more then, because it was new to me, but it certainly did 
              not tend to exalt my opinion of, or to strengthen my confidence 
              in, Mr. Jack Maldon. </p>
            <p>　　'I came out to inquire whether Annie would like to go to the 
              opera tonight,' said Mr. Maldon, turning to her. 'It's the last 
              good night there will be, this season; and there's a singer there, 
              whom she really ought to hear. She is perfectly exquisite. Besides 
              which, she is so charmingly ugly,' relapsing into languor. </p>
            <p>　　The Doctor, ever pleased with what was likely to please his young 
              wife, turned to her and said: </p>
            <p>　　'You must go, Annie. You must go.' </p>
            <p>　　'I would rather not,' she said to the Doctor. 'I prefer to remain 
              at home. I would much rather remain at home.' </p>
            <p>　　Without looking at her cousin, she then addressed me, and asked 
              me about Agnes, and whether she should see her, and whether she 
              was not likely to come that day; and was so much disturbed, that 
              I wondered how even the Doctor, buttering his toast, could be blind 
              to what was so obvious. </p>
            <p>　　But he saw nothing. He told her, good-naturedly, that she was 
              young and ought to be amused and entertained, and must not allow 
              herself to be made dull by a dull old fellow. Moreover, he said, 
              he wanted to hear her sing all the new singer's songs to him; and 
              how could she do that well, unless she went? So the Doctor persisted 
              in making the engagement for her, and Mr. Jack Maldon was to come 
              back to dinner. This concluded, he went to his Patent place, I suppose; 
              but at all events went away on his horse, looking very idle. </p>
            <p>　　I was curious to find out next morning, whether she had been. 
              She had not, but had sent into London to put her cousin off; and 
              had gone out in the afternoon to see Agnes, and had prevailed upon 
              the Doctor to go with her; and they had walked home by the fields, 
              the Doctor told me, the evening being delightful. I wondered then, 
              whether she would have gone if Agnes had not been in town, and whether 
              Agnes had some good influence over her too! </p>
            <p>　　She did not look very happy, I thought; but it was a good face, 
              or a very false one. I often glanced at it, for she sat in the window 
              all the time we were at work; and made our breakfast, which we took 
              by snatches as we were employed. When I left, at nine o'clock, she 
              was kneeling on the ground at the Doctor's feet, putting on his 
              shoes and gaiters for him. There was a softened shade upon her face, 
              thrown from some green leaves overhanging the open window of the 
              low room; and I thought all the way to Doctors' Commons, of the 
              night when I had seen it looking at him as he read. </p>
            <p>　　I was pretty busy now; up at five in the morning, and home at 
              nine or ten at night. But I had infinite satisfaction in being so 
              closely engaged, and never walked slowly on any account, and felt 
              enthusiastically that the more I tired myself, the more I was doing 
              to deserve Dora. I had not revealed myself in my altered character 
              to Dora yet, because she was coming to see Miss Mills in a few days, 
              and I deferred all I had to tell her until then; merely informing 
              her in my letters (all our communications were secretly forwarded 
              through Miss Mills), that I had much to tell her. In the meantime, 
              I put myself on a short allowance of bear's grease, wholly abandoned 
              scented soap and lavender water, and sold off three waistcoats at 
              a prodigious sacrifice, as being too luxurious for my stern career. 
            </p>
            <p>　　Not satisfied with all these proceedings, but burning with impatience 
              to do something more, I went to see Traddles, now lodging up behind 
              the parapet of a house in Castle Street, Holborn. Mr. Dick, who 
              had been with me to Highgate twice already, and had resumed his 
              companionship with the Doctor, I took with me. </p>
            <p>　　I took Mr. Dick with me, because, acutely sensitive to my aunt's 
              reverses, and sincerely believing that no galley-slave or convict 
              worked as I did, he had begun to fret and worry himself out of spirits 
              and appetite, as having nothing useful to do. In this condition, 
              he felt more incapable of finishing the Memorial than ever; and 
              the harder he worked at it, the oftener that unlucky head of King 
              Charles the First got into it. Seriously apprehending that his malady 
              would increase, unless we put some innocent deception upon him and 
              caused him to believe that he was useful, or unless we could put 
              him in the way of being really useful (which would be better), I 
              made up my mind to try if Traddles could help us. Before we went, 
              I wrote Traddles a full statement of all that had happened, and 
              Traddles wrote me back a capital answer, expressive of his sympathy 
              and friendship. </p>
            <p>　　We found him hard at work with his inkstand and papers, refreshed 
              by the sight of the flower-pot stand and the little round table 
              in a corner of the small apartment. He received us cordially, and 
              made friends with Mr. Dick in a moment. Mr. Dick professed an absolute 
              certainty of having seen him before, and we both said, 'Very likely.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　The first subject on which I had to consult Traddles was this, 
              - I had heard that many men distinguished in various pursuits had 
              begun life by reporting the debates in Parliament. Traddles having 
              mentioned newspapers to me, as one of his hopes, I had put the two 
              things together, and told Traddles in my letter that I wished to 
              know how I could qualify myself for this pursuit. Traddles now informed 
              me, as the result of his inquiries, that the mere mechanical acquisition 
              necessary, except in rare cases, for thorough excellence in it, 
              that is to say, a perfect and entire command of the mystery of short-hand 
              writing and reading, was about equal in difficulty to the mastery 
              of six languages; and that it might perhaps be attained, by dint 
              of perseverance, in the course of a few years. Traddles reasonably 
              supposed that this would settle the business; but I, only feeling 
              that here indeed were a few tall trees to be hewn down, immediately 
              resolved to work my way on to Dora through this thicket, axe in 
              hand. </p>
            <p>　　'I am very much obliged to you, my dear Traddles!' said I. 'I'll 
              begin tomorrow.' </p>
            <p>　　Traddles looked astonished, as he well might; but he had no notion 
              as yet of my rapturous condition. </p>
            <p>　　'I'll buy a book,' said I, 'with a good scheme of this art in 
              it; I'll work at it at the Commons, where I haven't half enough 
              to do; I'll take down the speeches in our court for practice - Traddles, 
              my dear fellow, I'll master it!' </p>
            <p>　　'Dear me,' said Traddles, opening his eyes, 'I had no idea you 
              were such a determined character, Copperfield!' </p>
            <p>　　I don't know how he should have had, for it was new enough to 
              me. I passed that off, and brought Mr. Dick on the carpet. </p>
            <p>　　'You see,' said Mr. Dick, wistfully, 'if I could exert myself, 
              Mr. Traddles - if I could beat a drum- or blow anything!' </p>
            <p>　　Poor fellow! I have little doubt he would have preferred such 
              an employment in his heart to all others. Traddles, who would not 
              have smiled for the world, replied composedly: </p>
            <p>　　'But you are a very good penman, sir. You told me so, Copperfield?' 
              'Excellent!' said I. And indeed he was. He wrote with extraordinary 
              neatness. </p>
            <p>　　'Don't you think,' said Traddles, 'you could copy writings, sir, 
              if I got them for you?' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Dick looked doubtfully at me. 'Eh, Trotwood?' </p>
            <p>　　I shook my head. Mr. Dick shook his, and sighed. 'Tell him about 
              the Memorial,' said Mr. Dick. </p>
            <p>　　I explained to Traddles that there was a difficulty in keeping 
              King Charles the First out of Mr. Dick's manuscripts; Mr. Dick in 
              the meanwhile looking very deferentially and seriously at Traddles, 
              and sucking his thumb. </p>
            <p>　　'But these writings, you know, that I speak of, are already drawn 
              up and finished,' said Traddles after a little consideration. 'Mr. 
              Dick has nothing to do with them. Wouldn't that make a difference, 
              Copperfield? At all events, wouldn't it be well to try?' </p>
            <p>　　This gave us new hope. Traddles and I laying our heads together 
              apart, while Mr. Dick anxiously watched us from his chair, we concocted 
              a scheme in virtue of which we got him to work next day, with triumphant 
              success. </p>
            <p>　　On a table by the window in Buckingham Street, we set out the 
              work Traddles procured for him - which was to make, I forget how 
              many copies of a legal document about some right of way - and on 
              another table we spread the last unfinished original of the great 
              Memorial. Our instructions to Mr. Dick were that he should copy 
              exactly what he had before him, without the least departure from 
              the original; and that when he felt it necessary to make the slightest 
              allusion to King Charles the First, he should fly to the Memorial. 
              We exhorted him to be resolute in this, and left my aunt to observe 
              him. My aunt reported to us, afterwards, that, at first, he was 
              like a man playing the kettle-drums, and constantly divided his 
              attentions between the two; but that, finding this confuse and fatigue 
              him, and having his copy there, plainly before his eyes, he soon 
              sat at it in an orderly business-like manner, and postponed the 
              Memorial to a more convenient time. In a word, although we took 
              great care that he should have no more to do than was good for him, 
              and although he did not begin with the beginning of a week, he earned 
              by the following Saturday night ten shillings and nine-pence; and 
              never, while I live, shall I forget his going about to all the shops 
              in the neighbourhood to change this treasure into sixpences, or 
              his bringing them to my aunt arranged in the form of a heart upon 
              a waiter, with tears of joy and pride in his eyes. He was like one 
              under the propitious influence of a charm, from the moment of his 
              being usefully employed; and if there were a happy man in the world, 
              that Saturday night, it was the grateful creature who thought my 
              aunt the most wonderful woman in existence, and me the most wonderful 
              young man. </p>
            <p>　　'No starving now, Trotwood,' said Mr. Dick, shaking hands with 
              me in a corner. 'I'll provide for her, Sir!' and he flourished his 
              ten fingers in the air, as if they were ten banks. </p>
            <p>　　I hardly know which was the better pleased, Traddles or I. 'It 
              really,' said Traddles, suddenly, taking a letter out of his pocket, 
              and giving it to me, 'put Mr. Micawber quite out of my head!' </p>
            <p>　　The letter (Mr. Micawber never missed any possible opportunity 
              of writing a letter) was addressed to me, 'By the kindness of T. 
              Traddles, Esquire, of the Inner Temple.' It ran thus: - </p>
            <p>　　 'MY DEAR COPPERFIELD, </p>
            <p>　　'You may possibly not be unprepared to receive the intimation 
              that something has turned up. I may have mentioned to you on a former 
              occasion that I was in expectation of such an event. </p>
            <p>　　'I am about to establish myself in one of the provincial towns 
              of our favoured island (where the society may be described as a 
              happy admixture of the agricultural and the clerical), in immediate 
              connexion with one of the learned professions. Mrs. Micawber and 
              our offspring will accompany me. Our ashes, at a future period, 
              will probably be found commingled in the cemetery attached to a 
              venerable pile, for which the spot to which I refer has acquired 
              a reputation, shall I say from China to Peru? </p>
            <p>　　'In bidding adieu to the modern Babylon, where we have undergone 
              many vicissitudes, I trust not ignobly, Mrs. Micawber and myself 
              cannot disguise from our minds that we part, it may be for years 
              and it may be for ever, with an individual linked by strong associations 
              to the altar of our domestic life. If, on the eve of such a departure, 
              you will accompany our mutual friend, Mr. Thomas Traddles, to our 
              present abode, and there reciprocate the wishes natural to the occasion, 
              you will confer a Boon </p>
            <p>　　 'On 'One 'Who 'Is 'Ever yours, 'WILKINS MICAWBER.' </p>
            <p>　　 I was glad to find that Mr. Micawber had got rid of his dust 
              and ashes, and that something really had turned up at last. Learning 
              from Traddles that the invitation referred to the evening then wearing 
              away, I expressed my readiness to do honour to it; and we went off 
              together to the lodging which Mr. Micawber occupied as Mr. Mortimer, 
              and which was situated near the top of the Gray's Inn Road. </p>
            <p>　　The resources of this lodging were so limited, that we found 
              the twins, now some eight or nine years old, reposing in a turn-up 
              bedstead in the family sitting-room, where Mr. Micawber had prepared, 
              in a wash-hand-stand jug, what he called 'a Brew' of the agreeable 
              beverage for which he was famous. I had the pleasure, on this occasion, 
              of renewing the acquaintance of Master Micawber, whom I found a 
              promising boy of about twelve or thirteen, very subject to that 
              restlessness of limb which is not an unfrequent phenomenon in youths 
              of his age. I also became once more known to his sister, Miss Micawber, 
              in whom, as Mr. Micawber told us, 'her mother renewed her youth, 
              like the Phoenix'. </p>
            <p>　　'My dear Copperfield,' said Mr. Micawber, 'yourself and Mr. Traddles 
              find us on the brink of migration, and will excuse any little discomforts 
              incidental to that position.' </p>
            <p>　　Glancing round as I made a suitable reply, I observed that the 
              family effects were already packed, and that the amount of luggage 
              was by no means overwhelming. I congratulated Mrs. Micawber on the 
              approaching change. </p>
            <p>　　'My dear Mr. Copperfield,' said Mrs. Micawber, 'of your friendly 
              interest in all our affairs, I am well assured. My family may consider 
              it banishment, if they please; but I am a wife and mother, and I 
              never will desert Mr. Micawber.' </p>
            <p>　　Traddles, appealed to by Mrs. Micawber's eye, feelingly acquiesced. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'That,' said Mrs. Micawber, 'that, at least, is my view, my dear 
              Mr. Copperfield and Mr. Traddles, of the obligation which I took 
              upon myself when I repeated the irrevocable words, &quot;I, Emma, 
              take thee, Wilkins.&quot; I read the service over with a flat-candle 
              on the previous night, and the conclusion I derived from it was, 
              that I never could desert Mr. Micawber. And,' said Mrs. Micawber, 
              'though it is possible I may be mistaken in my view of the ceremony, 
              I never will!' </p>
            <p>　　'My dear,' said Mr. Micawber, a little impatiently, 'I am not 
              conscious that you are expected to do anything of the sort.' </p>
            <p>　　'I am aware, my dear Mr. Copperfield,' pursued Mrs. Micawber, 
              'that I am now about to cast my lot among strangers; and I am also 
              aware that the various members of my family, to whom Mr. Micawber 
              has written in the most gentlemanly terms, announcing that fact, 
              have not taken the least notice of Mr. Micawber's communication. 
              Indeed I may be superstitious,' said Mrs. Micawber, 'but it appears 
              to me that Mr. Micawber is destined never to receive any answers 
              whatever to the great majority of the communications he writes. 
              I may augur, from the silence of my family, that they object to 
              the resolution I have taken; but I should not allow myself to be 
              swerved from the path of duty, Mr. Copperfield, even by my papa 
              and mama, were they still living.' </p>
            <p>　　I expressed my opinion that this was going in the right direction. 
              'It may be a sacrifice,' said Mrs. Micawber, 'to immure one's-self 
              in a Cathedral town; but surely, Mr. Copperfield, if it is a sacrifice 
              in me, it is much more a sacrifice in a man of Mr. Micawber's abilities.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Oh! You are going to a Cathedral town?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber, who had been helping us all, out of the wash-hand-stand 
              jug, replied: </p>
            <p>　　'To Canterbury. In fact, my dear Copperfield, I have entered 
              into arrangements, by virtue of which I stand pledged and contracted 
              to our friend Heep, to assist and serve him in the capacity of - 
              and to be - his confidential clerk.' </p>
            <p>　　I stared at Mr. Micawber, who greatly enjoyed my surprise. </p>
            <p>　　'I am bound to state to you,' he said, with an official air, 
              'that the business habits, and the prudent suggestions, of Mrs. 
              Micawber, have in a great measure conduced to this result. The gauntlet, 
              to which Mrs. Micawber referred upon a former occasion, being thrown 
              down in the form of an advertisement, was taken up by my friend 
              Heep, and led to a mutual recognition. Of my friend Heep,' said 
              Mr. Micawber, 'who is a man of remarkable shrewdness, I desire to 
              speak with all possible respect. My friend Heep has not fixed the 
              positive remuneration at too high a figure, but he has made a great 
              deal, in the way of extrication from the pressure of pecuniary difficulties, 
              contingent on the value of my services; and on the value of those 
              services I pin my faith. Such address and intelligence as I chance 
              to possess,' said Mr. Micawber, boastfully disparaging himself, 
              with the old genteel air, 'will be devoted to my friend Heep's service. 
              I have already some acquaintance with the law - as a defendant on 
              civil process - and I shall immediately apply myself to the Commentaries 
              of one of the most eminent and remarkable of our English jurists. 
              I believe it is unnecessary to add that I allude to Mr. justice 
              Blackstone.' </p>
            <p>　　These observations, and indeed the greater part of the observations 
              made that evening, were interrupted by Mrs. Micawber's discovering 
              that Master Micawber was sitting on his boots, or holding his head 
              on with both arms as if he felt it loose, or accidentally kicking 
              Traddles under the table, or shuffling his feet over one another, 
              or producing them at distances from himself apparently outrageous 
              to nature, or lying sideways with his hair among the wine-glasses, 
              or developing his restlessness of limb in some other form incompatible 
              with the general interests of society; and by Master Micawber's 
              receiving those discoveries in a resentful spirit. I sat all the 
              while, amazed by Mr. Micawber's disclosure, and wondering what it 
              meant; until Mrs. Micawber resumed the thread of the discourse, 
              and claimed my attention. </p>
            <p>　　'What I particularly request Mr. Micawber to be careful of, is,' 
              said Mrs. Micawber, 'that he does not, my dear Mr. Copperfield, 
              in applying himself to this subordinate branch of the law, place 
              it out of his power to rise, ultimately, to the top of the tree. 
              I am convinced that Mr. Micawber, giving his mind to a profession 
              so adapted to his fertile resources, and his flow of language, must 
              distinguish himself. Now, for example, Mr. Traddles,' said Mrs. 
              Micawber, assuming a profound air, 'a judge, or even say a Chancellor. 
              Does an individual place himself beyond the pale of those preferments 
              by entering on such an office as Mr. Micawber has accepted?' </p>
            <p>　　'My dear,' observed Mr. Micawber - but glancing inquisitively 
              at Traddles, too; 'we have time enough before us, for the consideration 
              of those questions.' </p>
            <p>　　'Micawber,' she returned, 'no! Your mistake in life is, that 
              you do not look forward far enough. You are bound, in justice to 
              your family, if not to yourself, to take in at a comprehensive glance 
              the extremest point in the horizon to which your abilities may lead 
              you.' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber coughed, and drank his punch with an air of exceeding 
              satisfaction - still glancing at Traddles, as if he desired to have 
              his opinion. </p>
            <p>　　'Why, the plain state of the case, Mrs. Micawber,' said Traddles, 
              mildly breaking the truth to her. 'I mean the real prosaic fact, 
              you know -' </p>
            <p>　　'Just so,' said Mrs. Micawber, 'my dear Mr. Traddles, I wish 
              to be as prosaic and literal as possible on a subject of so much 
              importance.' </p>
            <p>　　'- Is,' said Traddles, 'that this branch of the law, even if 
              Mr. Micawber were a regular solicitor -' </p>
            <p>　　'Exactly so,' returned Mrs. Micawber. ('Wilkins, you are squinting, 
              and will not be able to get your eyes back.') </p>
            <p>　　'- Has nothing,' pursued Traddles, 'to do with that. Only a barrister 
              is eligible for such preferments; and Mr. Micawber could not be 
              a barrister, without being entered at an inn of court as a student, 
              for five years.' </p>
            <p>　　'Do I follow you?' said Mrs. Micawber, with her most affable 
              air of business. 'Do I understand, my dear Mr. Traddles, that, at 
              the expiration of that period, Mr. Micawber would be eligible as 
              a Judge or Chancellor?' </p>
            <p>　　'He would be ELIGIBLE,' returned Traddles, with a strong emphasis 
              on that word. </p>
            <p>　　'Thank you,' said Mrs. Micawber. 'That is quite sufficient. If 
              such is the case, and Mr. Micawber forfeits no privilege by entering 
              on these duties, my anxiety is set at rest. I speak,' said Mrs. 
              Micawber, 'as a female, necessarily; but I have always been of opinion 
              that Mr. Micawber possesses what I have heard my papa call, when 
              I lived at home, the judicial mind; and I hope Mr. Micawber is now 
              entering on a field where that mind will develop itself, and take 
              a commanding station.' </p>
            <p>　　I quite believe that Mr. Micawber saw himself, in his judicial 
              mind's eye, on the woolsack. He passed his hand complacently over 
              his bald head, and said with ostentatious resignation: </p>
            <p>　　'My dear, we will not anticipate the decrees of fortune. If I 
              am reserved to wear a wig, I am at least prepared, externally,' 
              in allusion to his baldness, 'for that distinction. I do not,' said 
              Mr. Micawber, 'regret my hair, and I may have been deprived of it 
              for a specific purpose. I cannot say. It is my intention, my dear 
              Copperfield, to educate my son for the Church; I will not deny that 
              I should be happy, on his account, to attain to eminence.' </p>
            <p>　　'For the Church?' said I, still pondering, between whiles, on 
              Uriah Heep. </p>
            <p>　　'Yes,' said Mr. Micawber. 'He has a remarkable head-voice, and 
              will commence as a chorister. Our residence at Canterbury, and our 
              local connexion, will, no doubt, enable him to take advantage of 
              any vacancy that may arise in the Cathedral corps.' </p>
            <p>　　On looking at Master Micawber again, I saw that he had a certain 
              expression of face, as if his voice were behind his eyebrows; where 
              it presently appeared to be, on his singing us (as an alternative 
              between that and bed) 'The Wood-Pecker tapping'. After many compliments 
              on this performance, we fell into some general conversation; and 
              as I was too full of my desperate intentions to keep my altered 
              circumstances to myself, I made them known to Mr. and Mrs. Micawber. 
              I cannot express how extremely delighted they both were, by the 
              idea of my aunt's being in difficulties; and how comfortable and 
              friendly it made them. </p>
            <p>　　When we were nearly come to the last round of the punch, I addressed 
              myself to Traddles, and reminded him that we must not separate, 
              without wishing our friends health, happiness, and success in their 
              new career. I begged Mr. Micawber to fill us bumpers, and proposed 
              the toast in due form: shaking hands with him across the table, 
              and kissing Mrs. Micawber, to commemorate that eventful occasion. 
              Traddles imitated me in the first particular, but did not consider 
              himself a sufficiently old friend to venture on the second. </p>
            <p>　　'My dear Copperfield,' said Mr. Micawber, rising with one of 
              his thumbs in each of his waistcoat pockets, 'the companion of my 
              youth: if I may be allowed the expression - and my esteemed friend 
              Traddles: if I may be permitted to call him so - will allow me, 
              on the part of Mrs. Micawber, myself, and our offspring, to thank 
              them in the warmest and most uncompromising terms for their good 
              wishes. It may be expected that on the eve of a migration which 
              will consign us to a perfectly new existence,' Mr. Micawber spoke 
              as if they were going five hundred thousand miles, 'I should offer 
              a few valedictory remarks to two such friends as I see before me. 
              But all that I have to say in this way, I have said. Whatever station 
              in society I may attain, through the medium of the learned profession 
              of which I am about to become an unworthy member, I shall endeavour 
              not to disgrace, and Mrs. Micawber will be safe to adorn. Under 
              the temporary pressure of pecuniary liabilities, contracted with 
              a view to their immediate liquidation, but remaining unliquidated 
              through a combination of circumstances, I have been under the necessity 
              of assuming a garb from which my natural instincts recoil - I allude 
              to spectacles - and possessing myself of a cognomen, to which I 
              can establish no legitimate pretensions. All I have to say on that 
              score is, that the cloud has passed from the dreary scene, and the 
              God of Day is once more high upon the mountain tops. On Monday next, 
              on the arrival of the four o'clock afternoon coach at Canterbury, 
              my foot will be on my native heath - my name, Micawber!' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber resumed his seat on the close of these remarks, 
              and drank two glasses of punch in grave succession. He then said 
              with much solemnity: </p>
            <p>　　'One thing more I have to do, before this separation is complete, 
              and that is to perform an act of justice. My friend Mr. Thomas Traddles 
              has, on two several occasions, &quot;put his name&quot;, if I may 
              use a common expression, to bills of exchange for my accommodation. 
              On the first occasion Mr. Thomas Traddles was left - let me say, 
              in short, in the lurch. The fulfilment of the second has not yet 
              arrived. The amount of the first obligation,' here Mr. Micawber 
              carefully referred to papers, 'was, I believe, twenty-three, four, 
              nine and a half, of the second, according to my entry of that transaction, 
              eighteen, six, two. These sums, united, make a total, if my calculation 
              is correct, amounting to forty-one, ten, eleven and a half. My friend 
              Copperfield will perhaps do me the favour to check that total?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　I did so and found it correct. </p>
            <p>　　'To leave this metropolis,' said Mr. Micawber, 'and my friend 
              Mr. Thomas Traddles, without acquitting myself of the pecuniary 
              part of this obligation, would weigh upon my mind to an insupportable 
              extent. I have, therefore, prepared for my friend Mr. Thomas Traddles, 
              and I now hold in my hand, a document, which accomplishes the desired 
              object. I beg to hand to my friend Mr. Thomas Traddles my I.O.U. 
              for forty-one, ten, eleven and a half, and I am happy to recover 
              my moral dignity, and to know that I can once more walk erect before 
              my fellow man!' </p>
            <p>　　With this introduction (which greatly affected him), Mr. Micawber 
              placed his I.O.U. in the hands of Traddles, and said he wished him 
              well in every relation of life. I am persuaded, not only that this 
              was quite the same to Mr. Micawber as paying the money, but that 
              Traddles himself hardly knew the difference until he had had time 
              to think about it. Mr. Micawber walked so erect before his fellow 
              man, on the strength of this virtuous action, that his chest looked 
              half as broad again when he lighted us downstairs. We parted with 
              great heartiness on both sides; and when I had seen Traddles to 
              his own door, and was going home alone, I thought, among the other 
              odd and contradictory things I mused upon, that, slippery as Mr. 
              Micawber was, I was probably indebted to some compassionate recollection 
              he retained of me as his boy-lodger, for never having been asked 
              by him for money. I certainly should not have had the moral courage 
              to refuse it; and I have no doubt he knew that (to his credit be 
              it written), quite as well as I did. </p>

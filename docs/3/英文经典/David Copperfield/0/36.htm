            <p>　　 As soon as I could recover my presence of mind, which quite 
              deserted me in the first overpowering shock of my aunt's intelligence, 
              I proposed to Mr. Dick to come round to the chandler's shop, and 
              take possession of the bed which Mr. Peggotty had lately vacated. 
              The chandler's shop being in Hungerford Market, and Hungerford Market 
              being a very different place in those days, there was a low wooden 
              colonnade before the door (not very unlike that before the house 
              where the little man and woman used to live, in the old weather-glass), 
              which pleased Mr. Dick mightily. The glory of lodging over this 
              structure would have compensated him, I dare say, for many inconveniences; 
              but, as there were really few to bear, beyond the compound of flavours 
              I have already mentioned, and perhaps the want of a little more 
              elbow-room, he was perfectly charmed with his accommodation. Mrs. 
              Crupp had indignantly assured him that there wasn't room to swing 
              a cat there; but, as Mr. Dick justly observed to me, sitting down 
              on the foot of the bed, nursing his leg, 'You know, Trotwood, I 
              don't want to swing a cat. I never do swing a cat. Therefore, what 
              does that signify to ME!' </p>
            <p>　　I tried to ascertain whether Mr. Dick had any understanding of 
              the causes of this sudden and great change in my aunt's affairs. 
              As I might have expected, he had none at all. The only account he 
              could give of it was, that my aunt had said to him, the day before 
              yesterday, 'Now, Dick, are you really and truly the philosopher 
              I take you for?' That then he had said, Yes, he hoped so. That then 
              my aunt had said, 'Dick, I am ruined.' That then he had said, 'Oh, 
              indeed!' That then my aunt had praised him highly, which he was 
              glad of. And that then they had come to me, and had had bottled 
              porter and sandwiches on the road. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Dick was so very complacent, sitting on the foot of the bed, 
              nursing his leg, and telling me this, with his eyes wide open and 
              a surprised smile, that I am sorry to say I was provoked into explaining 
              to him that ruin meant distress, want, and starvation; but I was 
              soon bitterly reproved for this harshness, by seeing his face turn 
              pale, and tears course down his lengthened cheeks, while he fixed 
              upon me a look of such unutterable woe, that it might have softened 
              a far harder heart than mine. I took infinitely greater pains to 
              cheer him up again than I had taken to depress him; and I soon understood 
              (as I ought to have known at first) that he had been so confident, 
              merely because of his faith in the wisest and most wonderful of 
              women, and his unbounded reliance on my intellectual resources. 
              The latter, I believe, he considered a match for any kind of disaster 
              not absolutely mortal. </p>
            <p>　　'What can we do, Trotwood?' said Mr. Dick. 'There's the Memorial 
              -' </p>
            <p>　　'To be sure there is,' said I. 'But all we can do just now, Mr. 
              Dick, is to keep a cheerful countenance, and not let my aunt see 
              that we are thinking about it.' </p>
            <p>　　He assented to this in the most earnest manner; and implored 
              me, if I should see him wandering an inch out of the right course, 
              to recall him by some of those superior methods which were always 
              at my command. But I regret to state that the fright I had given 
              him proved too much for his best attempts at concealment. All the 
              evening his eyes wandered to my aunt's face, with an expression 
              of the most dismal apprehension, as if he saw her growing thin on 
              the spot. He was conscious of this, and put a constraint upon his 
              head; but his keeping that immovable, and sitting rolling his eyes 
              like a piece of machinery, did not mend the matter at all. I saw 
              him look at the loaf at supper (which happened to be a small one), 
              as if nothing else stood between us and famine; and when my aunt 
              insisted on his making his customary repast, I detected him in the 
              act of pocketing fragments of his bread and cheese; I have no doubt 
              for the purpose of reviving us with those savings, when we should 
              have reached an advanced stage of attenuation. </p>
            <p>　　My aunt, on the other hand, was in a composed frame of mind, 
              which was a lesson to all of us - to me, I am sure. She was extremely 
              gracious to Peggotty, except when I inadvertently called her by 
              that name; and, strange as I knew she felt in London, appeared quite 
              at home. She was to have my bed, and I was to lie in the sitting-room, 
              to keep guard over her. She made a great point of being so near 
              the river, in case of a conflagration; and I suppose really did 
              find some satisfaction in that circumstance. </p>
            <p>　　'Trot, my dear,' said my aunt, when she saw me making preparations 
              for compounding her usual night-draught, 'No!' </p>
            <p>　　'Nothing, aunt?' </p>
            <p>　　'Not wine, my dear. Ale.' </p>
            <p>　　'But there is wine here, aunt. And you always have it made of 
              wine.' </p>
            <p>　　'Keep that, in case of sickness,' said my aunt. 'We mustn't use 
              it carelessly, Trot. Ale for me. Half a pint.' </p>
            <p>　　I thought Mr. Dick would have fallen, insensible. My aunt being 
              resolute, I went out and got the ale myself. As it was growing late, 
              Peggotty and Mr. Dick took that opportunity of repairing to the 
              chandler's shop together. I parted from him, poor fellow, at the 
              corner of the street, with his great kite at his back, a very monument 
              of human misery. </p>
            <p>　　My aunt was walking up and down the room when I returned, crimping 
              the borders of her nightcap with her fingers. I warmed the ale and 
              made the toast on the usual infallible principles. When it was ready 
              for her, she was ready for it, with her nightcap on, and the skirt 
              of her gown turned back on her knees. </p>
            <p>　　'My dear,' said my aunt, after taking a spoonful of it; 'it's 
              a great deal better than wine. Not half so bilious.' </p>
            <p>　　I suppose I looked doubtful, for she added: </p>
            <p>　　'Tut, tut, child. If nothing worse than Ale happens to us, we 
              are well off.' </p>
            <p>　　'I should think so myself, aunt, I am sure,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Well, then, why DON'T you think so?' said my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　'Because you and I are very different people,' I returned. </p>
            <p>　　'Stuff and nonsense, Trot!' replied my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　MY aunt went on with a quiet enjoyment, in which there was very 
              little affectation, if any; drinking the warm ale with a tea-spoon, 
              and soaking her strips of toast in it. </p>
            <p>　　'Trot,' said she, 'I don't care for strange faces in general, 
              but I rather like that Barkis of yours, do you know!' </p>
            <p>　　'It's better than a hundred pounds to hear you say so!' said 
              I. </p>
            <p>　　'It's a most extraordinary world,' observed my aunt, rubbing 
              her nose; 'how that woman ever got into it with that name, is unaccountable 
              to me. It would be much more easy to be born a Jackson, or something 
              of that sort, one would think.' </p>
            <p>　　'Perhaps she thinks so, too; it's not her fault,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'I suppose not,' returned my aunt, rather grudging the admission; 
              'but it's very aggravating. However, she's Barkis now. That's some 
              comfort. Barkis is uncommonly fond of you, Trot.' </p>
            <p>　　'There is nothing she would leave undone to prove it,' said I. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Nothing, I believe,' returned my aunt. 'Here, the poor fool 
              has been begging and praying about handing over some of her money 
              - because she has got too much of it. A simpleton!' </p>
            <p>　　My aunt's tears of pleasure were positively trickling down into 
              the warm ale. </p>
            <p>　　'She's the most ridiculous creature that ever was born,' said 
              my aunt. 'I knew, from the first moment when I saw her with that 
              poor dear blessed baby of a mother of yours, that she was the most 
              ridiculous of mortals. But there are good points in Barkis!' </p>
            <p>　　Affecting to laugh, she got an opportunity of putting her hand 
              to her eyes. Having availed herself of it, she resumed her toast 
              and her discourse together. </p>
            <p>　　'Ah! Mercy upon us!' sighed my aunt. 'I know all about it, Trot! 
              Barkis and myself had quite a gossip while you were out with Dick. 
              I know all about it. I don't know where these wretched girls expect 
              to go to, for my part. I wonder they don't knock out their brains 
              against - against mantelpieces,' said my aunt; an idea which was 
              probably suggested to her by her contemplation of mine. </p>
            <p>　　'Poor Emily!' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, don't talk to me about poor,' returned my aunt. 'She should 
              have thought of that, before she caused so much misery! Give me 
              a kiss, Trot. I am sorry for your early experience.' </p>
            <p>　　As I bent forward, she put her tumbler on my knee to detain me, 
              and said: </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, Trot, Trot! And so you fancy yourself in love! Do you?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Fancy, aunt!' I exclaimed, as red as I could be. 'I adore her 
              with my whole soul!' </p>
            <p>　　'Dora, indeed!' returned my aunt. 'And you mean to say the little 
              thing is very fascinating, I suppose?' </p>
            <p>　　'My dear aunt,' I replied, 'no one can form the least idea what 
              she is!' </p>
            <p>　　'Ah! And not silly?' said my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　'Silly, aunt!' </p>
            <p>　　I seriously believe it had never once entered my head for a single 
              moment, to consider whether she was or not. I resented the idea, 
              of course; but I was in a manner struck by it, as a new one altogether. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Not light-headed?' said my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　'Light-headed, aunt!' I could only repeat this daring speculation 
              with the same kind of feeling with which I had repeated the preceding 
              question. </p>
            <p>　　'Well, well!' said my aunt. 'I only ask. I don't depreciate her. 
              Poor little couple! And so you think you were formed for one another, 
              and are to go through a party-supper-table kind of life, like two 
              pretty pieces of confectionery, do you, Trot?' </p>
            <p>　　She asked me this so kindly, and with such a gentle air, half 
              playful and half sorrowful, that I was quite touched. </p>
            <p>　　'We are young and inexperienced, aunt, I know,' I replied; 'and 
              I dare say we say and think a good deal that is rather foolish. 
              But we love one another truly, I am sure. If I thought Dora could 
              ever love anybody else, or cease to love me; or that I could ever 
              love anybody else, or cease to love her; I don't know what I should 
              do - go out of my mind, I think!' </p>
            <p>　　'Ah, Trot!' said my aunt, shaking her head, and smiling gravely; 
              'blind, blind, blind!' </p>
            <p>　　'Someone that I know, Trot,' my aunt pursued, after a pause, 
              'though of a very pliant disposition, has an earnestness of affection 
              in him that reminds me of poor Baby. Earnestness is what that Somebody 
              must look for, to sustain him and improve him, Trot. Deep, downright, 
              faithful earnestness.' </p>
            <p>　　'If you only knew the earnestness of Dora, aunt!' I cried. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, Trot!' she said again; 'blind, blind!' and without knowing 
              why, I felt a vague unhappy loss or want of something overshadow 
              me like a cloud. </p>
            <p>　　'However,' said my aunt, 'I don't want to put two young creatures 
              out of conceit with themselves, or to make them unhappy; so, though 
              it is a girl and boy attachment, and girl and boy attachments very 
              often - mind! I don't say always! - come to nothing, still we'll 
              be serious about it, and hope for a prosperous issue one of these 
              days. There's time enough for it to come to anything!' </p>
            <p>　　This was not upon the whole very comforting to a rapturous lover; 
              but I was glad to have my aunt in my confidence, and I was mindful 
              of her being fatigued. So I thanked her ardently for this mark of 
              her affection, and for all her other kindnesses towards me; and 
              after a tender good night, she took her nightcap into my bedroom. 
            </p>
            <p>　　How miserable I was, when I lay down! How I thought and thought 
              about my being poor, in Mr. Spenlow's eyes; about my not being what 
              I thought I was, when I proposed to Dora; about the chivalrous necessity 
              of telling Dora what my worldly condition was, and releasing her 
              from her engagement if she thought fit; about how I should contrive 
              to live, during the long term of my articles, when I was earning 
              nothing; about doing something to assist my aunt, and seeing no 
              way of doing anything; about coming down to have no money in my 
              pocket, and to wear a shabby coat, and to be able to carry Dora 
              no little presents, and to ride no gallant greys, and to show myself 
              in no agreeable light! Sordid and selfish as I knew it was, and 
              as I tortured myself by knowing that it was, to let my mind run 
              on my own distress so much, I was so devoted to Dora that I could 
              not help it. I knew that it was base in me not to think more of 
              my aunt, and less of myself; but, so far, selfishness was inseparable 
              from Dora, and I could not put Dora on one side for any mortal creature. 
              How exceedingly miserable I was, that night! </p>
            <p>　　As to sleep, I had dreams of poverty in all sorts of shapes, 
              but I seemed to dream without the previous ceremony of going to 
              sleep. Now I was ragged, wanting to sell Dora matches, six bundles 
              for a halfpenny; now I was at the office in a nightgown and boots, 
              remonstrated with by Mr. Spenlow on appearing before the clients 
              in that airy attire; now I was hungrily picking up the crumbs that 
              fell from old Tiffey's daily biscuit, regularly eaten when St. Paul's 
              struck one; now I was hopelessly endeavouring to get a licence to 
              marry Dora, having nothing but one of Uriah Heep's gloves to offer 
              in exchange, which the whole Commons rejected; and still, more or 
              less conscious of my own room, I was always tossing about like a 
              distressed ship in a sea of bed-clothes. </p>
            <p>　　My aunt was restless, too, for I frequently heard her walking 
              to and fro. Two or,three times in the course of the night, attired 
              in a long flannel wrapper in which she looked seven feet high, she 
              appeared, like a disturbed ghost, in my room, and came to the side 
              of the sofa on which I lay. On the first occasion I started up in 
              alarm, to learn that she inferred from a particular light in the 
              sky, that Westminster Abbey was on fire; and to be consulted in 
              reference to the probability of its igniting Buckingham Street, 
              in case the wind changed. Lying still, after that, I found that 
              she sat down near me, whispering to herself 'Poor boy!' And then 
              it made me twenty times more wretched, to know how unselfishly mindful 
              she was of me, and how selfishly mindful I was of myself. </p>
            <p>　　It was difficult to believe that a night so long to me, could 
              be short to anybody else. This consideration set me thinking and 
              thinking of an imaginary party where people were dancing the hours 
              away, until that became a dream too, and I heard the music incessantly 
              playing one tune, and saw Dora incessantly dancing one dance, without 
              taking the least notice of me. The man who had been playing the 
              harp all night, was trying in vain to cover it with an ordinary-sized 
              nightcap, when I awoke; or I should rather say, when I left off 
              trying to go to sleep, and saw the sun shining in through the window 
              at last. </p>
            <p>　　There was an old Roman bath in those days at the bottom of one 
              of the streets out of the Strand - it may be there still - in which 
              I have had many a cold plunge. Dressing myself as quietly as I could, 
              and leaving Peggotty to look after my aunt, I tumbled head foremost 
              into it, and then went for a walk to Hampstead. I had a hope that 
              this brisk treatment might freshen my wits a little; and I think 
              it did them good, for I soon came to the conclusion that the first 
              step I ought to take was, to try if my articles could be cancelled 
              and the premium recovered. I got some breakfast on the Heath, and 
              walked back to Doctors' Commons, along the watered roads </p>
            <p>　　and through a pleasant smell of summer flowers, growing in gardens 
              and carried into town on hucksters' heads, intent on this first 
              effort to meet our altered circumstances. </p>
            <p>　　I arrived at the office so soon, after all, that I had half an 
              hour's loitering about the Commons, before old Tiffey, who was always 
              first, appeared with his key. Then I sat down in my shady corner, 
              looking up at the sunlight on the opposite chimney-pots, and thinking 
              about Dora; until Mr. Spenlow came in, crisp and curly. </p>
            <p>　　'How are you, Copperfield?' said he. 'Fine morning!' </p>
            <p>　　'Beautiful morning, sir,' said I. 'Could I say a word to you 
              before you go into Court?' </p>
            <p>　　'By all means,' said he. 'Come into my room.' </p>
            <p>　　I followed him into his room, and he began putting on his gown, 
              and touching himself up before a little glass he had, hanging inside 
              a closet door. </p>
            <p>　　'I am sorry to say,' said I, 'that I have some rather disheartening 
              intelligence from my aunt.' </p>
            <p>　　'No!' said he. 'Dear me! Not paralysis, I hope?' </p>
            <p>　　'It has no reference to her health, sir,' I replied. 'She has 
              met with some large losses. In fact, she has very little left, indeed.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'You as-tound me, Copperfield!' cried Mr. Spenlow. </p>
            <p>　　I shook my head. 'Indeed, sir,' said I, 'her affairs are so changed, 
              that I wished to ask you whether it would be possible - at a sacrifice 
              on our part of some portion of the premium, of course,' I put in 
              this, on the spur of the moment, warned by the blank expression 
              of his face - 'to cancel my articles?' </p>
            <p>　　What it cost me to make this proposal, nobody knows. It was like 
              asking, as a favour, to be sentenced to transportation from Dora. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'To cancel your articles, Copperfield? Cancel?' </p>
            <p>　　I explained with tolerable firmness, that I really did not know 
              where my means of subsistence were to come from, unless I could 
              earn them for myself. I had no fear for the future, I said - and 
              I laid great emphasis on that, as if to imply that I should still 
              be decidedly eligible for a son-in-law one of these days - but, 
              for the present, I was thrown upon my own resources. 'I am extremely 
              sorry to hear this, Copperfield,' said Mr. Spenlow. 'Extremely sorry. 
              It is not usual to cancel articles for any such reason. It is not 
              a professional course of proceeding. It is not a convenient precedent 
              at all. Far from it. At the same time -' </p>
            <p>　　'You are very good, sir,' I murmured, anticipating a concession. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Not at all. Don't mention it,' said Mr. Spenlow. 'At the same 
              time, I was going to say, if it had been my lot to have my hands 
              unfettered - if I had not a partner - Mr. Jorkins -' </p>
            <p>　　My hopes were dashed in a moment, but I made another effort. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Do you think, sir,' said I, 'if I were to mention it to Mr. 
              Jorkins -' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Spenlow shook his head discouragingly. 'Heaven forbid, Copperfield,' 
              he replied, 'that I should do any man an injustice: still less, 
              Mr. jorkins. But I know my partner, Copperfield. Mr. jorkins is 
              not a man to respond to a proposition of this peculiar nature. Mr. 
              jorkins is very difficult to move from the beaten track. You know 
              what he is!' </p>
            <p>　　I am sure I knew nothing about him, except that he had originally 
              been alone in the business, and now lived by himself in a house 
              near Montagu Square, which was fearfully in want of painting; that 
              he came very late of a day, and went away very early; that he never 
              appeared to be consulted about anything; and that he had a dingy 
              little black-hole of his own upstairs, where no business was ever 
              done, and where there was a yellow old cartridge-paper pad upon 
              his desk, unsoiled by ink, and reported to be twenty years of age. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Would you object to my mentioning it to him, sir?' I asked. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'By no means,' said Mr. Spenlow. 'But I have some experience 
              of Mr. jorkins, Copperfield. I wish it were otherwise, for I should 
              be happy to meet your views in any respect. I cannot have the objection 
              to your mentioning it to Mr. jorkins, Copperfield, if you think 
              it worth while.' </p>
            <p>　　Availing myself of this permission, which was given with a warm 
              shake of the hand, I sat thinking about Dora, and looking at the 
              sunlight stealing from the chimney-pots down the wall of the opposite 
              house, until Mr. jorkins came. I then went up to Mr. jorkins's room, 
              and evidently astonished Mr. jorkins very much by making my appearance 
              there. </p>
            <p>　　'Come in, Mr. Copperfield,' said Mr. jorkins. 'Come in!' </p>
            <p>　　I went in, and sat down; and stated my case to Mr. jorkins pretty 
              much as I had stated it to Mr. Spenlow. Mr. Jorkins was not by any 
              means the awful creature one might have expected, but a large, mild, 
              smooth-faced man of sixty, who took so much snuff that there was 
              a tradition in the Commons that he lived principally on that stimulant, 
              having little room in his system for any other article of diet. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'You have mentioned this to Mr. Spenlow, I suppose?' said Mr. 
              jorkins; when he had heard me, very restlessly, to an end. </p>
            <p>　　I answered Yes, and told him that Mr. Spenlow had introduced 
              his name. </p>
            <p>　　'He said I should object?' asked Mr. jorkins. </p>
            <p>　　I was obliged to admit that Mr. Spenlow had considered it probable. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'I am sorry to say, Mr. Copperfield, I can't advance your object,' 
              said Mr. jorkins, nervously. 'The fact is - but I have an appointment 
              at the Bank, if you'll have the goodness to excuse me.' </p>
            <p>　　With that he rose in a great hurry, and was going out of the 
              room, when I made bold to say that I feared, then, there was no 
              way of arranging the matter? </p>
            <p>　　'No!' said Mr. jorkins, stopping at the door to shake his head. 
              'Oh, no! I object, you know,' which he said very rapidly, and went 
              out. 'You must be aware, Mr. Copperfield,' he added, looking restlessly 
              in at the door again, 'if Mr. Spenlow objects -' </p>
            <p>　　'Personally, he does not object, sir,' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh! Personally!' repeated Mr. Jorkins, in an impatient manner. 
              'I assure you there's an objection, Mr. Copperfield. Hopeless! What 
              you wish to be done, can't be done. I - I really have got an appointment 
              at the Bank.' With that he fairly ran away; and to the best of my 
              knowledge, it was three days before he showed himself in the Commons 
              again. </p>

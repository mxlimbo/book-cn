            <p>　　 The carrier's horse was the laziest horse in the world, I should 
              hope, and shuffled along, with his head down, as if he liked to 
              keep people waiting to whom the packages were directed. I fancied, 
              indeed, that he sometimes chuckled audibly over this reflection, 
              but the carrier said he was only troubled with a cough. The carrier 
              had a way of keeping his head down, like his horse, and of drooping 
              sleepily forward as he drove, with one of his arms on each of his 
              knees. I say 'drove', but it struck me that the cart would have 
              gone to Yarmouth quite as well without him, for the horse did all 
              that; and as to conversation, he had no idea of it but whistling. 
            </p>
            <p>　　Peggotty had a basket of refreshments on her knee, which would 
              have lasted us out handsomely, if we had been going to London by 
              the same conveyance. We ate a good deal, and slept a good deal. 
              Peggotty always went to sleep with her chin upon the handle of the 
              basket, her hold of which never relaxed; and I could not have believed 
              unless I had heard her do it, that one defenceless woman could have 
              snored so much. </p>
            <p>　　We made so many deviations up and down lanes, and were such a 
              long time delivering a bedstead at a public-house, and calling at 
              other places, that I was quite tired, and very glad, when we saw 
              Yarmouth. It looked rather spongy and soppy, I thought, as I carried 
              my eye over the great dull waste that lay across the river; and 
              I could not help wondering, if the world were really as round as 
              my geography book said, how any part of it came to be so flat. But 
              I reflected that Yarmouth might be situated at one of the poles; 
              which would account for it. </p>
            <p>　　As we drew a little nearer, and saw the whole adjacent prospect 
              lying a straight low line under the sky, I hinted to Peggotty that 
              a mound or so might have improved it; and also that if the land 
              had been a little more separated from the sea, and the town and 
              the tide had not been quite so much mixed up, like toast and water, 
              it would have been nicer. But Peggotty said, with greater emphasis 
              than usual, that we must take things as we found them, and that, 
              for her part, she was proud to call herself a Yarmouth Bloater. 
            </p>
            <p>　　When we got into the street (which was strange enough to me) 
              and smelt the fish, and pitch, and oakum, and tar, and saw the sailors 
              walking about, and the carts jingling up and down over the stones, 
              I felt that I had done so busy a place an injustice; and said as 
              much to Peggotty, who heard my expressions of delight with great 
              complacency, and told me it was well known (I suppose to those who 
              had the good fortune to be born Bloaters) that Yarmouth was, upon 
              the whole, the finest place in the universe. </p>
            <p>　　'Here's my Am!' screamed Peggotty, 'growed out of knowledge!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　He was waiting for us, in fact, at the public-house; and asked 
              me how I found myself, like an old acquaintance. I did not feel, 
              at first, that I knew him as well as he knew me, because he had 
              never come to our house since the night I was born, and naturally 
              he had the advantage of me. But our intimacy was much advanced by 
              his taking me on his back to carry me home. He was, now, a huge, 
              strong fellow of six feet high, broad in proportion, and round-shouldered; 
              but with a simpering boy's face and curly light hair that gave him 
              quite a sheepish look. He was dressed in a canvas jacket, and a 
              pair of such very stiff trousers that they would have stood quite 
              as well alone, without any legs in them. And you couldn't so properly 
              have said he wore a hat, as that he was covered in a-top, like an 
              old building, with something pitchy. </p>
            <p>　　Ham carrying me on his back and a small box of ours under his 
              arm, and Peggotty carrying another small box of ours, we turned 
              down lanes bestrewn with bits of chips and little hillocks of sand, 
              and went past gas-works, rope-walks, boat-builders' yards, shipwrights' 
              yards, ship-breakers' yards, caulkers' yards, riggers' lofts, smiths' 
              forges, and a great litter of such places, until we came out upon 
              the dull waste I had already seen at a distance; when Ham said, 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Yon's our house, Mas'r Davy!' </p>
            <p>　　I looked in all directions, as far as I could stare over the 
              wilderness, and away at the sea, and away at the river, but no house 
              could I make out. There was a black barge, or some other kind of 
              superannuated boat, not far off, high and dry on the ground, with 
              an iron funnel sticking out of it for a chimney and smoking very 
              cosily; but nothing else in the way of a habitation that was visible 
              to me. </p>
            <p>　　'That's not it?' said I. 'That ship-looking thing?' </p>
            <p>　　'That's it, Mas'r Davy,' returned Ham. </p>
            <p>　　If it had been Aladdin's palace, roc's egg and all, I suppose 
              I could not have been more charmed with the romantic idea of living 
              in it. There was a delightful door cut in the side, and it was roofed 
              in, and there were little windows in it; but the wonderful charm 
              of it was, that it was a real boat which had no doubt been upon 
              the water hundreds of times, and which had never been intended to 
              be lived in, on dry land. That was the captivation of it to me. 
              If it had ever been meant to be lived in, I might have thought it 
              small, or inconvenient, or lonely; but never having been designed 
              for any such use, it became a perfect abode. </p>
            <p>　　It was beautifully clean inside, and as tidy as possible. There 
              was a table, and a Dutch clock, and a chest of drawers, and on the 
              chest of drawers there was a tea-tray with a painting on it of a 
              lady with a parasol, taking a walk with a military-looking child 
              who was trundling a hoop. The tray was kept from tumbling down, 
              by a bible; and the tray, if it had tumbled down, would have smashed 
              a quantity of cups and saucers and a teapot that were grouped around 
              the book. On the walls there were some common coloured pictures, 
              framed and glazed, of scripture subjects; such as I have never seen 
              since in the hands of pedlars, without seeing the whole interior 
              of Peggotty's brother's house again, at one view. Abraham in red 
              going to sacrifice Isaac in blue, and Daniel in yellow cast into 
              a den of green lions, were the most prominent of these. Over the 
              little mantelshelf, was a picture of the 'Sarah Jane' lugger, built 
              at Sunderland, with a real little wooden stern stuck on to it; a 
              work of art, combining composition with carpentry, which I considered 
              to be one of the most enviable possessions that the world could 
              afford. There were some hooks in the beams of the ceiling, the use 
              of which I did not divine then; and some lockers and boxes and conveniences 
              of that sort, which served for seats and eked out the chairs. </p>
            <p>　　All this I saw in the first glance after I crossed the threshold 
              - child-like, according to my theory - and then Peggotty opened 
              a little door and showed me my bedroom. It was the completest and 
              most desirable bedroom ever seen - in the stern of the vessel; with 
              a little window, where the rudder used to go through; a little looking-glass, 
              just the right height for me, nailed against the wall, and framed 
              with oyster-shells; a little bed, which there was just room enough 
              to get into; and a nosegay of seaweed in a blue mug on the table. 
              The walls were whitewashed as white as milk, and the patchwork counterpane 
              made my eyes quite ache with its brightness. One thing I particularly 
              noticed in this delightful house, was the smell of fish; which was 
              so searching, that when I took out my pocket-handkerchief to wipe 
              my nose, I found it smelt exactly as if it had wrapped up a lobster. 
              On my imparting this discovery in confidence to Peggotty, she informed 
              me that her brother dealt in lobsters, crabs, and crawfish; and 
              I afterwards found that a heap of these creatures, in a state of 
              wonderful conglomeration with one another, and never leaving off 
              pinching whatever they laid hold of, were usually to be found in 
              a little wooden outhouse where the pots and kettles were kept. </p>
            <p>　　We were welcomed by a very civil woman in a white apron, whom 
              I had seen curtseying at the door when I was on Ham's back, about 
              a quarter of a mile off. Likewise by a most beautiful little girl 
              (or I thought her so) with a necklace of blue beads on, who wouldn't 
              let me kiss her when I offered to, but ran away and hid herself. 
              By and by, when we had dined in a sumptuous manner off boiled dabs, 
              melted butter, and potatoes, with a chop for me, a hairy man with 
              a very good-natured face came home. As he called Peggotty 'Lass', 
              and gave her a hearty smack on the cheek, I had no doubt, from the 
              general propriety of her conduct, that he was her brother; and so 
              he turned out - being presently introduced to me as Mr. Peggotty, 
              the master of the house. </p>
            <p>　　'Glad to see you, sir,' said Mr. Peggotty. 'You'll find us rough, 
              sir, but you'll find us ready.' </p>
            <p>　　I thanked him, and replied that I was sure I should be happy 
              in such a delightful place. </p>
            <p>　　'How's your Ma, sir?' said Mr. Peggotty. 'Did you leave her pretty 
              jolly?' </p>
            <p>　　I gave Mr. Peggotty to understand that she was as jolly as I 
              could wish, and that she desired her compliments - which was a polite 
              fiction on my part. </p>
            <p>　　'I'm much obleeged to her, I'm sure,' said Mr. Peggotty. 'Well, 
              sir, if you can make out here, fur a fortnut, 'long wi' her,' nodding 
              at his sister, 'and Ham, and little Em'ly, we shall be proud of 
              your company.' </p>
            <p>　　Having done the honours of his house in this hospitable manner, 
              Mr. Peggotty went out to wash himself in a kettleful of hot water, 
              remarking that 'cold would never get his muck off'. He soon returned, 
              greatly improved in appearance; but so rubicund, that I couldn't 
              help thinking his face had this in common with the lobsters, crabs, 
              and crawfish, - that it went into the hot water very black, and 
              came out very red. </p>
            <p>　　After tea, when the door was shut and all was made snug (the 
              nights being cold and misty now), it seemed to me the most delicious 
              retreat that the imagination of man could conceive. To hear the 
              wind getting up out at sea, to know that the fog was creeping over 
              the desolate flat outside, and to look at the fire, and think that 
              there was no house near but this one, and this one a boat, was like 
              enchantment. Little Em'ly had overcome her shyness, and was sitting 
              by my side upon the lowest and least of the lockers, which was just 
              large enough for us two, and just fitted into the chimney corner. 
              Mrs. Peggotty with the white apron, was knitting on the opposite 
              side of the fire. Peggotty at her needlework was as much at home 
              with St. Paul's and the bit of wax-candle, as if they had never 
              known any other roof. Ham, who had been giving me my first lesson 
              in all-fours, was trying to recollect a scheme of telling fortunes 
              with the dirty cards, and was printing off fishy impressions of 
              his thumb on all the cards he turned. Mr. Peggotty was smoking his 
              pipe. I felt it was a time for conversation and confidence. </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Peggotty!' says I. </p>
            <p>　　'Sir,' says he. </p>
            <p>　　'Did you give your son the name of Ham, because you lived in 
              a sort of ark?' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Peggotty seemed to think it a deep idea, but answered: </p>
            <p>　　'No, sir. I never giv him no name.' </p>
            <p>　　'Who gave him that name, then?' said I, putting question number 
              two of the catechism to Mr. Peggotty. </p>
            <p>　　'Why, sir, his father giv it him,' said Mr. Peggotty. </p>
            <p>　　'I thought you were his father!' </p>
            <p>　　'My brother Joe was his father,' said Mr. Peggotty. </p>
            <p>　　'Dead, Mr. Peggotty?' I hinted, after a respectful pause. </p>
            <p>　　'Drowndead,' said Mr. Peggotty. </p>
            <p>　　I was very much surprised that Mr. Peggotty was not Ham's father, 
              and began to wonder whether I was mistaken about his relationship 
              to anybody else there. I was so curious to know, that I made up 
              my mind to have it out with Mr. Peggotty. </p>
            <p>　　'Little Em'ly,' I said, glancing at her. 'She is your daughter, 
              isn't she, Mr. Peggotty?' </p>
            <p>　　'No, sir. My brother-in-law, Tom, was her father.' </p>
            <p>　　I couldn't help it. '- Dead, Mr. Peggotty?' I hinted, after another 
              respectful silence. </p>
            <p>　　'Drowndead,' said Mr. Peggotty. </p>
            <p>　　I felt the difficulty of resuming the subject, but had not got 
              to the bottom of it yet, and must get to the bottom somehow. So 
              I said: </p>
            <p>　　'Haven't you ANY children, Mr. Peggotty?' </p>
            <p>　　'No, master,' he answered with a short laugh. 'I'm a bacheldore.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'A bachelor!' I said, astonished. 'Why, who's that, Mr. Peggotty?' 
              pointing to the person in the apron who was knitting. </p>
            <p>　　'That's Missis Gummidge,' said Mr. Peggotty. </p>
            <p>　　'Gummidge, Mr. Peggotty?' </p>
            <p>　　But at this point Peggotty - I mean my own peculiar Peggotty 
              - made such impressive motions to me not to ask any more questions, 
              that I could only sit and look at all the silent company, until 
              it was time to go to bed. Then, in the privacy of my own little 
              cabin, she informed me that Ham and Em'ly were an orphan nephew 
              and niece, whom my host had at different times adopted in their 
              childhood, when they were left destitute: and that Mrs. Gummidge 
              was the widow of his partner in a boat, who had died very poor. 
              He was but a poor man himself, said Peggotty, but as good as gold 
              and as true as steel - those were her similes. The only subject, 
              she informed me, on which he ever showed a violent temper or swore 
              an oath, was this generosity of his; and if it were ever referred 
              to, by any one of them, he struck the table a heavy blow with his 
              right hand (had split it on one such occasion), and swore a dreadful 
              oath that he would be 'Gormed' if he didn't cut and run for good, 
              if it was ever mentioned again. It appeared, in answer to my inquiries, 
              that nobody had the least idea of the etymology of this terrible 
              verb passive to be gormed; but that they all regarded it as constituting 
              a most solemn imprecation. </p>
            <p>　　I was very sensible of my entertainer's goodness, and listened 
              to the women's going to bed in another little crib like mine at 
              the opposite end of the boat, and to him and Ham hanging up two 
              hammocks for themselves on the hooks I had noticed in the roof, 
              in a very luxurious state of mind, enhanced by my being sleepy. 
              As slumber gradually stole upon me, I heard the wind howling out 
              at sea and coming on across the flat so fiercely, that I had a lazy 
              apprehension of the great deep rising in the night. But I bethought 
              myself that I was in a boat, after all; and that a man like Mr. 
              Peggotty was not a bad person to have on board if anything did happen. 
              Nothing happened, however, worse than morning. Almost as soon as 
              it shone upon the oyster-shell frame of my mirror I was out of bed, 
              and out with little Em'ly, picking up stones upon the beach. </p>
            <p>　　'You're quite a sailor, I suppose?' I said to Em'ly. I don't 
              know that I supposed anything of the kind, but I felt it an act 
              of gallantry to say something; and a shining sail close to us made 
              such a pretty little image of itself, at the moment, in her bright 
              eye, that it came into my head to say this. </p>
            <p>　　'No,' replied Em'ly, shaking her head, 'I'm afraid of the sea.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Afraid!' I said, with a becoming air of boldness, and looking 
              very big at the mighty ocean. 'I an't!' </p>
            <p>　　'Ah! but it's cruel,' said Em'ly. 'I have seen it very cruel 
              to some of our men. I have seen it tear a boat as big as our house, 
              all to pieces.' </p>
            <p>　　'I hope it wasn't the boat that -' </p>
            <p>　　'That father was drownded in?' said Em'ly. 'No. Not that one, 
              I never see that boat.' </p>
            <p>　　'Nor him?' I asked her. </p>
            <p>　　Little Em'ly shook her head. 'Not to remember!' </p>
            <p>　　Here was a coincidence! I immediately went into an explanation 
              how I had never seen my own father; and how my mother and I had 
              always lived by ourselves in the happiest state imaginable, and 
              lived so then, and always meant to live so; and how my father's 
              grave was in the churchyard near our house, and shaded by a tree, 
              beneath the boughs of which I had walked and heard the birds sing 
              many a pleasant morning. But there were some differences between 
              Em'ly's orphanhood and mine, it appeared. She had lost her mother 
              before her father; and where her father's grave was no one knew, 
              except that it was somewhere in the depths of the sea. </p>
            <p>　　'Besides,' said Em'ly, as she looked about for shells and pebbles, 
              'your father was a gentleman and your mother is a lady; and my father 
              was a fisherman and my mother was a fisherman's daughter, and my 
              uncle Dan is a fisherman.' </p>
            <p>　　'Dan is Mr. Peggotty, is he?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　'Uncle Dan - yonder,' answered Em'ly, nodding at the boat-house. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Yes. I mean him. He must be very good, I should think?' </p>
            <p>　　'Good?' said Em'ly. 'If I was ever to be a lady, I'd give him 
              a sky-blue coat with diamond buttons, nankeen trousers, a red velvet 
              waistcoat, a cocked hat, a large gold watch, a silver pipe, and 
              a box of money.' </p>
            <p>　　I said I had no doubt that Mr. Peggotty well deserved these treasures. 
              I must acknowledge that I felt it difficult to picture him quite 
              at his ease in the raiment proposed for him by his grateful little 
              niece, and that I was particularly doubtful of the policy of the 
              cocked hat; but I kept these sentiments to myself. </p>
            <p>　　Little Em'ly had stopped and looked up at the sky in her enumeration 
              of these articles, as if they were a glorious vision. We went on 
              again, picking up shells and pebbles. </p>
            <p>　　'You would like to be a lady?' I said. </p>
            <p>　　Emily looked at me, and laughed and nodded 'yes'. </p>
            <p>　　'I should like it very much. We would all be gentlefolks together, 
              then. Me, and uncle, and Ham, and Mrs. Gummidge. We wouldn't mind 
              then, when there comes stormy weather. - Not for our own sakes, 
              I mean. We would for the poor fishermen's, to be sure, and we'd 
              help 'em with money when they come to any hurt.' This seemed to 
              me to be a very satisfactory and therefore not at all improbable 
              picture. I expressed my pleasure in the contemplation of it, and 
              little Em'ly was emboldened to say, shyly, </p>
            <p>　　'Don't you think you are afraid of the sea, now?' </p>
            <p>　　It was quiet enough to reassure me, but I have no doubt if I 
              had seen a moderately large wave come tumbling in, I should have 
              taken to my heels, with an awful recollection of her drowned relations. 
              However, I said 'No,' and I added, 'You don't seem to be either, 
              though you say you are,' - for she was walking much too near the 
              brink of a sort of old jetty or wooden causeway we had strolled 
              upon, and I was afraid of her falling over. </p>
            <p>　　'I'm not afraid in this way,' said little Em'ly. 'But I wake 
              when it blows, and tremble to think of Uncle Dan and Ham and believe 
              I hear 'em crying out for help. That's why I should like so much 
              to be a lady. But I'm not afraid in this way. Not a bit. Look here!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　She started from my side, and ran along a jagged timber which 
              protruded from the place we stood upon, and overhung the deep water 
              at some height, without the least defence. The incident is so impressed 
              on my remembrance, that if I were a draughtsman I could draw its 
              form here, I dare say, accurately as it was that day, and little 
              Em'ly springing forward to her destruction (as it appeared to me), 
              with a look that I have never forgotten, directed far out to sea. 
            </p>
            <p>　　The light, bold, fluttering little figure turned and came back 
              safe to me, and I soon laughed at my fears, and at the cry I had 
              uttered; fruitlessly in any case, for there was no one near. But 
              there have been times since, in my manhood, many times there have 
              been, when I have thought, Is it possible, among the possibilities 
              of hidden things, that in the sudden rashness of the child and her 
              wild look so far off, there was any merciful attraction of her into 
              danger, any tempting her towards him permitted on the part of her 
              dead father, that her life might have a chance of ending that day? 
              There has been a time since when I have wondered whether, if the 
              life before her could have been revealed to me at a glance, and 
              so revealed as that a child could fully comprehend it, and if her 
              preservation could have depended on a motion of my hand, I ought 
              to have held it up to save her. There has been a time since - I 
              do not say it lasted long, but it has been - when I have asked myself 
              the question, would it have been better for little Em'ly to have 
              had the waters close above her head that morning in my sight; and 
              when I have answered Yes, it would have been. </p>
            <p>　　This may be premature. I have set it down too soon, perhaps. 
              But let it stand. </p>
            <p>　　We strolled a long way, and loaded ourselves with things that 
              we thought curious, and put some stranded starfish carefully back 
              into the water - I hardly know enough of the race at this moment 
              to be quite certain whether they had reason to feel obliged to us 
              for doing so, or the reverse - and then made our way home to Mr. 
              Peggotty's dwelling. We stopped under the lee of the lobster-outhouse 
              to exchange an innocent kiss, and went in to breakfast glowing with 
              health and pleasure. </p>
            <p>　　'Like two young mavishes,' Mr. Peggotty said. I knew this meant, 
              in our local dialect, like two young thrushes, and received it as 
              a compliment. </p>
            <p>　　Of course I was in love with little Em'ly. I am sure I loved 
              that baby quite as truly, quite as tenderly, with greater purity 
              and more disinterestedness, than can enter into the best love of 
              a later time of life, high and ennobling as it is. I am sure my 
              fancy raised up something round that blue-eyed mite of a child, 
              which etherealized, and made a very angel of her. If, any sunny 
              forenoon, she had spread a little pair of wings and flown away before 
              my eyes, I don't think I should have regarded it as much more than 
              I had had reason to expect. </p>
            <p>　　We used to walk about that dim old flat at Yarmouth in a loving 
              manner, hours and hours. The days sported by us, as if Time had 
              not grown up himself yet, but were a child too, and always at play. 
              I told Em'ly I adored her, and that unless she confessed she adored 
              me I should be reduced to the necessity of killing myself with a 
              sword. She said she did, and I have no doubt she did. </p>
            <p>　　As to any sense of inequality, or youthfulness, or other difficulty 
              in our way, little Em'ly and I had no such trouble, because we had 
              no future. We made no more provision for growing older, than we 
              did for growing younger. We were the admiration of Mrs. Gummidge 
              and Peggotty, who used to whisper of an evening when we sat, lovingly, 
              on our little locker side by side, 'Lor! wasn't it beautiful!' Mr. 
              Peggotty smiled at us from behind his pipe, and Ham grinned all 
              the evening and did nothing else. They had something of the sort 
              of pleasure in us, I suppose, that they might have had in a pretty 
              toy, or a pocket model of the Colosseum. </p>
            <p>　　I soon found out that Mrs. Gummidge did not always make herself 
              so agreeable as she might have been expected to do, under the circumstances 
              of her residence with Mr. Peggotty. Mrs. Gummidge's was rather a 
              fretful disposition, and she whimpered more sometimes than was comfortable 
              for other parties in so small an establishment. I was very sorry 
              for her; but there were moments when it would have been more agreeable, 
              I thought, if Mrs. Gummidge had had a convenient apartment of her 
              own to retire to, and had stopped there until her spirits revived. 
            </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Peggotty went occasionally to a public-house called The Willing 
              Mind. I discovered this, by his being out on the second or third 
              evening of our visit, and by Mrs. Gummidge's looking up at the Dutch 
              clock, between eight and nine, and saying he was there, and that, 
              what was more, she had known in the morning he would go there. </p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Gummidge had been in a low state all day, and had burst 
              into tears in the forenoon, when the fire smoked. 'I am a lone lorn 
              creetur',' were Mrs. Gummidge's words, when that unpleasant occurrence 
              took place, 'and everythink goes contrary with me.' </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, it'll soon leave off,' said Peggotty - I again mean our 
              Peggotty - 'and besides, you know, it's not more disagreeable to 
              you than to us.' </p>
            <p>　　'I feel it more,' said Mrs. Gummidge. </p>
            <p>　　It was a very cold day, with cutting blasts of wind. Mrs. Gummidge's 
              peculiar corner of the fireside seemed to me to be the warmest and 
              snuggest in the place, as her chair was certainly the easiest, but 
              it didn't suit her that day at all. She was constantly complaining 
              of the cold, and of its occasioning a visitation in her back which 
              she called 'the creeps'. At last she shed tears on that subject, 
              and said again that she was 'a lone lorn creetur' and everythink 
              went contrary with her'. </p>
            <p>　　'It is certainly very cold,' said Peggotty. 'Everybody must feel 
              it so.' </p>
            <p>　　'I feel it more than other people,' said Mrs. Gummidge. </p>
            <p>　　So at dinner; when Mrs. Gummidge was always helped immediately 
              after me, to whom the preference was given as a visitor of distinction. 
              The fish were small and bony, and the potatoes were a little burnt. 
              We all acknowledged that we felt this something of a disappointment; 
              but Mrs. Gummidge said she felt it more than we did, and shed tears 
              again, and made that former declaration with great bitterness. </p>
            <p>　　Accordingly, when Mr. Peggotty came home about nine o'clock, 
              this unfortunate Mrs. Gummidge was knitting in her corner, in a 
              very wretched and miserable condition. Peggotty had been working 
              cheerfully. Ham had been patching up a great pair of waterboots; 
              and I, with little Em'ly by my side, had been reading to them. Mrs. 
              Gummidge had never made any other remark than a forlorn sigh, and 
              had never raised her eyes since tea. </p>
            <p>　　'Well, Mates,' said Mr. Peggotty, taking his seat, 'and how are 
              you?' </p>
            <p>　　We all said something, or looked something, to welcome him, except 
              Mrs. Gummidge, who only shook her head over her knitting. </p>
            <p>　　'What's amiss?' said Mr. Peggotty, with a clap of his hands. 
              'Cheer up, old Mawther!' (Mr. Peggotty meant old girl.) </p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Gummidge did not appear to be able to cheer up. She took 
              out an old black silk handkerchief and wiped her eyes; but instead 
              of putting it in her pocket, kept it out, and wiped them again, 
              and still kept it out, ready for use. </p>
            <p>　　'What's amiss, dame?' said Mr. Peggotty. </p>
            <p>　　'Nothing,' returned Mrs. Gummidge. 'You've come from The Willing 
              Mind, Dan'l?' </p>
            <p>　　'Why yes, I've took a short spell at The Willing Mind tonight,' 
              said Mr. Peggotty. </p>
            <p>　　'I'm sorry I should drive you there,' said Mrs. Gummidge. </p>
            <p>　　'Drive! I don't want no driving,' returned Mr. Peggotty with 
              an honest laugh. 'I only go too ready.' </p>
            <p>　　'Very ready,' said Mrs. Gummidge, shaking her head, and wiping 
              her eyes. 'Yes, yes, very ready. I am sorry it should be along of 
              me that you're so ready.' </p>
            <p>　　'Along o' you! It an't along o' you!' said Mr. Peggotty. 'Don't 
              ye believe a bit on it.' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, yes, it is,' cried Mrs. Gummidge. 'I know what I am. I 
              know that I am a lone lorn creetur', and not only that everythink 
              goes contrary with me, but that I go contrary with everybody. Yes, 
              yes. I feel more than other people do, and I show it more. It's 
              my misfortun'.' </p>
            <p>　　I really couldn't help thinking, as I sat taking in all this, 
              that the misfortune extended to some other members of that family 
              besides Mrs. Gummidge. But Mr. Peggotty made no such retort, only 
              answering with another entreaty to Mrs. Gummidge to cheer up. </p>
            <p>　　'I an't what I could wish myself to be,' said Mrs. Gummidge. 
              'I am far from it. I know what I am. My troubles has made me contrary. 
              I feel my troubles, and they make me contrary. I wish I didn't feel 
              'em, but I do. I wish I could be hardened to 'em, but I an't. I 
              make the house uncomfortable. I don't wonder at it. I've made your 
              sister so all day, and Master Davy.' </p>
            <p>　　Here I was suddenly melted, and roared out, 'No, you haven't, 
              Mrs. Gummidge,' in great mental distress. </p>
            <p>　　'It's far from right that I should do it,' said Mrs. Gummidge. 
              'It an't a fit return. I had better go into the house and die. I 
              am a lone lorn creetur', and had much better not make myself contrary 
              here. If thinks must go contrary with me, and I must go contrary 
              myself, let me go contrary in my parish. Dan'l, I'd better go into 
              the house, and die and be a riddance!' </p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Gummidge retired with these words, and betook herself to 
              bed. When she was gone, Mr. Peggotty, who had not exhibited a trace 
              of any feeling but the profoundest sympathy, looked round upon us, 
              and nodding his head with a lively expression of that sentiment 
              still animating his face, said in a whisper: </p>
            <p>　　'She's been thinking of the old 'un!' </p>
            <p>　　I did not quite understand what old one Mrs. Gummidge was supposed 
              to have fixed her mind upon, until Peggotty, on seeing me to bed, 
              explained that it was the late Mr. Gummidge; and that her brother 
              always took that for a received truth on such occasions, and that 
              it always had a moving effect upon him. Some time after he was in 
              his hammock that night, I heard him myself repeat to Ham, 'Poor 
              thing! She's been thinking of the old 'un!' And whenever Mrs. Gummidge 
              was overcome in a similar manner during the remainder of our stay 
              (which happened some few times), he always said the same thing in 
              extenuation of the circumstance, and always with the tenderest commiseration. 
            </p>
            <p>　　So the fortnight slipped away, varied by nothing but the variation 
              of the tide, which altered Mr. Peggotty's times of going out and 
              coming in, and altered Ham's engagements also. When the latter was 
              unemployed, he sometimes walked with us to show us the boats and 
              ships, and once or twice he took us for a row. I don't know why 
              one slight set of impressions should be more particularly associated 
              with a place than another, though I believe this obtains with most 
              people, in reference especially to the associations of their childhood. 
              I never hear the name, or read the name, of Yarmouth, but I am reminded 
              of a certain Sunday morning on the beach, the bells ringing for 
              church, little Em'ly leaning on my shoulder, Ham lazily dropping 
              stones into the water, and the sun, away at sea, just breaking through 
              the heavy mist, and showing us the ships, like their own shadows. 
            </p>
            <p>　　At last the day came for going home. I bore up against the separation 
              from Mr. Peggotty and Mrs. Gummidge, but my agony of mind at leaving 
              little Em'ly was piercing. We went arm-in-arm to the public-house 
              where the carrier put up, and I promised, on the road, to write 
              to her. (I redeemed that promise afterwards, in characters larger 
              than those in which apartments are usually announced in manuscript, 
              as being to let.) We were greatly overcome at parting; and if ever, 
              in my life, I have had a void made in my heart, I had one made that 
              day. </p>
            <p>　　Now, all the time I had been on my visit, I had been ungrateful 
              to my home again, and had thought little or nothing about it. But 
              I was no sooner turned towards it, than my reproachful young conscience 
              seemed to point that way with a ready finger; and I felt, all the 
              more for the sinking of my spirits, that it was my nest, and that 
              my mother was my comforter and friend. </p>
            <p>　　This gained upon me as we went along; so that the nearer we drew, 
              the more familiar the objects became that we passed, the more excited 
              I was to get there, and to run into her arms. But Peggotty, instead 
              of sharing in those transports, tried to check them (though very 
              kindly), and looked confused and out of sorts. </p>
            <p>　　Blunderstone Rookery would come, however, in spite of her, when 
              the carrier's horse pleased - and did. How well I recollect it, 
              on a cold grey afternoon, with a dull sky, threatening rain! </p>
            <p>　　The door opened, and I looked, half laughing and half crying 
              in my pleasant agitation, for my mother. It was not she, but a strange 
              servant. </p>
            <p>　　'Why, Peggotty!' I said, ruefully, 'isn't she come home?' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, yes, Master Davy,' said Peggotty. 'She's come home. Wait 
              a bit, Master Davy, and I'll - I'll tell you something.' </p>
            <p>　　Between her agitation, and her natural awkwardness in getting 
              out of the cart, Peggotty was making a most extraordinary festoon 
              of herself, but I felt too blank and strange to tell her so. When 
              she had got down, she took me by the hand; led me, wondering, into 
              the kitchen; and shut the door. </p>
            <p>　　'Peggotty!' said I, quite frightened. 'What's the matter?' </p>
            <p>　　'Nothing's the matter, bless you, Master Davy dear!' she answered, 
              assuming an air of sprightliness. </p>
            <p>　　'Something's the matter, I'm sure. Where's mama?' </p>
            <p>　　'Where's mama, Master Davy?' repeated Peggotty. </p>
            <p>　　'Yes. Why hasn't she come out to the gate, and what have we come 
              in here for? Oh, Peggotty!' My eyes were full, and I felt as if 
              I were going to tumble down. </p>
            <p>　　'Bless the precious boy!' cried Peggotty, taking hold of me. 
              'What is it? Speak, my pet!' </p>
            <p>　　'Not dead, too! Oh, she's not dead, Peggotty?' </p>
            <p>　　Peggotty cried out No! with an astonishing volume of voice; and 
              then sat down, and began to pant, and said I had given her a turn. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I gave her a hug to take away the turn, or to give her another 
              turn in the right direction, and then stood before her, looking 
              at her in anxious inquiry. </p>
            <p>　　'You see, dear, I should have told you before now,' said Peggotty, 
              'but I hadn't an opportunity. I ought to have made it, perhaps, 
              but I couldn't azackly' - that was always the substitute for exactly, 
              in Peggotty's militia of words - 'bring my mind to it.' </p>
            <p>　　'Go on, Peggotty,' said I, more frightened than before. </p>
            <p>　　'Master Davy,' said Peggotty, untying her bonnet with a shaking 
              hand, and speaking in a breathless sort of way. 'What do you think? 
              You have got a Pa!' </p>
            <p>　　I trembled, and turned white. Something - I don't know what, 
              or how - connected with the grave in the churchyard, and the raising 
              of the dead, seemed to strike me like an unwholesome wind. </p>
            <p>　　'A new one,' said Peggotty. </p>
            <p>　　'A new one?' I repeated. </p>
            <p>　　Peggotty gave a gasp, as if she were swallowing something that 
              was very hard, and, putting out her hand, said: </p>
            <p>　　'Come and see him.' </p>
            <p>　　'I don't want to see him.' </p>
            <p>　　- 'And your mama,' said Peggotty. </p>
            <p>　　I ceased to draw back, and we went straight to the best parlour, 
              where she left me. On one side of the fire, sat my mother; on the 
              other, Mr. Murdstone. My mother dropped her work, and arose hurriedly, 
              but timidly I thought. </p>
            <p>　　'Now, Clara my dear,' said Mr. Murdstone. 'Recollect! control 
              yourself, always control yourself! Davy boy, how do you do?' </p>
            <p>　　I gave him my hand. After a moment of suspense, I went and kissed 
              my mother: she kissed me, patted me gently on the shoulder, and 
              sat down again to her work. I could not look at her, I could not 
              look at him, I knew quite well that he was looking at us both; and 
              I turned to the window and looked out there, at some shrubs that 
              were drooping their heads in the cold. </p>
            <p>　　As soon as I could creep away, I crept upstairs. My old dear 
              bedroom was changed, and I was to lie a long way off. I rambled 
              downstairs to find anything that was like itself, so altered it 
              all seemed; and roamed into the yard. I very soon started back from 
              there, for the empty dog-kennel was filled up with a great dog - 
              deep mouthed and black-haired like Him - and he was very angry at 
              the sight of me, and sprang out to get at me. </p>

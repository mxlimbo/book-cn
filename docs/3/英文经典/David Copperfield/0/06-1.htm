            <p>　　We had started from Yarmouth at three o'clock in the afternoon, 
              and we were due in London about eight next morning. It was Mid-summer 
              weather, and the evening was very pleasant. When we passed through 
              a village, I pictured to myself what the insides of the houses were 
              like, and what the inhabitants were about; and when boys came running 
              after us, and got up behind and swung there for a little way, I 
              wondered whether their fathers were alive, and whether they Were 
              happy at home. I had plenty to think of, therefore, besides my mind 
              running continually on the kind of place I was going to - which 
              was an awful speculation. Sometimes, I remember, I resigned myself 
              to thoughts of home and Peggotty; and to endeavouring, in a confused 
              blind way, to recall how I had felt, and what sort of boy I used 
              to be, before I bit Mr. Murdstone: which I couldn't satisfy myself 
              about by any means, I seemed to have bitten him in such a remote 
              antiquity. </p>
            <p>　　The night was not so pleasant as the evening, for it got chilly; 
              and being put between two gentlemen (the rough-faced one and another) 
              to prevent my tumbling off the coach, I was nearly smothered by 
              their falling asleep, and completely blocking me up. They squeezed 
              me so hard sometimes, that I could not help crying out, 'Oh! If 
              you please!' - which they didn't like at all, because it woke them. 
              Opposite me was an elderly lady in a great fur cloak, who looked 
              in the dark more like a haystack than a lady, she was wrapped up 
              to such a degree. This lady had a basket with her, and she hadn't 
              known what to do with it, for a long time, until she found that 
              on account of my legs being short, it could go underneath me. It 
              cramped and hurt me so, that it made me perfectly miserable; but 
              if I moved in the least, and made a glass that was in the basket 
              rattle against something else (as it was sure to do), she gave me 
              the cruellest poke with her foot, and said, 'Come, don't YOU fidget. 
              YOUR bones are young enough, I'm sure!' </p>
            <p>　　At last the sun rose, and then my companions seemed to sleep 
              easier. The difficulties under which they had laboured all night, 
              and which had found utterance in the most terrific gasps and snorts, 
              are not to be conceived. As the sun got higher, their sleep became 
              lighter, and so they gradually one by one awoke. I recollect being 
              very much surprised by the feint everybody made, then, of not having 
              been to sleep at all, and by the uncommon indignation with which 
              everyone repelled the charge. I labour under the same kind of astonishment 
              to this day, having invariably observed that of all human weaknesses, 
              the one to which our common nature is the least disposed to confess 
              (I cannot imagine why) is the weakness of having gone to sleep in 
              a coach. </p>
            <p>　　What an amazing place London was to me when I saw it in the distance, 
              and how I believed all the adventures of all my favourite heroes 
              to be constantly enacting and re-enacting there, and how I vaguely 
              made it out in my own mind to be fuller of wonders and wickedness 
              than all the cities of the earth, I need not stop here to relate. 
              We approached it by degrees, and got, in due time, to the inn in 
              the Whitechapel district, for which we were bound. I forget whether 
              it was the Blue Bull, or the Blue Boar; but I know it was the Blue 
              Something, and that its likeness was painted up on the back of the 
              coach. </p>
            <p>　　The guard's eye lighted on me as he was getting down, and he 
              said at the booking-office door: </p>
            <p>　　'Is there anybody here for a yoongster booked in the name of 
              Murdstone, from Bloonderstone, Sooffolk, to be left till called 
              for?' </p>
            <p>　　Nobody answered. </p>
            <p>　　'Try Copperfield, if you please, sir,' said I, looking helplessly 
              down. </p>
            <p>　　'Is there anybody here for a yoongster, booked in the name of 
              Murdstone, from Bloonderstone, Sooffolk, but owning to the name 
              of Copperfield, to be left till called for?' said the guard. 'Come! 
              IS there anybody?' </p>
            <p>　　No. There was nobody. I looked anxiously around; but the inquiry 
              made no impression on any of the bystanders, if I except a man in 
              gaiters, with one eye, who suggested that they had better put a 
              brass collar round my neck, and tie me up in the stable. </p>
            <p>　　A ladder was brought, and I got down after the lady, who was 
              like a haystack: not daring to stir, until her basket was removed. 
              The coach was clear of passengers by that time, the luggage was 
              very soon cleared out, the horses had been taken out before the 
              luggage, and now the coach itself was wheeled and backed off by 
              some hostlers, out of the way. Still, nobody appeared, to claim 
              the dusty youngster from Blunderstone, Suffolk. </p>
            <p>　　More solitary than Robinson Crusoe, who had nobody to look at 
              him and see that he was solitary, I went into the booking-office, 
              and, by invitation of the clerk on duty, passed behind the counter, 
              and sat down on the scale at which they weighed the luggage. Here, 
              as I sat looking at the parcels, packages, and books, and inhaling 
              the smell of stables (ever since associated with that morning), 
              a procession of most tremendous considerations began to march through 
              my mind. Supposing nobody should ever fetch me, how long would they 
              consent to keep me there? Would they keep me long enough to spend 
              seven shillings? Should I sleep at night in one of those wooden 
              bins, with the other luggage, and wash myself at the pump in the 
              yard in the morning; or should I be turned out every night, and 
              expected to come again to be left till called for, when the office 
              opened next day? Supposing there was no mistake in the case, and 
              Mr. Murdstone had devised this plan to get rid of me, what should 
              I do? If they allowed me to remain there until my seven shillings 
              were spent, I couldn't hope to remain there when I began to starve. 
              That would obviously be inconvenient and unpleasant to the customers, 
              besides entailing on the Blue Whatever-it-was, the risk of funeral 
              expenses. If I started off at once, and tried to walk back home, 
              how could I ever find my way, how could I ever hope to walk so far, 
              how could I make sure of anyone but Peggotty, even if I got back? 
              If I found out the nearest proper authorities, and offered myself 
              to go for a soldier, or a sailor, I was such a little fellow that 
              it was most likely they wouldn't take me in. These thoughts, and 
              a hundred other such thoughts, turned me burning hot, and made me 
              giddy with apprehension and dismay. I was in the height of my fever 
              when a man entered and whispered to the clerk, who presently slanted 
              me off the scale, and pushed me over to him, as if I were weighed, 
              bought, delivered, and paid for. </p>
            <p>　　As I went out of the office, hand in hand with this new acquaintance, 
              I stole a look at him. He was a gaunt, sallow young man, with hollow 
              cheeks, and a chin almost as black as Mr. Murdstone's; but there 
              the likeness ended, for his whiskers were shaved off, and his hair, 
              instead of being glossy, was rusty and dry. He was dressed in a 
              suit of black clothes which were rather rusty and dry too, and rather 
              short in the sleeves and legs; and he had a white neck-kerchief 
              on, that was not over-clean. I did not, and do not, suppose that 
              this neck-kerchief was all the linen he wore, but it was all he 
              showed or gave any hint of. </p>
            <p>　　'You're the new boy?' he said. 'Yes, sir,' I said. </p>
            <p>　　I supposed I was. I didn't know. </p>
            <p>　　'I'm one of the masters at Salem House,' he said. </p>
            <p>　　I made him a bow and felt very much overawed. I was so ashamed 
              to allude to a commonplace thing like my box, to a scholar and a 
              master at Salem House, that we had gone some little distance from 
              the yard before I had the hardihood to mention it. We turned back, 
              on my humbly insinuating that it might be useful to me hereafter; 
              and he told the clerk that the carrier had instructions to call 
              for it at noon. </p>
            <p>　　'If you please, sir,' I said, when we had accomplished about 
              the same distance as before, 'is it far?' </p>
            <p>　　'It's down by Blackheath,' he said. </p>
            <p>　　'Is that far, sir?' I diffidently asked. </p>
            <p>　　'It's a good step,' he said. 'We shall go by the stage-coach. 
              It's about six miles.' </p>
            <p>　　I was so faint and tired, that the idea of holding out for six 
              miles more, was too much for me. I took heart to tell him that I 
              had had nothing all night, and that if he would allow me to buy 
              something to eat, I should be very much obliged to him. He appeared 
              surprised at this - I see him stop and look at me now - and after 
              considering for a few moments, said he wanted to call on an old 
              person who lived not far off, and that the best way would be for 
              me to buy some bread, or whatever I liked best that was wholesome, 
              and make my breakfast at her house, where we could get some milk. 
            </p>
            <p>　　Accordingly we looked in at a baker's window, and after I had 
              made a series of proposals to buy everything that was bilious in 
              the shop, and he had rejected them one by one, we decided in favour 
              of a nice little loaf of brown bread, which cost me threepence. 
              Then, at a grocer's shop, we bought an egg and a slice of streaky 
              bacon; which still left what I thought a good deal of change, out 
              of the second of the bright shillings, and made me consider London 
              a very cheap place. These provisions laid in, we went on through 
              a great noise and uproar that confused my weary head beyond description, 
              and over a bridge which, no doubt, was London Bridge (indeed I think 
              he told me so, but I was half asleep), until we came to the poor 
              person's house, which was a part of some alms-houses, as I knew 
              by their look, and by an inscription on a stone over the gate which 
              said they were established for twenty-five poor women. </p>
            <p>　　The Master at Salem House lifted the latch of one of a number 
              of little black doors that were all alike, and had each a little 
              diamond-paned window on one side, and another little diamond- paned 
              window above; and we went into the little house of one of these 
              poor old women, who was blowing a fire to make a little saucepan 
              boil. On seeing the master enter, the old woman stopped with the 
              bellows on her knee, and said something that I thought sounded like 
              'My Charley!' but on seeing me come in too, she got up, and rubbing 
              her hands made a confused sort of half curtsey. </p>
            <p>　　'Can you cook this young gentleman's breakfast for him, if you 
              please?' said the Master at Salem House. </p>
            <p>　　'Can I?' said the old woman. 'Yes can I, sure!' </p>
            <p>　　'How's Mrs. Fibbitson today?' said the Master, looking at another 
              old woman in a large chair by the fire, who was such a bundle of 
              clothes that I feel grateful to this hour for not having sat upon 
              her by mistake. </p>
            <p>　　'Ah, she's poorly,' said the first old woman. 'It's one of her 
              bad days. If the fire was to go out, through any accident, I verily 
              believe she'd go out too, and never come to life again.' </p>
            <p>　　As they looked at her, I looked at her also. Although it was 
              a warm day, she seemed to think of nothing but the fire. I fancied 
              she was jealous even of the saucepan on it; and I have reason to 
              know that she took its impressment into the service of boiling my 
              egg and broiling my bacon, in dudgeon; for I saw her, with my own 
              discomfited eyes, shake her fist at me once, when those culinary 
              operations were going on, and no one else was looking. The sun streamed 
              in at the little window, but she sat with her own back and the back 
              of the large chair towards it, screening the fire as if she were 
              sedulously keeping IT warm, instead of it keeping her warm, and 
              watching it in a most distrustful manner. The completion of the 
              preparations for my breakfast, by relieving the fire, gave her such 
              extreme joy that she laughed aloud - and a very unmelodious laugh 
              she had, I must say. </p>
            <p>　　I sat down to my brown loaf, my egg, and my rasher of bacon, 
              with a basin of milk besides, and made a most delicious meal. While 
              I was yet in the full enjoyment of it, the old woman of the house 
              said to the Master: </p>
            <p>　　'Have you got your flute with you?' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes,' he returned. </p>
            <p>　　'Have a blow at it,' said the old woman, coaxingly. 'Do!' </p>
            <p>　　The Master, upon this, put his hand underneath the skirts of 
              his coat, and brought out his flute in three pieces, which he screwed 
              together, and began immediately to play. My impression is, after 
              many years of consideration, that there never can have been anybody 
              in the world who played worse. He made the most dismal sounds I 
              have ever heard produced by any means, natural or artificial. I 
              don't know what the tunes were - if there were such things in the 
              performance at all, which I doubt - but the influence of the strain 
              upon me was, first, to make me think of all my sorrows until I could 
              hardly keep my tears back; then to take away my appetite; and lastly, 
              to make me so sleepy that I couldn't keep my eyes open. They begin 
              to close again, and I begin to nod, as the recollection rises fresh 
              upon me. Once more the little room, with its open corner cupboard, 
              and its square-backed chairs, and its angular little staircase leading 
              to the room above, and its three peacock's feathers displayed over 
              the mantelpiece - I remember wondering when I first went in, what 
              that peacock would have thought if he had known what his finery 
              was doomed to come to - fades from before me, and I nod, and sleep. 
              The flute becomes inaudible, the wheels of the coach are heard instead, 
              and I am on my journey. The coach jolts, I wake with a start, and 
              the flute has come back again, and the Master at Salem House is 
              sitting with his legs crossed, playing it dolefully, while the old 
              woman of the house looks on delighted. She fades in her turn, and 
              he fades, and all fades, and there is no flute, no Master, no Salem 
              House, no David Copperfield, no anything but heavy sleep. </p>
            <p>　　I dreamed, I thought, that once while he was blowing into this 
              dismal flute, the old woman of the house, who had gone nearer and 
              nearer to him in her ecstatic admiration, leaned over the back of 
              his chair and gave him an affectionate squeeze round the neck, which 
              stopped his playing for a moment. I was in the middle state between 
              sleeping and waking, either then or immediately afterwards; for, 
              as he resumed - it was a real fact that he had stopped playing - 
              I saw and heard the same old woman ask Mrs. Fibbitson if it wasn't 
              delicious (meaning the flute), to which Mrs. Fibbitson replied, 
              'Ay, ay! yes!' and nodded at the fire: to which, I am persuaded, 
              she gave the credit of the whole performance. </p>
            <p>　　When I seemed to have been dozing a long while, the Master at 
              Salem House unscrewed his flute into the three pieces, put them 
              up as before, and took me away. We found the coach very near at 
              hand, and got upon the roof; but I was so dead sleepy, that when 
              we stopped on the road to take up somebody else, they put me inside 
              where there were no passengers, and where I slept profoundly, until 
              I found the coach going at a footpace up a steep hill among green 
              leaves. Presently, it stopped, and had come to its destination. 
            </p>
            <p>　　A short walk brought us - I mean the Master and me - to Salem 
              House, which was enclosed with a high brick wall, and looked very 
              dull. Over a door in this wall was a board with SALEM HousE upon 
              it; and through a grating in this door we were surveyed when we 
              rang the bell by a surly face, which I found, on the door being 
              opened, belonged to a stout man with a bull-neck, a wooden leg, 
              overhanging temples, and his hair cut close all round his head. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'The new boy,' said the Master. </p>
            <p>　　The man with the wooden leg eyed me all over - it didn't take 
              long, for there was not much of me - and locked the gate behind 
              us, and took out the key. We were going up to the house, among some 
              dark heavy trees, when he called after my conductor. 'Hallo!' </p>
            <p>　　We looked back, and he was standing at the door of a little lodge, 
              where he lived, with a pair of boots in his hand. </p>
            <p>　　'Here! The cobbler's been,' he said, 'since you've been out, 
              Mr. Mell, and he says he can't mend 'em any more. He says there 
              ain't a bit of the original boot left, and he wonders you expect 
              it.' </p>
            <p>　　With these words he threw the boots towards Mr. Mell, who went 
              back a few paces to pick them up, and looked at them (very disconsolately, 
              I was afraid), as we went on together. I observed then, for the 
              first time, that the boots he had on were a good deal the worse 
              for wear, and that his stocking was just breaking out in one place, 
              like a bud. </p>
            <p>　　Salem House was a square brick building with wings; of a bare 
              and unfurnished appearance. All about it was so very quiet, that 
              I said to Mr. Mell I supposed the boys were out; but he seemed surprised 
              at my not knowing that it was holiday-time. That all the boys were 
              at their several homes. That Mr. Creakle, the proprietor, was down 
              by the sea-side with Mrs. and Miss Creakle; and that I was sent 
              in holiday-time as a punishment for my misdoing, all of which he 
              explained to me as we went along. </p>
            <p>　　I gazed upon the schoolroom into which he took me, as the most 
              forlorn and desolate place I had ever seen. I see it now. A long 
              room with three long rows of desks, and six of forms, and bristling 
              all round with pegs for hats and slates. Scraps of old copy-books 
              and exercises litter the dirty floor. Some silkworms' houses, made 
              of the same materials, are scattered over the desks. Two miserable 
              little white mice, left behind by their owner, are running up and 
              down in a fusty castle made of pasteboard and wire, looking in all 
              the corners with their red eyes for anything to eat. A bird, in 
              a cage very little bigger than himself, makes a mournful rattle 
              now and then in hopping on his perch, two inches high, or dropping 
              from it; but neither sings nor chirps. There is a strange unwholesome 
              smell upon the room, like mildewed corduroys, sweet apples wanting 
              air, and rotten books. There could not well be more ink splashed 
              about it, if it had been roofless from its first construction, and 
              the skies had rained, snowed, hailed, and blown ink through the 
              varying seasons of the year. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Mell having left me while he took his irreparable boots upstairs, 
              I went softly to the upper end of the room, observing all this as 
              I crept along. Suddenly I came upon a pasteboard placard, beautifully 
              written, which was lying on the desk, and bore these words: 'TAKE 
              CARE OF HIM. HE BITES.' </p>
            <p>　　I got upon the desk immediately, apprehensive of at least a great 
              dog underneath. But, though I looked all round with anxious eyes, 
              I could see nothing of him. I was still engaged in peering about, 
              when Mr. Mell came back, and asked me what I did up there? </p>
            <p>　　'I beg your pardon, sir,' says I, 'if you please, I'm looking 
              for the dog.' </p>
            <p>　　'Dog?' he says. 'What dog?' </p>
            <p>　　'Isn't it a dog, sir?' </p>
            <p>　　'Isn't what a dog?' </p>
            <p>　　'That's to be taken care of, sir; that bites.' </p>
            <p>　　'No, Copperfield,' says he, gravely, 'that's not a dog. That's 
              a boy. My instructions are, Copperfield, to put this placard on 
              your back. I am sorry to make such a beginning with you, but I must 
              do it.' With that he took me down, and tied the placard, which was 
              neatly constructed for the purpose, on my shoulders like a knapsack; 
              and wherever I went, afterwards, I had the consolation of carrying 
              it. </p>
            <p>　　What I suffered from that placard, nobody can imagine. Whether 
              it was possible for people to see me or not, I always fancied that 
              somebody was reading it. It was no relief to turn round and find 
              nobody; for wherever my back was, there I imagined somebody always 
              to be. That cruel man with the wooden leg aggravated my sufferings. 
              He was in authority; and if he ever saw me leaning against a tree, 
              or a wall, or the house, he roared out from his lodge door in a 
              stupendous voice, 'Hallo, you sir! You Copperfield! Show that badge 
              conspicuous, or I'll report you!' The playground was a bare gravelled 
              yard, open to all the back of the house and the offices; and I knew 
              that the servants read it, and the butcher read it, and the baker 
              read it; that everybody, in a word, who came backwards and forwards 
              to the house, of a morning when I was ordered to walk there, read 
              that I was to be taken care of, for I bit, I recollect that I positively 
              began to have a dread of myself, as a kind of wild boy who did bite. 
            </p>
            <p>　　There was an old door in this playground, on which the boys had 
              a custom of carving their names. It was completely covered with 
              such inscriptions. In my dread of the end of the vacation and their 
              coming back, I could not read a boy's name, without inquiring in 
              what tone and with what emphasis HE would read, 'Take care of him. 
              He bites.' There was one boy - a certain J. Steerforth - who cut 
              his name very deep and very often, who, I conceived, would read 
              it in a rather strong voice, and afterwards pull my hair. There 
              was another boy, one Tommy Traddles, who I dreaded would make game 
              of it, and pretend to be dreadfully frightened of me. There was 
              a third, George Demple, who I fancied would sing it. I have looked, 
              a little shrinking creature, at that door, until the owners of all 
              the names - there were five-and-forty of them in the school then, 
              Mr. Mell said - seemed to send me to Coventry by general acclamation, 
              and to cry out, each in his own way, 'Take care of him. He bites!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　It was the same with the places at the desks and forms. It was 
              the same with the groves of deserted bedsteads I peeped at, on my 
              way to, and when I was in, my own bed. I remember dreaming night 
              after night, of being with my mother as she used to be, or of going 
              to a party at Mr. Peggotty's, or of travelling outside the stage-coach, 
              or of dining again with my unfortunate friend the waiter, and in 
              all these circumstances making people scream and stare, by the unhappy 
              disclosure that I had nothing on but my little night-shirt, and 
              that placard. </p>
            <p>　　In the monotony of my life, and in my constant apprehension of 
              the re-opening of the school, it was such an insupportable affliction! 
              I had long tasks every day to do with Mr. Mell; but I did them, 
              there being no Mr. and Miss Murdstone here, and got through them 
              without disgrace. Before, and after them, I walked about - supervised, 
              as I have mentioned, by the man with the wooden leg. How vividly 
              I call to mind the damp about the house, the green cracked flagstones 
              in the court, an old leaky water-butt, and the discoloured trunks 
              of some of the grim trees, which seemed to have dripped more in 
              the rain than other trees, and to have blown less in the sun! At 
              one we dined, Mr. Mell and I, at the upper end of a long bare dining-room, 
              full of deal tables, and smelling of fat. Then, we had more tasks 
              until tea, which Mr. Mell drank out of a blue teacup, and I out 
              of a tin pot. All day long, and until seven or eight in the evening, 
              Mr. Mell, at his own detached desk in the schoolroom, worked hard 
              with pen, ink, ruler, books, and writing- paper, making out the 
              bills (as I found) for last half-year. When he had put up his things 
              for the night he took out his flute, and blew at it, until I almost 
              thought he would gradually blow his whole being into the large hole 
              at the top, and ooze away at the keys. </p>
            <p>　　I picture my small self in the dimly-lighted rooms, sitting with 
              my head upon my hand, listening to the doleful performance of Mr. 
              Mell, and conning tomorrow's lessons. I picture myself with my books 
              shut up, still listening to the doleful performance of Mr. Mell, 
              and listening through it to what used to be at home, and to the 
              blowing of the wind on Yarmouth flats, and feeling very sad and 
              solitary. I picture myself going up to bed, among the unused rooms, 
              and sitting on my bed-side crying for a comfortable word from Peggotty. 
              I picture myself coming downstairs in the morning, and looking through 
              a long ghastly gash of a staircase window at the school-bell hanging 
              on the top of an out-house with a weathercock above it; and dreading 
              the time when it shall ring J. Steerforth and the rest to work: 
              which is only second, in my foreboding apprehensions, to the time 
              when the man with the wooden leg shall unlock the rusty gate to 
              give admission to the awful Mr. Creakle. I cannot think I was a 
              very dangerous character in any of these aspects, but in all of 
              them I carried the same warning on my back. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Mell never said much to me, but he was never harsh to me. 
              I suppose we were company to each other, without talking. I forgot 
              to mention that he would talk to himself sometimes, and grin, and 
              clench his fist, and grind his teeth, and pull his hair in an unaccountable 
              manner. But he had these peculiarities: and at first they frightened 
              me, though I soon got used to them. </p>

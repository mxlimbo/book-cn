            <p>　　I think I never saw anything more ridiculous - I was sensible 
              of it, even at the time - than Mr. Micawber making broad-sword guards 
              with the ruler, and crying, 'Come on!' while Traddles and I pushed 
              him back into a corner, from which, as often as we got him into 
              it, he persisted in emerging again. </p>
            <p>　　His enemy, muttering to himself, after wringing his wounded hand 
              for sometime, slowly drew off his neck-kerchief and bound it up; 
              then held it in his other hand, and sat upon his table with his 
              sullen face looking down. </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber, when he was sufficiently cool, proceeded with his 
              letter. </p>
            <p>　　'&quot;The stipendiary emoluments in consideration of which I 
              entered into the service of - HEEP,&quot;' always pausing before 
              that word and uttering it with astonishing vigour, '&quot;were not 
              defined, beyond the pittance of twenty-two shillings and six per 
              week. The rest was left contingent on the value of my professional 
              exertions; in other and more expressive words, on the baseness of 
              my nature, the cupidity of my motives, the poverty of my family, 
              the general moral (or rather immoral) resemblance between myself 
              and - HEEP. Need I say, that it soon became necessary for me to 
              solicit from - HEEP - pecuniary advances towards the support of 
              Mrs. Micawber, and our blighted but rising family? Need I say that 
              this necessity had been foreseen by - HEEP? That those advances 
              were secured by I.O.U.'s and other similar acknowledgements, known 
              to the legal institutions of this country? And that I thus became 
              immeshed in the web he had spun for my reception?&quot;' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber's enjoyment of his epistolary powers, in describing 
              this unfortunate state of things, really seemed to outweigh any 
              pain or anxiety that the reality could have caused him. He read 
              on: </p>
            <p>　　'&quot;Then it was that - HEEP - began to favour me with just 
              so much of his confidence, as was necessary to the discharge of 
              his infernal business. Then it was that I began, if I may so Shakespearianly 
              express myself, to dwindle, peak, and pine. I found that my services 
              were constantly called into requisition for the falsification of 
              business, and the mystification of an individual whom I will designate 
              as Mr. W. That Mr. W. was imposed upon, kept in ignorance, and deluded, 
              in every possible way; yet, that all this while, the ruffian - HEEP 
              - was professing unbounded gratitude to, and unbounded friendship 
              for, that much-abused gentleman. This was bad enough; but, as the 
              philosophic Dane observes, with that universal applicability which 
              distinguishes the illustrious ornament of the Elizabethan Era, worse 
              remains behind!&quot;' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber was so very much struck by this happy rounding off 
              with a quotation, that he indulged himself, and us, with a second 
              reading of the sentence, under pretence of having lost his place. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'&quot;It is not my intention,&quot;' he continued reading on, 
              '&quot;to enter on a detailed list, within the compass of the present 
              epistle (though it is ready elsewhere), of the various malpractices 
              of a minor nature, affecting the individual whom I have denominated 
              Mr. W., to which I have been a tacitly consenting party. My object, 
              when the contest within myself between stipend and no stipend, baker 
              and no baker, existence and non-existence, ceased, was to take advantage 
              of my opportunities to discover and expose the major malpractices 
              committed, to that gentleman's grievous wrong and injury, by - HEEP. 
              Stimulated by the silent monitor within, and by a no less touching 
              and appealing monitor without - to whom I will briefly refer as 
              Miss W. - I entered on a not unlaborious task of clandestine investigation, 
              protracted - now, to the best of my knowledge, information, and 
              belief, over a period exceeding twelve calendar months.&quot;' </p>
            <p>　　He read this passage as if it were from an Act of Parliament; 
              and appeared majestically refreshed by the sound of the words. </p>
            <p>　　'&quot;My charges against - HEEP,&quot;' he read on, glancing 
              at him, and drawing the ruler into a convenient position under his 
              left arm, in case of need, '&quot;are as follows.&quot;' </p>
            <p>　　We all held our breath, I think. I am sure Uriah held his. </p>
            <p>　　'&quot;First,&quot;' said Mr. Micawber, '&quot;When Mr. W.'s 
              faculties and memory for business became, through causes into which 
              it is not necessary or expedient for me to enter, weakened and confused, 
              - HEEP - designedly perplexed and complicated the whole of the official 
              transactions. When Mr. W. was least fit to enter on business, - 
              HEEP was always at hand to force him to enter on it. He obtained 
              Mr. W.'s signature under such circumstances to documents of importance, 
              representing them to be other documents of no importance. He induced 
              Mr. W. to empower him to draw out, thus, one particular sum of trust-money, 
              amounting to twelve six fourteen, two and nine, and employed it 
              to meet pretended business charges and deficiencies which were either 
              already provided for, or had never really existed. He gave this 
              proceeding, throughout, the appearance of having originated in Mr. 
              W.'s own dishonest intention, and of having been accomplished by 
              Mr. W.'s own dishonest act; and has used it, ever since, to torture 
              and constrain him.&quot;' </p>
            <p>　　'You shall prove this, you Copperfield!' said Uriah, with a threatening 
              shake of the head. 'All in good time!' </p>
            <p>　　'Ask - HEEP - Mr. Traddles, who lived in his house after him,' 
              said Mr. Micawber, breaking off from the letter; 'will you?' </p>
            <p>　　'The fool himself- and lives there now,' said Uriah, disdainfully. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Ask - HEEP - if he ever kept a pocket-book in that house,' said 
              Mr. Micawber; 'will you?' </p>
            <p>　　I saw Uriah's lank hand stop, involuntarily, in the scraping 
              of his chin. </p>
            <p>　　'Or ask him,' said Mr. Micawber,'if he ever burnt one there. 
              If he says yes, and asks you where the ashes are, refer him to Wilkins 
              Micawber, and he will hear of something not at all to his advantage!' 
            </p>
            <p>　　The triumphant flourish with which Mr. Micawber delivered himself 
              of these words, had a powerful effect in alarming the mother; who 
              cried out, in much agitation: </p>
            <p>　　'Ury, Ury! Be umble, and make terms, my dear!' </p>
            <p>　　'Mother!' he retorted, 'will you keep quiet? You're in a fright, 
              and don't know what you say or mean. Umble!' he repeated, looking 
              at me, with a snarl; 'I've umbled some of 'em for a pretty long 
              time back, umble as I was!' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber, genteelly adjusting his chin in his cravat, presently 
              proceeded with his composition. </p>
            <p>　　'&quot;Second. HEEP has, on several occasions, to the best of 
              my knowledge, information, and belief -&quot;' </p>
            <p>　　'But that won't do,' muttered Uriah, relieved. 'Mother, you keep 
              quiet.' </p>
            <p>　　'We will endeavour to provide something that WILL do, and do 
              for you finally, sir, very shortly,' replied Mr. Micawber. </p>
            <p>　　'&quot;Second. HEEP has, on several occasions, to the best of 
              my knowledge, information, and belief, systematically forged, to 
              various entries, books, and documents, the signature of Mr. W.; 
              and has distinctly done so in one instance, capable of proof by 
              me. To wit, in manner following, that is to say:&quot;' </p>
            <p>　　Again, Mr. Micawber had a relish in this formal piling up of 
              words, which, however ludicrously displayed in his case, was, I 
              must say, not at all peculiar to him. I have observed it, in the 
              course of my life, in numbers of men. It seems to me to be a general 
              rule. In the taking of legal oaths, for instance, deponents seem 
              to enjoy themselves mightily when they come to several good words 
              in succession, for the expression of one idea; as, that they utterly 
              detest, abominate, and abjure, or so forth; and the old anathemas 
              were made relishing on the same principle. We talk about the tyranny 
              of words, but we like to tyrannize over them too; we are fond of 
              having a large superfluous establishment of words to wait upon us 
              on great occasions; we think it looks important, and sounds well. 
              As we are not particular about the meaning of our liveries on state 
              occasions, if they be but fine and numerous enough, so, the meaning 
              or necessity of our words is a secondary consideration, if there 
              be but a great parade of them. And as individuals get into trouble 
              by making too great a show of liveries, or as slaves when they are 
              too numerous rise against their masters, so I think I could mention 
              a nation that has got into many great difficulties, and will get 
              into many greater, from maintaining too large a retinue of words. 
            </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber read on, almost smacking his lips: </p>
            <p>　　'&quot;To wit, in manner following, that is to say. Mr. W. being 
              infirm, and it being within the bounds of probability that his decease 
              might lead to some discoveries, and to the downfall of - HEEP'S 
              - power over the W. family, - as I, Wilkins Micawber, the undersigned, 
              assume - unless the filial affection of his daughter could be secretly 
              influenced from allowing any investigation of the partnership affairs 
              to be ever made, the said - HEEP - deemed it expedient to have a 
              bond ready by him, as from Mr. W., for the before-mentioned sum 
              of twelve six fourteen, two and nine, with interest, stated therein 
              to have been advanced by - HEEP - to Mr. W. to save Mr. W. from 
              dishonour; though really the sum was never advanced by him, and 
              has long been replaced. The signatures to this instrument purporting 
              to be executed by Mr. W. and attested by Wilkins Micawber, are forgeries 
              by - HEEP. I have, in my possession, in his hand and pocket-book, 
              several similar imitations of Mr. W.'s signature, here and there 
              defaced by fire, but legible to anyone. I never attested any such 
              document. And I have the document itself, in my possession.&quot;' 
              Uriah Heep, with a start, took out of his pocket a bunch of keys, 
              and opened a certain drawer; then, suddenly bethought himself of 
              what he was about, and turned again towards us, without looking 
              in it. </p>
            <p>　　'&quot;And I have the document,&quot;' Mr. Micawber read again, 
              looking about as if it were the text of a sermon, '&quot;in my possession, 
              - that is to say, I had, early this morning, when this was written, 
              but have since relinquished it to Mr. Traddles.&quot;' </p>
            <p>　　'It is quite true,' assented Traddles. </p>
            <p>　　'Ury, Ury!' cried the mother, 'be umble and make terms. I know 
              my son will be umble, gentlemen, if you'll give him time to think. 
              Mr. Copperfield, I'm sure you know that he was always very umble, 
              sir!' </p>
            <p>　　It was singular to see how the mother still held to the old trick, 
              when the son had abandoned it as useless. </p>
            <p>　　'Mother,' he said, with an impatient bite at the handkerchief 
              in which his hand was wrapped, 'you had better take and fire a loaded 
              gun at me.' </p>
            <p>　　'But I love you, Ury,' cried Mrs. Heep. And I have no doubt she 
              did; or that he loved her, however strange it may appear; though, 
              to be sure, they were a congenial couple. 'And I can't bear to hear 
              you provoking the gentlemen, and endangering of yourself more. I 
              told the gentleman at first, when he told me upstairs it was come 
              to light, that I would answer for your being umble, and making amends. 
              Oh, see how umble I am, gentlemen, and don't mind him!' </p>
            <p>　　'Why, there's Copperfield, mother,' he angrily retorted, pointing 
              his lean finger at me, against whom all his animosity was levelled, 
              as the prime mover in the discovery; and I did not undeceive him; 
              'there's Copperfield, would have given you a hundred pound to say 
              less than you've blurted out!' </p>
            <p>　　'I can't help it, Ury,' cried his mother. 'I can't see you running 
              into danger, through carrying your head so high. Better be umble, 
              as you always was.' </p>
            <p>　　He remained for a little, biting the handkerchief, and then said 
              to me with a scowl: </p>
            <p>　　'What more have you got to bring forward? If anything, go on 
              with it. What do you look at me for?' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber promptly resumed his letter, glad to revert to a 
              performance with which he was so highly satisfied. </p>
            <p>　　'&quot;Third. And last. I am now in a condition to show, by - 
              HEEP'S - false books, and - HEEP'S - real memoranda, beginning with 
              the partially destroyed pocket-book (which I was unable to comprehend, 
              at the time of its accidental discovery by Mrs. Micawber, on our 
              taking possession of our present abode, in the locker or bin devoted 
              to the reception of the ashes calcined on our domestic hearth), 
              that the weaknesses, the faults, the very virtues, the parental 
              affections, and the sense of honour, of the unhappy Mr. W. have 
              been for years acted on by, and warped to the base purposes of - 
              HEEP. That Mr. W. has been for years deluded and plundered, in every 
              conceivable manner, to the pecuniary aggrandisement of the avaricious, 
              false, and grasping - HEEP. That the engrossing object of- HEEP 
              - was, next to gain, to subdue Mr. and Miss W. (of his ulterior 
              views in reference to the latter I say nothing) entirely to himself. 
              That his last act, completed but a few months since, was to induce 
              Mr. W. to execute a relinquishment of his share in the partnership, 
              and even a bill of sale on the very furniture of his house, in consideration 
              of a certain annuity, to be well and truly paid by - HEEP - on the 
              four common quarter-days in each and every year. That these meshes; 
              beginning with alarming and falsified accounts of the estate of 
              which Mr. W. is the receiver, at a period when Mr. W. had launched 
              into imprudent and ill-judged speculations, and may not have had 
              the money, for which he was morally and legally responsible, in 
              hand; going on with pretended borrowings of money at enormous interest, 
              really coming from - HEEP - and by - HEEP - fraudulently obtained 
              or withheld from Mr. W. himself, on pretence of such speculations 
              or otherwise; perpetuated by a miscellaneous catalogue of unscrupulous 
              chicaneries - gradually thickened, until the unhappy Mr. W. could 
              see no world beyond. Bankrupt, as he believed, alike in circumstances, 
              in all other hope, and in honour, his sole reliance was upon the 
              monster in the garb of man,&quot;' - Mr. Micawber made a good deal 
              of this, as a new turn of expression, - '&quot;who, by making himself 
              necessary to him, had achieved his destruction. All this I undertake 
              to show. Probably much more!&quot;' </p>
            <p>　　I whispered a few words to Agnes, who was weeping, half joyfully, 
              half sorrowfully, at my side; and there was a movement among us, 
              as if Mr. Micawber had finished. He said, with exceeding gravity, 
              'Pardon me,' and proceeded, with a mixture of the lowest spirits 
              and the most intense enjoyment, to the peroration of his letter. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'&quot;I have now concluded. It merely remains for me to substantiate 
              these accusations; and then, with my ill-starred family, to disappear 
              from the landscape on which we appear to be an encumbrance. That 
              is soon done. It may be reasonably inferred that our baby will first 
              expire of inanition, as being the frailest member of our circle; 
              and that our twins will follow next in order. So be it! For myself, 
              my Canterbury Pilgrimage has done much; imprisonment on civil process, 
              and want, will soon do more. I trust that the labour and hazard 
              of an investigation - of which the smallest results have been slowly 
              pieced together, in the pressure of arduous avocations, under grinding 
              penurious apprehensions, at rise of morn, at dewy eve, in the shadows 
              of night, under the watchful eye of one whom it were superfluous 
              to call Demon - combined with the struggle of parental Poverty to 
              turn it, when completed, to the right account, may be as the sprinkling 
              of a few drops of sweet water on my funeral pyre. I ask no more. 
              Let it be, in justice, merely said of me, as of a gallant and eminent 
              naval Hero, with whom I have no pretensions to cope, that what I 
              have done, I did, in despite of mercenary and selfish objects, </p>
            <p>　　 For England, home, and Beauty. </p>
            <p>　　 '&quot;Remaining always, &amp;c. &amp;c., WILKINS MICAWBER.&quot;' 
            </p>
            <p>　　 Much affected, but still intensely enjoying himself, Mr. Micawber 
              folded up his letter, and handed it with a bow to my aunt, as something 
              she might like to keep. </p>
            <p>　　There was, as I had noticed on my first visit long ago, an iron 
              safe in the room. The key was in it. A hasty suspicion seemed to 
              strike Uriah; and, with a glance at Mr. Micawber, he went to it, 
              and threw the doors clanking open. It was empty. </p>
            <p>　　'Where are the books?' he cried, with a frightful face. 'Some 
              thief has stolen the books!' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber tapped himself with the ruler. 'I did, when I got 
              the key from you as usual - but a little earlier - and opened it 
              this morning.' </p>
            <p>　　'Don't be uneasy,' said Traddles. 'They have come into my possession. 
              I will take care of them, under the authority I mentioned.' </p>
            <p>　　'You receive stolen goods, do you?' cried Uriah. </p>
            <p>　　'Under such circumstances,' answered Traddles, 'yes.' </p>
            <p>　　What was my astonishment when I beheld my aunt, who had been 
              profoundly quiet and attentive, make a dart at Uriah Heep, and seize 
              him by the collar with both hands! </p>
            <p>　　'You know what I want?' said my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　'A strait-waistcoat,' said he. </p>
            <p>　　'No. My property!' returned my aunt. 'Agnes, my dear, as long 
              as I believed it had been really made away with by your father, 
              I wouldn't - and, my dear, I didn't, even to Trot, as he knows - 
              breathe a syllable of its having been placed here for investment. 
              But, now I know this fellow's answerable for it, and I'll have it! 
              Trot, come and take it away from him!' </p>
            <p>　　Whether my aunt supposed, for the moment, that he kept her property 
              in his neck-kerchief, I am sure I don't know; but she certainly 
              pulled at it as if she thought so. I hastened to put myself between 
              them, and to assure her that we would all take care that he should 
              make the utmost restitution of everything he had wrongly got. This, 
              and a few moments' reflection, pacified her; but she was not at 
              all disconcerted by what she had done (though I cannot say as much 
              for her bonnet) and resumed her seat composedly. </p>
            <p>　　During the last few minutes, Mrs. Heep had been clamouring to 
              her son to be 'umble'; and had been going down on her knees to all 
              of us in succession, and making the wildest promises. Her son sat 
              her down in his chair; and, standing sulkily by her, holding her 
              arm with his hand, but not rudely, said to me, with a ferocious 
              look: </p>
            <p>　　'What do you want done?' </p>
            <p>　　'I will tell you what must be done,' said Traddles. </p>
            <p>　　'Has that Copperfield no tongue?' muttered Uriah, 'I would do 
              a good deal for you if you could tell me, without lying, that somebody 
              had cut it out.' </p>
            <p>　　'My Uriah means to be umble!' cried his mother. 'Don't mind what 
              he says, good gentlemen!' </p>
            <p>　　'What must be done,' said Traddles, 'is this. First, the deed 
              of relinquishment, that we have heard of, must be given over to 
              me now - here.' </p>
            <p>　　'Suppose I haven't got it,' he interrupted. </p>
            <p>　　'But you have,' said Traddles; 'therefore, you know, we won't 
              suppose so.' And I cannot help avowing that this was the first occasion 
              on which I really did justice to the clear head, and the plain, 
              patient, practical good sense, of my old schoolfellow. 'Then,' said 
              Traddles, 'you must prepare to disgorge all that your rapacity has 
              become possessed of, and to make restoration to the last farthing. 
              All the partnership books and papers must remain in our possession; 
              all your books and papers; all money accounts and securities, of 
              both kinds. In short, everything here.' </p>
            <p>　　'Must it? I don't know that,' said Uriah. 'I must have time to 
              think about that.' </p>
            <p>　　'Certainly,' replied Traddles; 'but, in the meanwhile, and until 
              everything is done to our satisfaction, we shall maintain possession 
              of these things; and beg you - in short, compel you - to keep to 
              your own room, and hold no communication with anyone.' </p>
            <p>　　'I won't do it!' said Uriah, with an oath. </p>
            <p>　　'Maidstone jail is a safer place of detention,' observed Traddles; 
              'and though the law may be longer in righting us, and may not be 
              able to right us so completely as you can, there is no doubt of 
              its punishing YOU. Dear me, you know that quite as well as I! Copperfield, 
              will you go round to the Guildhall, and bring a couple of officers?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　Here, Mrs. Heep broke out again, crying on her knees to Agnes 
              to interfere in their behalf, exclaiming that he was very humble, 
              and it was all true, and if he didn't do what we wanted, she would, 
              and much more to the same purpose; being half frantic with fears 
              for her darling. To inquire what he might have done, if he had had 
              any boldness, would be like inquiring what a mongrel cur might do, 
              if it had the spirit of a tiger. He was a coward, from head to foot; 
              and showed his dastardly nature through his sullenness and mortification, 
              as much as at any time of his mean life. </p>
            <p>　　'Stop!' he growled to me; and wiped his hot face with his hand. 
              'Mother, hold your noise. Well! Let 'em have that deed. Go and fetch 
              it!' </p>
            <p>　　'Do you help her, Mr. Dick,' said Traddles, 'if you please.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　Proud of his commission, and understanding it, Mr. Dick accompanied 
              her as a shepherd's dog might accompany a sheep. But, Mrs. Heep 
              gave him little trouble; for she not only returned with the deed, 
              but with the box in which it was, where we found a banker's book 
              and some other papers that were afterwards serviceable. </p>
            <p>　　'Good!' said Traddles, when this was brought. 'Now, Mr. Heep, 
              you can retire to think: particularly observing, if you please, 
              that I declare to you, on the part of all present, that there is 
              only one thing to be done; that it is what I have explained; and 
              that it must be done without delay.' </p>
            <p>　　Uriah, without lifting his eyes from the ground, shuffled across 
              the room with his hand to his chin, and pausing at the door, said: 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Copperfield, I have always hated you. You've always been an 
              upstart, and you've always been against me.' </p>
            <p>　　'As I think I told you once before,' said I, 'it is you who have 
              been, in your greed and cunning, against all the world. It may be 
              profitable to you to reflect, in future, that there never were greed 
              and cunning in the world yet, that did not do too much, and overreach 
              themselves. It is as certain as death.' </p>
            <p>　　'Or as certain as they used to teach at school (the same school 
              where I picked up so much umbleness), from nine o'clock to eleven, 
              that labour was a curse; and from eleven o'clock to one, that it 
              was a blessing and a cheerfulness, and a dignity, and I don't know 
              what all, eh?' said he with a sneer. 'You preach, about as consistent 
              as they did. Won't umbleness go down? I shouldn't have got round 
              my gentleman fellow-partner without it, I think. - Micawber, you 
              old bully, I'll pay YOU!' </p>
            <p>　　Mr. Micawber, supremely defiant of him and his extended finger, 
              and making a great deal of his chest until he had slunk out at the 
              door, then addressed himself to me, and proffered me the satisfaction 
              of 'witnessing the re-establishment of mutual confidence between 
              himself and Mrs. Micawber'. After which, he invited the company 
              generally to the contemplation of that affecting spectacle. </p>
            <p>　　'The veil that has long been interposed between Mrs. Micawber 
              and myself, is now withdrawn,' said Mr. Micawber; 'and my children 
              and the Author of their Being can once more come in contact on equal 
              terms.' </p>
            <p>　　As we were all very grateful to him, and all desirous to show 
              that we were, as well as the hurry and disorder of our spirits would 
              permit, I dare say we should all have gone, but that it was necessary 
              for Agnes to return to her father, as yet unable to bear more than 
              the dawn of hope; and for someone else to hold Uriah in safe keeping. 
              So, Traddles remained for the latter purpose, to be presently relieved 
              by Mr. Dick; and Mr. Dick, my aunt, and I, went home with Mr. Micawber. 
              As I parted hurriedly from the dear girl to whom I owed so much, 
              and thought from what she had been saved, perhaps, that morning 
              - her better resolution notwithstanding - I felt devoutly thankful 
              for the miseries of my younger days which had brought me to the 
              knowledge of Mr. Micawber. </p>
            <p>　　His house was not far off; and as the street door opened into 
              the sitting-room, and he bolted in with a precipitation quite his 
              own, we found ourselves at once in the bosom of the family. Mr. 
              Micawber exclaiming, 'Emma! my life!' rushed into Mrs. Micawber's 
              arms. Mrs. Micawber shrieked, and folded Mr. Micawber in her embrace. 
              Miss Micawber, nursing the unconscious stranger of Mrs. Micawber's 
              last letter to me, was sensibly affected. The stranger leaped. The 
              twins testified their joy by several inconvenient but innocent demonstrations. 
              Master Micawber, whose disposition appeared to have been soured 
              by early disappointment, and whose aspect had become morose, yielded 
              to his better feelings, and blubbered. </p>
            <p>　　'Emma!' said Mr. Micawber. 'The cloud is past from my mind. Mutual 
              confidence, so long preserved between us once, is restored, to know 
              no further interruption. Now, welcome poverty!' cried Mr. Micawber, 
              shedding tears. 'Welcome misery, welcome houselessness, welcome 
              hunger, rags, tempest, and beggary! Mutual confidence will sustain 
              us to the end!' </p>
            <p>　　With these expressions, Mr. Micawber placed Mrs. Micawber in 
              a chair, and embraced the family all round; welcoming a variety 
              of bleak prospects, which appeared, to the best of my judgement, 
              to be anything but welcome to them; and calling upon them to come 
              out into Canterbury and sing a chorus, as nothing else was left 
              for their support. </p>
            <p>　　But Mrs. Micawber having, in the strength of her emotions, fainted 
              away, the first thing to be done, even before the chorus could be 
              considered complete, was to recover her. This my aunt and Mr. Micawber 
              did; and then my aunt was introduced, and Mrs. Micawber recognized 
              me. </p>
            <p>　　'Excuse me, dear Mr. Copperfield,' said the poor lady, giving 
              me her hand, 'but I am not strong; and the removal of the late misunderstanding 
              between Mr. Micawber and myself was at first too much for me.' </p>
            <p>　　'Is this all your family, ma'am?' said my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　'There are no more at present,' returned Mrs. Micawber. </p>
            <p>　　'Good gracious, I didn't mean that, ma'am,' said my aunt. 'I 
              mean, are all these yours?' </p>
            <p>　　'Madam,' replied Mr. Micawber, 'it is a true bill.' </p>
            <p>　　'And that eldest young gentleman, now,' said my aunt, musing, 
              'what has he been brought up to?' </p>
            <p>　　'It was my hope when I came here,' said Mr. Micawber, 'to have 
              got Wilkins into the Church: or perhaps I shall express my meaning 
              more strictly, if I say the Choir. But there was no vacancy for 
              a tenor in the venerable Pile for which this city is so justly eminent; 
              and he has - in short, he has contracted a habit of singing in public-houses, 
              rather than in sacred edifices.' </p>
            <p>　　'But he means well,' said Mrs. Micawber, tenderly. </p>
            <p>　　'I dare say, my love,' rejoined Mr. Micawber, 'that he means 
              particularly well; but I have not yet found that he carries out 
              his meaning, in any given direction whatsoever.' </p>
            <p>　　Master Micawber's moroseness of aspect returned upon him again, 
              and he demanded, with some temper, what he was to do? Whether he 
              had been born a carpenter, or a coach-painter, any more than he 
              had been born a bird? Whether he could go into the next street, 
              and open a chemist's shop? Whether he could rush to the next assizes, 
              and proclaim himself a lawyer? Whether he could come out by force 
              at the opera, and succeed by violence? Whether he could do anything, 
              without being brought up to something? </p>
            <p>　　My aunt mused a little while, and then said: </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Micawber, I wonder you have never turned your thoughts to 
              emigration.' </p>
            <p>　　'Madam,' returned Mr. Micawber, 'it was the dream of my youth, 
              and the fallacious aspiration of my riper years.' I am thoroughly 
              persuaded, by the by, that he had never thought of it in his life. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Aye?' said my aunt, with a glance at me. 'Why, what a thing 
              it would be for yourselves and your family, Mr. and Mrs. Micawber, 
              if you were to emigrate now.' </p>
            <p>　　'Capital, madam, capital,' urged Mr. Micawber, gloomily. </p>
            <p>　　'That is the principal, I may say the only difficulty, my dear 
              Mr. Copperfield,' assented his wife. </p>
            <p>　　'Capital?' cried my aunt. 'But you are doing us a great service 
              - have done us a great service, I may say, for surely much will 
              come out of the fire - and what could we do for you, that would 
              be half so good as to find the capital?' </p>
            <p>　　'I could not receive it as a gift,' said Mr. Micawber, full of 
              fire and animation, 'but if a sufficient sum could be advanced, 
              say at five per cent interest, per annum, upon my personal liability 
              - say my notes of hand, at twelve, eighteen, and twenty-four months, 
              respectively, to allow time for something to turn up -' </p>
            <p>　　'Could be? Can be and shall be, on your own terms,' returned 
              my aunt, 'if you say the word. Think of this now, both of you. Here 
              are some people David knows, going out to Australia shortly. If 
              you decide to go, why shouldn't you go in the same ship? You may 
              help each other. Think of this now, Mr. and Mrs. Micawber. Take 
              your time, and weigh it well.' </p>
            <p>　　'There is but one question, my dear ma'am, I could wish to ask,' 
              said Mrs. Micawber. 'The climate, I believe, is healthy?' </p>
            <p>　　'Finest in the world!' said my aunt. </p>
            <p>　　'Just so,' returned Mrs. Micawber. 'Then my question arises. 
              Now, are the circumstances of the country such, that a man of Mr. 
              Micawber's abilities would have a fair chance of rising in the social 
              scale? I will not say, at present, might he aspire to be Governor, 
              or anything of that sort; but would there be a reasonable opening 
              for his talents to develop themselves - that would be amply sufficient 
              - and find their own expansion?' </p>
            <p>　　'No better opening anywhere,' said my aunt, 'for a man who conducts 
              himself well, and is industrious.' </p>
            <p>　　'For a man who conducts himself well,' repeated Mrs. Micawber, 
              with her clearest business manner, 'and is industrious. Precisely. 
              It is evident to me that Australia is the legitimate sphere of action 
              for Mr. Micawber!' </p>
            <p>　　'I entertain the conviction, my dear madam,' said Mr. Micawber, 
              'that it is, under existing circumstances, the land, the only land, 
              for myself and family; and that something of an extraordinary nature 
              will turn up on that shore. It is no distance - comparatively speaking; 
              and though consideration is due to the kindness of your proposal,

            <p>　　Shall I ever forget how, in a moment, he was the most sanguine 
              of men, looking on to fortune; or how Mrs. Micawber presently discoursed

              of Canterbury on a market-day, without recalling him, as he walked 
              back with us; expressing, in the hardy roving manner he assumed, 
              the unsettled habits of a temporary sojourner in the land; and looking 
              at the bullocks, as they came by, with the eye of an Australian 
              farmer! </p>

            <p>　　The gloomy taint that was in the Murdstone blood, darkened the 
              Murdstone religion, which was austere and wrathful. I have thought, 
              since, that its assuming that character was a necessary consequence 
              of Mr. Murdstone's firmness, which wouldn't allow him to let anybody 
              off from the utmost weight of the severest penalties he could find 
              any excuse for. Be this as it may, I well remember the tremendous 
              visages with which we used to go to church, and the changed air 
              of the place. Again, the dreaded Sunday comes round, and I file 
              into the old pew first, like a guarded captive brought to a condemned 
              service. Again, Miss Murdstone, in a black velvet gown, that looks 
              as if it had been made out of a pall, follows close upon me; then 
              my mother; then her husband. There is no Peggotty now, as in the 
              old time. Again, I listen to Miss Murdstone mumbling the responses, 
              and emphasizing all the dread words with a cruel relish. Again, 
              I see her dark eyes roll round the church when she says 'miserable 
              sinners', as if she were calling all the congregation names. Again, 
              I catch rare glimpses of my mother, moving her lips timidly between 
              the two, with one of them muttering at each ear like low thunder. 
              Again, I wonder with a sudden fear whether it is likely that our 
              good old clergyman can be wrong, and Mr. and Miss Murdstone right, 
              and that all the angels in Heaven can be destroying angels. Again, 
              if I move a finger or relax a muscle of my face, Miss Murdstone 
              pokes me with her prayer-book, and makes my side ache. </p>
            <p>　　Yes, and again, as we walk home, I note some neighbours looking 
              at my mother and at me, and whispering. Again, as the three go on 
              arm-in-arm, and I linger behind alone, I follow some of those looks, 
              and wonder if my mother's step be really not so light as I have 
              seen it, and if the gaiety of her beauty be really almost worried 
              away. Again, I wonder whether any of the neighbours call to mind, 
              as I do, how we used to walk home together, she and I; and I wonder 
              stupidly about that, all the dreary dismal day. </p>
            <p>　　There had been some talk on occasions of my going to boarding- 
              school. Mr. and Miss Murdstone had originated it, and my mother 
              had of course agreed with them. Nothing, however, was concluded 
              on the subject yet. In the meantime, I learnt lessons at home. Shall 
              I ever forget those lessons! They were presided over nominally by 
              my mother, but really by Mr. Murdstone and his sister, who were 
              always present, and found them a favourable occasion for giving 
              my mother lessons in that miscalled firmness, which was the bane 
              of both our lives. I believe I was kept at home for that purpose. 
              I had been apt enough to learn, and willing enough, when my mother 
              and I had lived alone together. I can faintly remember learning 
              the alphabet at her knee. To this day, when I look upon the fat 
              black letters in the primer, the puzzling novelty of their shapes, 
              and the easy good-nature of O and Q and S, seem to present themselves 
              again before me as they used to do. But they recall no feeling of 
              disgust or reluctance. On the contrary, I seem to have walked along 
              a path of flowers as far as the crocodile-book, and to have been 
              cheered by the gentleness of my mother's voice and manner all the 
              way. But these solemn lessons which succeeded those, I remember 
              as the death-blow of my peace, and a grievous daily drudgery and 
              misery. They were very long, very numerous, very hard - perfectly 
              unintelligible, some of them, to me - and I was generally as much 
              bewildered by them as I believe my poor mother was herself. </p>
            <p>　　Let me remember how it used to be, and bring one morning back 
              again. </p>
            <p>　　I come into the second-best parlour after breakfast, with my 
              books, and an exercise-book, and a slate. My mother is ready for 
              me at her writing-desk, but not half so ready as Mr. Murdstone in 
              his easy-chair by the window (though he pretends to be reading a 
              book), or as Miss Murdstone, sitting near my mother stringing steel 
              beads. The very sight of these two has such an influence over me, 
              that I begin to feel the words I have been at infinite pains to 
              get into my head, all sliding away, and going I don't know where. 
              I wonder where they do go, by the by? </p>
            <p>　　I hand the first book to my mother. Perhaps it is a grammar, 
              perhaps a history, or geography. I take a last drowning look at 
              the page as I give it into her hand, and start off aloud at a racing 
              pace while I have got it fresh. I trip over a word. Mr. Murdstone 
              looks up. I trip over another word. Miss Murdstone looks up. I redden, 
              tumble over half-a-dozen words, and stop. I think my mother would 
              show me the book if she dared, but she does not dare, and she says 
              softly: </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, Davy, Davy!' </p>
            <p>　　'Now, Clara,' says Mr. Murdstone, 'be firm with the boy. Don't 
              say, &quot;Oh, Davy, Davy!&quot; That's childish. He knows his lesson, 
              or he does not know it.' </p>
            <p>　　'He does NOT know it,' Miss Murdstone interposes awfully. </p>
            <p>　　'I am really afraid he does not,' says my mother. </p>
            <p>　　'Then, you see, Clara,' returns Miss Murdstone, 'you should just 
              give him the book back, and make him know it.' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, certainly,' says my mother; 'that is what I intend to do, 
              my dear Jane. Now, Davy, try once more, and don't be stupid.' </p>
            <p>　　I obey the first clause of the injunction by trying once more, 
              but am not so successful with the second, for I am very stupid. 
              I tumble down before I get to the old place, at a point where I 
              was all right before, and stop to think. But I can't think about 
              the lesson. I think of the number of yards of net in Miss Murdstone's 
              cap, or of the price of Mr. Murdstone's dressing-gown, or any such 
              ridiculous problem that I have no business with, and don't want 
              to have anything at all to do with. Mr. Murdstone makes a movement 
              of impatience which I have been expecting for a long time. Miss 
              Murdstone does the same. My mother glances submissively at them, 
              shuts the book, and lays it by as an arrear to be worked out when 
              my other tasks are done. </p>
            <p>　　There is a pile of these arrears very soon, and it swells like 
              a rolling snowball. The bigger it gets, the more stupid I get. The 
              case is so hopeless, and I feel that I am wallowing in such a bog 
              of nonsense, that I give up all idea of getting out, and abandon 
              myself to my fate. The despairing way in which my mother and I look 
              at each other, as I blunder on, is truly melancholy. But the greatest 
              effect in these miserable lessons is when my mother (thinking nobody 
              is observing her) tries to give me the cue by the motion of her 
              lips. At that instant, Miss Murdstone, who has been lying in wait 
              for nothing else all along, says in a deep warning voice: </p>
            <p>　　'Clara!' </p>
            <p>　　My mother starts, colours, and smiles faintly. Mr. Murdstone 
              comes out of his chair, takes the book, throws it at me or boxes 
              my ears with it, and turns me out of the room by the shoulders. 
            </p>
            <p>　　Even when the lessons are done, the worst is yet to happen, in 
              the shape of an appalling sum. This is invented for me, and delivered 
              to me orally by Mr. Murdstone, and begins, 'If I go into a cheesemonger's 
              shop, and buy five thousand double-Gloucester cheeses at fourpence-halfpenny 
              each, present payment' - at which I see Miss Murdstone secretly 
              overjoyed. I pore over these cheeses without any result or enlightenment 
              until dinner-time, when, having made a Mulatto of myself by getting 
              the dirt of the slate into the pores of my skin, I have a slice 
              of bread to help me out with the cheeses, and am considered in disgrace 
              for the rest of the evening. </p>
            <p>　　It seems to me, at this distance of time, as if my unfortunate 
              studies generally took this course. I could have done very well 
              if I had been without the Murdstones; but the influence of the Murdstones 
              upon me was like the fascination of two snakes on a wretched young 
              bird. Even when I did get through the morning with tolerable credit, 
              there was not much gained but dinner; for Miss Murdstone never could 
              endure to see me untasked, and if I rashly made any show of being 
              unemployed, called her brother's attention to me by saying, 'Clara, 
              my dear, there's nothing like work - give your boy an exercise'; 
              which caused me to be clapped down to some new labour, there and 
              then. As to any recreation with other children of my age, I had 
              very little of that; for the gloomy theology of the Murdstones made 
              all children out to be a swarm of little vipers (though there WAS 
              a child once set in the midst of the Disciples), and held that they 
              contaminated one another. </p>
            <p>　　The natural result of this treatment, continued, I suppose, for 
              some six months or more, was to make me sullen, dull, and dogged. 
              I was not made the less so by my sense of being daily more and more 
              shut out and alienated from my mother. I believe I should have been 
              almost stupefied but for one circumstance. </p>
            <p>　　It was this. My father had left a small collection of books in 
              a little room upstairs, to which I had access (for it adjoined my 
              own) and which nobody else in our house ever troubled. From that 
              blessed little room, Roderick Random, Peregrine Pickle, Humphrey 
              Clinker, Tom Jones, the Vicar of Wakefield, Don Quixote, Gil Blas, 
              and Robinson Crusoe, came out, a glorious host, to keep me company. 
              They kept alive my fancy, and my hope of something beyond that place 
              and time, - they, and the Arabian Nights, and the Tales of the Genii, 
              - and did me no harm; for whatever harm was in some of them was 
              not there for me; I knew nothing of it. It is astonishing to me 
              now, how I found time, in the midst of my porings and blunderings 
              over heavier themes, to read those books as I did. It is curious 
              to me how I could ever have consoled myself under my small troubles 
              (which were great troubles to me), by impersonating my favourite 
              characters in them - as I did - and by putting Mr. and Miss Murdstone 
              into all the bad ones - which I did too. I have been Tom Jones (a 
              child's Tom Jones, a harmless creature) for a week together. I have 
              sustained my own idea of Roderick Random for a month at a stretch, 
              I verily believe. I had a greedy relish for a few volumes of Voyages 
              and Travels - I forget what, now - that were on those shelves; and 
              for days and days I can remember to have gone about my region of 
              our house, armed with the centre-piece out of an old set of boot-trees 
              - the perfect realization of Captain Somebody, of the Royal British 
              Navy, in danger of being beset by savages, and resolved to sell 
              his life at a great price. The Captain never lost dignity, from 
              having his ears boxed with the Latin Grammar. I did; but the Captain 
              was a Captain and a hero, in despite of all the grammars of all 
              the languages in the world, dead or alive. </p>
            <p>　　This was my only and my constant comfort. When I think of it, 
              the picture always rises in my mind, of a summer evening, the boys 
              at play in the churchyard, and I sitting on my bed, reading as if 
              for life. Every barn in the neighbourhood, every stone in the church, 
              and every foot of the churchyard, had some association of its own, 
              in my mind, connected with these books, and stood for some locality 
              made famous in them. I have seen Tom Pipes go climbing up the church-steeple; 
              I have watched Strap, with the knapsack on his back, stopping to 
              rest himself upon the wicket-gate; and I know that Commodore Trunnion 
              held that club with Mr. Pickle, in the parlour of our little village 
              alehouse. </p>
            <p>　　The reader now understands, as well as I do, what I was when 
              I came to that point of my youthful history to which I am now coming 
              again. </p>
            <p>　　One morning when I went into the parlour with my books, I found 
              my mother looking anxious, Miss Murdstone looking firm, and Mr. 
              Murdstone binding something round the bottom of a cane - a lithe 
              and limber cane, which he left off binding when I came in, and poised 
              and switched in the air. </p>
            <p>　　'I tell you, Clara,' said Mr. Murdstone, 'I have been often flogged 
              myself.' </p>
            <p>　　'To be sure; of course,' said Miss Murdstone. </p>
            <p>　　'Certainly, my dear Jane,' faltered my mother, meekly. 'But - 
              but do you think it did Edward good?' </p>
            <p>　　'Do you think it did Edward harm, Clara?' asked Mr. Murdstone, 
              gravely. </p>
            <p>　　'That's the point,' said his sister. </p>
            <p>　　To this my mother returned, 'Certainly, my dear Jane,' and said 
              no more. </p>
            <p>　　I felt apprehensive that I was personally interested in this 
              dialogue, and sought Mr. Murdstone's eye as it lighted on mine. 
            </p>
            <p>　　'Now, David,' he said - and I saw that cast again as he said 
              it - 'you must be far more careful today than usual.' He gave the 
              cane another poise, and another switch; and having finished his 
              preparation of it, laid it down beside him, with an impressive look, 
              and took up his book. </p>
            <p>　　This was a good freshener to my presence of mind, as a beginning. 
              I felt the words of my lessons slipping off, not one by one, or 
              line by line, but by the entire page; I tried to lay hold of them; 
              but they seemed, if I may so express it, to have put skates on, 
              and to skim away from me with a smoothness there was no checking. 
            </p>
            <p>　　We began badly, and went on worse. I had come in with an idea 
              of distinguishing myself rather, conceiving that I was very well 
              prepared; but it turned out to be quite a mistake. Book after book 
              was added to the heap of failures, Miss Murdstone being firmly watchful 
              of us all the time. And when we came at last to the five thousand 
              cheeses (canes he made it that day, I remember), my mother burst 
              out crying. </p>
            <p>　　'Clara!' said Miss Murdstone, in her warning voice. </p>
            <p>　　'I am not quite well, my dear Jane, I think,' said my mother. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I saw him wink, solemnly, at his sister, as he rose and said, 
              taking up the cane: </p>
            <p>　　'Why, Jane, we can hardly expect Clara to bear, with perfect 
              firmness, the worry and torment that David has occasioned her today. 
              That would be stoical. Clara is greatly strengthened and improved, 
              but we can hardly expect so much from her. David, you and I will 
              go upstairs, boy.' </p>
            <p>　　As he took me out at the door, my mother ran towards us. Miss 
              Murdstone said, 'Clara! are you a perfect fool?' and interfered. 
              I saw my mother stop her ears then, and I heard her crying. </p>
            <p>　　He walked me up to my room slowly and gravely - I am certain 
              he had a delight in that formal parade of executing justice - and 
              when we got there, suddenly twisted my head under his arm. </p>
            <p>　　'Mr. Murdstone! Sir!' I cried to him. 'Don't! Pray don't beat 
              me! I have tried to learn, sir, but I can't learn while you and 
              Miss Murdstone are by. I can't indeed!' </p>
            <p>　　'Can't you, indeed, David?' he said. 'We'll try that.' </p>
            <p>　　He had my head as in a vice, but I twined round him somehow, 
              and stopped him for a moment, entreating him not to beat me. It 
              was only a moment that I stopped him, for he cut me heavily an instant 
              afterwards, and in the same instant I caught the hand with which 
              he held me in my mouth, between my teeth, and bit it through. It 
              sets my teeth on edge to think of it. </p>
            <p>　　He beat me then, as if he would have beaten me to death. Above 
              all the noise we made, I heard them running up the stairs, and crying 
              out - I heard my mother crying out - and Peggotty. Then he was gone; 
              and the door was locked outside; and I was lying, fevered and hot, 
              and torn, and sore, and raging in my puny way, upon the floor. </p>
            <p>　　How well I recollect, when I became quiet, what an unnatural 
              stillness seemed to reign through the whole house! How well I remember, 
              when my smart and passion began to cool, how wicked I began to feel! 
            </p>
            <p>　　I sat listening for a long while, but there was not a sound. 
              I crawled up from the floor, and saw my face in the glass, so swollen, 
              red, and ugly that it almost frightened me. My stripes were sore 
              and stiff, and made me cry afresh, when I moved; but they were nothing 
              to the guilt I felt. It lay heavier on my breast than if I had been 
              a most atrocious criminal, I dare say. </p>
            <p>　　It had begun to grow dark, and I had shut the window (I had been 
              lying, for the most part, with my head upon the sill, by turns crying, 
              dozing, and looking listlessly out), when the key was turned, and 
              Miss Murdstone came in with some bread and meat, and milk. These 
              she put down upon the table without a word, glaring at me the while 
              with exemplary firmness, and then retired, locking the door after 
              her. </p>
            <p>　　Long after it was dark I sat there, wondering whether anybody 
              else would come. When this appeared improbable for that night, I 
              undressed, and went to bed; and, there, I began to wonder fearfully 
              what would be done to me. Whether it was a criminal act that I had 
              committed? Whether I should be taken into custody, and sent to prison? 
              Whether I was at all in danger of being hanged? </p>
            <p>　　I never shall forget the waking, next morning; the being cheerful 
              and fresh for the first moment, and then the being weighed down 
              by the stale and dismal oppression of remembrance. Miss Murdstone 
              reappeared before I was out of bed; told me, in so many words, that 
              I was free to walk in the garden for half an hour and no longer; 
              and retired, leaving the door open, that I might avail myself of 
              that permission. </p>
            <p>　　I did so, and did so every morning of my imprisonment, which 
              lasted five days. If I could have seen my mother alone, I should 
              have gone down on my knees to her and besought her forgiveness; 
              but I saw no one, Miss Murdstone excepted, during the whole time 
              - except at evening prayers in the parlour; to which I was escorted 
              by Miss Murdstone after everybody else was placed; where I was stationed, 
              a young outlaw, all alone by myself near the door; and whence I 
              was solemnly conducted by my jailer, before any one arose from the 
              devotional posture. I only observed that my mother was as far off 
              from me as she could be, and kept her face another way so that I 
              never saw it; and that Mr. Murdstone's hand was bound up in a large 
              linen wrapper. </p>
            <p>　　The length of those five days I can convey no idea of to any 
              one. They occupy the place of years in my remembrance. The way in 
              which I listened to all the incidents of the house that made themselves 
              audible to me; the ringing of bells, the opening and shutting of 
              doors, the murmuring of voices, the footsteps on the stairs; to 
              any laughing, whistling, or singing, outside, which seemed more 
              dismal than anything else to me in my solitude and disgrace - the 
              uncertain pace of the hours, especially at night, when I would wake 
              thinking it was morning, and find that the family were not yet gone 
              to bed, and that all the length of night had yet to come - the depressed 
              dreams and nightmares I had - the return of day, noon, afternoon, 
              evening, when the boys played in the churchyard, and I watched them 
              from a distance within the room, being ashamed to show myself at 
              the window lest they should know I was a prisoner - the strange 
              sensation of never hearing myself speak - the fleeting intervals 
              of something like cheerfulness, which came with eating and drinking, 
              and went away with it - the setting in of rain one evening, with 
              a fresh smell, and its coming down faster and faster between me 
              and the church, until it and gathering night seemed to quench me 
              in gloom, and fear, and remorse - all this appears to have gone 
              round and round for years instead of days, it is so vividly and 
              strongly stamped on my remembrance. On the last night of my restraint, 
              I was awakened by hearing my own name spoken in a whisper. I started 
              up in bed, and putting out my arms in the dark, said: </p>
            <p>　　'Is that you, Peggotty?' </p>
            <p>　　There was no immediate answer, but presently I heard my name 
              again, in a tone so very mysterious and awful, that I think I should 
              have gone into a fit, if it had not occurred to me that it must 
              have come through the keyhole. </p>
            <p>　　I groped my way to the door, and putting my own lips to the keyhole, 
              whispered: 'Is that you, Peggotty dear?' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, my own precious Davy,' she replied. 'Be as soft as a mouse, 
              or the Cat'll hear us.' </p>
            <p>　　I understood this to mean Miss Murdstone, and was sensible of 
              the urgency of the case; her room being close by. </p>
            <p>　　'How's mama, dear Peggotty? Is she very angry with me?' </p>
            <p>　　I could hear Peggotty crying softly on her side of the keyhole, 
              as I was doing on mine, before she answered. 'No. Not very.' </p>
            <p>　　'What is going to be done with me, Peggotty dear? Do you know?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　'School. Near London,' was Peggotty's answer. I was obliged to 
              get her to repeat it, for she spoke it the first time quite down 
              my throat, in consequence of my having forgotten to take my mouth 
              away from the keyhole and put my ear there; and though her words 
              tickled me a good deal, I didn't hear them. </p>
            <p>　　'When, Peggotty?' </p>
            <p>　　'Tomorrow.' </p>
            <p>　　'Is that the reason why Miss Murdstone took the clothes out of 
              my drawers?' which she had done, though I have forgotten to mention 
              it. </p>
            <p>　　'Yes,' said Peggotty. 'Box.' </p>
            <p>　　'Shan't I see mama?' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes,' said Peggotty. 'Morning.' </p>
            <p>　　Then Peggotty fitted her mouth close to the keyhole, and delivered 
              these words through it with as much feeling and earnestness as a 
              keyhole has ever been the medium of communicating, I will venture 
              to assert: shooting in each broken little sentence in a convulsive 
              little burst of its own. </p>
            <p>　　'Davy, dear. If I ain't been azackly as intimate with you. Lately, 
              as I used to be. It ain't because I don't love you. just as well 
              and more, my pretty poppet. It's because I thought it better for 
              you. And for someone else besides. Davy, my darling, are you listening? 
              Can you hear?' </p>
            <p>　　'Ye-ye-ye-yes, Peggotty!' I sobbed. </p>
            <p>　　'My own!' said Peggotty, with infinite compassion. 'What I want 
              to say, is. That you must never forget me. For I'll never forget 
              you. And I'll take as much care of your mama, Davy. As ever I took 
              of you. And I won't leave her. The day may come when she'll be glad 
              to lay her poor head. On her stupid, cross old Peggotty's arm again. 
              And I'll write to you, my dear. Though I ain't no scholar. And I'll 
              - I'll -' Peggotty fell to kissing the keyhole, as she couldn't 
              kiss me. </p>
            <p>　　'Thank you, dear Peggotty!' said I. 'Oh, thank you! Thank you! 
              Will you promise me one thing, Peggotty? Will you write and tell 
              Mr. Peggotty and little Em'ly, and Mrs. Gummidge and Ham, that I 
              am not so bad as they might suppose, and that I sent 'em all my 
              love - especially to little Em'ly? Will you, if you please, Peggotty?' 
            </p>
            <p>　　The kind soul promised, and we both of us kissed the keyhole 
              with the greatest affection - I patted it with my hand, I recollect, 
              as if it had been her honest face - and parted. From that night 
              there grew up in my breast a feeling for Peggotty which I cannot 
              very well define. She did not replace my mother; no one could do 
              that; but she came into a vacancy in my heart, which closed upon 
              her, and I felt towards her something I have never felt for any 
              other human being. It was a sort of comical affection, too; and 
              yet if she had died, I cannot think what I should have done, or 
              how I should have acted out the tragedy it would have been to me. 
            </p>
            <p>　　In the morning Miss Murdstone appeared as usual, and told me 
              I was going to school; which was not altogether such news to me 
              as she supposed. She also informed me that when I was dressed, I 
              was to come downstairs into the parlour, and have my breakfast. 
              There, I found my mother, very pale and with red eyes: into whose 
              arms I ran, and begged her pardon from my suffering soul. </p>
            <p>　　'Oh, Davy!' she said. 'That you could hurt anyone I love! Try 
              to be better, pray to be better! I forgive you; but I am so grieved, 
              Davy, that you should have such bad passions in your heart.' </p>
            <p>　　They had persuaded her that I was a wicked fellow, and she was 
              more sorry for that than for my going away. I felt it sorely. I 
              tried to eat my parting breakfast, but my tears dropped upon my 
              bread- and-butter, and trickled into my tea. I saw my mother look 
              at me sometimes, and then glance at the watchful Miss Murdstone, 
              and than look down, or look away. </p>
            <p>　　'Master Copperfield's box there!' said Miss Murdstone, when wheels 
              were heard at the gate. </p>
            <p>　　I looked for Peggotty, but it was not she; neither she nor Mr. 
              Murdstone appeared. My former acquaintance, the carrier, was at 
              the door. the box was taken out to his cart, and lifted in. </p>
            <p>　　'Clara!' said Miss Murdstone, in her warning note. </p>
            <p>　　'Ready, my dear Jane,' returned my mother. 'Good-bye, Davy. You 
              are going for your own good. Good-bye, my child. You will come home 
              in the holidays, and be a better boy.' </p>
            <p>　　'Clara!' Miss Murdstone repeated. </p>
            <p>　　'Certainly, my dear Jane,' replied my mother, who was holding 
              me. 'I forgive you, my dear boy. God bless you!' </p>
            <p>　　'Clara!' Miss Murdstone repeated. </p>
            <p>　　Miss Murdstone was good enough to take me out to the cart, and 
              to say on the way that she hoped I would repent, before I came to 
              a bad end; and then I got into the cart, and the lazy horse walked 
              off with it. </p>

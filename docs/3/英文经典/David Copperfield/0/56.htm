            <div align="center"><b>TEMPEST </b> </div>
            <p>　　 I now approach an event in my life, so indelible, so awful, 
              so bound by an infinite variety of ties to all that has preceded 
              it, in these pages, that, from the beginning of my narrative, I 
              have seen it growing larger and larger as I advanced, like a great 
              tower in a plain, and throwing its fore-cast shadow even on the 
              incidents of my childish days. </p>
            <p>　　For years after it occurred, I dreamed of it often. I have started 
              up so vividly impressed by it, that its fury has yet seemed raging 
              in my quiet room, in the still night. I dream of it sometimes, though 
              at lengthened and uncertain intervals, to this hour. I have an association 
              between it and a stormy wind, or the lightest mention of a sea-shore, 
              as strong as any of which my mind is conscious. As plainly as I 
              behold what happened, I will try to write it down. I do not recall 
              it, but see it done; for it happens again before me. </p>
            <p>　　The time drawing on rapidly for the sailing of the emigrant-ship, 
              my good old nurse (almost broken-hearted for me, when we first met) 
              came up to London. I was constantly with her, and her brother, and 
              the Micawbers (they being very much together); but Emily I never 
              saw. </p>
            <p>　　One evening when the time was close at hand, I was alone with 
              Peggotty and her brother. Our conversation turned on Ham. She described 
              to us how tenderly he had taken leave of her, and how manfully and 
              quietly he had borne himself. Most of all, of late, when she believed 
              he was most tried. It was a subject of which the affectionate creature 
              never tired; and our interest in hearing the many examples which 
              she, who was so much with him, had to relate, was equal to hers 
              in relating them. </p>
            <p>　　MY aunt and I were at that time vacating the two cottages at 
              Highgate; I intending to go abroad, and she to return to her house 
              at Dover. We had a temporary lodging in Covent Garden. As I walked 
              home to it, after this evening's conversation, reflecting on what 
              had passed between Ham and myself when I was last at Yarmouth, I 
              wavered in the original purpose I had formed, of leaving a letter 
              for Emily when I should take leave of her uncle on board the ship, 
              and thought it would be better to write to her now. She might desire, 
              I thought, after receiving my communication, to send some parting 
              word by me to her unhappy lover. I ought to give her the opportunity. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I therefore sat down in my room, before going to bed, and wrote 
              to her. I told her that I had seen him, and that he had requested 
              me to tell her what I have already written in its place in these 
              sheets. I faithfully repeated it. I had no need to enlarge upon 
              it, if I had had the right. Its deep fidelity and goodness were 
              not to be adorned by me or any man. I left it out, to be sent round 
              in the morning; with a line to Mr. Peggotty, requesting him to give 
              it to her; and went to bed at daybreak. </p>
            <p>　　I was weaker than I knew then; and, not falling asleep until 
              the sun was up, lay late, and unrefreshed, next day. I was roused 
              by the silent presence of my aunt at my bedside. I felt it in my 
              sleep, as I suppose we all do feel such things. </p>
            <p>　　'Trot, my dear,' she said, when I opened my eyes, 'I couldn't 
              make up my mind to disturb you. Mr. Peggotty is here; shall he come 
              up?' </p>
            <p>　　I replied yes, and he soon appeared. </p>
            <p>　　'Mas'r Davy,' he said, when we had shaken hands, 'I giv Em'ly 
              your letter, sir, and she writ this heer; and begged of me fur to 
              ask you to read it, and if you see no hurt in't, to be so kind as 
              take charge on't.' </p>
            <p>　　'Have you read it?' said I. </p>
            <p>　　He nodded sorrowfully. I opened it, and read as follows: </p>
            <p>　　 'I have got your message. Oh, what can I write, to thank you 
              for your good and blessed kindness to me! </p>
            <p>　　'I have put the words close to my heart. I shall keep them till 
              I die. They are sharp thorns, but they are such comfort. I have 
              prayed over them, oh, I have prayed so much. When I find what you 
              are, and what uncle is, I think what God must be, and can cry to 
              him. </p>
            <p>　　'Good-bye for ever. Now, my dear, my friend, good-bye for ever 
              in this world. In another world, if I am forgiven, I may wake a 
              child and come to you. All thanks and blessings. Farewell, evermore.' 
            </p>
            <p>　　 This, blotted with tears, was the letter. </p>
            <p>　　'May I tell her as you doen't see no hurt in't, and as you'll 
              be so kind as take charge on't, Mas'r Davy?' said Mr. Peggotty, 
              when I had read it. 'Unquestionably,' said I - 'but I am thinking 
              -' </p>
            <p>　　'Yes, Mas'r Davy?' </p>
            <p>　　'I am thinking,' said I, 'that I'll go down again to Yarmouth. 
              There's time, and to spare, for me to go and come back before the 
              ship sails. My mind is constantly running on him, in his solitude; 
              to put this letter of her writing in his hand at this time, and 
              to enable you to tell her, in the moment of parting, that he has 
              got it, will be a kindness to both of them. I solemnly accepted 
              his commission, dear good fellow, and cannot discharge it too completely. 
              The journey is nothing to me. I am restless, and shall be better 
              in motion. I'll go down tonight.' </p>
            <p>　　Though he anxiously endeavoured to dissuade me, I saw that he 
              was of my mind; and this, if I had required to be confirmed in my 
              intention, would have had the effect. He went round to the coach 
              office, at my request, and took the box-seat for me on the mail. 
              In the evening I started, by that conveyance, down the road I had 
              traversed under so many vicissitudes. </p>
            <p>　　'Don't you think that,' I asked the coachman, in the first stage 
              out of London, 'a very remarkable sky? I don't remember to have 
              seen one like it.' </p>
            <p>　　'Nor I - not equal to it,' he replied. 'That's wind, sir. There'll 
              be mischief done at sea, I expect, before long.' </p>
            <p>　　It was a murky confusion - here and there blotted with a colour 
              like the colour of the smoke from damp fuel - of flying clouds, 
              tossed up into most remarkable heaps, suggesting greater heights 
              in the clouds than there were depths below them to the bottom of 
              the deepest hollows in the earth, through which the wild moon seemed 
              to plunge headlong, as if, in a dread disturbance of the laws of 
              nature, she had lost her way and were frightened. There had been 
              a wind all day; and it was rising then, with an extraordinary great 
              sound. In another hour it had much increased, and the sky was more 
              overcast, and blew hard. </p>
            <p>　　But, as the night advanced, the clouds closing in and densely 
              over-spreading the whole sky, then very dark, it came on to blow, 
              harder and harder. It still increased, until our horses could scarcely 
              face the wind. Many times, in the dark part of the night (it was 
              then late in September, when the nights were not short), the leaders 
              turned about, or came to a dead stop; and we were often in serious 
              apprehension that the coach would be blown over. Sweeping gusts 
              of rain came up before this storm, like showers of steel; and, at 
              those times, when there was any shelter of trees or lee walls to 
              be got, we were fain to stop, in a sheer impossibility of continuing 
              the struggle. </p>
            <p>　　When the day broke, it blew harder and harder. I had been in 
              Yarmouth when the seamen said it blew great guns, but I had never 
              known the like of this, or anything approaching to it. We came to 
              Ipswich - very late, having had to fight every inch of ground since 
              we were ten miles out of London; and found a cluster of people in 
              the market-place, who had risen from their beds in the night, fearful 
              of falling chimneys. Some of these, congregating about the inn-yard 
              while we changed horses, told us of great sheets of lead having 
              been ripped off a high church-tower, and flung into a by-street, 
              which they then blocked up. Others had to tell of country people, 
              coming in from neighbouring villages, who had seen great trees lying 
              torn out of the earth, and whole ricks scattered about the roads 
              and fields. Still, there was no abatement in the storm, but it blew 
              harder. </p>
            <p>　　As we struggled on, nearer and nearer to the sea, from which 
              this mighty wind was blowing dead on shore, its force became more 
              and more terrific. Long before we saw the sea, its spray was on 
              our lips, and showered salt rain upon us. The water was out, over 
              miles and miles of the flat country adjacent to Yarmouth; and every 
              sheet and puddle lashed its banks, and had its stress of little 
              breakers setting heavily towards us. When we came within sight of 
              the sea, the waves on the horizon, caught at intervals above the 
              rolling abyss, were like glimpses of another shore with towers and 
              buildings. When at last we got into the town, the people came out 
              to their doors, all aslant, and with streaming hair, making a wonder 
              of the mail that had come through such a night. </p>
            <p>　　I put up at the old inn, and went down to look at the sea; staggering 
              along the street, which was strewn with sand and seaweed, and with 
              flying blotches of sea-foam; afraid of falling slates and tiles; 
              and holding by people I met, at angry corners. Coming near the beach, 
              I saw, not only the boatmen, but half the people of the town, lurking 
              behind buildings; some, now and then braving the fury of the storm 
              to look away to sea, and blown sheer out of their course in trying 
              to get zigzag back. </p>
            <p>　　joining these groups, I found bewailing women whose husbands 
              were away in herring or oyster boats, which there was too much reason 
              to think might have foundered before they could run in anywhere 
              for safety. Grizzled old sailors were among the people, shaking 
              their heads, as they looked from water to sky, and muttering to 
              one another; ship-owners, excited and uneasy; children, huddling 
              together, and peering into older faces; even stout mariners, disturbed 
              and anxious, levelling their glasses at the sea from behind places 
              of shelter, as if they were surveying an enemy. </p>
            <p>　　The tremendous sea itself, when I could find sufficient pause 
              to look at it, in the agitation of the blinding wind, the flying 
              stones and sand, and the awful noise, confounded me. As the high 
              watery walls came rolling in, and, at their highest, tumbled into 
              surf, they looked as if the least would engulf the town. As the 
              receding wave swept back with a hoarse roar, it seemed to scoop 
              out deep caves in the beach, as if its purpose were to undermine 
              the earth. When some white-headed billows thundered on, and dashed 
              themselves to pieces before they reached the land, every fragment 
              of the late whole seemed possessed by the full might of its wrath, 
              rushing to be gathered to the composition of another monster. Undulating 
              hills were changed to valleys, undulating valleys (with a solitary 
              storm-bird sometimes skimming through them) were lifted up to hills; 
              masses of water shivered and shook the beach with a booming sound; 
              every shape tumultuously rolled on, as soon as made, to change its 
              shape and place, and beat another shape and place away; the ideal 
              shore on the horizon, with its towers and buildings, rose and fell; 
              the clouds fell fast and thick; I seemed to see a rending and upheaving 
              of all nature. </p>
            <p>　　Not finding Ham among the people whom this memorable wind - for 
              it is still remembered down there, as the greatest ever known to 
              blow upon that coast - had brought together, I made my way to his 
              house. It was shut; and as no one answered to my knocking, I went, 
              by back ways and by-lanes, to the yard where he worked. I learned, 
              there, that he had gone to Lowestoft, to meet some sudden exigency 
              of ship-repairing in which his skill was required; but that he would 
              be back tomorrow morning, in good time. </p>
            <p>　　I went back to the inn; and when I had washed and dressed, and 
              tried to sleep, but in vain, it was five o'clock in the afternoon. 
              I had not sat five minutes by the coffee-room fire, when the waiter, 
              coming to stir it, as an excuse for talking, told me that two colliers 
              had gone down, with all hands, a few miles away; and that some other 
              ships had been seen labouring hard in the Roads, and trying, in 
              great distress, to keep off shore. Mercy on them, and on all poor 
              sailors, said he, if we had another night like the last! </p>
            <p>　　I was very much depressed in spirits; very solitary; and felt 
              an uneasiness in Ham's not being there, disproportionate to the 
              occasion. I was seriously affected, without knowing how much, by 
              late events; and my long exposure to the fierce wind had confused 
              me. There was that jumble in my thoughts and recollections, that 
              I had lost the clear arrangement of time and distance. Thus, if 
              I had gone out into the town, I should not have been surprised, 
              I think, to encounter someone who I knew must be then in London. 
              So to speak, there was in these respects a curious inattention in 
              my mind. Yet it was busy, too, with all the remembrances the place 
              naturally awakened; and they were particularly distinct and vivid. 
            </p>
            <p>　　In this state, the waiter's dismal intelligence about the ships 
              immediately connected itself, without any effort of my volition, 
              with my uneasiness about Ham. I was persuaded that I had an apprehension 
              of his returning from Lowestoft by sea, and being lost. This grew 
              so strong with me, that I resolved to go back to the yard before 
              I took my dinner, and ask the boat-builder if he thought his attempting 
              to return by sea at all likely? If he gave me the least reason to 
              think so, I would go over to Lowestoft and prevent it by bringing 
              him with me. </p>
            <p>　　I hastily ordered my dinner, and went back to the yard. I was 
              none too soon; for the boat-builder, with a lantern in his hand, 
              was locking the yard-gate. He quite laughed when I asked him the 
              question, and said there was no fear; no man in his senses, or out 
              of them, would put off in such a gale of wind, least of all Ham 
              Peggotty, who had been born to seafaring. </p>
            <p>　　So sensible of this, beforehand, that I had really felt ashamed 
              of doing what I was nevertheless impelled to do, I went back to 
              the inn. If such a wind could rise, I think it was rising. The howl 
              and roar, the rattling of the doors and windows, the rumbling in 
              the chimneys, the apparent rocking of the very house that sheltered 
              me, and the prodigious tumult of the sea, were more fearful than 
              in the morning. But there was now a great darkness besides; and 
              that invested the storm with new terrors, real and fanciful. </p>
            <p>　　I could not eat, I could not sit still, I could not continue 
              steadfast to anything. Something within me, faintly answering to 
              the storm without, tossed up the depths of my memory and made a 
              tumult in them. Yet, in all the hurry of my thoughts, wild running 
              with the thundering sea, - the storm, and my uneasiness regarding 
              Ham were always in the fore-ground. </p>
            <p>　　My dinner went away almost untasted, and I tried to refresh myself 
              with a glass or two of wine. In vain. I fell into a dull slumber 
              before the fire, without losing my consciousness, either of the 
              uproar out of doors, or of the place in which I was. Both became 
              overshadowed by a new and indefinable horror; and when I awoke - 
              or rather when I shook off the lethargy that bound me in my chair- 
              my whole frame thrilled with objectless and unintelligible fear. 
            </p>
            <p>　　I walked to and fro, tried to read an old gazetteer, listened 
              to the awful noises: looked at faces, scenes, and figures in the 
              fire. At length, the steady ticking of the undisturbed clock on 
              the wall tormented me to that degree that I resolved to go to bed. 
            </p>
            <p>　　It was reassuring, on such a night, to be told that some of the 
              inn-servants had agreed together to sit up until morning. I went 
              to bed, exceedingly weary and heavy; but, on my lying down, all 
              such sensations vanished, as if by magic, and I was broad awake, 
              with every sense refined. </p>
            <p>　　For hours I lay there, listening to the wind and water; imagining, 
              now, that I heard shrieks out at sea; now, that I distinctly heard 
              the firing of signal guns; and now, the fall of houses in the town. 
              I got up, several times, and looked out; but could see nothing, 
              except the reflection in the window-panes of the faint candle I 
              had left burning, and of my own haggard face looking in at me from 
              the black void. </p>
            <p>　　At length, my restlessness attained to such a pitch, that I hurried 
              on my clothes, and went downstairs. In the large kitchen, where 
              I dimly saw bacon and ropes of onions hanging from the beams, the 
              watchers were clustered together, in various attitudes, about a 
              table, purposely moved away from the great chimney, and brought 
              near the door. A pretty girl, who had her ears stopped with her 
              apron, and her eyes upon the door, screamed when I appeared, supposing 
              me to be a spirit; but the others had more presence of mind, and 
              were glad of an addition to their company. One man, referring to 
              the topic they had been discussing, asked me whether I thought the 
              souls of the collier-crews who had gone down, were out in the storm? 
            </p>
            <p>　　I remained there, I dare say, two hours. Once, I opened the yard-gate, 
              and looked into the empty street. The sand, the sea-weed, and the 
              flakes of foam, were driving by; and I was obliged to call for assistance 
              before I could shut the gate again, and make it fast against the 
              wind. </p>
            <p>　　There was a dark gloom in my solitary chamber, when I at length 
              returned to it; but I was tired now, and, getting into bed again, 
              fell - off a tower and down a precipice - into the depths of sleep. 
              I have an impression that for a long time, though I dreamed of being 
              elsewhere and in a variety of scenes, it was always blowing in my 
              dream. At length, I lost that feeble hold upon reality, and was 
              engaged with two dear friends, but who they were I don't know, at 
              the siege of some town in a roar of cannonading. </p>
            <p>　　The thunder of the cannon was so loud and incessant, that I could 
              not hear something I much desired to hear, until I made a great 
              exertion and awoke. It was broad day - eight or nine o'clock; the 
              storm raging, in lieu of the batteries; and someone knocking and 
              calling at my door. </p>
            <p>　　'What is the matter?' I cried. </p>
            <p>　　'A wreck! Close by!' </p>
            <p>　　I sprung out of bed, and asked, what wreck? </p>
            <p>　　'A schooner, from Spain or Portugal, laden with fruit and wine. 
              Make haste, sir, if you want to see her! It's thought, down on the 
              beach, she'll go to pieces every moment.' </p>
            <p>　　The excited voice went clamouring along the staircase; and I 
              wrapped myself in my clothes as quickly as I could, and ran into 
              the street. </p>
            <p>　　Numbers of people were there before me, all running in one direction, 
              to the beach. I ran the same way, outstripping a good many, and 
              soon came facing the wild sea. </p>
            <p>　　The wind might by this time have lulled a little, though not 
              more sensibly than if the cannonading I had dreamed of, had been 
              diminished by the silencing of half-a-dozen guns out of hundreds. 
              But the sea, having upon it the additional agitation of the whole 
              night, was infinitely more terrific than when I had seen it last. 
              Every appearance it had then presented, bore the expression of being 
              swelled; and the height to which the breakers rose, and, looking 
              over one another, bore one another down, and rolled in, in interminable 
              hosts, was most appalling. In the difficulty of hearing anything 
              but wind and waves, and in the crowd, and the unspeakable confusion, 
              and my first breathless efforts to stand against the weather, I 
              was so confused that I looked out to sea for the wreck, and saw 
              nothing but the foaming heads of the great waves. A half-dressed 
              boatman, standing next me, pointed with his bare arm (a tattoo'd 
              arrow on it, pointing in the same direction) to the left. Then, 
              O great Heaven, I saw it, close in upon us! </p>
            <p>　　One mast was broken short off, six or eight feet from the deck, 
              and lay over the side, entangled in a maze of sail and rigging; 
              and all that ruin, as the ship rolled and beat - which she did without 
              a moment's pause, and with a violence quite inconceivable - beat 
              the side as if it would stave it in. Some efforts were even then 
              being made, to cut this portion of the wreck away; for, as the ship, 
              which was broadside on, turned towards us in her rolling, I plainly 
              descried her people at work with axes, especially one active figure 
              with long curling hair, conspicuous among the rest. But a great 
              cry, which was audible even above the wind and water, rose from 
              the shore at this moment; the sea, sweeping over the rolling wreck, 
              made a clean breach, and carried men, spars, casks, planks, bulwarks, 
              heaps of such toys, into the boiling surge. </p>
            <p>　　The second mast was yet standing, with the rags of a rent sail, 
              and a wild confusion of broken cordage flapping to and fro. The 
              ship had struck once, the same boatman hoarsely said in my ear, 
              and then lifted in and struck again. I understood him to add that 
              she was parting amidships, and I could readily suppose so, for the 
              rolling and beating were too tremendous for any human work to suffer 
              long. As he spoke, there was another great cry of pity from the 
              beach; four men arose with the wreck out of the deep, clinging to 
              the rigging of the remaining mast; uppermost, the active figure 
              with the curling hair. </p>
            <p>　　There was a bell on board; and as the ship rolled and dashed, 
              like a desperate creature driven mad, now showing us the whole sweep 
              of her deck, as she turned on her beam-ends towards the shore, now 
              nothing but her keel, as she sprung wildly over and turned towards 
              the sea, the bell rang; and its sound, the knell of those unhappy 
              men, was borne towards us on the wind. Again we lost her, and again 
              she rose. Two men were gone. The agony on the shore increased. Men 
              groaned, and clasped their hands; women shrieked, and turned away 
              their faces. Some ran wildly up and down along the beach, crying 
              for help where no help could be. I found myself one of these, frantically 
              imploring a knot of sailors whom I knew, not to let those two lost 
              creatures perish before our eyes. </p>
            <p>　　They were making out to me, in an agitated way - I don't know 
              how, for the little I could hear I was scarcely composed enough 
              to understand - that the lifeboat had been bravely manned an hour 
              ago, and could do nothing; and that as no man would be so desperate 
              as to attempt to wade off with a rope, and establish a communication 
              with the shore, there was nothing left to try; when I noticed that 
              some new sensation moved the people on the beach, and saw them part, 
              and Ham come breaking through them to the front. </p>
            <p>　　I ran to him - as well as I know, to repeat my appeal for help. 
              But, distracted though I was, by a sight so new to me and terrible, 
              the determination in his face, and his look out to sea - exactly 
              the same look as I remembered in connexion with the morning after 
              Emily's flight - awoke me to a knowledge of his danger. I held him 
              back with both arms; and implored the men with whom I had been speaking, 
              not to listen to him, not to do murder, not to let him stir from 
              off that sand! </p>
            <p>　　Another cry arose on shore; and looking to the wreck, we saw 
              the cruel sail, with blow on blow, beat off the lower of the two 
              men, and fly up in triumph round the active figure left alone upon 
              the mast. </p>
            <p>　　Against such a sight, and against such determination as that 
              of the calmly desperate man who was already accustomed to lead half 
              the people present, I might as hopefully have entreated the wind. 
              'Mas'r Davy,' he said, cheerily grasping me by both hands, 'if my 
              time is come, 'tis come. If 'tan't, I'll bide it. Lord above bless 
              you, and bless all! Mates, make me ready! I'm a-going off!' </p>
            <p>　　I was swept away, but not unkindly, to some distance, where the 
              people around me made me stay; urging, as I confusedly perceived, 
              that he was bent on going, with help or without, and that I should 
              endanger the precautions for his safety by troubling those with 
              whom they rested. I don't know what I answered, or what they rejoined; 
              but I saw hurry on the beach, and men running with ropes from a 
              capstan that was there, and penetrating into a circle of figures 
              that hid him from me. Then, I saw him standing alone, in a seaman's 
              frock and trousers: a rope in his hand, or slung to his wrist: another 
              round his body: and several of the best men holding, at a little 
              distance, to the latter, which he laid out himself, slack upon the 
              shore, at his feet. </p>
            <p>　　The wreck, even to my unpractised eye, was breaking up. I saw 
              that she was parting in the middle, and that the life of the solitary 
              man upon the mast hung by a thread. Still, he clung to it. He had 
              a singular red cap on, - not like a sailor's cap, but of a finer 
              colour; and as the few yielding planks between him and destruction 
              rolled and bulged, and his anticipative death-knell rung, he was 
              seen by all of us to wave it. I saw him do it now, and thought I 
              was going distracted, when his action brought an old remembrance 
              to my mind of a once dear friend. </p>
            <p>　　Ham watched the sea, standing alone, with the silence of suspended 
              breath behind him, and the storm before, until there was a great 
              retiring wave, when, with a backward glance at those who held the 
              rope which was made fast round his body, he dashed in after it, 
              and in a moment was buffeting with the water; rising with the hills, 
              falling with the valleys, lost beneath the foam; then drawn again 
              to land. They hauled in hastily. </p>
            <p>　　He was hurt. I saw blood on his face, from where I stood; but 
              he took no thought of that. He seemed hurriedly to give them some 
              directions for leaving him more free - or so I judged from the motion 
              of his arm - and was gone as before. </p>
            <p>　　And now he made for the wreck, rising with the hills, falling 
              with the valleys, lost beneath the rugged foam, borne in towards 
              the shore, borne on towards the ship, striving hard and valiantly. 
              The distance was nothing, but the power of the sea and wind made 
              the strife deadly. At length he neared the wreck. He was so near, 
              that with one more of his vigorous strokes he would be clinging 
              to it, - when a high, green, vast hill-side of water, moving on 
              shoreward, from beyond the ship, he seemed to leap up into it with 
              a mighty bound, and the ship was gone! </p>
            <p>　　Some eddying fragments I saw in the sea, as if a mere cask had 
              been broken, in running to the spot where they were hauling in. 
              Consternation was in every face. They drew him to my very feet - 
              insensible - dead. He was carried to the nearest house; and, no 
              one preventing me now, I remained near him, busy, while every means 
              of restoration were tried; but he had been beaten to death by the 
              great wave, and his generous heart was stilled for ever. </p>
            <p>　　As I sat beside the bed, when hope was abandoned and all was 
              done, a fisherman, who had known me when Emily and I were children, 
              and ever since, whispered my name at the door. </p>
            <p>　　'Sir,' said he, with tears starting to his weather-beaten face, 
              which, with his trembling lips, was ashy pale, 'will you come over 
              yonder?' </p>
            <p>　　The old remembrance that had been recalled to me, was in his 
              look. I asked him, terror-stricken, leaning on the arm he held out 
              to support me: </p>
            <p>　　'Has a body come ashore?' </p>
            <p>　　He said, 'Yes.' </p>
            <p>　　'Do I know it?' I asked then. </p>
            <p>　　He answered nothing. </p>
            <p>　　But he led me to the shore. And on that part of it where she 
              and I had looked for shells, two children - on that part of it where 
              some lighter fragments of the old boat, blown down last night, had 
              been scattered by the wind - among the ruins of the home he had 
              wronged - I saw him lying with his head upon his arm, as I had often 
              seen him lie at school. </p>

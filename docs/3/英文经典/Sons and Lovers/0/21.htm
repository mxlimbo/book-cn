            <p>　　She ate her cake mechanically. He tried to go on with his argument,but 
              could not get back the right note. Soon Edgar came in. Mrs. Morel 
              had gone to her friends'. The three set off to Willey Farm.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam brooded over his split with her. There was something elsehe 
              wanted. He could not be satisfied; he could give her no peace. There 
              was between them now always a ground for strife.She wanted to prove 
              him. She believed that his chief need in lifewas herself. If she 
              could prove it, both to herself and to him,the rest might go; she 
              could simply trust to the future.</p>
            <p>　　So in May she asked him to come to Willey Farm and meetMrs. Dawes. 
              There was something he hankered after. She saw him,whenever they 
              spoke of Clara Dawes, rouse and get slightly angry. He said he did 
              not like her. Yet he was keen to know about her. Well, he should 
              put himself to the test. She believed that therewere in him desires 
              for higher things, and desires for lower, and thatthe desire for 
              the higher would conquer. At any rate, he should try. She forgot 
              that her &quot;higher&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; were arbitrary.</p>
            <p>　　He was rather excited at the idea of meeting Clara at Willey 
              Farm. Mrs. Dawes came for the day. Her heavy, dun-coloured hair 
              wascoiled on top of her head. She wore a white blouse and navy skirt,and 
              somehow, wherever she was, seemed to make things look paltryand 
              insignificant. When she was in the room, the kitchen seemedtoo small 
              and mean altogether. Miriam's beautiful twilightyparlour looked 
              stiff and stupid. All the Leivers were eclipsedlike candles. They 
              found her rather hard to put up with. Yet she was perfectly amiable, 
              but indifferent, and rather hard.</p>
            <p>　　Paul did not come till afternoon. He was early. As he swungoff 
              his bicycle, Miriam saw him look round at the house eagerly. He 
              would be disappointed if the visitor had not come. Miriam wentout 
              to meet him, bowing her head because of the sunshine. Nasturtiums 
              were coming out crimson under the cool green shadowof their leaves. 
              The girl stood, dark-haired, glad to see him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Hasn't Clara come?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Miriam in her musical tone. &quot;She's 
              reading.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He wheeled his bicycle into the barn. He had puton a handsome 
              tie, of which he was rather proud, and socks to match.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She came this morning?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Miriam, as she walked at his side. &quot;You 
              said you'dbring me that letter from the man at Liberty's. Have you 
              remembered?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, dash, no!&quot; he said. &quot;But nag at me till you 
              get it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't like to nag at you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do it whether or not. And is she any more agreeable?&quot;he 
              continued.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You know I always think she is quite agreeable.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He was silent. Evidently his eagerness to be early to-dayhad 
              been the newcomer. Miriam already began to suffer. They wenttogether 
              towards the house. He took the clips off his trousers,but was too 
              lazy to brush the dust from his shoes, in spite of thesocks and 
              tie.</p>
            <p>　　Clara sat in the cool parlour reading. He saw the nape of herwhite 
              neck, and the fine hair lifted from it. She rose, looking athim 
              indifferently. To shake hands she lifted her arm straight,in a manner 
              that seemed at once to keep him at a distance,and yet to fling something 
              to him. He noticed how her breastsswelled inside her blouse, and 
              how her shoulder curved handsomelyunder the thin muslin at the top 
              of her arm.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You have chosen a fine day,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It happens so,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; he said; &quot;I am glad.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She sat down, not thanking him for his politeness.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What have you been doing all morning?&quot; asked Paul 
              of Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, you see,&quot; said Miriam, coughing huskily, &quot;Clara 
              onlycame with father--and so--she's not been here very long.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Clara sat leaning on the table, holding aloof. He noticedher 
              hands were large, but well kept. And the skin on them seemedalmost 
              coarse, opaque, and white, with fine golden hairs. She didnot mind 
              if he observed her hands. She intended to scorn him. Her heavy arm 
              lay negligently on the table. Her mouth was closedas if she were 
              offended, and she kept her face slightly averted.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You were at Margaret Bonford's meeting the other evening,&quot;he 
              said to her.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam did not know this courteous Paul. Clara glanced at him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why,&quot; asked Miriam, &quot;how do you know?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I went in for a few minutes before the train came,&quot; 
              he answered.</p>
            <p>　　Clara turned away again rather disdainfully.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I think she's a lovable little woman,&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Margaret Bonford!&quot; exclaimed Clara. &quot;She's a 
              great dealcleverer than most men.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, I didn't say she wasn't,&quot; he said, deprecating. 
              &quot;She's lovable for all that.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And, of course, that is all that matters,&quot; said Clara 
              witheringly.</p>
            <p>　　He rubbed his head, rather perplexed, rather annoyed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I suppose it matters more than her cleverness,&quot; he 
              said;&quot;which, after all, would never get her to heaven.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's not heaven she wants to get--it's her fair share on 
              earth,&quot;retorted Clara. She spoke as if he were responsible 
              for somedeprivation which Miss Bonford suffered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;I thought she was warm, and 
              awfully nice--onlytoo frail. I wished she was sitting comfortably 
              in peace---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;'Darning her husband's stockings,'&quot; said Clara scathingly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm sure she wouldn't mind darning even my stockings,&quot; 
              he said. &quot;And I'm sure she'd do them well. Just as I wouldn't 
              mind blackingher boots if she wanted me to.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　But Clara refused to answer this sally of his. He talkedto Miriam 
              for a little while. The other woman held aloof.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;I think I'll go and see Edgar. 
              Is heon the land?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I believe,&quot; said Miriam, &quot;he's gone for a load 
              of coal. He should be back directly.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then,&quot; he said, &quot;I'll go and meet him.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Miriam dared not propose anything for the three of them. He rose 
              and left them.</p>
            <p>　　On the top road, where the gorse was out, he saw Edgar walkinglazily 
              beside the mare, who nodded her white-starred foreheadas she dragged 
              the clanking load of coal. The young farmer's facelighted up as 
              he saw his friend. Edgar was good-looking, with dark,warm eyes. 
              His clothes were old and rather disreputable, and hewalked with 
              considerable pride.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Hello!&quot; he said, seeing Paul bareheaded. &quot;Where 
              are you going?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Came to meet you. Can't stand 'Nevermore.'&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Edgar's teeth flashed in a laugh of amusement.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Who is 'Nevermore'?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;The lady--Mrs. Dawes--it ought to be Mrs. The Raven that 
              quothed'Nevermore.'&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Edgar laughed with glee.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't you like her?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Not a fat lot,&quot; said Paul. &quot;Why, do you?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No!&quot; The answer came with a deep ring of conviction. 
              &quot;No!&quot;Edgar pursed up his lips. &quot;I can't say she's 
              much in my line.&quot; He mused a little. Then: &quot;But why do 
              you call her 'Nevermore'?&quot;he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well,&quot; said Paul, &quot;if she looks at a man she 
              says haughtily'Nevermore,' and if she looks at herself in the looking-glass 
              shesays disdainfully 'Nevermore,' and if she thinks back she says 
              itin disgust, and if she looks forward she says it cynically.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Edgar considered this speech, failed to make much out of it,and 
              said, laughing:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You think she's a man-hater?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;SHE thinks she is,&quot; replied Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But you don't think so?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; replied Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Wasn't she nice with you, then?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Could you imagine her NICE with anybody?&quot; asked the 
              young man.</p>
            <p>　　Edgar laughed. Together they unloaded the coal in the yard. Paul 
              was rather self-conscious, because he knew Clara could see if shelooked 
              out of the window. She didn't look.</p>
            <p>　　On Saturday afternoons the horses were brushed down and groomed. 
              Paul and Edgar worked together, sneezing with the dust that camefrom 
              the pelts of Jimmy and Flower.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you know a new song to teach me?&quot; said Edgar.</p>
            <p>　　He continued to work all the time. The back of his neckwas sun-red 
              when he bent down, and his fingers that held the brushwere thick. 
              Paul watched him sometimes.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;'Mary Morrison'?&quot; suggested the younger.</p>
            <p>　　Edgar agreed. He had a good tenor voice, and he loved to learnall 
              the songs his friend could teach him, so that he could singwhilst 
              he was carting. Paul had a very indifferent baritone voice,but a 
              good ear. However, he sang softly, for fear of Clara. Edgar repeated 
              the line in a clear tenor. At times they both brokeoff to sneeze, 
              and first one, then the other, abused his horse.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam was impatient of men. It took so little to amusethem--even 
              Paul. She thought it anomalous in him that he couldbe so thoroughly 
              absorbed in a triviality.</p>
            <p>　　It was tea-time when they had finished.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What song was that?&quot; asked Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　Edgar told her. The conversation turned to singing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;We have such jolly times,&quot; Miriam said to Clara.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Dawes ate her meal in a slow, dignified way. Whenever the 
              men were present she grew distant.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you like singing?&quot; Miriam asked her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;If it is good,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　Paul, of course, coloured.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You mean if it is high-class and trained?&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I think a voice needs training before the singing is anything,&quot;she 
              said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You might as well insist on having people's voices trainedbefore 
              you allowed them to talk,&quot; he replied. &quot;Really, people 
              singfor their own pleasure, as a rule.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And it may be for other people's discomfort.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then the other people should have flaps to their ears,&quot;he 
              replied.</p>
            <p>　　The boys laughed. There was a silence. He flushed deeply,and 
              ate in silence.</p>
            <p>　　After tea, when all the men had gone but Paul, Mrs. Leiverssaid 
              to Clara:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And you find life happier now?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Infinitely.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And you are satisfied?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;So long as I can be free and independent.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And you don't MISS anything in your life?&quot;asked Mrs. 
              Leivers gently.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I've put all that behind me.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Paul had been feeling uncomfortable during this discourse. He 
              got up.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You'll find you're always tumbling over the things you've 
              putbehind you,&quot; he said. Then he took his departure to the 
              cowsheds. He felt he had been witty, and his manly pride was high. 
              He whistledas he went down the brick track.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam came for him a little later to know if he would go withClara 
              and her for a walk. They set off down to Strelley Mill Farm. As 
              they were going beside the brook, on the Willey Water side,looking 
              through the brake at the edge of the wood, where pink campionsglowed 
              under a few sunbeams, they saw, beyond the tree-trunksand the thin 
              hazel bushes, a man leading a great bay horse throughthe gullies. 
              The big red beast seemed to dance romanticallythrough that dimness 
              of green hazel drift, away therewhere the air was shadowy, as if 
              it were in the past,among the fading bluebells that might have bloomedfor 
              Deidre or Iseult.</p>
            <p>　　The three stood charmed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What a treat to be a knight,&quot; he said, &quot;and to 
              havea pavilion here.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And to have us shut up safely?&quot; replied Clara.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; he answered, &quot;singing with your maids at 
              your broidery. I would carry your banner of white and green and 
              heliotrope. I wouldhave 'W.S.P.U.' emblazoned on my shield, beneath 
              a woman rampant.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I have no doubt,&quot; said Clara, &quot;that you would 
              much ratherfight for a woman than let her fight for herself.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I would. When she fights for herself she seems like a dogbefore 
              a looking-glass, gone into a mad fury with its own shadow.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And YOU are the looking-glass?&quot; she asked, with a 
              curlof the lip.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Or the shadow,&quot; he replied.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I am afraid,&quot; she said, &quot;that you are too clever.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, I leave it to you to be GOOD,&quot; he retorted, 
              laughing. &quot;Be good, sweet maid, and just let ME be clever.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　But Clara wearied of his flippancy. Suddenly, looking at her,he 
              saw that the upward lifting of her face was misery and not scorn. 
              His heart grew tender for everybody. He turned and was gentlewith 
              Miriam, whom he had neglected till then.</p>
            <p>　　At the wood's edge they met Limb, a thin, swarthy man of forty,tenant 
              of Strelley Mill, which he ran as a cattle-raising farm. He held 
              the halter of the powerful stallion indifferently, as if hewere 
              tired. The three stood to let him pass over the stepping-stonesof 
              the first brook. Paul admired that so large an animal shouldwalk 
              on such springy toes, with an endless excess of vigour. Limb pulled 
              up before them.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Tell your father, Miss Leivers,&quot; he said, in a peculiarpiping 
              voice, &quot;that his young beas'es 'as broke that bottom fencethree 
              days an' runnin'.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Which?&quot; asked Miriam, tremulous.</p>
            <p>　　The great horse breathed heavily, shifting round its red flanks,and 
              looking suspiciously with its wonderful big eyes upwards fromunder 
              its lowered head and falling mane.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Come along a bit,&quot; replied Limb, &quot;an' I'll show 
              you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The man and the stallion went forward. It danced sideways,shaking 
              its white fetlocks and looking frightened, as it felt itselfin the 
              brook.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No hanky-pankyin',&quot; said the man affectionately to 
              the beast.</p>
            <p>　　It went up the bank in little leaps, then splashed finely throughthe 
              second brook. Clara, walking with a kind of sulky abandon,watched 
              it half-fascinated, half-contemptuous. Limb stoppedand pointed to 
              the fence under some willows.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;There, you see where they got through,&quot; he said. &quot;My 
              man'sdruv 'em back three times.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Miriam, colouring as if she were at 
              fault.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Are you comin' in?&quot; asked the man.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, thanks; but we should like to go by the pond.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, just as you've a mind,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　The horse gave little whinneys of pleasure at being so near home.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He is glad to be back,&quot; said Clara, who was interestedin 
              the creature.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes--'e's been a tidy step to-day.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They went through the gate, and saw approaching them fromthe 
              big farmhouse a smallish, dark, excitable-looking womanof about 
              thirty-five. Her hair was touched with grey, her darkeyes looked 
              wild. She walked with her hands behind her back. Her brother went 
              forward. As it saw her, the big bay stallionwhinneyed again. She 
              came up excitedly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Are you home again, my boy!&quot; she said tenderly to 
              the horse,not to the man. The great beast shifted round to her, 
              ducking his head. She smuggled into his mouth the wrinkled yellow 
              apple she hadbeen hiding behind her back, then she kissed him near 
              the eyes. He gave a big sigh of pleasure. She held his head in her 
              armsagainst her breast.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Isn't he splendid!&quot; said Miriam to her.</p>
            <p>　　Miss Limb looked up. Her dark eyes glanced straight at Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, good-evening, Miss Leivers,&quot; she said. &quot;It's 
              agessince you've been down.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Miriam introduced her friends.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Your horse IS a fine fellow!&quot; said Clara.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Isn't he!&quot; Again she kissed him. &quot;As loving as 
              any man!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;More loving than most men, I should think,&quot; replied 
              Clara.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He's a nice boy!&quot; cried the woman, again embracing 
              the horse.</p>
            <p>　　Clara, fascinated by the big beast, went up to stroke his neck.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He's quite gentle,&quot; said Miss Limb. &quot;Don't you 
              think bigfellows are?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He's a beauty!&quot; replied Clara.</p>
            <p>　　She wanted to look in his eyes. She wanted him to look at her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's a pity he can't talk,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, but he can--all but,&quot; replied the other woman.</p>
            <p>　　Then her brother moved on with the horse.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Are you coming in? DO come in, Mr.--I didn't catch it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Morel,&quot; said Miriam. &quot;No, we won't come in, but 
              we shouldlike to go by the mill-pond.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes--yes, do. Do you fish, Mr. Morel?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Because if you do you might come and fish any time,&quot;said 
              Miss Limb. &quot;We scarcely see a soul from week's end to week's 
              end. I should be thankful.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What fish are there in the pond?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　They went through the front garden, over the sluice,and up the 
              steep bank to the pond, which lay in shadow, with itstwo wooded 
              islets. Paul walked with Miss Limb.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I shouldn't mind swimming here,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do,&quot; she replied. &quot;Come when you like. My brother 
              will beawfully pleased to talk with you. He is so quiet, because 
              thereis no one to talk to. Do come and swim.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Clara came up.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's a fine depth,&quot; she said, &quot;and so clear.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; said Miss Limb.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you swim?&quot; said Paul. &quot;Miss Limb was just 
              saying we couldcome when we liked.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Of course there's the farm-hands,&quot; said Miss Limb.</p>
            <p>　　They talked a few moments, then went on up the wild hill,leaving 
              the lonely, haggard-eyed woman on the bank.</p>
            <p>　　The hillside was all ripe with sunshine. It was wild and tussocky,given 
              over to rabbits. The three walked in silence. Then:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She makes me feel uncomfortable,&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You mean Miss Limb?&quot; asked Miriam. &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What's a matter with her? Is she going dotty with beingtoo 
              lonely?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; said Miriam. &quot;It's not the right sort of 
              life for her. I think it's cruel to bury her there. I really ought 
              to go and seeher more. But--she upsets me.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She makes me feel sorry for her--yes, and she bothers me,&quot;he 
              said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I suppose,&quot; blurted Clara suddenly, &quot;she wants 
              a man.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The other two were silent for a few moments.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But it's the loneliness sends her cracked,&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　Clara did not answer, but strode on uphill. She was walkingwith 
              her hand hanging, her legs swinging as she kicked throughthe dead 
              thistles and the tussocky grass, her arms hanging loose. Rather 
              than walking, her handsome body seemed to be blundering upthe hill. 
              A hot wave went over Paul. He was curious about her. Perhaps life 
              had been cruel to her. He forgot Miriam, who was walkingbeside him 
              talking to him. She glanced at him, finding he did notanswer her. 
              His eyes were fixed ahead on Clara.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you still think she is disagreeable?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　He did not notice that the question was sudden. It ranwith his 
              thoughts.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Something's the matter with her,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　They found at the top of the hill a hidden wild field,two sides 
              of which were backed by the wood, the other sides by highloose hedges 
              of hawthorn and elder bushes. Between these overgrownbushes were 
              gaps that the cattle might have walked through hadthere been any 
              cattle now. There the turf was smooth as velveteen,padded and holed 
              by the rabbits. The field itself was coarse,and crowded with tall, 
              big cowslips that had never been cut. Clusters of strong flowers 
              rose everywhere above the coarsetussocks of bent. It was like a 
              roadstead crowded with tan,fairy shipping.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ah!&quot; cried Miriam, and she looked at Paul, her dark 
              eyes dilating. He smiled. Together they enjoyed the field of flowers. 
              Clara,a little way off, was looking at the cowslips disconsolately. 
              Paul and Miriam stayed close together, talking in subdued tones. 
              He kneeled on one knee, quickly gathering the best blossoms,moving 
              from tuft to tuft restlessly, talking softly all the time. Miriam 
              plucked the flowers lovingly, lingering over them. He always seemed 
              to her too quick and almost scientific.Yet his bunches had a natural 
              beauty more than hers.He loved them, but as if they were his and 
              he had a rightto them. She had more reverence for them: they held 
              something she had not.</p>
            <p>　　The flowers were very fresh and sweet. He wanted to drink them. 
              As he gathered them, he ate the little yellow trumpets. Clara was 
              still wandering about disconsolately. Going towards her,he said:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why don't you get some?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't believe in it. They look better growing.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But you'd like some?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;They want to be left.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't believe they do.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't want the corpses of flowers about me,&quot; she 
              said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;That's a stiff, artificial notion,&quot; he said. &quot;They 
              don't dieany quicker in water than on their roots. And besides, 
              they LOOKnice in a bowl--they look jolly. And you only call a thing 
              a corpsebecause it looks corpse-like.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Whether it is one or not?&quot; she argued.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It isn't one to me. A dead flower isn't a corpse of a flower.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Clara now ignored him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And even so--what right have you to pull them?&quot; she 
              asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Because I like them, and want them--and there's plenty 
              of them.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And that is sufficient?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes. Why not? I'm sure they'd smell nice in your roomin 
              Nottingham.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And I should have the pleasure of watching them die.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But then--it does not matter if they do die.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Whereupon he left her, and went stooping over the clumpsof tangled 
              flowers which thickly sprinkled the field like pale,luminous foam-clots. 
              Miriam had come close. Clara was kneeling,breathing some scent from 
              the cowslips.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I think,&quot; said Miriam, &quot;if you treat them with 
              reverence youdon't do them any harm. It is the spirit you pluck 
              them in that matters.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; he said. &quot;But no, you get 'em because you 
              want 'em,and that's all.&quot; He held out his bunch.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam was silent. He picked some more.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Look at these!&quot; he continued; &quot;sturdy and lusty 
              like littletrees and like boys with fat legs.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Clara's hat lay on the grass not far off. She was kneeling,bending 
              forward still to smell the flowers. Her neck gave hima sharp pang, 
              such a beautiful thing, yet not proud of itselfjust now. Her breasts 
              swung slightly in her blouse. The archingcurve of her back was beautiful 
              and strong; she wore no stays. Suddenly, without knowing, he was 
              scattering a handful of cowslipsover her hair and neck, saying:</p>
            <p>　　 &quot;Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust, If the Lord won't have 
              you the devil must.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The chill flowers fell on her neck. She looked up at him,with 
              almost pitiful, scared grey eyes, wondering what he was doing. Flowers 
              fell on her face, and she shut her eyes.</p>
            <p>　　Suddenly, standing there above her, he felt awkward.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I thought you wanted a funeral,&quot; he said, ill at ease.</p>
            <p>　　Clara laughed strangely, and rose, picking the cowslips fromher 
              hair. She took up her hat and pinned it on. One flower hadremained 
              tangled in her hair. He saw, but would not tell her. He gathered 
              up the flowers he had sprinkled over her.</p>
            <p>　　At the edge of the wood the bluebells had flowed over into thefield 
              and stood there like flood-water. But they were fading now. Clara 
              strayed up to them. He wandered after her. The bluebellspleased 
              him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Look how they've come out of the wood!&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　Then she turned with a flash of warmth and of gratitude.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; she smiled.</p>
            <p>　　His blood beat up.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It makes me think of the wild men of the woods, how terrifiedthey 
              would be when they got breast to breast with the open space.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you think they were?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I wonder which was more frightened among old tribes--thosebursting 
              out of their darkness of woods upon all the space of light,or those 
              from the open tiptoeing into the forests.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I should think the second,&quot; she answered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, you DO feel like one of the open space sort, trying 
              toforce yourself into the dark, don't you?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;How should I know?&quot; she answered queerly.</p>
            <p>　　The conversation ended there.</p>
            <p>　　The evening was deepening over the earth. Already the valley 
              wasfull of shadow. One tiny square of light stood opposite at CrossleighBank 
              Farm. Brightness was swimming on the tops of the hills. Miriam came 
              up slowly, her face in her big, loose bunch of flowers,walking ankle-deep 
              through the scattered froth of the cowslips. Beyond her the trees 
              were coming into shape, all shadow.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Shall we go?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　And the three turned away. They were all silent. Going down the 
              path they could see the light of home right across,and on the ridge 
              of the hill a thin dark outline with little lights,where the colliery 
              village touched the sky.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It has been nice, hasn't it?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam murmured assent. Clara was silent.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't you think so?&quot; he persisted.</p>

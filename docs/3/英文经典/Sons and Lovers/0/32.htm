            <p>　　It was true as he said. As a rule, when he started love-making,the 
              emotion was strong enough to carry with it everything--reason, soul,blood--in 
              a great sweep, like the Trent carries bodily its back-swirlsand 
              intertwinings, noiselessly. Gradually the little criticisms,the 
              little sensations, were lost, thought also went, everything bornealong 
              in one flood. He became, not a man with a mind, but agreat instinct. 
              His hands were like creatures, living; his limbs,his body, were 
              all life and consciousness, subject to no will of his,but living 
              in themselves. Just as he was, so it seemed the vigorous,wintry 
              stars were strong also with life. He and they struck withthe same 
              pulse of fire, and the same joy of strength which heldthe bracken-frond 
              stiff near his eyes held his own body firm. It was as if he, and 
              the stars, and the dark herbage, and Clarawere licked up in an immense 
              tongue of flame, which tore onwardsand upwards. Everything rushed 
              along in living beside him;everything was still, perfect in itself, 
              along with him. This wonderful stillness in each thing in itself, 
              while it was beingborne along in a very ecstasy of living, seemed 
              the highest pointof bliss.</p>
            <p>　　And Clara knew this held him to her, so she trusted altogetherto 
              the passion. It, however, failed her very often. They didnot often 
              reach again the height of that once when the peewitshad called. 
              Gradually, some mechanical effort spoilt their loving,or, when they 
              had splendid moments, they had them separately,and not so satisfactorily. 
              So often he seemed merely to be runningon alone; often they realised 
              it had been a failure, not what theyhad wanted. He left her, knowing 
              THAT evening had only madea little split between them. Their loving 
              grew more mechanical,without the marvellous glamour. Gradually they 
              began to introducenovelties, to get back some of the feeling of 
              satisfaction. They would be very near, almost dangerously near to 
              the river,so that the black water ran not far from his face, and 
              it gavea little thrill; or they loved sometimes in a little hollow 
              belowthe fence of the path where people were passing occasionally,on 
              the edge of the town, and they heard footsteps coming, almost feltthe 
              vibration of the tread, and they heard what the passersbysaid--strange 
              little things that were never intended to be heard. And afterwards 
              each of them was rather ashamed, and these thingscaused a distance 
              between the two of them. He began to despise hera little, as if 
              she had merited it!</p>
            <p>　　One night he left her to go to Daybrook Station over the fields. 
              It was very dark, with an attempt at snow, although the springwas 
              so far advanced. Morel had not much time; he plunged forward. The 
              town ceases almost abruptly on the edge of a steep hollow; there 
              thehouses with their yellow lights stand up against the darkness. 
              He wentover the stile, and dropped quickly into the hollow of the 
              fields. Under the orchard one warm window shone in Swineshead Farm. 
              Paul glanced round. Behind, the houses stood on the brim of the 
              dip,black against the sky, like wild beasts glaring curiously withyellow 
              eyes down into the darkness. It was the town that seemedsavage and 
              uncouth, glaring on the clouds at the back of him. Some creature 
              stirred under the willows of the farm pond. It was toodark to distinguish 
              anything.</p>
            <p>　　He was close up to the next stile before he saw a dark shapeleaning 
              against it. The man moved aside.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Good-evening!&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Good-evening!&quot; Morel answered, not noticing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Paul Morel?&quot; said the man.</p>
            <p>　　Then he knew it was Dawes. The man stopped his way.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I've got yer, have I?&quot; he said awkwardly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I shall miss my train,&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　He could see nothing of Dawes's face. The man's teeth seemedto 
              chatter as he talked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You're going to get it from me now,&quot; said Dawes.</p>
            <p>　　Morel attempted to move forward; the other man stepped in frontof 
              him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Are yer goin' to take that top-coat off,&quot; he said, 
              &quot;or areyou goin' to lie down to it?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Paul was afraid the man was mad.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But,&quot; he said, &quot;I don't know how to fight.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;All right, then,&quot; answered Dawes, and before the younger 
              manknew where he was, he was staggering backwards from a blow acrossthe 
              face.</p>
            <p>　　The whole night went black. He tore off his overcoat and coat,dodging 
              a blow, and flung the garments over Dawes. The latterswore savagely. 
              Morel, in his shirt-sleeves, was now alert andfurious. He felt his 
              whole body unsheath itself like a claw. He could not fight, so he 
              would use his wits. The other man becamemore distinct to him; he 
              could see particularly the shirt-breast.Dawes stumbled over Paul's 
              coats, then came rushing forward. The young man's mouth was bleeding. 
              It was the other man's mouth he was dying to get at, and the desire 
              was anguish in its strength. He stepped quickly through the stile, 
              and as Dawes was coming throughafter him, like a flash he got a 
              blow in over the other's mouth. He shivered with pleasure. Dawes 
              advanced slowly, spitting. Paulwas afraid; he moved round to get 
              to the stile again. Suddenly, fromout of nowhere, came a great blow 
              against his ear, that sent himfalling helpless backwards. He heard 
              Dawes's heavy panting,like a wild beast's, then came a kick on the 
              knee, giving himsuch agony that he got up and, quite blind, leapt 
              clean under hisenemy's guard. He felt blows and kicks, but they 
              did not hurt. He hung on to the bigger man like a wild cat, till 
              at last Dawes fellwith a crash, losing his presence of mind. Paul 
              went down with him. Pure instinct brought his hands to the man's 
              neck, and before Dawes,in frenzy and agony, could wrench him free, 
              he had got his fiststwisted in the scarf and his knuckles dug in 
              the throat of theother man. He was a pure instinct, without reason 
              or feeling. His body, hard and wonderful in itself, cleaved against 
              thestruggling body of the other man; not a muscle in him relaxed. 
              He was quite unconscious, only his body had taken upon itself to 
              killthis other man. For himself, he had neither feeling nor reason. 
              He lay pressed hard against his adversary, his body adjusting itselfto 
              its one pure purpose of choking the other man, resisting exactlyat 
              the right moment, with exactly the right amount of strength,the 
              struggles of the other, silent, intent, unchanging, graduallypressing 
              its knuckles deeper, feeling the struggles of the otherbody become 
              wilder and more frenzied. Tighter and tighter grewhis body, like 
              a screw that is gradually increasing in pressure,till something 
              breaks.</p>
            <p>　　Then suddenly he relaxed, full of wonder and misgiving. Dawes 
              had been yielding. Morel felt his body flame with pain,as he realised 
              what he was doing; he was all bewildered. Dawes's struggles suddenly 
              renewed themselves in a furious spasm. Paul's hands were wrenched, 
              torn out of the scarf in which theywere knotted, and he was flung 
              away, helpless. He heard the horridsound of the other's gasping, 
              but he lay stunned; then, still dazed,he felt the blows of the other's 
              feet, and lost consciousness.</p>
            <p>　　Dawes, grunting with pain like a beast, was kicking the prostratebody 
              of his rival. Suddenly the whistle of the train shriekedtwo fields 
              away. He turned round and glared suspiciously. What was coming? 
              He saw the lights of the train draw across his vision. It seemed 
              to him people were approaching. He made off across thefield into 
              Nottingham, and dimly in his consciousness as he went,he felt on 
              his foot the place where his boot had knocked againstone of the 
              lad's bones. The knock seemed to re-echo inside him;he hurried to 
              get away from it.</p>
            <p>　　Morel gradually came to himself. He knew where he was andwhat 
              had happened, but he did not want to move. He lay still,with tiny 
              bits of snow tickling his face. It was pleasantto lie quite, quite 
              still. The time passed. It was the bitsof snow that kept rousing 
              him when he did not want to be roused. At last his will clicked 
              into action.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I mustn't lie here,&quot; he said; &quot;it's silly.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　But still he did not move.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I said I was going to get up,&quot; he repeated. &quot;Why 
              don't I?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And still it was some time before he had sufficiently pulledhimself 
              together to stir; then gradually he got up. Pain made himsick and 
              dazed, but his brain was clear. Reeling, he groped forhis coats 
              and got them on, buttoning his overcoat up to his ears. It was some 
              time before he found his cap. He did not know whether hisface was 
              still bleeding. Walking blindly, every step making him sickwith 
              pain, he went back to the pond and washed his face and hands. The 
              icy water hurt, but helped to bring him back to himself. He crawled 
              back up the hill to the tram. He wanted to get to hismother--he 
              must get to his mother--that was his blind intention. He covered 
              his face as much as he could, and struggled sickly along. Continually 
              the ground seemed to fall away from him as he walked,and he felt 
              himself dropping with a sickening feeling into space; so,like a 
              nightmare, he got through with the journey home.</p>
            <p>　　Everybody was in bed. He looked at himself. His face wasdiscoloured 
              and smeared with blood, almost like a dead man's face. He washed 
              it, and went to bed. The night went by in delirium. In the morning 
              he found his mother looking at him. Her blue eyes--theywere all 
              he wanted to see. She was there; he was in her hands.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's not much, mother,&quot; he said. &quot;It was Baxter 
              Dawes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Tell me where it hurts you,&quot; she said quietly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know--my shoulder. Say it was a bicycle accident, 
              mother.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He could not move his arm. Presently Minnie, the little servant,came 
              upstairs with some tea.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Your mother's nearly frightened me out of my wits--fainted 
              away,&quot;she said.</p>
            <p>　　He felt he could not bear it. His mother nursed him; he toldher 
              about it.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And now I should have done with them all,&quot; she said 
              quietly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I will, mother.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She covered him up.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And don't think about it,&quot; she said--&quot;only try 
              to go to sleep. The doctor won't be here till eleven.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He had a dislocated shoulder, and the second day acute bronchitisset 
              in. His mother was pale as death now, and very thin. She wouldsit 
              and look at him, then away into space. There was somethingbetween 
              them that neither dared mention. Clara came to see him. Afterwards 
              he said to his mother:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She makes me tired, mother.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; I wish she wouldn't come,&quot; Mrs. Morel replied.</p>
            <p>　　Another day Miriam came, but she seemed almost like a strangerto 
              him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You know, I don't care about them, mother,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm afraid you don't, my son,&quot; she replied sadly.</p>
            <p>　　It was given out everywhere that it was a bicycle accident. Soon 
              he was able to go to work again, but now there was a constantsickness 
              and gnawing at his heart. He went to Clara, but there seemed,as 
              it were, nobody there. He could not work. He and his motherseemed 
              almost to avoid each other. There was some secret betweenthem which 
              they could not bear. He was not aware of it. He onlyknew that his 
              life seemed unbalanced, as if it were going to smashinto pieces.</p>
            <p>　　Clara did not know what was the matter with him. She realised 
              that he seemed unaware of her. Even when he cameto her he seemed 
              unaware of her; always he was somewhere else. She felt she was clutching 
              for him, and he was somewhere else. It tortured her, and so she 
              tortured him. For a month at a timeshe kept him at arm's length. 
              He almost hated her, and was drivento her in spite of himself. He 
              went mostly into the company of men,was always at the George or 
              the White Horse. His mother was ill,distant, quiet, shadowy. He 
              was terrified of something; he darednot look at her. Her eyes seemed 
              to grow darker, her face more waxen;still she dragged about at her 
              work.</p>
            <p>　　At Whitsuntide he said he would go to Blackpool for fourdays 
              with his friend Newton. The latter was a big, jolly fellow,with 
              a touch of the bounder about him. Paul said his mother must goto 
              Sheffield to stay a week with Annie, who lived there. Perhaps thechange 
              would do her good. Mrs. Morel was attending a woman's doctorin Nottingham. 
              He said her heart and her digestion were wrong. She consented to 
              go to Sheffield, though she did not want to;but now she would do 
              everything her son wished of her. Paul saidhe would come for her 
              on the fifth day, and stay also in Sheffieldtill the holiday was 
              up. It was agreed.</p>
            <p>　　The two young men set off gaily for Blackpool. Mrs. Morel wasquite 
              lively as Paul kissed her and left her. Once at the station,he forgot 
              everything. Four days were clear--not an anxiety,not a thought. 
              The two young men simply enjoyed themselves. Paul was like another 
              man. None of himself remained--no Clara,no Miriam, no mother that 
              fretted him. He wrote to them all,and long letters to his mother; 
              but they were jolly letters thatmade her laugh. He was having a 
              good time, as young fellows willin a place like Blackpool. And underneath 
              it all was a shadowfor her.</p>
            <p>　　Paul was very gay, excited at the thought of staying with hismother 
              in Sheffield. Newton was to spend the day with them. Their train 
              was late. Joking, laughing, with their pipes betweentheir teeth, 
              the young men swung their bags on to the tram-car. Paulhad bought 
              his mother a little collar of real lace that he wantedto see her 
              wear, so that he could tease her about it.</p>
            <p>　　Annie lived in a nice house, and had a little maid. Paul rangaily 
              up the steps. He expected his mother laughing in the hall,but it 
              was Annie who opened to him. She seemed distant to him. He stood 
              a second in dismay. Annie let him kiss her cheek.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Is my mother ill?&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; she's not very well. Don't upset her.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Is she in bed?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And then the queer feeling went over him, as if all the sunshinehad 
              gone out of him, and it was all shadow. He dropped the bagand ran 
              upstairs. Hesitating, he opened the door. His mothersat up in bed, 
              wearing a dressing-gown of old-rose colour. She looked at him almost 
              as if she were ashamed of herself,pleading to him, humble. He saw 
              the ashy look about her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Mother!&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I thought you were never coming,&quot; she answered gaily.</p>
            <p>　　But he only fell on his knees at the bedside, and buriedhis face 
              in the bedclothes, crying in agony, and saying:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Mother--mother--mother!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She stroked his hair slowly with her thin hand.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't cry,&quot; she said. &quot;Don't cry--it's nothing.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　But he felt as if his blood was melting into tears, and hecried 
              in terror and pain.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't--don't cry,&quot; his mother faltered.</p>
            <p>　　Slowly she stroked his hair. Shocked out of himself, he cried,and 
              the tears hurt in every fibre of his body. Suddenly he stopped,but 
              he dared not lift his face out of the bedclothes.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You ARE late. Where have you been?&quot; his mother asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;The train was late,&quot; he replied, muffled in the sheet.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; that miserable Central! Is Newton come?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm sure you must be hungry, and they've kept dinner waiting.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　With a wrench he looked up at her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What is it, mother?&quot; he asked brutally.</p>
            <p>　　She averted her eyes as she answered:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Only a bit of a tumour, my boy. You needn't trouble. It's 
              been there--the lump has--a long time.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Up came the tears again. His mind was clear and hard,but his 
              body was crying.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Where?&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　She put her hand on her side.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Here. But you know they can sweal a tumour away.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He stood feeling dazed and helpless, like a child. He thoughtperhaps 
              it was as she said. Yes; he reassured himself it was so. But all 
              the while his blood and his body knew definitely what it was. He 
              sat down on the bed, and took her hand. She had never had but theone 
              ring--her wedding-ring.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;When were you poorly?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It was yesterday it began,&quot; she answered submissively.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Pains?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; but not more than I've often had at home. I believeDr. 
              Ansell is an alarmist.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You ought not to have travelled alone,&quot; he said, to 
              himselfmore than to her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;As if that had anything to do with it!&quot; she answered 
              quickly.</p>
            <p>　　They were silent for a while.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Now go and have your dinner,&quot; she said. &quot;You 
              MUST be hungry.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Have you had yours?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; a beautiful sole I had. Annie IS good to me.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They talked a little while, then he went downstairs. He was very 
              white and strained. Newton sat in miserable sympathy.</p>
            <p>　　After dinner he went into the scullery to help Annie to wash 
              up. The little maid had gone on an errand.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Is it really a tumour?&quot; he asked.</p>

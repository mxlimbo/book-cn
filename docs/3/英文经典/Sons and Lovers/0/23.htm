            <p>　　WHEN he was twenty-three years old, Paul sent in a landscape 
              tothe winter exhibition at Nottingham Castle. Miss Jordan had takena 
              good deal of interest in him, and invited him to her house,where 
              he met other artists. He was beginning to grow ambitious.</p>
            <p>　　One morning the postman came just as he was washing inthe scullery. 
              Suddenly he heard a wild noise from his mother. Rushing into the 
              kitchen, he found her standing on the hearthrugwildly waving a letter 
              and crying &quot;Hurrah!&quot; as if she had gone mad. He was shocked 
              and frightened.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why, mother!&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
            <p>　　She flew to him, flung her arms round him for a moment,then waved 
              the letter, crying:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Hurrah, my boy! I knew we should do it!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He was afraid of her--the small, severe woman with graying hairsuddenly 
              bursting out in such frenzy. The postman came running back,afraid 
              something had happened. They saw his tipped cap over theshort curtains. 
              Mrs. Morel rushed to the door.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;His picture's got first prize, Fred,&quot; she cried, &quot;and 
              is soldfor twenty guineas.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;My word, that's something like!&quot; said the young postman,whom 
              they had known all his life.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And Major Moreton has bought it!&quot; she cried.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It looks like meanin' something, that does, Mrs. Morel,&quot;said 
              the postman, his blue eyes bright. He was glad to have broughtsuch 
              a lucky letter. Mrs. Morel went indoors and sat down, trembling. 
              Paul was afraid lest she might have misread the letter, and might 
              bedisappointed after all. He scrutinised it once, twice. Yes, he 
              becameconvinced it was true. Then he sat down, his heart beating 
              with joy.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Mother!&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Didn't I SAY we should do it!&quot; she said, pretending 
              shewas not crying.</p>
            <p>　　He took the kettle off the fire and mashed the tea.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You didn't think, mother--&quot; he began tentatively.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, my son--not so much--but I expected a good deal.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But not so much,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No--no--but I knew we should do it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And then she recovered her composure, apparently at least. He 
              sat with his shirt turned back, showing his young throat almostlike 
              a girl's, and the towel in his hand, his hair sticking up wet.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Twenty guineas, mother! That's just what you wanted to 
              buyArthur out. Now you needn't borrow any. It'll just do.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Indeed, I shan't take it all,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But why?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Because I shan't.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well--you have twelve pounds, I'll have nine.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They cavilled about sharing the twenty guineas. She wantedto 
              take only the five pounds she needed. He would not hear of it. So 
              they got over the stress of emotion by quarrelling.</p>
            <p>　　Morel came home at night from the pit, saying:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;They tell me Paul's got first prize for his picture, and 
              soldit to Lord Henry Bentley for fifty pound.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, what stories people do tell!&quot; she cried.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ha!&quot; he answered. &quot;I said I wor sure it wor a 
              lie. But they said tha'd told Fred Hodgkisson.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;As if I would tell him such stuff!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ha!&quot; assented the miner.</p>
            <p>　　But he was disappointed nevertheless.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's true he has got the first prize,&quot; said Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　The miner sat heavily in his chair.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Has he, beguy!&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
            <p>　　He stared across the room fixedly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But as for fifty pounds--such nonsense!&quot; She was silent 
              awhile. &quot;Major Moreton bought it for twenty guineas, that's 
              true.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Twenty guineas! Tha niver says!&quot; exclaimed Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, and it was worth it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ay!&quot; he said. &quot;I don't misdoubt it. But twenty 
              guineasfor a bit of a paintin' as he knocked off in an hour or two!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He was silent with conceit of his son. Mrs. Morel sniffed,as 
              if it were nothing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And when does he handle th' money?&quot; asked the collier.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;That I couldn't tell you. When the picture is sent home,I 
              suppose.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　There was silence. Morel stared at the sugar-basin insteadof 
              eating his dinner. His black arm, with the hand all gnarledwith 
              work lay on the table. His wife pretended not to see him rubthe 
              back of his hand across his eyes, nor the smear in the coal-duston 
              his black face.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, an' that other lad 'ud 'a done as much if they hadnaha' 
              killed 'im,&quot; he said quietly.</p>
            <p>　　The thought of William went through Mrs. Morel like a cold blade. 
              It left her feeling she was tired, and wanted rest.</p>
            <p>　　Paul was invited to dinner at Mr. Jordan's. Afterwards he said:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Mother, I want an evening suit.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, I was afraid you would,&quot; she said. She was glad. 
              There was a moment or two of silence. &quot;There's that one of 
              William's,&quot;she continued, &quot;that I know cost four pounds 
              tenand which he'd only worn three times.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Should you like me to wear it, mother?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes. I think it would fit you--at least the coat. The trouserswould 
              want shortening.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He went upstairs and put on the coat and vest. Coming down,he 
              looked strange in a flannel collar and a flannel shirt-front,with 
              an evening coat and vest. It was rather large.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;The tailor can make it right,&quot; she said, smoothing 
              her handover his shoulder. &quot;It's beautiful stuff. I never could 
              findin my heart to let your father wear the trousers, and very gladI 
              am now.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And as she smoothed her hand over the silk collar she thoughtof 
              her eldest son. But this son was living enough inside the clothes. 
              She passed her hand down his back to feel him. He was alive and 
              hers. The other was dead.</p>
            <p>　　He went out to dinner several times in his evening suit that 
              hadbeen William's. Each time his mother's heart was firm with prideand 
              joy. He was started now. The studs she and the children hadbought 
              for William were in his shirt-front; he wore one of William'sdress 
              shirts. But he had an elegant figure. His face was rough,but warm-looking 
              and rather pleasing. He did not look particularlya gentleman, but 
              she thought he looked quite a man.</p>
            <p>　　He told her everything that took place, everything that was said. 
              It was as if she had been there. And he was dying to introduce herto 
              these new friends who had dinner at seven-thirty in the evening.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Go along with you!&quot; she said. &quot;What do they want 
              to knowme for?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;They do!&quot; he cried indignantly. &quot;If they want 
              to know me--andthey say they do--then they want to know you, because 
              you are quiteas clever as I am. &quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Go along with you, child! &quot; she laughed.</p>
            <p>　　But she began to spare her hands. They, too, were work-gnarled 
              now. The skin was shiny with so much hot water, the knuckles rather 
              swollen. But she began to be careful to keep them out of soda. She 
              regrettedwhat they had been--so small and exquisite. And when Annie 
              insistedon her having more stylish blouses to suit her age, she 
              submitted. She even went so far as to allow a black velvet bow to 
              be placedon her hair. Then she sniffed in her sarcastic manner, 
              and wassure she looked a sight. But she looked a lady, Paul declared,as 
              much as Mrs. Major Moreton, and far, far nicer. The familywas coming 
              on. Only Morel remained unchanged, or rather,lapsed slowly.</p>
            <p>　　Paul and his mother now had long discussions about life. Religion 
              was fading into the background. He had shovelled awayan the beliefs 
              that would hamper him, had cleared the ground,and come more or less 
              to the bedrock of belief that one should feelinside oneself for 
              right and wrong, and should have the patience togradually realise 
              one's God. Now life interested him more.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You know,&quot; he said to his mother, &quot;I don't want 
              to belongto the well-to-do middle class. I like my common people 
              best. I belong to the common people.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But if anyone else said so, my son, wouldn't you be in 
              a tear. YOU know you consider yourself equal to any gentleman.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;In myself,&quot; he answered, &quot;not in my class or 
              my educationor my manners. But in myself I am.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Very well, then. Then why talk about the common people?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Because--the difference between people isn't in their class,but 
              in themselves. Only from the middle classes one gets ideas,and from 
              the common people--life itself, warmth. You feel their hatesand 
              loves.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's all very well, my boy. But, then, why don't you goand 
              talk to your father's pals?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But they're rather different.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Not at all. They're the common people. After all, whom 
              do youmix with now--among the common people? Those that exchange 
              ideas,like the middle classes. The rest don't interest you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But--there's the life---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't believe there's a jot more life from Miriam than 
              youcould get from any educated girl--say Miss Moreton. It is YOUwho 
              are snobbish about class.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She frankly WANTED him to climb into the middle classes,a thing 
              not very difficult, she knew. And she wanted him in the endto marry 
              a lady.</p>
            <p>　　Now she began to combat him in his restless fretting. He still 
              kept up his connection with Miriam, could neither breakfree nor 
              go the whole length of engagement. And this indecisionseemed to 
              bleed him of his energy. Moreover, his mother suspectedhim of an 
              unrecognised leaning towards Clara, and, since the latterwas a married 
              woman, she wished he would fall in love with oneof the girls in 
              a better station of life. But he was stupid,and would refuse to 
              love or even to admire a girl much, just becauseshe was his social 
              superior.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;My boy,&quot; said his mother to him, &quot;all your cleverness,your 
              breaking away from old things, and taking life in your own hands,doesn't 
              seem to bring you much happiness.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What is happiness!&quot; he cried. &quot;It's nothing to 
              me! How AM I to be happy?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The plump question disturbed her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;That's for you to judge, my lad. But if you could meetsome 
              GOOD woman who would MAKE you happy--and you began to thinkof settling 
              your life--when you have the means--so that you couldwork without 
              all this fretting--it would be much better for you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He frowned. His mother caught him on the raw of his woundof Miriam. 
              He pushed the tumbled hair off his forehead, his eyesfull of pain 
              and fire.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You mean easy, mother,&quot; he cried. &quot;That's a woman's 
              whole doctrinefor life--ease of soul and physical comfort. And I 
              do despise it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, do you!&quot; replied his mother. &quot;And do you 
              call yoursa divine discontent?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes. I don't care about its divinity. But damn your happiness! 
              So long as life's full, it doesn't matter whether it's happy or 
              not. I'm afraid your happiness would bore me.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You never give it a chance,&quot; she said. Then suddenly 
              allher passion of grief over him broke out. &quot;But it does matter!&quot;she 
              cried. &quot;And you OUGHT to be happy, you ought to try to be happy,to 
              live to be happy. How could I bear to think your life wouldn'tbe 
              a happy one!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Your own's been bad enough, mater, but it hasn't left youso 
              much worse off than the folk who've been happier. I reckonyou've 
              done well. And I am the same. Aren't I well enough off?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You're not, my son. Battle--battle--and suffer. It's aboutall 
              you do, as far as I can see.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But why not, my dear? I tell you it's the best---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It isn't. And one OUGHT to be happy, one OUGHT.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　By this time Mrs. Morel was trembling violently. Struggles ofthis 
              kind often took place between her and her son, when sheseemed to 
              fight for his very life against his own will to die. He took her 
              in his arms. She was ill and pitiful.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Never mind, Little,&quot; he murmured. &quot;So long as 
              you don't feellife's paltry and a miserable business, the rest doesn't 
              matter,happiness or unhappiness.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She pressed him to her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But I want you to be happy,&quot; she said pathetically.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Eh, my dear--say rather you want me to live.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel felt as if her heart would break for him. At this 
              rate she knew he would not live. He had that poignantcarelessness 
              about himself, his own suffering, his own life,which is a form of 
              slow suicide. It almost broke her heart. With all the passion of 
              her strong nature she hated Miriam for havingin this subtle way 
              undermined his joy. It did not matter to herthat Miriam could not 
              help it. Miriam did it, and she hated her.</p>
            <p>　　She wished so much he would fall in love with a girl equalto 
              be his mate--educated and strong. But he would not look atanybody 
              above him in station. He seemed to like Mrs. Dawes. At any rate 
              that feeling was wholesome. His mother prayed and prayedfor him, 
              that he might not be wasted. That was all her prayer--notfor his 
              soul or his righteousness, but that he might not be wasted. And 
              while he slept, for hours and hours she thought and prayedfor him.</p>
            <p>　　He drifted away from Miriam imperceptibly, without knowing hewas 
              going. Arthur only left the army to be married. The baby wasborn 
              six months after his wedding. Mrs. Morel got him a job underthe 
              firm again, at twenty-one shillings a week. She furnished for him,with 
              the help of Beatrice's mother, a little cottage of two rooms. He 
              was caught now. It did not matter how he kicked and struggled,he 
              was fast. For a time he chafed, was irritable with hisyoung wife, 
              who loved him; he went almost distracted when the baby,which was 
              delicate, cried or gave trouble. He grumbled for hoursto his mother. 
              She only said: &quot;Well, my lad, you did it yourself,now you must 
              make the best of it.&quot; And then the grit came out in him. He 
              buckled to work, undertook his responsibilities, acknowledged thathe 
              belonged to his wife and child, and did make a good best of it. 
              He had never been very closely inbound into the family. Now he wasgone 
              altogether.</p>
            <p>　　The months went slowly along. Paul had more or less got intoconnection 
              with the Socialist, Suffragette, Unitarian people inNottingham, 
              owing to his acquaintance with Clara. One daya friend of his and 
              of Clara's, in Bestwood, asked him to takea message to Mrs. Dawes. 
              He went in the evening across SneintonMarket to Bluebell Hill. He 
              found the house in a mean little streetpaved with granite cobbles 
              and having causeways of dark blue,grooved bricks. The front door 
              went up a step from off thisrough pavement, where the feet of the 
              passersby rasped and clattered. The brown paint on the door was 
              so old that the naked wood showedbetween the rents. He stood on 
              the street below and knocked. There came a heavy footstep; a large, 
              stout woman of about sixtytowered above him. He looked up at her 
              from the pavement. She had a rather severe face.</p>
            <p>　　She admitted him into the parlour, which opened on to the street. 
              It was a small, stuffy, defunct room, of mahogany, and deathlyenlargements 
              of photographs of departed people done in carbon. Mrs. Radford left 
              him. She was stately, almost martial. In a moment Clara appeared. 
              She flushed deeply, and he was coveredwith confusion. It seemed 
              as if she did not like being discoveredin her home circumstances.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I thought it couldn't be your voice,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　But she might as well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb. She 
              invited him out of the mausoleum of a parlour into the kitchen.</p>
            <p>　　That was a little, darkish room too, but it was smotheredin white 
              lace. The mother had seated herself again by the cupboard,and was 
              drawing thread from a vast web of lace. A clump of fluff andravelled 
              cotton was at her right hand, a heap of three-quarter-inch lacelay 
              on her left, whilst in front of her was the mountain of lace web,piling 
              the hearthrug. Threads of curly cotton, pulled out from betweenthe 
              lengths of lace, strewed over the fender and the fireplace. Paul 
              dared not go forward, for fear of treading on piles of white stuff.</p>
            <p>　　On the table was a jenny for carding the lace. There wasa pack 
              of brown cardboard squares, a pack of cards of lace,a little box 
              of pins, and on the sofa lay a heap of drawn lace.</p>
            <p>　　The room was all lace, and it was so dark and warm that the white,snowy 
              stuff seemed the more distinct.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;If you're coming in you won't have to mind the work,&quot;said 
              Mrs. Radford. &quot;I know we're about blocked up. But sityou down.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Clara, much embarrassed, gave him a chair against the wallopposite 
              the white heaps. Then she herself took her placeon the sofa, shamedly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Will you drink a bottle of stout?&quot; Mrs. Radford asked. 
              &quot;Clara, get him a bottle of stout.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He protested, but Mrs. Radford insisted.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You look as if you could do with it,&quot; she said. &quot;Haven't 
              younever any more colour than that?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's only a thick skin I've got that doesn't showthe blood 
              through,&quot; he answered.</p>
            <p>　　Clara, ashamed and chagrined, brought him a bottle of stoutand 
              a glass. He poured out some of the black stuff.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well,&quot; he said, lifting the glass, &quot;here's health!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And thank you,&quot; said Mrs. Radford.</p>
            <p>　　He took a drink of stout.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And light yourself a cigarette, so long as you don't setthe 
              house on fire,&quot; said Mrs. Radford.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Thank you,&quot; he replied.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nay, you needn't thank me,&quot; she answered. &quot;I 
              s'll beglad to smell a bit of smoke in th' 'ouse again. A house 
              o'women is as dead as a house wi' no fire, to my thinkin'. I'mnot 
              a spider as likes a corner to myself. I like a man about,if he's 
              only something to snap at.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Clara began to work. Her jenny spun with a subdued buzz;the white 
              lace hopped from between her fingers on to the card. It was filled; 
              she snipped off the length, and pinned the enddown to the banded 
              lace. Then she put a new card in her jenny. Paul watched her. She 
              sat square and magnificent. Her throat andarms were bare. The blood 
              still mantled below her ears; she benther head in shame of her humility. 
              Her face was set on her work. Her arms were creamy and full of life 
              beside the white lace;her large, well-kept hands worked with a balanced 
              movement,as if nothing would hurry them. He, not knowing, watched 
              her allthe time. He saw the arch of her neck from the shoulder, 
              as shebent her head; he saw the coil of dun hair; he watched her 
              moving,gleaming arms.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I've heard a bit about you from Clara,&quot; continued 
              the mother. &quot;You're in Jordan's, aren't you?&quot; She drew 
              her lace unceasing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ay, well, and I can remember when Thomas Jordan used to 
              askME for one of my toffies.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Did he?&quot; laughed Paul. &quot;And did he get it?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Sometimes he did, sometimes he didn't--which was latterly. 
              For he's the sort that takes all and gives naught, he is--or usedto 
              be.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I think he's very decent,&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; well, I'm glad to hear it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Radford looked across at him steadily. There was somethingdetermined 
              about her that he liked. Her face was falling loose,but her eyes 
              were calm, and there was something strong in her thatmade it seem 
              she was not old; merely her wrinkles and loose cheekswere an anachronism. 
              She had the strength and sang-froid of a womanin the prime of life. 
              She continued drawing the lace with slow,dignified movements. The 
              big web came up inevitably over her apron;the length of lace fell 
              away at her side. Her arms were finely shapen,but glossy and yellow 
              as old ivory. They had not the peculiar dullgleam that made Clara's 
              so fascinating to him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And you've been going with Miriam Leivers?&quot; the mother 
              asked him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well--&quot; he answered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, she's a nice girl,&quot; she continued. &quot;She's 
              very nice,but she's a bit too much above this world to suit my fancy.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She is a bit like that,&quot; he agreed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She'll never be satisfied till she's got wings and can 
              flyover everybody's head, she won't,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　Clara broke in, and he told her his message. She spoke humblyto 
              him. He had surprised her in her drudgery. To have her humblemade 
              him feel as if he were lifting his head in expectation.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you like jennying?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What can a woman do!&quot; she replied bitterly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Is it sweated?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;More or less. Isn't ALL woman's work? That's another trickthe 
              men have played, since we force ourselves into the labour market.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Now then, you shut up about the men,&quot; said her mother. 
              &quot;If thewomen wasn't fools, the men wouldn't be bad uns, that's 
              what I say. No man was ever that bad wi' me but what he got it back 
              again. Not but what they're a lousy lot, there's no denying it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But they're all right really, aren't they?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, they're a bit different from women,&quot; she answered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Would you care to be back at Jordan's?&quot; he asked Clara.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't think so,&quot; she replied.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, she would!&quot; cried her mother; &quot;thank her 
              stars if shecould get back. Don't you listen to her. She's for ever 
              on that'igh horse of hers, an' it's back's that thin an' starved 
              it'llcut her in two one of these days.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Clara suffered badly from her mother. Paul felt as if his eyeswere 
              coming very wide open. Wasn't he to take Clara's fulminationsso 
              seriously, after all? She spun steadily at her work. He experienceda 
              thrill of joy, thinking she might need his help. She seemeddenied 
              and deprived of so much. And her arm moved mechanically,that should 
              never have been subdued to a mechanism, and her headwas bowed to 
              the lace, that never should have been bowed. She seemedto be stranded 
              there among the refuse that life has thrown away,doing her jennying. 
              It was a bitter thing to her to be put asideby life, as if it had 
              no use for her. No wonder she protested.</p>
            <p>　　She came with him to the door. He stood below in the mean street,looking 
              up at her. So fine she was in her stature and her bearing,she reminded 
              him of Juno dethroned. As she stood in the doorway,she winced from 
              the street, from her surroundings.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And you will go with Mrs. Hodgkisson to Hucknall?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He was talking quite meaninglessly, only watching her. Her grey 
              eyes at last met his. They looked dumb with humiliation,pleading 
              with a kind of captive misery. He was shaken and at a loss. He had 
              thought her high and mighty.</p>
            <p>　　When he left her, he wanted to run. He went to the stationin 
              a sort of dream, and was at home without realising he had movedout 
              of her street.</p>
            <p>　　He had an idea that Susan, the overseer of the Spiral girls,was 
              about to be married. He asked her the next day.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I say, Susan, I heard a whisper of your getting married. 
              What about it?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Susan flushed red.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Who's been talking to you?&quot; she replied.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nobody. I merely heard a whisper that you WERE thinking---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, I am, though you needn't tell anybody. What's more,I 
              wish I wasn't!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nay, Susan, you won't make me believe that.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Shan't I? You CAN believe it, though. I'd rather stophere 
              a thousand times.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Paul was perturbed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why, Susan?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The girl's colour was high, and her eyes flashed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;That's why!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And must you?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　For answer, she looked at him. There was about him a candourand 
              gentleness which made the women trust him. He understood.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ah, I'm sorry,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　Tears came to her eyes.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But you'll see it'll turn out all right. You'll make the 
              bestof it,&quot; he continued rather wistfully.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;There's nothing else for it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yea, there's making the worst of it. Try and make it all 
              right.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He soon made occasion to call again on Clara.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Would you,&quot; he said, &quot;care to come back to Jordan's?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She put down her work, laid her beautiful arms on the table,and 
              looked at him for some moments without answering. Gradually theflush 
              mounted her cheek.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　Paul felt rather awkward.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, because Susan is thinking of leaving,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　Clara went on with her jennying. The white lace leapedin little 
              jumps and bounds on to the card. He waited for her. Without raising 
              her head, she said at last, in a peculiar low voice:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Have you said anything about it?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Except to you, not a word.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　There was again a long silence.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I will apply when the advertisement is out,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You will apply before that. I will let you know exactly 
              when.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She went on spinning her little machine, and did not contradict 
              him.</p>
            <p>　　Clara came to Jordan's. Some of the older hands, Fanny among 
              them,remembered her earlier rule, and cordially disliked the memory. 
              Clara had always been &quot;ikey&quot;, reserved, and superior. 
              She had nevermixed with the girls as one of themselves. If she had 
              occasionto find fault, she did it coolly and with perfect politeness,which 
              the defaulter felt to be a bigger insult than crassness. Towards 
              Fanny, the poor, overstrung hunchback, Clara was unfailinglycompassionate 
              and gentle, as a result of which Fanny shedmore bitter tears than 
              ever the rough tongues of the other overseershad caused her.</p>
            <p>　　There was something in Clara that Paul disliked, and muchthat 
              piqued him. If she were about, he always watched her strongthroat 
              or her neck, upon which the blonde hair grew low and fluffy. There 
              was a fine down, almost invisible, upon the skin of her faceand 
              arms, and when once he had perceived it, he saw it always.</p>
            <p>　　When he was at his work, painting in the afternoon,she would 
              come and stand near to him, perfectly motionless. Then he felt her, 
              though she neither spoke nor touched him. Although she stood a yard 
              away he felt as if he were in contactwith her. Then he could paint 
              no more. He flung down the brushes,and turned to talk to her.</p>
            <p>　　Sometimes she praised his work; sometimes she was criticaland 
              cold.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You are affected in that piece,&quot; she would say; and, 
              as therewas an element of truth in her condemnation, his blood boiledwith 
              anger.</p>
            <p>　　Again: &quot;What of this?&quot; he would ask enthusiastically.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;H'm!&quot; She made a small doubtful sound. &quot;It doesn't 
              interestme much.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Because you don't understand it,&quot; he retorted.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then why ask me about it?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Because I thought you would understand.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She would shrug her shoulders in scorn of his work. She maddened 
              him. He was furious. Then he abused her, and went intopassionate 
              exposition of his stuff. This amused and stimulated her. But she 
              never owned that she had been wrong.</p>
            <p>　　During the ten years that she had belonged to the women's movementshe 
              had acquired a fair amount of education, and, having had someof 
              Miriam's passion to be instructed, had taught herself French,and 
              could read in that language with a struggle. She consideredherself 
              as a woman apart, and particularly apart, from her class. The girls 
              in the Spiral department were all of good homes. It was a small, 
              special industry, and had a certain distinction. There was an air 
              of refinement in both rooms. But Clara was aloofalso from her fellow-workers.</p>
            <p>　　None of these things, however, did she reveal to Paul. She was 
              not the one to give herself away. There was a sense ofmystery about 
              her. She was so reserved, he felt she had much to reserve. Her history 
              was open on the surface, but its inner meaning was hiddenfrom everybody. 
              It was exciting. And then sometimes he caughther looking at him 
              from under her brows with an almost furtive,sullen scrutiny, which 
              made him move quickly. Often she met his eyes. But then her own 
              were, as it were, covered over, revealing nothing. She gave him 
              a little, lenient smile. She was to him extraordinarilyprovocative, 
              because of the knowledge she seemed to possess,and gathered fruit 
              of experience he could not attain.</p>
            <p>　　One day he picked up a copy of Lettres de mon Moulin fromher 
              work-bench.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You read French, do you?&quot; he cried.</p>

            <p>　　Many of these letters, some of them in French or Norwegian,were 
              a great puzzle to the boy. He sat on his stool nervously awaitingthe 
              arrival of his &quot;boss&quot;. He suffered tortures of shyness 
              when,at half-past eight, the factory girls for upstairs trooped 
              past him.</p>
            <p>　　Mr. Pappleworth arrived, chewing a chlorodyne gum, at abouttwenty 
              to nine, when all the other men were at work. He was a thin,sallow 
              man with a red nose, quick, staccato, and smartly butstiffly dressed. 
              He was about thirty-six years old. There wassomething rather &quot;doggy&quot;, 
              rather smart, rather 'cute and shrewd,and something warm, and something 
              slightly contemptible about him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You my new lad?&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　Paul stood up and said he was.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Fetched the letters?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Mr. Pappleworth gave a chew to his gum.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Copied 'em?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, come on then, let's look slippy. Changed your coat?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You want to bring an old coat and leave it here.&quot; 
              He pronouncedthe last words with the chlorodyne gum between his 
              side teeth. He vanished into the darkness behind the great parcel-rack,reappeared 
              coatless, turning up a smart striped shirt-cuff overa thin and hairy 
              arm. Then he slipped into his coat. Paul noticedhow thin he was, 
              and that his trousers were in folds behind. He seized a stool, dragged 
              it beside the boy's, and sat down.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Sit down,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　Paul took a seat.</p>
            <p>　　Mr. Pappleworth was very close to him. The man seizedthe letters, 
              snatched a long entry-book out of a rack in frontof him, flung it 
              open, seized a pen, and said:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Now look here. You want to copy these letters in here.&quot; 
              He sniffed twice, gave a quick chew at his gum, stared fixedly ata 
              letter, then went very still and absorbed, and wrote the entry rapidly,in 
              a beautiful flourishing hand. He glanced quickly at Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;See that?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Think you can do it all right?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;All right then, let's see you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He sprang off his stool. Paul took a pen. Mr. Pappleworthdisappeared. 
              Paul rather liked copying the letters, but he wrote slowly,laboriously, 
              and exceedingly badly. He was doing the fourth letter,and feeling 
              quite busy and happy, when Mr. Pappleworth reappeared.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Now then, how'r' yer getting on? Done 'em?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He leaned over the boy's shoulder, chewing, and smellingof chlorodyne.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Strike my bob, lad, but you're a beautiful writer!&quot;he 
              exclaimed satirically. &quot;Ne'er mind, how many h'yer done? Only 
              three! I'd 'a eaten 'em. Get on, my lad, an' put numberson 'em. 
              Here, look! Get on!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Paul ground away at the letters, whilst Mr. Pappleworth fussedover 
              various jobs. Suddenly the boy started as a shrill whistlesounded 
              near his ear. Mr. Pappleworth came, took a plug out of a pipe,and 
              said, in an amazingly cross and bossy voice:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Paul heard a faint voice, like a woman's, out of the mouth ofthe 
              tube. He gazed in wonder, never having seen a speaking-tube before.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well,&quot; said Mr. Pappleworth disagreeably into the 
              tube,&quot;you'd better get some of your back work done, then.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Again the woman's tiny voice was heard, sounding pretty and cross.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I've not time to stand here while you talk,&quot; said 
              Mr. Pappleworth,and he pushed the plug into the tube.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Come, my lad,&quot; he said imploringly to Paul, &quot;there's 
              Pollycrying out for them orders. Can't you buck up a bit? Here, 
              come out!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He took the book, to Paul's immense chagrin, and beganthe copying 
              himself. He worked quickly and well. This done,he seized some strips 
              of long yellow paper, about three inches wide,and made out the day's 
              orders for the work-girls.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You'd better watch me,&quot; he said to Paul, working all 
              thewhile rapidly. Paul watched the weird little drawings of legs,and 
              thighs, and ankles, with the strokes across and the numbers,and 
              the few brief directions which his chief made upon the yellow paper. 
              Then Mr. Pappleworth finished and jumped up.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Come on with me,&quot; he said, and the yellow papers flyingin 
              his hands, he dashed through a door and down some stairs,into the 
              basement where the gas was burning. They crossed the cold,damp storeroom, 
              then a long, dreary room with a long table on trestles,into a smaller, 
              cosy apartment, not very high, which had beenbuilt on to the main 
              building. In this room a small woman witha red serge blouse, and 
              her black hair done on top of her head,was waiting like a proud 
              little bantam.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Here y'are!&quot; said Pappleworth.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I think it is 'here you are'!&quot; exclaimed Polly. &quot;The 
              girlshave been here nearly half an hour waiting. Just think of thetime 
              wasted!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;YOU think of getting your work done and not talking so 
              much,&quot;said Mr. Pappleworth. &quot;You could ha' been finishing 
              off.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You know quite well we finished everything off on Saturday!&quot;cried 
              Pony, flying at him, her dark eyes flashing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Tu-tu-tu-tu-terterter!&quot; he mocked. &quot;Here's your 
              new lad. Don't ruin him as you did the last.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;As we did the last!&quot; repeated Polly. &quot;Yes, WE 
              do a lotof ruining, we do. My word, a lad would TAKE some ruining 
              afterhe'd been with you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's time for work now, not for talk,&quot; said Mr. Pappleworthseverely 
              and coldly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It was time for work some time back,&quot; said Polly, 
              marching awaywith her head in the air. She was an erect little body 
              of forty.</p>
            <p>　　In that room were two round spiral machines on the bench underthe 
              window. Through the inner doorway was another longer room,with six 
              more machines. A little group of girls, nicely dressedin white aprons, 
              stood talking together.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Have you nothing else to do but talk?&quot; said Mr. Pappleworth.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Only wait for you,&quot; said one handsome girl, laughing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, get on, get on,&quot; he said. &quot;Come on, my 
              lad. You'll know your road down here again.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And Paul ran upstairs after his chief. He was given somechecking 
              and invoicing to do. He stood at the desk, labouring in hisexecrable 
              handwriting. Presently Mr. Jordan came strutting down fromthe glass 
              office and stood behind him, to the boy's great discomfort. Suddenly 
              a red and fat finger was thrust on the form he was filling in.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;MR. J. A. Bates, Esquire!&quot; exclaimed the cross voice 
              justbehind his ear.</p>
            <p>　　Paul looked at &quot;Mr. J. A. Bates, Esquire&quot; in his own 
              vile writing,and wondered what was the matter now.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Didn't they teach you any better THAN that while they were 
              at it? If you put 'Mr.' you don't put Esquire'-a man can't be both 
              at once.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The boy regretted his too-much generosity in disposingof honours, 
              hesitated, and with trembling fingers, scratched outthe &quot;Mr.&quot; 
              Then all at once Mr. Jordan snatched away the invoice.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Make another! Are you going to send that to a gentleman?&quot; 
              And he tore up the blue form irritably.</p>
            <p>　　Paul, his ears red with shame, began again. Still Mr. Jordan 
              watched.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know what they DO teach in schools. You'll haveto 
              write better than that. Lads learn nothing nowadays, but howto recite 
              poetry and play the fiddle. Have you seen his writing?&quot;he asked 
              of Mr. Pappleworth.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; prime, isn't it?&quot; replied Mr. Pappleworth indifferently.</p>
            <p>　　Mr. Jordan gave a little grunt, not unamiable. Paul divinedthat 
              his master's bark was worse than his bite. Indeed, the littlemanufacturer, 
              although he spoke bad English, was quite gentlemanenough to leave 
              his men alone and to take no notice of trifles. But he knew he did 
              not look like the boss and owner of the show,so he had to play his 
              role of proprietor at first, to put thingson a right footing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Let's see, WHAT'S your name?&quot; asked Mr. Pappleworth 
              of the boy.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Paul Morel.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　It is curious that children suffer so much at havingto pronounce 
              their own names.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Paul Morel, is it? All right, you Paul-Morel through themthings 
              there, and then---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Mr. Pappleworth subsided on to a stool, and began writing. A 
              girl came up from out of a door just behind, put somenewly-pressed 
              elastic web appliances on the counter, and returned. Mr. Pappleworth 
              picked up the whitey-blue knee-band, examined it,and its yellow 
              order-paper quickly, and put it on one side. Next was a flesh-pink 
              &quot;leg&quot;. He went through the few things,wrote out a couple 
              of orders, and called to Paul to accompany him. This time they went 
              through the door whence the girl had emerged. There Paul found himself 
              at the top of a little wooden flight of steps,and below him saw 
              a room with windows round two sides, and at thefarther end half 
              a dozen girls sitting bending over the benches inthe light from 
              the window, sewing. They were singing together &quot;TwoLittle Girls 
              in Blue&quot;. Hearing the door opened, they all turned round,to 
              see Mr. Pappleworth and Paul looking down on them from the farend 
              of the room. They stopped singing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Can't you make a bit less row?&quot; said Mr. Pappleworth. 
              &quot;Folk'll think we keep cats.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　A hunchback woman on a high stool turned her long, rather heavyface 
              towards Mr. Pappleworth, and said, in a contralto voice:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;They're all tom-cats then.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　In vain Mr. Pappleworth tried to be impressive for Paul's benefit.He 
              descended the steps into the finishing-off room,and went to the 
              hunchback Fanny. She had sucha short body on her high stool that 
              her head, with itsgreat bands of bright brown hair, seemed over 
              large, as did her pale,heavy face. She wore a dress of green-black 
              cashmere, and her wrists,coming out of the narrow cuffs, were thin 
              and flat, as she putdown her work nervously. He showed her something 
              that was wrongwith a knee-cap.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;you needn't come blaming it 
              on to me. It's not my fault.&quot; Her colour mounted to her cheek.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I never said it WAS your fault. Will you do as I tell you?&quot;replied 
              Mr. Pappleworth shortly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You don't say it's my fault, but you'd like to make out 
              as it was,&quot;the hunchback woman cried, almost in tears. Then 
              she snatchedthe knee-cap from her &quot;boss&quot;, saying: &quot;Yes, 
              I'll do it for you,but you needn't be snappy.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Here's your new lad,&quot; said Mr. Pappleworth.</p>
            <p>　　Fanny turned, smiling very gently on Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh!&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; don't make a softy of him between you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's not us as 'ud make a softy of him,&quot; she said 
              indignantly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Come on then, Paul,&quot; said Mr. Pappleworth.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Au revoy, Paul,&quot; said one of the girls.</p>
            <p>　　There was a titter of laughter. Paul went out, blushing deeply,not 
              having spoken a word.</p>
            <p>　　The day was very long. All morning the work-people were comingto 
              speak to Mr. Pappleworth. Paul was writing or learning to makeup 
              parcels, ready for the midday post. At one o'clock, or, rather,at 
              a quarter to one, Mr. Pappleworth disappeared to catch his train: 
              he lived in the suburbs. At one o'clock, Paul, feeling very lost,took 
              his dinner-basket down into the stockroom in the basement,that had 
              the long table on trestles, and ate his meal hurriedly,alone in 
              that cellar of gloom and desolation. Then he went out of doors. 
              The brightness and the freedom of the streets made him feel adventurousand 
              happy. But at two o'clock he was back in the corner of thebig room. 
              Soon the work-girls went trooping past, making remarks. It was the 
              commoner girls who worked upstairs at the heavy tasksof truss-making 
              and the finishing of artificial limbs. He waitedfor Mr. Pappleworth, 
              not knowing what to do, sitting scribblingon the yellow order-paper. 
              Mr. Pappleworth came at twenty minutesto three. Then he sat and 
              gossiped with Paul, treating the boyentirely as an equal, even in 
              age.</p>
            <p>　　In the afternoon there was never very much to do, unless itwere 
              near the week-end, and the accounts had to be made up. At five o'clock 
              all the men went down into the dungeon with thetable on trestles, 
              and there they had tea, eating bread-and-butteron the bare, dirty 
              boards, talking with the same kind of uglyhaste and slovenliness 
              with which they ate their meal. And yetupstairs the atmosphere among 
              them was always jolly and clear. The cellar and the trestles affected 
              them.</p>
            <p>　　After tea, when all the gases were lighted, WORK went more briskly. 
              There was the big evening post to get off. The hose came up warmand 
              newly pressed from the workrooms. Paul had made out the invoices. 
              Now he had the packing up and addressing to do, then he hadto weigh 
              his stock of parcels on the scales. Everywhere voiceswere calling 
              weights, there was the chink of metal, the rapidsnapping of string, 
              the hurrying to old Mr. Melling for stamps. And at last the postman 
              came with his sack, laughing and jolly. Then everything slacked 
              off, and Paul took his dinner-basketand ran to the station to catch 
              the eight-twenty train. The dayin the factory was just twelve hours 
              long.</p>
            <p>　　His mother sat waiting for him rather anxiously. He had towalk 
              from Keston, so was not home until about twenty past nine. And he 
              left the house before seven in the morning. Mrs. Morelwas rather 
              anxious about his health. But she herself had had to put upwith 
              so much that she expected her children to take the same odds. They 
              must go through with what came. And Paul stayed at Jordan's,although 
              all the time he was there his health suffered from thedarkness and 
              lack of air and the long hours.</p>
            <p>　　He came in pale and tired. His mother looked at him. She saw 
              he was rather pleased, and her anxiety all went.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, and how was it?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ever so funny, mother,&quot; he replied. &quot;You don't 
              have to worka bit hard, and they're nice with you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And did you get on all right?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes: they only say my writing's bad. But Mr. Pappleworth--he's 
              my man--said to Mr. Jordan I should be all right. I'm Spiral, mother; 
              you must come and see. It's ever so nice.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Soon he liked Jordan's. Mr. Pappleworth, who had a certain&quot;saloon 
              bar&quot; flavour about him, was always natural, and treatedhim 
              as if he had been a comrade. Sometimes the &quot;Spiral boss&quot;was 
              irritable, and chewed more lozenges than ever. Even then,however, 
              he was not offensive, but one of those people who hurtthemselves 
              by their own irritability more than they hurt other people.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Haven't you done that YET?&quot; he would cry. &quot;Go 
              on, be a monthof Sundays.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Again, and Paul could understand him least then, he was jocularand 
              in high spirits.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm going to bring my little Yorkshire terrier bitch tomorrow,&quot;he 
              said jubilantly to Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What's a Yorkshire terrier?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;DON'T know what a Yorkshire terrier is? DON'T KNOW A YORKSHIRE---&quot;Mr. 
              Pappleworth was aghast.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Is it a little silky one--colours of iron and rusty silver?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;THAT'S it, my lad. She's a gem. She's had five pounds'worth 
              of pups already, and she's worth over seven pounds herself;and she 
              doesn't weigh twenty ounces.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The next day the bitch came. She was a shivering, miserable morsel. 
              Paul did not care for her; she seemed so like a wet rag that wouldnever 
              dry. Then a man called for her, and began to make coarse jokes. 
              But Mr. Pappleworth nodded his head in the direction of the boy,and 
              the talk went on sotto voce.</p>
            <p>　　Mr. Jordan only made one more excursion to watch Paul,and then 
              the only fault he found was seeing the boy lay his penon the counter.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Put your pen in your ear, if you're going to be a clerk. 
              Pen in your ear!&quot; And one day he said to the lad: &quot;Why 
              don't youhold your shoulders straighter? Come down here,&quot; when 
              he took himinto the glass office and fitted him with special braces 
              for keepingthe shoulders square.</p>
            <p>　　But Paul liked the girls best. The men seemed common andrather 
              dull. He liked them all, but they were uninteresting. Polly,the 
              little brisk overseer downstairs, finding Paul eating in the cellar,asked 
              him if she could cook him anything on her little stove. Next day 
              his mother gave him a dish that could be heated up. He took it into 
              the pleasant, clean room to Polly. And very soon itgrew to be an 
              established custom that he should have dinner with her. When he 
              came in at eight in the morning he took his basket to her,and when 
              he came down at one o'clock she had his dinner ready.</p>
            <p>　　He was not very tall, and pale, with thick chestnut hair,irregular 
              features, and a wide, full mouth. She was like a small bird. He 
              often called her a &quot;robinet&quot;. Though naturally rather 
              quiet,he would sit and chatter with her for hours telling her about 
              his home. The girls all liked to hear him talk. They often gathered 
              in a littlecircle while he sat on a bench, and held forth to them, 
              laughing. Some of them regarded him as a curious little creature, 
              so serious,yet so bright and jolly, and always so delicate in his 
              way with them. They all liked him, and he adored them. Polly he 
              felt he belonged to. Then Connie, with her mane of red hair, her 
              face of apple-blossom,her murmuring voice, such a lady in her shabby 
              black frock,appealed to his romantic side.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;When you sit winding,&quot; he said, &quot;it looks as 
              if you werespinning at a spinning-wheel--it looks ever so nice. 
              You remindme of Elaine in the 'Idylls of the King'. I'd draw you 
              if I could.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And she glanced at him blushing shyly. And later on he hada sketch 
              he prized very much: Connie sitting on the stool beforethe wheel, 
              her flowing mane of red hair on her rusty black frock,her red mouth 
              shut and serious, running the scarlet thread offthe hank on to the 
              reel.</p>
            <p>　　With Louie, handsome and brazen, who always seemed to thrusther 
              hip at him, he usually joked.</p>
            <p>　　Emma was rather plain, rather old, and condescending. But to 
              condescend to him made her happy, and he did not mind.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;How do you put needles in?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Go away and don't bother.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But I ought to know how to put needles in.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She ground at her machine all the while steadily.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;There are many things you ought to know,&quot; she replied.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Tell me, then, how to stick needles in the machine.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, the boy, what a nuisance he is! Why, THIS is how youdo 
              it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He watched her attentively. Suddenly a whistle piped. Then Polly 
              appeared, and said in a clear voice:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Mr. Pappleworth wants to know how much longer you're goingto 
              be down here playing with the girls, Paul.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Paul flew upstairs, calling &quot;Good-bye!&quot; and Emma drew 
              herself up.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It wasn't ME who wanted him to play with the machine,&quot;she 
              said.</p>
            <p>　　As a rule, when all the girls came back at two o'clock, heran 
              upstairs to Fanny, the hunchback, in the finishing-off room. Mr. 
              Pappleworth did not appear till twenty to three, and he oftenfound 
              his boy sitting beside Fanny, talking, or drawing, or singingwith 
              the girls.</p>
            <p>　　Often, after a minute's hesitation, Fanny would begin to sing. 
              She had a fine contralto voice. Everybody joined in the chorus,and 
              it went well. Paul was not at all embarrassed, after a while,sitting 
              in the room with the half a dozen work-girls.</p>
            <p>　　At the end of the song Fanny would say:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I know you've been laughing at me.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't be so soft, Fanny!&quot; cried one of the girls.</p>
            <p>　　Once there was mention of Connie's red hair.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Fanny's is better, to my fancy,&quot; said Emma.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You needn't try to make a fool of me,&quot; said Fanny, 
              flushing deeply.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, but she has, Paul; she's got beautiful hair.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's a treat of a colour,&quot; said he. &quot;That coldish 
              colourlike earth, and yet shiny. It's like bog-water.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Goodness me!&quot; exclaimed one girl, laughing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;How I do but get criticised,&quot; said Fanny.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But you should see it down, Paul,&quot; cried Emma earnestly. 
              &quot;It's simply beautiful. Put it down for him, Fanny, if he wantssomething 
              to paint.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Fanny would not, and yet she wanted to.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then I'll take it down myself,&quot; said the lad.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, you can if you like,&quot; said Fanny.</p>
            <p>　　And he carefully took the pins out of the knot, and the rushof 
              hair, of uniform dark brown, slid over the humped back.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What a lovely lot!&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
            <p>　　The girls watched. There was silence. The youth shookthe hair 
              loose from the coil.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's splendid!&quot; he said, smelling its perfume. &quot;I'll 
              betit's worth pounds.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'll leave it you when I die, Paul,&quot; said Fanny, half 
              joking.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You look just like anybody else, sitting drying their hair,&quot;said 
              one of the girls to the long-legged hunchback.</p>
            <p>　　Poor Fanny was morbidly sensitive, always imagining insults. 
              Polly was curt and businesslike. The two departments were for everat 
              war, and Paul was always finding Fanny in tears. Then he wasmade 
              the recipient of all her woes, and he had to plead her casewith 
              Polly.</p>
            <p>　　So the time went along happily enough. The factory had ahomely 
              feel. No one was rushed or driven. Paul always enjoyedit when the 
              work got faster, towards post-time, and all the menunited in labour. 
              He liked to watch his fellow-clerks at work. The man was the work 
              and the work was the man, one thing, for thetime being. It was different 
              with the girls. The real womannever seemed to be there at the task, 
              but as if left out, waiting.</p>
            <p>　　From the train going home at night he used to watch the lightsof 
              the town, sprinkled thick on the hills, fusing together in a blazein 
              the valleys. He felt rich in life and happy. Drawing farther off,there 
              was a patch of lights at Bulwell like myriad petals shakento the 
              ground from the shed stars; and beyond was the red glareof the furnaces, 
              playing like hot breath on the clouds.</p>
            <p>　　He had to walk two and more miles from Keston home,up two long 
              hills, down two short hills. He was often tired,and he counted the 
              lamps climbing the hill above him, how many moreto pass. And from 
              the hilltop, on pitch-dark nights, he lookedround on the villages 
              five or six miles away, that shone like swarmsof glittering living 
              things, almost a heaven against his feet. Marlpool and Heanor scattered 
              the far-off darkness with brilliance. And occasionally the black 
              valley space between was traced,violated by a great train rushing 
              south to London or north to Scotland. The trains roared by like 
              projectiles level on the darkness,fuming and burning, making the 
              valley clang with their passage. They were gone, and the lights 
              of the towns and villages glitteredin silence.</p>
            <p>　　And then he came to the corner at home, which faced theother 
              side of the night. The ash-tree seemed a friend now. His mother 
              rose with gladness as he entered. He put his eightshillings proudly 
              on the table.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It'll help, mother?&quot; he asked wistfully.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;There's precious little left,&quot; she answered, &quot;after 
              yourticket and dinners and such are taken off.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Then he told her the budget of the day. His life-story,like an 
              Arabian Nights, was told night after night to his mother. It was 
              almost as if it were her own life.</p>

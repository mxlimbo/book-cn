            <p>　　ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electricalplant 
              at Minton Pit. He earned very little, but had a good chanceof getting 
              on. But he was wild and restless. He did not drinknor gamble. Yet 
              he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,always through 
              some hot-headed thoughtlessness. Either he wentrabbiting in the 
              woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottinghamall night instead 
              of coming home, or he miscalculated his diveinto the canal at Bestwood, 
              and scored his chest into one massof wounds on the raw stones and 
              tins at the bottom.</p>
            <p>　　He had not been at his work many months when again he didnot 
              come home one night.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you know where Arthur is?&quot; asked Paul at breakfast.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I do not,&quot; replied his mother.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He is a fool,&quot; said Paul. &quot;And if he DID anything 
              Ishouldn't mind. But no, he simply can't come away from a gameof 
              whist, or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink--quiteproprietously--and 
              so can't get home. He's a fool.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know that it would make it any better if he didsomething 
              to make us all ashamed,&quot; said Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, I should respect him more,&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I very much doubt it,&quot; said his mother coldly.</p>
            <p>　　They went on with breakfast.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Are you fearfully fond of him?&quot; Paul asked his mother.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What do you ask that for?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Because they say a woman always like the youngest best.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She may do--but I don't. No, he wearies me.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And you'd actually rather he was good?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Paul was raw and irritable. He also wearied his mother very often. 
              She saw the sunshine going out of him, and she resented it.</p>
            <p>　　As they were finishing breakfast came the postman with a letterfrom 
              Derby. Mrs. Morel screwed up her eyes to look at the address.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Give it here, blind eye!&quot; exclaimed her son, snatching 
              itaway from her.</p>
            <p>　　She started, and almost boxed his ears.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's from your son, Arthur,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What now---!&quot; cried Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;'My dearest Mother,'&quot; Paul read, &quot;'I don't know 
              what mademe such a fool. I want you to come and fetch me back from 
              here. I came with Jack Bredon yesterday, instead of going to work,and 
              enlisted. He said he was sick of wearing the seat of a stool out,and, 
              like the idiot you know I am, I came away with him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;'I have taken the King's shilling, but perhaps if youcame 
              for me they would let me go back with you. I was a foolwhen I did 
              it. I don't want to be in the army. My dear mother,I am nothing 
              but a trouble to you. But if you get me out of this,I promise I 
              will have more sense and consideration. . . .'&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel sat down in her rocking-chair.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, NOW,&quot; she cried, &quot;let him stop!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; said Paul, &quot;let him stop.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　There was silence. The mother sat with her hands foldedin her 
              apron, her face set, thinking.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;If I'm not SICK!&quot; she cried suddenly. &quot;Sick!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Now,&quot; said Paul, beginning to frown, &quot;you're 
              not goingto worry your soul out about this, do you hear.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I suppose I'm to take it as a blessing,&quot; she flashed,turning 
              on her son.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You're not going to mount it up to a tragedy, so there,&quot;he 
              retorted.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;The FOOL!--the young fool!&quot; she cried.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He'll look well in uniform,&quot; said Paul irritatingly.</p>
            <p>　　His mother turned on him like a fury.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, will he!&quot; she cried. &quot;Not in my eyes!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He should get in a cavalry regiment; he'll have the timeof 
              his life, and will look an awful swell.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Swell!--SWELL!--a mighty swell idea indeed!--a common soldier!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well,&quot; said Paul, &quot;what am I but a common clerk?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;A good deal, my boy!&quot; cried his mother, stung.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;At any rate, a MAN, and not a thing in a red coat.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I shouldn't mind being in a red coat--or dark blue, that 
              wouldsuit me better--if they didn't boss me about too much.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　But his mother had ceased to listen.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Just as he was getting on, or might have been getting on,at 
              his job--a young nuisance--here he goes and ruins himself for life. 
              What good will he be, do you think, after THIS?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It may lick him into shape beautifully,&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Lick him into shape!--lick what marrow there WAS out of 
              his bones. A SOLDIER!--a common SOLDIER!--nothing but a body that 
              makes movementswhen it hears a shout! It's a fine thing!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I can't understand why it upsets you,&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, perhaps you can't. But I understand&quot;; and she 
              sat backin her chair, her chin in one hand, holding her elbow with 
              the other,brimmed up with wrath and chagrin.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And shall you go to Derby?&quot; asked Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's no good.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'll see for myself.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And why on earth don't you let him stop. It's just whathe 
              wants.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Of course,&quot; cried the mother, &quot;YOU know what 
              he wants!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She got ready and went by the first train to Derby, where shesaw 
              her son and the sergeant. It was, however, no good.</p>
            <p>　　When Morel was having his dinner in the evening, she said suddenly:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I've had to go to Derby to-day.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The miner turned up his eyes, showing the whites in his black 
              face.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Has ter, lass. What took thee there?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;That Arthur!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh--an' what's agate now?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He's only enlisted.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Morel put down his knife and leaned back in his chair.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nay,&quot; he said, &quot;that he niver 'as!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And is going down to Aldershot tomorrow.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well!&quot; exclaimed the miner. &quot;That's a winder.&quot; 
              He consideredit a moment, said &quot;H'm!&quot; and proceeded with 
              his dinner. Suddenly hisface contracted with wrath. &quot;I hope 
              he may never set foot i'my house again,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;The idea!&quot; cried Mrs. Morel. &quot;Saying such a thing!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I do,&quot; repeated Morel. &quot;A fool as runs away for 
              a soldier,let 'im look after 'issen; I s'll do no more for 'im.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;A fat sight you have done as it is,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　And Morel was almost ashamed to go to his public-housethat evening.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, did you go?&quot; said Paul to his mother when he 
              came home.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I did.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And could you see him?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And what did he say?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He blubbered when I came away.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;H'm!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And so did I, so you needn't 'h'm'!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel fretted after her son. She knew he would notlike the 
              army. He did not. The discipline was intolerable to him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But the doctor,&quot; she said with some pride to Paul, 
              &quot;said hewas perfectly proportioned--almost exactly; all his 
              measurementswere correct. He IS good-looking, you know.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He's awfully nice-looking. But he doesn't fetch the girlslike 
              William, does he?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No; it's a different character. He's a good deal likehis 
              father, irresponsible.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　To console his mother, Paul did not go much to WilleyFarm at 
              this time. And in the autumn exhibition of students'work in the 
              Castle he had two studies, a landscape in water-colourand a still 
              life in oil, both of which had first-prize awards. He was highly 
              excited.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What do you think I've got for my pictures, mother?&quot; 
              he asked,coming home one evening. She saw by his eyes he was glad. 
              Her face flushed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Now, how should I know, my boy!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;A first prize for those glass jars---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;H'm!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And a first prize for that sketch up at Willey Farm.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Both first?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;H'm!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　There was a rosy, bright look about her, though she said nothing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's nice,&quot; he said, &quot;isn't it?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It is.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why don't you praise me up to the skies?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She laughed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I should have the trouble of dragging you down again,&quot;she 
              said.</p>
            <p>　　But she was full of joy, nevertheless. William had broughther 
              his sporting trophies. She kept them still, and she did notforgive 
              his death. Arthur was handsome--at least, a good specimen--and warmand 
              generous, and probably would do well in the end. But Paulwas going 
              to distinguish himself. She had a great belief in him,the more because 
              he was unaware of his own powers. There wasso much to come out of 
              him. Life for her was rich with promise. She was to see herself 
              fulfilled. Not for nothing had beenher struggle.</p>
            <p>　　Several times during the exhibition Mrs. Morel went to theCastle 
              unknown to Paul. She wandered down the long room lookingat the other 
              exhibits. Yes, they were good. But they had not inthem a certain 
              something which she demanded for her satisfaction. Some made her 
              jealous, they were so good. She looked at thema long time trying 
              to find fault with them. Then suddenly shehad a shock that made 
              her heart beat. There hung Paul's picture! She knew it as if it 
              were printed on her heart.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Name--Paul Morel--First Prize.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　It looked so strange, there in public, on the walls of theCastle 
              gallery, where in her lifetime she had seen so many pictures. And 
              she glanced round to see if anyone had noticed her again in frontof 
              the same sketch.</p>
            <p>　　But she felt a proud woman. When she met well-dressed ladiesgoing 
              home to the Park, she thought to herself:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, you look very well--but I wonder if YOUR son has twofirst 
              prizes in the Castle.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And she walked on, as proud a little woman as any in Nottingham. 
              And Paul felt he had done something for her, if only a trifle. All 
              his work was hers.</p>
            <p>　　One day, as he was going up Castle Gate, he met Miriam. He hadseen 
              her on the Sunday, and had not expected to meet her in town. She 
              was walking with a rather striking woman, blonde, with a sullenexpression, 
              and a defiant carriage. It was strange how Miriam,in her bowed, 
              meditative bearing, looked dwarfed beside this womanwith the handsome 
              shoulders. Miriam watched Paul searchingly. His gaze was on the 
              stranger, who ignored him. The girl saw hismasculine spirit rear 
              its head.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Hello!&quot; he said, &quot;you didn't tell me you were 
              coming to town.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; replied Miriam, half apologetically. &quot;I 
              drovein to Cattle Market with father.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He looked at her companion.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I've told you about Mrs. Dawes,&quot; said Miriam huskily;she 
              was nervous. &quot;Clara, do you know Paul?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I think I've seen him before,&quot; replied Mrs. Dawes 
              indifferently,as she shook hands with him. She had scornful grey 
              eyes, a skinlike white honey, and a full mouth, with a slightly 
              lifted upperlip that did not know whether it was raised in scorn 
              of all menor out of eagerness to be kissed, but which believed the 
              former. She carried her head back, as if she had drawn away in contempt,perhaps 
              from men also. She wore a large, dowdy hat of black beaver,and a 
              sort of slightly affected simple dress that made her lookrather 
              sack-like. She was evidently poor, and had not much taste. Miriam 
              usually looked nice.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Where have you seen me?&quot; Paul asked of the woman.</p>
            <p>　　She looked at him as if she would not trouble to answer. Then:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Walking with Louie Travers,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　Louie was one of the &quot;Spiral&quot; girls.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why, do you know her?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　She did not answer. He turned to Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Where are you going?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;To the Castle.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What train are you going home by?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I am driving with father. I wish you could come too. What 
              time are you free?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You know not till eight to-night, damn it!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And directly the two women moved on.</p>
            <p>　　Paul remembered that Clara Dawes was the daughter of an oldfriend 
              of Mrs. Leivers. Miriam had sought her out because shehad once been 
              Spiral overseer at Jordan's, and because her husband,Baxter Dawes, 
              was smith for the factory, making the irons forcripple instruments, 
              and so on. Through her Miriam felt she gotinto direct contact with 
              Jordan's, and could estimate betterPaul's position. But Mrs. Dawes 
              was separated from her husband,and had taken up Women's Rights. 
              She was supposed to be clever. It interested Paul.</p>
            <p>　　Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked. The smith was a manof thirty-one 
              or thirty-two. He came occasionally through Paul'scorner--a big, 
              well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome. There was 
              a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife. He had the same 
              white skin, with a clear, golden tinge. His hairwas of soft brown, 
              his moustache was golden. And he had a similardefiance in his bearing 
              and manner. But then came the difference. His eyes, dark brown and 
              quick-shifting, were dissolute. They protruded very slightly, and 
              his eyelids hung over them in away that was half hate. His mouth, 
              too, was sensual. His wholemanner was of cowed defiance, as if he 
              were ready to knock anybodydown who disapproved of him--perhaps 
              because he really disapprovedof himself.</p>
            <p>　　From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's impersonal,deliberate 
              gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What are yer lookin' at?&quot; he sneered, bullying.</p>
            <p>　　The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behindthe counter 
              and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty,with a kind of 
              rottenness. Again he found the youth with his cool,critical gaze 
              fixed on his face. The smith started round as if hehad been stung.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?&quot; he 
              snarled.</p>
            <p>　　The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why yer---!&quot; shouted Dawes.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Leave him alone,&quot; said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuatingvoice 
              which means, &quot;He's only one of your good little sops who can'thelp 
              it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Since that time the boy used to look at the man every timehe 
              came through with the same curious criticism, glancing awaybefore 
              he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hatedeach other 
              in silence.</p>
            <p>　　Clara Dawes had no children. When she had left her husband thehome 
              had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her mother. Dawes 
              lodged with his sister. In the same house was a sister-in-law, andsomehow 
              Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers, was now Dawes's woman. 
              She was a handsome, insolent hussy, who mocked at the youth, and 
              yetflushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went 
              home.</p>
            <p>　　The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening. 
              She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others,except 
              her father and mother and the young children, had gone out,so the 
              two had the parlour together. It was a long, low, warm room. There 
              were three of Paul's small sketches on the wall, and his photo wason 
              the mantelpiece. On the table and on the high oldrosewood piano 
              were bowls of coloured leaves. He sat in the armchair,she crouched 
              on the hearthrug near his feet. The glow was warmon her handsome, 
              pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?&quot; she asked quietly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She doesn't look very amiable,&quot; he replied.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?&quot; she said,in 
              a deep tone,</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes--in stature. But without a grain of taste. I like herfor 
              some things. IS she disagreeable?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't think so. I think she's dissatisfied.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What with?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well--how would you like to be tied for life to a man like 
              that?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsionsso 
              soon?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ay, why did she!&quot; repeated Miriam bitterly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And I should have thought she had enough fight in herto 
              match him,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam bowed her head.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ay?&quot; she queried satirically. &quot;What makes you 
              think so?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Look at her mouth--made for passion--and the very setbackof 
              her throat---&quot; He threw his head back in Clara's defiant manner.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam bowed a little lower.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of Clara.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And what were the things you liked about her?&quot; she 
              asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know--her skin and the texture of her--and her--I 
              don'tknow--there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her. I appreciateher 
              as an artist, that's all.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange 
              way. It irritated him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You don't really like her, do you?&quot; he asked the girl.</p>
            <p>　　She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I do,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You don't--you can't--not really.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then what?&quot; she asked slowly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Eh, I don't know--perhaps you like her because she's got 
              a grudgeagainst men.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　That was more probably one of his own reasons for likingMrs. 
              Dawes, but this did not occur to him. They were silent. There had 
              come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which wasbecoming 
              habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam. She longed 
              to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it. It seemedthe stamp 
              of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.</p>
            <p>　　There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl. 
              He reached over and pulled out a bunch.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;If you put red berries in your hair,&quot; he said, &quot;why 
              wouldyou look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She laughed with a naked, painful sound.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why can't you laugh?&quot; he said. &quot;You never laugh 
              laughter. You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and 
              then italmost seems to hurt you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute--justfor 
              one minute. I feel as if it would set something free.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But&quot;--and she looked up at him with eyes frightenedand 
              struggling--&quot;I do laugh at you--I DO.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Never! There's always a kind of intensity. When you laughI 
              could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering. Oh, 
              you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Slowly she shook her head despairingly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm sure I don't want to,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm so damned spiritual with YOU always!&quot; he cried.</p>
            <p>　　She remained silent, thinking, &quot;Then why don't you be otherwise.&quot; 
              But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed to tearhim 
              in two.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But, there, it's autumn,&quot; he said, &quot;and everybody 
              feelslike a disembodied spirit then.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　There was still another silence. This peculiar sadnessbetween 
              them thrilled her soul. He seemed so beautiful with hiseyes gone 
              dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You make me so spiritual!&quot; he lamented. &quot;And 
              I don't wantto be spiritual.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and lookedup 
              at him almost challenging. But still her soul was naked in hergreat 
              dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her. If he 
              could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so. 
              But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other 
              way. And she yearned to him.</p>
            <p>　　He gave a brief laugh.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;get that French and we'll do 
              some--some Verlaine.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation. 
              And she rose and got the books. And her rather red, nervous handslooked 
              so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her. But thenbe dared 
              not--or could not. There was something prevented him. His kisses 
              were wrong for her. They continued the reading till teno'clock, 
              when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural and jollyagain 
              with the father and mother. His eyes were dark and shining;there 
              was a kind of fascination about him.</p>
            <p>　　When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the frontwheel 
              punctured.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl,&quot; he said to her. 
              &quot;I shall be late, and then I s'll catch it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned upthe 
              bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowlof water 
              and stood close to him, watching. She loved to seehis hands doing 
              things. He was slim and vigorous, with a kindof easiness even in 
              his most hasty movements. And busy at his workhe seemed to forget 
              her. She loved him absorbedly. She wantedto run her hands down his 
              sides. She always wanted to embrace him,so long as he did not want 
              her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;There!&quot; he said, rising suddenly. &quot;Now, could 
              you have doneit quicker?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No!&quot; she laughed.</p>
            <p>　　He straightened himself. His back was towards her. She puther 
              two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You are so FINE!&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a waveof 
              flame by her hands. She did not seem to realise HIM in all this. 
              He might have been an object. She never realised the male he was.</p>
            <p>　　He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barnfloor 
              to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;That's all right!&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Did you have them mended?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But why didn't you?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;The back one goes on a bit.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But it's not safe.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I can use my toe.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I wish you'd had them mended,&quot; she murmured.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't worry--come to tea tomorrow, with Edgar.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Shall we?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do--about four. I'll come to meet you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Very well.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She was pleased. They went across the dark yard to the gate. 
              Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of thekitchen 
              the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow. It looked very 
              cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite blackin front.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Till tomorrow,&quot; he said, jumping on his bicycle.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You'll take care, won't you?&quot; she pleaded.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　His voice already came out of the darkness. She stood a momentwatching 
              the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground. She 
              turned very slowly indoors. Orion was wheeling up over the wood,his 
              dog twinkling after him, half smothered. For the rest the worldwas 
              full of darkness, and silent, save for the breathing of cattlein 
              their stalls. She prayed earnestly for his safety that night. When 
              he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering if he had gothome 
              safely.</p>
            <p>　　He dropped down the hills on his bicycle. The roads were greasy,so 
              he had to let it go. He felt a pleasure as the machine plungedover 
              the second, steeper drop in the hill. &quot;Here goes!&quot; he 
              said. It was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the 
              bottom,and because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners 
              asleep. His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it. 
              Recklessness is almost a man's revenge on his woman. He feels he 
              is not valued, so he will risk destroying himself todeprive her 
              altogether.</p>

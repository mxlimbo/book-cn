            <p>　　HE was gradually making it possible to earn a livelihood byhis 
              art. Liberty's had taken several of his painted designson various 
              stuffs, and he could sell designs for embroideries,for altar-cloths, 
              and similar things, in one or two places. It was not very much he 
              made at present, but he might extend it. He had also made friends 
              with the designer for a pottery firm,and was gaining some knowledge 
              of his new acquaintance's art. The applied arts interested him very 
              much. At the same timehe laboured slowly at his pictures. He loved 
              to paint large figures, full of light, but not merely made up of 
              lights and cast shadows, like the impressionists; rather definite 
              figures that had a certain luminous quality, like some of Michael 
              Angelo's people. And these he fitted into a landscape, in what he 
              thought true proportion. He worked a great deal from memory, using 
              everybody he knew. He believed firmly in his work, that it was good 
              and valuable. In spite of fits of depression, shrinking, everything, 
              he believedin his work.</p>
            <p>　　He was twenty-four when he said his first confident thingto his 
              mother.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Mother,&quot; he said, &quot;I s'll make a painter that 
              they'll attend to.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She sniffed in her quaint fashion. It was like a half-pleasedshrug 
              of the shoulders.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Very well, my boy, we'll see,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You shall see, my pigeon! You see if you're not swankyone 
              of these days!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm quite content, my boy,&quot; she smiled.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But you'll have to alter. Look at you with Minnie!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Minnie was the small servant, a girl of fourteen.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And what about Minnie?&quot; asked Mrs. Morel, with dignity.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I heard her this morning: 'Eh, Mrs. Morel! I was goingto 
              do that,' when you went out in the rain for some coal,&quot; he 
              said. &quot;That looks a lot like your being able to manage servants!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, it was only the child's niceness,&quot; said Mrs. 
              Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And you apologising to her: 'You can't do two things at 
              once,can you?'&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She WAS busy washing up,&quot; replied Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And what did she say? 'It could easy have waited a bit. 
              Now look how your feet paddle!'&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes--brazen young baggage!&quot; said Mrs. Morel, smiling.</p>
            <p>　　He looked at his mother, laughing. She was quite warm androsy 
              again with love of him. It seemed as if all the sunshinewere on 
              her for a moment. He continued his work gladly. She seemed so well 
              when she was happy that he forgot her grey hair.</p>
            <p>　　And that year she went with him to the Isle of Wight fora holiday. 
              It was too exciting for them both, and too beautiful. Mrs. Morel 
              was full of joy and wonder. But he would have herwalk with him more 
              than she was able. She had a bad fainting bout. So grey her face 
              was, so blue her mouth! It was agony to him. He felt as if someone 
              were pushing a knife in his chest. Then shewas better again, and 
              he forgot. But the anxiety remained inside him,like a wound that 
              did not close.</p>
            <p>　　After leaving Miriam he went almost straight to Clara. On the 
              Monday following the day of the rupture he went down tothe work-room. 
              She looked up at him and smiled. They had grownvery intimate unawares. 
              She saw a new brightness about him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, Queen of Sheba!&quot; he said, laughing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But why?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I think it suits you. You've got a new frock on.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She flushed, asking:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And what of it?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Suits you--awfully! I could design you a dress.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;How would it be?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He stood in front of her, his eyes glittering as he expounded. 
              He kept her eyes fixed with his. Then suddenly he took hold of her. 
              She half-started back. He drew the stuff of her blouse tighter,smoothed 
              it over her breast.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;More SO!&quot; he explained.</p>
            <p>　　But they were both of them flaming with blushes, and immediatelyhe 
              ran away. He had touched her. His whole body was quiveringwith the 
              sensation.</p>
            <p>　　There was already a sort of secret understanding between them. 
              The next evening he went to the cinematograph with her for a fewminutes 
              before train-time. As they sat, he saw her hand lyingnear him. For 
              some moments he dared not touch it. The picturesdanced and dithered. 
              Then he took her hand in his. It was largeand firm; it filled his 
              grasp. He held it fast. She neithermoved nor made any sign. When 
              they came out his train was due. He hesitated.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Good-night,&quot; she said. He darted away across the road.</p>
            <p>　　The next day he came again, talking to her. She was rathersuperior 
              with him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Shall we go a walk on Monday?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　She turned her face aside.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Shall you tell Miriam?&quot; she replied sarcastically.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I have broken off with her,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;When?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Last Sunday.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You quarrelled?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No! I had made up my mind. I told her quite definitely 
              Ishould consider myself free.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Clara did not answer, and he returned to his work. She wasso 
              quiet and so superb!</p>
            <p>　　On the Saturday evening he asked her to come and drink coffeewith 
              him in a restaurant, meeting him after work was over. She came,looking 
              very reserved and very distant. He had three-quartersof an hour 
              to train-time.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;We will walk a little while,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　She agreed, and they went past the Castle into the Park. He was 
              afraid of her. She walked moodily at his side, with a kindof resentful, 
              reluctant, angry walk. He was afraid to take her hand.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Which way shall we go?&quot; he asked as they walked in 
              darkness.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't mind.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then we'll go up the steps.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He suddenly turned round. They had passed the Park steps. She 
              stood still in resentment at his suddenly abandoning her. He looked 
              for her. She stood aloof. He caught her suddenly inhis arms, held 
              her strained for a moment, kissed her. Then he lether go.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Come along,&quot; he said, penitent.</p>
            <p>　　She followed him. He took her hand and kissed herfinger-tips. 
              They went in silence. When they came to the light,he let go her 
              hand. Neither spoke till they reached the station. Then they looked 
              each other in the eyes.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Good-night,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　And he went for his train. His body acted mechanically. People 
              talked to him. He heard faint echoes answering them. He was in a 
              delirium. He felt that he would go mad if Monday didnot come at 
              once. On Monday he would see her again. All himselfwas pitched there, 
              ahead. Sunday intervened. He could not bear it. He could not see 
              her till Monday. And Sunday intervened--hourafter hour of tension. 
              He wanted to beat his head against thedoor of the carriage. But 
              he sat still. He drank some whiskyon the way home, but it only made 
              it worse. His mother must notbe upset, that was all. He dissembled, 
              and got quickly to bed. There he sat, dressed, with his chin on 
              his knees, staring out ofthe window at the far hill, with its few 
              lights. He neither thought nor slept,but sat perfectly still, staring. 
              And when at last he was so cold thathe came to himself, he found 
              his watch had stopped at half-past two. It was after three o'clock. 
              He was exhausted, but still there wasthe torment of knowing it was 
              only Sunday morning. He went to bedand slept. Then he cycled all 
              day long, till he was fagged out. And he scarcely knew where he 
              had been. But the day after was Monday. He slept till four o'clock. 
              Then he lay and thought. He was comingnearer to himself--he could 
              see himself, real, somewhere in front. She would go a walk with 
              him in the afternoon. Afternoon! It seemedyears ahead.</p>
            <p>　　Slowly the hours crawled. His father got up; he heard himpottering 
              about. Then the miner set off to the pit, his heavyboots scraping 
              the yard. Cocks were still crowing. A cartwent down the road. His 
              mother got up. She knocked the fire. Presently she called him softly. 
              He answered as if he were asleep. This shell of himself did well.</p>
            <p>　　He was walking to the station--another mile! The trainwas near 
              Nottingham. Would it stop before the tunnels? But it did not matter; 
              it would get there before dinner-time. Hewas at Jordan's. She would 
              come in half an hour. At any rate,she would be near. He had done 
              the letters. She would be there. Perhaps she had not come. He ran 
              downstairs. Ah! he saw herthrough the glass door. Her shoulders 
              stooping a little to herwork made him feel he could not go forward; 
              he could not stand. He went in. He was pale, nervous, awkward, and 
              quite cold. Would she misunderstand him? He could not write his 
              real selfwith this shell.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And this afternoon,&quot; he struggled to say. &quot;You 
              will come?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I think so,&quot; she replied, murmuring.</p>
            <p>　　He stood before her, unable to say a word. She hid herface from 
              him. Again came over him the feeling that he wouldlose consciousness. 
              He set his teeth and went upstairs. He haddone everything correctly 
              yet, and he would do so. All the morningthings seemed a long way 
              off, as they do to a man under chloroform. He himself seemed under 
              a tight band of constraint. Then there was hisother self, in the 
              distance, doing things, entering stuff in a ledger,and he watched 
              that far-off him carefully to see he made no mistake.</p>
            <p>　　But the ache and strain of it could not go on much longer. He 
              worked incessantly. Still it was only twelve o'clock. As if hehad 
              nailed his clothing against the desk, he stood there and worked,forcing 
              every stroke out of himself. It was a quarter to one;he could clear 
              away. Then he ran downstairs.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You will meet me at the Fountain at two o'clock,&quot; 
              he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I can't be there till half-past.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes!&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　She saw his dark, mad eyes.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I will try at a quarter past.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And he had to be content. He went and got some dinner. All the 
              time he was still under chloroform, and every minutewas stretched 
              out indefinitely. He walked miles of streets. Then he thought he 
              would be late at the meeting-place. He was atthe Fountain at five 
              past two. The torture of the next quarterof an hour was refined 
              beyond expression. It was the anguishof combining the living self 
              with the shell. Then he saw her. She came! And he was there.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You are late,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Only five minutes,&quot; she answered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'd never have done it to you,&quot; he laughed.</p>
            <p>　　She was in a dark blue costume. He looked at her beautiful figure.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You want some flowers,&quot; he said, going to the nearest 
              florist's.</p>
            <p>　　She followed him in silence. He bought her a bunch of scarlet,brick-red 
              carnations. She put them in her coat, flushing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;That's a fine colour!&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'd rather have had something softer,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　He laughed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you feel like a blot of vermilion walking down the street?&quot;he 
              said.</p>
            <p>　　She hung her head, afraid of the people they met. He looked sideways 
              at her as they walked. There was a wonderfulclose down on her face 
              near the ear that he wanted to touch. And a certain heaviness, the 
              heaviness of a very full ear ofcorn that dips slightly in the wind, 
              that there was about her,made his brain spin. He seemed to be spinning 
              down the street,everything going round.</p>
            <p>　　As they sat in the tramcar, she leaned her heavy shoulderagainst 
              him, and he took her hand. He felt himself coming roundfrom the 
              anaesthetic, beginning to breathe. Her ear, half-hidden amongher 
              blonde hair, was near to him. The temptation to kiss it wasalmost 
              too great. But there were other people on top of the car. It still 
              remained to him to kiss it. After all, he was not himself,he was 
              some attribute of hers, like the sunshine that fell on her.</p>
            <p>　　He looked quickly away. It had been raining. The big bluffof 
              the Castle rock was streaked with rain, as it reared abovethe flat 
              of the town. They crossed the wide, black space of theMidland Railway, 
              and passed the cattle enclosure that stood out white. Then they 
              ran down sordid Wilford Road.</p>
            <p>　　She rocked slightly to the tram's motion, and as she leanedagainst 
              him, rocked upon him. He was a vigorous, slender man,with exhaustless 
              energy. His face was rough, with rough-hewn features,like the common 
              people's; but his eyes under the deep brows wereso full of life 
              that they fascinated her. They seemed to dance,and yet they were 
              still trembling on the finest balance of laughter. His mouth the 
              same was just going to spring into a laugh of triumph,yet did not. 
              There was a sharp suspense about him. She bit herlip moodily. His 
              hand was hard clenched over hers.</p>
            <p>　　They paid their two halfpennies at the turnstile and crossedthe 
              bridge. The Trent was very full. It swept silent and insidiousunder 
              the bridge, travelling in a soft body. There had been a greatdeal 
              of rain. On the river levels were flat gleams of flood water. The 
              sky was grey, with glisten of silver here and there. In Wilfordchurchyard 
              the dahlias were sodden with rain--wet black-crimson balls. No one 
              was on the path that went along the green river meadow,along the 
              elm-tree colonnade.</p>
            <p>　　There was the faintest haze over the silvery-dark waterand the 
              green meadow-bank, and the elm-trees that were spangledwith gold. 
              The river slid by in a body, utterly silent and swift,intertwining 
              among itself like some subtle, complex creature. Clara walked moodily 
              beside him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why,&quot; she asked at length, in rather a jarring tone, 
              &quot;did youleave Miriam?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He frowned.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Because I WANTED to leave her,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Because I didn't want to go on with her. And I didn't wantto 
              marry.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She was silent for a moment. They picked their way down the muddy 
              path. Drops of water fell from the elm-trees.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You didn't want to marry Miriam, or you didn't want to 
              marryat all?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Both,&quot; he answered--&quot;both!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They had to manoeuvre to get to the stile, because of the poolsof 
              water.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And what did she say?&quot; Clara asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Miriam? She said I was a baby of four, and that I alwaysHAD 
              battled her off.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Clara pondered over this for a time.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But you have really been going with her for some time?&quot;she 
              asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And now you don't want any more of her?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No. I know it's no good.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She pondered again.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't you think you've treated her rather badly?&quot; 
              she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; I ought to have dropped it years back. But it wouldhave 
              been no good going on. Two wrongs don't make a right.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;How old ARE you?&quot; Clara asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Twenty-five.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And I am thirty,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I know you are.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I shall be thirty-one--or AM I thirty-one?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I neither know nor care. What does it matter!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They were at the entrance to the Grove. The wet, red track,already 
              sticky with fallen leaves, went up the steep bank betweenthe grass. 
              On either side stood the elm-trees like pillars alonga great aisle, 
              arching over and making high up a roof from which thedead leaves 
              fell. All was empty and silent and wet. She stood ontop of the stile, 
              and he held both her hands. Laughing, she lookeddown into his eyes. 
              Then she leaped. Her breast came against his;he held her, and covered 
              her face with kisses.</p>
            <p>　　They went on up the slippery, steep red path. Presently shereleased 
              his hand and put it round her waist.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You press the vein in my arm, holding it so tightly,&quot;she 
              said.</p>
            <p>　　They walked along. His finger-tips felt the rocking of her breast. 
              All was silent and deserted. On the left the red wet plough-landshowed 
              through the doorways between the elm-boles andtheir branches. On 
              the right, looking down, they could see the tree-topsof elms growing 
              far beneath them, hear occasionally the gurgle ofthe river. Sometimes 
              there below they caught glimpses of the full,soft-sliding Trent, 
              and of water-meadows dotted with small cattle.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It has scarcely altered since little Kirke White used to 
              come,&quot;he said.</p>
            <p>　　But he was watching her throat below the ear, where the flush 
              wasfusing into the honey-white, and her mouth that pouted disconsolate. 
              She stirred against him as she walked, and his body was likea taut 
              string.</p>
            <p>　　Halfway up the big colonnade of elms, where the Grove rosehighest 
              above the river, their forward movement faltered to an end. He led 
              her across to the grass, under the trees at the edge of the path. 
              The cliff of red earth sloped swiftly down, through trees and bushes,to 
              the river that glimmered and was dark between the foliage. The far-below 
              water-meadows were very green. He and she stood leaningagainst one 
              another, silent, afraid, their bodies touching all along. There 
              came a quick gurgle from the river below.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why,&quot; he asked at length, &quot;did you hate Baxter 
              Dawes?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She turned to him with a splendid movement. Her mouth wasoffered 
              him, and her throat; her eyes were half-shut; her breastwas tilted 
              as if it asked for him. He flashed with a small laugh,shut his eyes, 
              and met her in a long, whole kiss. Her mouth fusedwith his; their 
              bodies were sealed and annealed. It was some minutesbefore they 
              withdrew. They were standing beside the public path.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Will you go down to the river?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　She looked at him, leaving herself in his hands. He wentover 
              the brim of the declivity and began to climb down.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It is slippery,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Never mind,&quot; she replied.</p>
            <p>　　The red clay went down almost sheer. He slid, went from onetuft 
              of grass to the next, hanging on to the bushes, making for alittle 
              platform at the foot of a tree. There he waited for her,laughing 
              with excitement. Her shoes were clogged with red earth. It was hard 
              for her. He frowned. At last he caught her hand,and she stood beside 
              him. The cliff rose above them and fell awaybelow. Her colour was 
              up, her eyes flashed. He looked at the bigdrop below them.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's risky,&quot; he said; &quot;or messy, at any rate. 
              Shall wego back?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Not for my sake,&quot; she said quickly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;All right. You see, I can't help you; I should only hinder. 
              Give me that little parcel and your gloves. Your poor shoes!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They stood perched on the face of the declivity, under the trees.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, I'll go again,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　Away he went, slipping, staggering, sliding to the next tree,into 
              which he fell with a slam that nearly shook the breath out of him. 
              She came after cautiously, hanging on to the twigs and grasses. 
              So they descended, stage by stage, to the river's brink. There,to 
              his disgust, the flood had eaten away the path, and the reddecline 
              ran straight into the water. He dug in his heels and broughthimself 
              up violently. The string of the parcel broke with a snap;the brown 
              parcel bounded down, leaped into the water, and sailedsmoothly away. 
              He hung on to his tree.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, I'll be damned!&quot; he cried crossly. Then he laughed. 
              She was coming perilously down.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Mind!&quot; he warned her. He stood with his back to the 
              tree, waiting. &quot;Come now,&quot; he called, opening his arms.</p>
            <p>　　She let herself run. He caught her, and together they stoodwatching 
              the dark water scoop at the raw edge of the bank. The parcel had 
              sailed out of sight.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It doesn't matter,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　He held her close and kissed her. There was only roomfor their 
              four feet.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's a swindle!&quot; he said. &quot;But there's a rut 
              where a manhas been, so if we go on I guess we shall find the path 
              again.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The river slid and twined its great volume. On the other bankcattle 
              were feeding on the desolate flats. The cliff rose highabove Paul 
              and Clara on their right hand. They stood againstthe tree in the 
              watery silence.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Let us try going forward,&quot; he said; and they struggledin 
              the red clay along the groove a man's nailed boots had made. They 
              were hot and flushed. Their barkled shoes hung heavy ontheir steps. 
              At last they found the broken path. It was litteredwith rubble from 
              the water, but at any rate it was easier. They cleaned their boots 
              with twigs. His heart was beating thickand fast.</p>
            <p>　　Suddenly, coming on to the little level, he saw two figuresof 
              men standing silent at the water's edge. His heart leaped. They 
              were fishing. He turned and put his hand up warningly to Clara. 
              She hesitated, buttoned her coat. The two went on together.</p>
            <p>　　The fishermen turned curiously to watch the two intruderson their 
              privacy and solitude. They had had a fire, but it wasnearly out. 
              All kept perfectly still. The men turned again totheir fishing, 
              stood over the grey glinting river like statues. Clara went with 
              bowed head, flushing; he was laughing to himself. Directly they 
              passed out of sight behind the willows.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Now they ought to be drowned,&quot; said Paul softly.</p>
            <p>　　Clara did not answer. They toiled forward along a tiny pathon 
              the river's lip. Suddenly it vanished. The bank was sheer redsolid 
              clay in front of them, sloping straight into the river. He stood 
              and cursed beneath his breath, setting his teeth.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's impossible!&quot; said Clara.</p>
            <p>　　He stood erect, looking round. Just ahead were two isletsin the 
              stream, covered with osiers. But they were unattainable. The cliff 
              came down like a sloping wall from far above their heads. Behind, 
              not far back, were the fishermen. Across the river thedistant cattle 
              fed silently in the desolate afternoon. He cursedagain deeply under 
              his breath. He gazed up the great steep bank. Was there no hope 
              but to scale back to the public path?</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Stop a minute,&quot; he said, and, digging his heels sidewaysinto 
              the steep bank of red clay, he began nimbly to mount. He looked 
              across at every tree-foot. At last he found what he wanted. Two 
              beech-trees side by side on the hill held a little level on theupper 
              face between their roots. It was littered with damp leaves,but it 
              would do. The fishermen were perhaps sufficiently out of sight. 
              He threw down his rainproof and waved to her to come.</p>
            <p>　　She toiled to his side. Arriving there, she looked at himheavily, 
              dumbly, and laid her head on his shoulder. He held her fastas he 
              looked round. They were safe enough from all but the small,lonely 
              cows over the river. He sunk his mouth on her throat,where he felt 
              her heavy pulse beat under his lips. Everything wasperfectly still. 
              There was nothing in the afternoon but themselves.</p>
            <p>　　When she arose, he, looking on the ground all the time,saw suddenly 
              sprinkled on the black wet beech-roots many scarletcarnation petals, 
              like splashed drops of blood; and red, smallsplashes fell from her 
              bosom, streaming down her dress to her feet.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Your flowers are smashed,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　She looked at him heavily as she put back her hair. Suddenly 
              he put his finger-tips on her cheek.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why dost look so heavy?&quot; he reproached her.</p>
            <p>　　She smiled sadly, as if she felt alone in herself. He caressedher 
              cheek with his fingers, and kissed her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nay!&quot; he said. &quot;Never thee bother!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She gripped his fingers tight, and laughed shakily. Then she 
              dropped her hand. He put the hair back from her brows,stroking her 
              temples, kissing them lightly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But tha shouldna worrit!&quot; he said softly, pleading.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, I don't worry!&quot; she laughed tenderly and resigned.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yea, tha does! Dunna thee worrit,&quot; he implored, caressing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No!&quot; she consoled him, kissing him.</p>
            <p>　　They had a stiff climb to get to the top again. It took thema 
              quarter of an hour. When he got on to the level grass, he threwoff 
              his cap, wiped the sweat from his forehead, and sighed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Now we're back at the ordinary level,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　She sat down, panting, on the tussocky grass. Her cheekswere 
              flushed pink. He kissed her, and she gave way to joy.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And now I'll clean thy boots and make thee fit for respectable 
              folk,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　He kneeled at her feet, worked away with a stick and tuftsof 
              grass. She put her fingers in his hair, drew his head to her,and 
              kissed it.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What am I supposed to be doing,&quot; he said, looking 
              at her laughing;&quot;cleaning shoes or dibbling with love? Answer 
              me that!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Just whichever I please,&quot; she replied.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm your boot-boy for the time being, and nothing else!&quot; 
              But they remained looking into each other's eyes and laughing. Then 
              they kissed with little nibbling kisses.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;T-t-t-t!&quot; he went with his tongue, like his mother. 
              &quot;I tell you, nothing gets done when there's a woman about.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And he returned to his boot-cleaning, singing softly. She touched 
              his thick hair, and he kissed her fingers. He workedaway at her 
              shoes. At last they were quite presentable.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;There you are, you see!&quot; he said. &quot;Aren't I a 
              great hand atrestoring you to respectability? Stand up! There, you 
              look as irreproachable as Britannia herself!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He cleaned his own boots a little, washed his hands in a puddle,and 
              sang. They went on into Clifton village. He was madly in lovewith 
              her; every movement she made, every crease in her garments,sent 
              a hot flash through him and seemed adorable.</p>
            <p>　　The old lady at whose house they had tea was roused into gaietyby 
              them.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I could wish you'd had something of a better day,&quot; 
              she said,hovering round.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nay!&quot; he laughed. &quot;We've been saying how nice 
              it is.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The old lady looked at him curiously. There was a peculiarglow 
              and charm about him. His eyes were dark and laughing. He rubbed 
              his moustache with a glad movement.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Have you been saying SO!&quot; she exclaimed, a light rousingin 
              her old eyes.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Truly!&quot; he laughed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then I'm sure the day's good enough,&quot; said the old 
              lady.</p>
            <p>　　She fussed about, and did not want to leave them.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know whether you'd like some radishes as well,&quot;she 
              said to Clara; &quot;but I've got some in the garden--AND a cucumber.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Clara flushed. She looked very handsome.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I should like some radishes,&quot; she answered.</p>
            <p>　　And the old lady pottered off gleefully.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;If she knew!&quot; said Clara quietly to him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, she doesn't know; and it shows we're nice in ourselves,at 
              any rate. You look quite enough to satisfy an archangel, and I'msure 
              I feel harmless--so--if it makes you look nice, and makes folkhappy 
              when they have us, and makes us happy--why, we're not cheatingthem 
              out of much!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They went on with the meal. When they were going away,the old 
              lady came timidly with three tiny dahlias in full blow,neat as bees, 
              and speckled scarlet and white. She stood before Clara,pleased with 
              herself, saying:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know whether---&quot; and holding the flowers forwardin 
              her old hand.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, how pretty!&quot; cried Clara, accepting the flowers.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Shall she have them all?&quot; asked Paul reproachfully 
              of theold woman.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, she shall have them all,&quot; she replied, beaming 
              with joy. &quot;You have got enough for your share.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ah, but I shall ask her to give me one!&quot; he teased.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then she does as she pleases,&quot; said the old lady, 
              smiling. And she bobbed a little curtsey of delight.</p>
            <p>　　Clara was rather quiet and uncomfortable. As they walked along,he 
              said:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You don't feel criminal, do you?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She looked at him with startled grey eyes.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Criminal!&quot; she said. &quot;No.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But you seem to feel you have done a wrong?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;I only think, 'If they knew!'&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;If they knew, they'd cease to understand. As it is, they 
              dounderstand, and they like it. What do they matter? Here, with 
              onlythe trees and me, you don't feel not the least bit wrong, do 
              you?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He took her by the arm, held her facing him, holding her eyeswith 
              his. Something fretted him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Not sinners, are we?&quot; he said, with an uneasy little 
              frown.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; she replied.</p>
            <p>　　He kissed her, laughing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You like your little bit of guiltiness, I believe,&quot; 
              he said. &quot;I believe Eve enjoyed it, when she went cowering 
              out of Paradise.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　But there was a certain glow and quietness about her that madehim 
              glad. When he was alone in the railway-carriage, he foundhimself 
              tumultuously happy, and the people exceedingly nice,and the night 
              lovely, and everything good.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel was sitting reading when he got home. Her healthwas 
              not good now, and there had come that ivory pallor into her facewhich 
              he never noticed, and which afterwards he never forgot. She did 
              not mention her own ill-health to him. After all, she thought,it 
              was not much.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You are late!&quot; she said, looking at him.</p>
            <p>　　His eyes were shining; his face seemed to glow. He smiledto her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; I've been down Clifton Grove with Clara.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　His mother looked at him again.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But won't people talk?&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why? They know she's a suffragette, and so on. And whatif 
              they do talk!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Of course, there may be nothing wrong in it,&quot; said 
              his mother. &quot;But you know what folks are, and if once she gets 
              talked about---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, I can't help it. Their jaw isn't so almighty important,after 
              all.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I think you ought to consider HER.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;So I DO! What can people say?--that we take a walk together. 
              I believe you're jealous.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You know I should be GLAD if she weren't a married woman.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, my dear, she lives separate from her husband, and 
              talkson platforms; so she's already singled out from the sheep, 
              and, as faras I can see, hasn't much to lose. No; her life's nothing 
              to her,so what's the worth of nothing? She goes with me--it becomes 
              something. Then she must pay--we both must pay! Folk are so frightened 
              of paying;they'd rather starve and die.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Very well, my son. We'll see how it will end.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Very well, my mother. I'll abide by the end.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;We'll see!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And she's--she's AWFULLY nice, mother; she is really! You 
              don't know!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;That's not the same as marrying her.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's perhaps better.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　There was silence for a while. He wantedto ask his mother something, 
              but was afraid.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Should you like to know her?&quot; He hesitated.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mrs. Morel coolly. &quot;I should like 
              to knowwhat she's like.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But she's nice, mother, she is! And not a bit common!&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>　　&quot;I never suggested she was.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But you seem to think she's--not as good as--- She's better 
              thanninety-nine folk out of a hundred, I tell you! She's BETTER, 
              she is! She's fair, she's honest, she's straight! There isn't anythingunderhand 
              or superior about her. Don't be mean about her!&quot;</p>

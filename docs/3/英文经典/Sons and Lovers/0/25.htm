            <p>　　WITH the spring came again the old madness and battle. Now heknew 
              he would have to go to Miriam. But what was his reluctance? He told 
              himself it was only a sort of overstrong virginity in herand him 
              which neither could break through. He might have married her;but 
              his circumstances at home made it difficult, and, moreover, he didnot 
              want to marry. Marriage was for life, and because they had becomeclose 
              companions, he and she, he did not see that it should inevitablyfollow 
              they should be man and wife. He did not feel that he wantedmarriage 
              with Miriam. He wished he did. He would have given hishead to have 
              felt a joyous desire to marry her and to have her. Then why couldn't 
              he bring it off? There was some obstacle;and what was the obstacle? 
              It lay in the physical bondage. He shrank from the physical contact. 
              But why? With her he felt boundup inside himself. He could not go 
              out to her. Something struggledin him, but he could not get to her. 
              Why? She loved him. Clara said she even wanted him; then why couldn't 
              he go to her,make love to her, kiss her? Why, when she put her arm 
              in his,timidly, as they walked, did he feel he would burst forth 
              in brutalityand recoil? He owed himself to her; he wanted to belong 
              to her. Perhaps the recoil and the shrinking from her was love in 
              its firstfierce modesty. He had no aversion for her. No, it was 
              the opposite;it was a strong desire battling with a still stronger 
              shynessand virginity. It seemed as if virginity were a positive 
              force,which fought and won in both of them. And with her he felt 
              itso hard to overcome; yet he was nearest to her, and with her alonecould 
              he deliberately break through. And he owed himself to her.Then, 
              if they could get things right, they could marry; but he would not 
              marry unless he could feel strong in the joy of it--never. He could 
              not have faced his mother. It seemed to him thatto sacrifice himself 
              in a marriage he did not want would bedegrading, and would undo 
              all his life, make it a nullity. He would try what he COULD do.</p>
            <p>　　And he had a great tenderness for Miriam. Always, she was sad,dreaming 
              her religion; and he was nearly a religion to her. He couldnot bear 
              to fail her. It would all come right if they tried.</p>
            <p>　　He looked round. A good many of the nicest men he knew werelike 
              himself, bound in by their own virginity, which they could notbreak 
              out of. They were so sensitive to their women that they wouldgo 
              without them for ever rather than do them a hurt, an injustice. 
              Being the sons of mothers whose husbands had blundered ratherbrutally 
              through their feminine sanctities, they were themselvestoo diffident 
              and shy. They could easier deny themselves than incurany reproach 
              from a woman; for a woman was like their mother, and theywere full 
              of the sense of their mother. They preferred themselvesto suffer 
              the misery of celibacy, rather than risk the other person.</p>
            <p>　　He went back to her. Something in her, when he looked at her,brought 
              the tears almost to his eyes. One day he stood behind heras she 
              sang. Annie was playing a song on the piano. As Miriam sangher mouth 
              seemed hopeless. She sang like a nun singing to heaven. It reminded 
              him so much of the mouth and eyes of one who singsbeside a Botticelli 
              Madonna, so spiritual. Again, hot as steel,came up the pain in him. 
              Why must he ask her for the other thing? Why was there his blood 
              battling with her? If only he could have beenalways gentle, tender 
              with her, breathing with her the atmosphereof reverie and religious 
              dreams, he would give his right hand. It was not fair to hurt her. 
              There seemed an eternal maidenhoodabout her; and when he thought 
              of her mother, he saw the greatbrown eyes of a maiden who was nearly 
              scared and shocked out of hervirgin maidenhood, but not quite, in 
              spite of her seven children. They had been born almost leaving her 
              out of count, not of her,but upon her. So she could never let them 
              go, because she never hadpossessed them.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel saw him going again frequently to Miriam,and was astonished. 
              He said nothing to his mother. He did not explainnor excuse himself. 
              If he came home late, and she reproached him,he frowned and turned 
              on her in an overbearing way:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I shall come home when I like,&quot; he said; &quot;I am 
              old enough.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Must she keep you till this time?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It is I who stay,&quot; he answered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And she lets you? But very well,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　And she went to bed, leaving the door unlocked for him;but she 
              lay listening until he came, often long after. It was a great bitterness 
              to her that he had gone back to Miriam. She recognised, however, 
              the uselessness of any further interference. He went to Willey Farm 
              as a man now, not as a youth. She hadno right over him. There was 
              a coldness between him and her. He hardly told her anything. Discarded, 
              she waited on him, cooked forhim still, and loved to slave for him; 
              but her face closed againlike a mask. There was nothing for her 
              to do now but the housework;for all the rest he had gone to Miriam. 
              She could not forgive him. Miriam killed the joy and the warmth 
              in him. He had been such ajolly lad, and full of the warmest affection; 
              now he grew colder,more and more irritable and gloomy. It reminded 
              her of William;but Paul was worse. He did things with more intensity, 
              and morerealisation of what he was about. His mother knew how he 
              wassuffering for want of a woman, and she saw him going to Miriam. 
              If he had made up his mind, nothing on earth would alter him. Mrs. 
              Morel was tired. She began to give up at last; she had finished. 
              She was in the way.</p>
            <p>　　He went on determinedly. He realised more or less what hismother 
              felt. It only hardened his soul. He made himself calloustowards 
              her; but it was like being callous to his own health. It undermined 
              him quickly; yet he persisted.</p>
            <p>　　He lay back in the rocking-chair at Willey Farm one evening. 
              He had been talking to Miriam for some weeks, but had not come tothe 
              point. Now he said suddenly:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I am twenty-four, almost.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She had been brooding. She looked up at him suddenly in surprise.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes. What makes you say it?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　There was something in the charged atmosphere that she dreaded.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Sir Thomas More says one can marry at twenty-four.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She laughed quaintly, saying:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Does it need Sir Thomas More's sanction?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No; but one ought to marry about then.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ay,&quot; she answered broodingly; and she waited.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I can't marry you,&quot; he continued slowly, &quot;not 
              now, because we'veno money, and they depend on me at home.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She sat half-guessing what was coming.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But I want to marry now---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You want to marry?&quot; she repeated.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;A woman--you know what I mean.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She was silent.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Now, at last, I must,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ay,&quot; she answered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And you love me?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She laughed bitterly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why are you ashamed of it,&quot; he answered. &quot;You 
              wouldn'tbe ashamed before your God, why are you before people?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nay,&quot; she answered deeply, &quot;I am not ashamed.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You are,&quot; he replied bitterly; &quot;and it's my fault. 
              But youknow I can't help being--as I am--don't you?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I know you can't help it,&quot; she replied.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I love you an awful lot--then there is something short.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Where?&quot; she answered, looking at him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, in me! It is I who ought to be ashamed--likea spiritual 
              cripple. And I am ashamed. It is misery. Why is it?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know,&quot; replied Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And I don't know,&quot; he repeated. &quot;Don't you think 
              we havebeen too fierce in our what they call purity? Don't you thinkthat 
              to be so much afraid and averse is a sort of dirtiness?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She looked at him with startled dark eyes.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You recoiled away from anything of the sort, and I tookthe 
              motion from you, and recoiled also, perhaps worse.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　There was silence in the room for some time.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, &quot;it is so.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;There is between us,&quot; he said, &quot;all these years 
              of intimacy. I feel naked enough before you. Do you understand?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I think so,&quot; she answered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And you love me?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She laughed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't be bitter,&quot; he pleaded.</p>
            <p>　　She looked at him and was sorry for him; his eyes were darkwith 
              torture. She was sorry for him; it was worse for him to have thisdeflated 
              love than for herself, who could never be properly mated. He was 
              restless, for ever urging forward and trying to find a way out. 
              He might do as he liked, and have what he liked of her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nay,&quot; she said softly, &quot;I am not bitter.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She felt she could bear anything for him; she would suffer for 
              him. She put her hand on his knee as he leaned forward in his chair. 
              He took it and kissed it; but it hurt to do so. He felt he wasputting 
              himself aside. He sat there sacrificed to her purity,which felt 
              more like nullity. How could he kiss her hand passionately,when 
              it would drive her away, and leave nothing but pain? Yet slowlyhe 
              drew her to him and kissed her.</p>
            <p>　　They knew each other too well to pretend anything. As she kissed 
              him, she watched his eyes; they were staring acrossthe room, with 
              a peculiar dark blaze in them that fascinated her. He was perfectly 
              still. She could feel his heart throbbing heavilyin his breast.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What are you thinking about?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　The blaze in his eyes shuddered, became uncertain.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I was thinking, all the while, I love you. I have been 
              obstinate.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She sank her head on his breast.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;That's all,&quot; he said, and his voice seemed sure, and 
              his mouthwas kissing her throat.</p>
            <p>　　Then she raised her head and looked into his eyes with herfull 
              gaze of love. The blaze struggled, seemed to try to get awayfrom 
              her, and then was quenched. He turned his head quickly aside. It 
              was a moment of anguish.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Kiss me,&quot; she whispered.</p>
            <p>　　He shut his eyes, and kissed her, and his arms folded hercloser 
              and closer.</p>
            <p>　　When she walked home with him over the fields, he said:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I am glad I came back to you. I feel so simple with you--asif 
              there was nothing to hide. We will be happy?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; she murmured, and the tears came to her eyes.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Some sort of perversity in our souls,&quot; he said, &quot;makes 
              usnot want, get away from, the very thing we want. We have to fightagainst 
              that.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, and she felt stunned.</p>
            <p>　　As she stood under the drooping-thorn tree, in the darkness bythe 
              roadside, he kissed her, and his fingers wandered over her face. 
              In the darkness, where he could not see her but only feel her,his 
              passion flooded him. He clasped her very close.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Sometime you will have me?&quot; he murmured, hiding his 
              faceon her shoulder. It was so difficult.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Not now,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　His hopes and his heart sunk. A dreariness came over him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　His clasp of her slackened.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I love to feel your arm THERE!&quot; she said, pressing 
              his armagainst her back, where it went round her waist. &quot;It 
              rests me so.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He tightened the pressure of his arm upon the small of herback 
              to rest her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;We belong to each other,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then why shouldn't we belong to each other altogether?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But---&quot; she faltered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I know it's a lot to ask,&quot; he said; &quot;but there's 
              not much riskfor you really--not in the Gretchen way. You can trust 
              me there?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, I can trust you.&quot; The answer came quick and strong. 
              &quot;It's not that--it's not that at all--but---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She hid her face in his neck with a little cry of misery.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know!&quot; she cried.</p>
            <p>　　She seemed slightly hysterical, but with a sort of horror. His 
              heart died in him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You don't think it ugly?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, not now. You have TAUGHT me it isn't.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You are afraid?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She calmed herself hastily.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, I am only afraid,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　He kissed her tenderly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Never mind,&quot; he said. &quot;You should please yourself.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Suddenly she gripped his arms round her, and clenched herbody 
              stiff.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You SHALL have me,&quot; she said, through her shut teeth.</p>
            <p>　　His heart beat up again like fire. He folded her close, and hismouth 
              was on her throat. She could not bear it. She drew away. He disengaged 
              her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Won't you be late?&quot; she asked gently.</p>
            <p>　　He sighed, scarcely hearing what she said. She waited,wishing 
              he would go. At last he kissed her quickly and climbedthe fence. 
              Looking round he saw the pale blotch of her face downin the darkness 
              under the hanging tree. There was no more of herbut this pale blotch.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Good-bye!&quot; she called softly. She had no body, only 
              avoice and a dim face. He turned away and ran down the road,his 
              fists clenched; and when he came to the wall over the lakehe leaned 
              there, almost stunned, looking up the black water.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam plunged home over the meadows. She was not afraidof people, 
              what they might say; but she dreaded the issuewith him. Yes, she 
              would let him have her if he insisted;and then, when she thought 
              of it afterwards, her heart went down. He would be disappointed, 
              he would find no satisfaction, and then hewould go away. Yet he 
              was so insistent; and over this, which didnot seem so all-important 
              to her, was their love to break down. After all, he was only like 
              other men, seeking his satisfaction. Oh, but there was something 
              more in him, something deeper! She couldtrust to it, in spite of 
              all desires. He said that possession wasa great moment in life. 
              All strong emotions concentrated there. Perhaps it was so. There 
              was something divine in it; then shewould submit, religiously, to 
              the sacrifice. He should have her. And at the thought her whole 
              body clenched itself involuntarily,hard, as if against something; 
              but Life forced her through thisgate of suffering, too, and she 
              would submit. At any rate,it would give him what he wanted, which 
              was her deepest wish. She brooded and brooded and brooded herself 
              towards accepting him.</p>
            <p>　　He courted her now like a lover. Often, when he grew hot,she 
              put his face from her, held it between her hands, and looked inhis 
              eyes. He could not meet her gaze. Her dark eyes, full of love,earnest 
              and searching, made him turn away. Not for an instantwould she let 
              him forget. Back again he had to torture himselfinto a sense of 
              his responsibility and hers. Never any relaxing, never any leaving 
              himself to the great hunger and impersonalityof passion; he must 
              be brought back to a deliberate, reflective creature. As if from 
              a swoon of passion she caged him back to the littleness,the personal 
              relationship. He could not bear it. &quot;Leave mealone--leave me 
              alone!&quot; he wanted to cry; but she wanted him tolook at her 
              with eyes full of love. His eyes, full of the dark,impersonal fire 
              of desire, did not belong to her.</p>
            <p>　　There was a great crop of cherries at the farm. The trees atthe 
              back of the house, very large and tall, hung thick with scarletand 
              crimson drops, under the dark leaves. Paul and Edgar were gatheringthe 
              fruit one evening. It had been a hot day, and now the cloudswere 
              rolling in the sky, dark and warm. Paul combed high in the tree,above 
              the scarlet roofs of the buildings. The wind, moaning steadily,made 
              the whole tree rock with a subtle, thrilling motion that stirredthe 
              blood. The young man, perched insecurely in the slender branches,rocked 
              till he felt slightly drunk, reached down the boughs,where the scarlet 
              beady cherries hung thick underneath, and toreoff handful after 
              handful of the sleek, cool-fleshed fruit. Cherries touched his ears 
              and his neck as he stretched forward,their chill finger-tips sending 
              a flash down his blood. All shadesof red, from a golden vermilion 
              to a rich crimson, glowed and methis eyes under a darkness of leaves.</p>
            <p>　　The sun, going down, suddenly caught the broken clouds. Immense 
              piles of gold flared out in the south-east, heaped in soft,glowing 
              yellow right up the sky. The world, till now dusk and grey,reflected 
              the gold glow, astonished. Everywhere the trees,and the grass, and 
              the far-off water, seemed roused from the twilightand shining.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam came out wondering.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh!&quot; Paul heard her mellow voice call, &quot;isn't 
              it wonderful?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He looked down. There was a faint gold glimmer on her face,that 
              looked very soft, turned up to him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;How high you are!&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　Beside her, on the rhubarb leaves, were four dead birds,thieves 
              that had been shot. Paul saw some cherry stones hangingquite bleached, 
              like skeletons, picked clear of flesh. He lookeddown again to Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Clouds are on fire,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Beautiful!&quot; she cried.</p>
            <p>　　She seemed so small, so soft, so tender, down there. He threwa 
              handful of cherries at her. She was startled and frightened. He 
              laughed with a low, chuckling sound, and pelted her. She ranfor 
              shelter, picking up some cherries. Two fine red pairs she hungover 
              her ears; then she looked up again.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Haven't you got enough?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nearly. It is like being on a ship up here.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And how long will you stay?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;While the sunset lasts.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She went to the fence and sat there, watching the gold clouds 
              fallto pieces, and go in immense, rose-coloured ruin towards the 
              darkness. Gold flamed to scarlet, like pain in its intense brightness. 
              Then the scarlet sank to rose, and rose to crimson, and quicklythe 
              passion went out of the sky. All the world was dark grey. Paul scrambled 
              quickly down with his basket, tearing his shirt-sleeveas he did 
              so.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;They are lovely,&quot; said Miriam, fingering the cherries.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I've torn my sleeve,&quot; he answered.</p>
            <p>　　She took the three-cornered rip, saying:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I shall have to mend it.&quot; It was near the shoulder. 
              She put her fingers through the tear. &quot;How warm!&quot; she 
              said.</p>
            <p>　　He laughed. There was a new, strange note in his voice,one that 
              made her pant.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Shall we stay out?&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Won't it rain?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, let us walk a little way.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They went down the fields and into the thick plantationof trees 
              and pines.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Shall we go in among the trees?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you want to?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　It was very dark among the firs, and the sharp spines prickedher 
              face. She was afraid. Paul was silent and strange.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I like the darkness,&quot; he said. &quot;I wish it were 
              thicker--good,thick darkness.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He seemed to be almost unaware of her as a person: she wasonly 
              to him then a woman. She was afraid.</p>
            <p>　　He stood against a pine-tree trunk and took her in his arms. 
              She relinquished herself to him, but it was a sacrifice in which 
              shefelt something of horror. This thick-voiced, oblivious man wasa 
              stranger to her.</p>
            <p>　　Later it began to rain. The pine-trees smelled very strong. Paul 
              lay with his head on the ground, on the dead pine needles,listening 
              to the sharp hiss of the rain--a steady, keen noise. His heart was 
              down, very heavy. Now he realised that she hadnot been with him 
              all the time, that her soul had stood apart,in a sort of horror. 
              He was physically at rest, but no more. Very dreary at heart, very 
              sad, and very tender, his fingers wanderedover her face pitifully. 
              Now again she loved him deeply. He was tenderand beautiful.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;The rain!&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes--is it coming on you?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She put her hands over him, on his hair, on his shoulders, to 
              feelif the raindrops fell on him. She loved him dearly. He, as he 
              laywith his face on the dead pine-leaves, felt extraordinarily quiet. 
              He did not mind if the raindrops came on him: he would have lainand 
              got wet through: he felt as if nothing mattered, as if hisliving 
              were smeared away into the beyond, near and quite lovable. This 
              strange, gentle reaching-out to death was new to him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;We must go,&quot; said Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; he answered, but did not move.</p>
            <p>　　To him now, life seemed a shadow, day a white shadow; night,and 
              death, and stillness, and inaction, this seemed like BEING. To be 
              alive, to be urgent and insistent--that was NOT-TO-BE. Thehighest 
              of all was to melt out into the darkness and sway there,identified 
              with the great Being.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;The rain is coming in on us,&quot; said Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　He rose, and assisted her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It is a pity,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;To have to go. I feel so still.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Still!&quot; she repeated.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Stiller than I have ever been in my life.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He was walking with his hand in hers. She pressed his fingers,feeling 
              a slight fear. Now he seemed beyond her; she had a fearlest she 
              should lose him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;The fir-trees are like presences on the darkness: each 
              oneonly a presence.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She was afraid, and said nothing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;A sort of hush: the whole night wondering and asleep: I 
              suppose that's what we do in death--sleep in wonder.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She had been afraid before of the brute in him: now of the mystic. 
              She trod beside him in silence. The rain fell with a heavy &quot;Hush!&quot;on 
              the trees. At last they gained the cartshed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Let us stay here awhile,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　There was a sound of rain everywhere, smothering everything.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I feel so strange and still,&quot; he said; &quot;along 
              with everything.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ay,&quot; she answered patiently.</p>
            <p>　　He seemed again unaware of her, though he held her hand close.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;To be rid of our individuality, which is our will, which 
              isour effort--to live effortless, a kind of curious sleep--that 
              isvery beautiful, I think; that is our after-life--our immortality.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes--and very beautiful to have.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You don't usually say that.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　In a while they went indoors. Everybody looked at them curiously. 
              He still kept the quiet, heavy look in his eyes, the stillnessin 
              his voice. Instinctively, they all left him alone.</p>
            <p>　　About this time Miriam's grandmother, who lived in a tiny cottagein 
              Woodlinton, fell ill, and the girl was sent to keep house. It was 
              a beautiful little place. The cottage had a big garden in front,with 
              red brick walls, against which the plum trees were nailed. At the 
              back another garden was separated from the fields by a tallold hedge. 
              It was very pretty. Miriam had not much to do,so she found time 
              for her beloved reading, and for writing littleintrospective pieces 
              which interested her.</p>
            <p>　　At the holiday-time her grandmother, being better, was drivento 
              Derby to stay with her daughter for a day or two. She was acrotchety 
              old lady, and might return the second day or the third;so Miriam 
              stayed alone in the cottage, which also pleased her.</p>
            <p>　　Paul used often to cycle over, and they had as a rulepeaceful 
              and happy times. He did not embarrass her much; but thenon the Monday 
              of the holiday he was to spend a whole day with her.</p>
            <p>　　It was perfect weather. He left his mother, telling her where 
              hewas going. She would be alone all the day. It cast a shadow over 
              him;but he had three days that were all his own, when he wasgoing 
              to do as he liked. It was sweet to rushthrough the morning lanes 
              on his bicycle.</p>
            <p>　　He got to the cottage at about eleven o'clock. Miriam was busypreparing 
              dinner. She looked so perfectly in keeping with thelittle kitchen, 
              ruddy and busy. He kissed her and sat down to watch. The room was 
              small and cosy. The sofa was covered all over with asort of linen 
              in squares of red and pale blue, old, much washed,but pretty. There 
              was a stuffed owl in a case over a corner cupboard. The sunlight 
              came through the leaves of the scented geraniumsin the window. She 
              was cooking a chicken in his honour. It was their cottage for the 
              day, and they were man and wife. He beat the eggs for her and peeled 
              the potatoes. He thought shegave a feeling of home almost like his 
              mother; and no one couldlook more beautiful, with her tumbled curls, 
              when she was flushedfrom the fire.</p>
            <p>　　The dinner was a great success. Like a young husband, he carved. 
              They talked all the time with unflagging zest. Then he wipedthe 
              dishes she had washed, and they went out down the fields. There 
              was a bright little brook that ran into a bog at the footof a very 
              steep bank. Here they wandered, picking still a fewmarsh-marigolds 
              and many big blue forget-me-nots. Then she sat onthe bank with her 
              hands full of flowers, mostly golden water-blobs.As she put her 
              face down into the marigolds, it was all overcastwith a yellow shine.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Your face is bright,&quot; he said, &quot;like a transfiguration.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She looked at him, questioning. He laughed pleadingly to her,laying 
              his hands on hers. Then he kissed her fingers, then her face.</p>
            <p>　　The world was all steeped in sunshine, and quite still,yet not 
              asleep, but quivering with a kind of expectancy.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I have never seen anything more beautiful than this,&quot; 
              he said. He held her hand fast all the time.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And the water singing to itself as it runs--do you love 
              it?&quot; She looked at him full of love. His eyes were very dark,very 
              bright.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't you think it's a great day?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　She murmured her assent. She WAS happy, and he saw it.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And our day--just between us,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　They lingered a little while. Then they stood up uponthe sweet 
              thyme, and he looked down at her simply.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Will you come?&quot; he asked.</p>

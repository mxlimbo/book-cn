            <p align="center"><b>THE YOUNG LIFE OF PAUL （I）</b></p>
            <p>　　PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small. 
              His fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey. 
              He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and 
              witha full, dropping underlip.</p>
            <p>　　As a rule he seemed old for his years. He was so consciousof 
              what other people felt, particularly his mother. When shefretted 
              he understood, and could have no peace. His soul seemedalways attentive 
              to her.</p>
            <p>　　As he grew older he became stronger. William was too farremoved 
              from him to accept him as a companion. So the smaller boybelonged 
              at first almost entirely to Annie. She was a tomboy and a&quot;flybie-skybie&quot;, 
              as her mother called her. But she was intenselyfond of her second 
              brother. So Paul was towed round at the heelsof Annie, sharing her 
              game. She raced wildly at lerky with the otheryoung wild-cats of 
              the Bottoms. And always Paul flew beside her,living her share of 
              the game, having as yet no part of his own. He was quiet and not 
              noticeable. But his sister adored him. He always seemed to care 
              for things if she wanted him to.</p>
            <p>　　She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though notso 
              fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it withan antimacassar, 
              to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paulmust practise jumping 
              off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash intothe face of the hidden 
              doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail,and sat down to weep 
              a dirge. Paul remained quite still.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell 
              itwas there,&quot; he repeated over and over. So long as Annie wept 
              forthe doll he sat helpless with misery. Her grief wore itself out. 
              She forgave her brother--he was so much upset. But a day or twoafterwards 
              she was shocked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella,&quot; he said. &quot;Let's 
              burn her.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She was horrified, yet rather fascinated. She wanted to seewhat 
              the boy would do. He made an altar of bricks, pulled some ofthe 
              shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments intothe 
              hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thingalight. 
              He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt offthe 
              broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the flame. 
              So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence. At 
              the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the armsand 
              legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella,&quot; he said. 
              &quot;An' I'mglad there's nothing left of her.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing. 
              He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.</p>
            <p>　　All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarlyagainst 
              their father, along with their mother. Morel continuedto bully and 
              to drink. He had periods, months at a time, when hemade the whole 
              life of the family a misery. Paul never forgotcoming home from the 
              Band of Hope one Monday evening and findinghis mother with her eye 
              swollen and discoloured, his father standingon the hearthrug, feet 
              astride, his head down, and William,just home from work, glaring 
              at his father. There was a silenceas the young children entered, 
              but none of the elders looked round.</p>
            <p>　　William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched. He 
              waited until the children were silent, watching with children'srage 
              and hate; then he said:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You coward, you daren't do it when I was in.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　But Morel's blood was up. He swung round on his son. William 
              was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Dossn't I?&quot; he shouted. &quot;Dossn't I? Ha'e much 
              more o'thy chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about 
              thee. Ay, an' I sholl that, dost see?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,almost 
              beast-like fashion. William was white with rage.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Will yer?&quot; he said, quiet and intense. &quot;It 'ud 
              be thelast time, though.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fistto 
              strike. William put his fists ready. A light came into hisblue eyes, 
              almost like a laugh. He watched his father. Another word,and the 
              men would have begun to fight. Paul hoped they would. The three 
              children sat pale on the sofa.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Stop it, both of you,&quot; cried Mrs. Morel in a hard 
              voice. &quot;We've had enough for ONE night. And YOU,&quot;she said, 
              turning on to her husband, &quot;look at your children!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Morel glanced at the sofa.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!&quot; he 
              sneered. &quot;Why, what have I done to the children, I should like 
              to know? But they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own 
              tricks andnasty ways--you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She refused to answer him. No one spoke. After a while hethrew 
              his boots under the table and went to bed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why didn't you let me have a go at him?&quot; said William,when 
              his father was upstairs. &quot;I could easily have beaten him.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;A nice thing--your own father,&quot; she replied.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;'FATHER!'&quot; repeated William. &quot;Call HIM MY father!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, he is--and so---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;The idea!&quot; she cried. &quot;It hasn't come to THAT 
              yet.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;it's come to worse. Look at yourself. 
              WHY didn't you let me give it him?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it,&quot;she 
              cried quickly.</p>
            <p>　　And the children went to bed, miserably.</p>
            <p>　　When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottomsto 
              a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley,which 
              spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before 
              it. In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind,sweeping 
              from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,and the tree 
              shrieked again. Morel liked it.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's music,&quot; he said. &quot;It sends me to sleep.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it. To Paul it becamealmost 
              a demoniacal noise. The winter of their first yearin the new house 
              their father was very bad. The children playedin the street, on 
              the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eighto'clock. Then they 
              went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below. Having such a great 
              space in front of the house gave the childrena feeling of night, 
              of vastness, and of terror. This terror camein from the shrieking 
              of the tree and the anguish of the home discord. Often Paul would 
              wake up, after he had been asleep a long time,aware of thuds downstairs. 
              Instantly he was wide awake. Then heheard the booming shouts of 
              his father, come home nearly drunk, then thesharp replies of his 
              mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist onthe table, and 
              the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher. And then 
              the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieksand cries from 
              the great, wind-swept ash-tree. The childrenlay silent in suspense, 
              waiting for a lull in the wind to hearwhat their father was doing. 
              He might hit their mother again. There was a feeling of horror, 
              a kind of bristling in the darkness,and a sense of blood. They lay 
              with their hearts in the grip of anintense anguish. The wind came 
              through the tree fiercer and fiercer. All the chords of the great 
              harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked. And then came the horror of 
              the sudden silence, silence everywhere,outside and downstairs. What 
              was it? Was it a silence of blood? What had he done?</p>
            <p>　　The children lay and breathed the darkness. And then, at last,they 
              heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairsin his 
              stockinged feet. Still they listened. Then at last,if the wind allowed, 
              they heard the water of the tap drumming intothe kettle, which their 
              mother was filling for morning, and theycould go to sleep in peace.</p>
            <p>　　So they were happy in the morning--happy, very happy playing,dancing 
              at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst ofthe darkness. 
              But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,one darkness 
              in their eyes, which showed all their lives.</p>
            <p>　　Paul hated his father. As a boy he had a fervent private religion.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Make him stop drinking,&quot; he prayed every night. &quot;Lord, 
              let myfather die,&quot; he prayed very often. &quot;Let him not 
              be killed at pit,&quot;he prayed when, after tea, the father did 
              not come home from work.</p>
            <p>　　That was another time when the family suffered intensely. The 
              children came from school and had their teas. On the hobthe big 
              black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven,ready 
              for Morel's dinner. He was expected at five o'clock. But formonths 
              he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.</p>
            <p>　　In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early,Mrs. 
              Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light atallow 
              candle to save the gas. The children finished theirbread-and-butter, 
              or dripping, and were ready to go out to play. But if Morel had 
              not come they faltered. The sense of his sittingin all his pit-dirt, 
              drinking, after a long day's work, not cominghome and eating and 
              washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach,made Mrs. 
              Morel unable to bear herself. From her the feeling wastransmitted 
              to the other children. She never suffered alone any more: the children 
              suffered with her.</p>
            <p>　　Paul went out to play with the rest. Down in the great troughof 
              twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were. A 
              few last colliers straggled up the dim field path. The lamplightercame 
              along. No more colliers came. Darkness shut down over the valley;work 
              was done. It was night.</p>
            <p>　　Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen. The one candle stillburned 
              on the table, the big fire glowed red. Mrs. Morel sat alone. On 
              the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waitingon the 
              table. All the room was full of the sense of waiting,waiting for 
              the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless,some mile away 
              from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk. Paul stood 
              in the doorway.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Has my dad come?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You can see he hasn't,&quot; said Mrs. Morel, cross with 
              thefutility of the question.</p>
            <p>　　Then the boy dawdled about near his mother. They sharedthe same 
              anxiety. Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strainedthe potatoes.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;They're ruined and black,&quot; she said; &quot;but what 
              do I care?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Not many words were spoken. Paul almost hated his motherfor suffering 
              because his father did not come home from work.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What do you bother yourself for?&quot; he said. &quot;If 
              he wantsto stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Let him!&quot; flashed Mrs. Morel. &quot;You may well say 
              'let him'.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is 
              on aquick way to ruining himself and his home. The children were 
              yet young,and depended on the breadwinner. William gave her the 
              sense of relief,providing her at last with someone to turn to if 
              Morel failed. Butthe tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting 
              evenings was the same.</p>
            <p>　　The minutes ticked away. At six o'clock still the cloth layon 
              the table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same senseof 
              anxiety and expectation in the room. The boy could not stand itany 
              longer. He could not go out and play. So he ran in to Mrs. Inger,next 
              door but one, for her to talk to him. She had no children. Her husband 
              was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.So, when she 
              saw the lad at the door, she called:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Come in, Paul.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The two sat talking for some time, when suddenlythe boy rose, 
              saying:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand 
              doing.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell hisfriend 
              what ailed him. Then he ran indoors.</p>
            <p>　　Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;This is a nice time to come home,&quot; said Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?&quot; he 
              shouted.</p>
            <p>　　And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous. 
              He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when hehad 
              done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay hisarms 
              on the table. Then he went to sleep.</p>
            <p>　　Paul hated his father so. The collier's small, mean head,with 
              its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms,and 
              the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin,paltry 
              brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and wearinessand nasty 
              temper. If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,the man 
              looked up and shouted:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if 
              thadoesna stop that clatter! Dost hear?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion,usually 
              at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.</p>
            <p>　　He was shut out from all family affairs. No one told him anything. 
              The children, alone with their mother, told her all about theday's 
              happenings, everything. Nothing had really taken place inthem until 
              it was told to their mother. But as soon as the fathercame in, everything 
              stopped. He was like the scotch in the smooth,happy machinery of 
              the home. And he was always aware of this fallof silence on his 
              entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome. But now it was gone 
              too far to alter.</p>
            <p>　　He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him,but they 
              could not. Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You ought to tell your father.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper. Everybody 
              was highly jubilant.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in,&quot;said 
              Mrs. Morel. &quot;You know how be carries on and says he's nevertold 
              anything.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;All right,&quot; said Paul. But he would almost rather 
              haveforfeited the prize than have to tell his father.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I've won a prize in a competition, dad,&quot; he said. 
              Morel turned round to him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, nothing--about famous women.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's a book.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, indeed! &quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;About birds.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Hm--hm! &quot;</p>
            <p>　　And that was all. Conversation was impossible between thefather 
              and any other member of the family. He was an outsider. He had denied 
              the God in him.</p>
            <p>　　The only times when he entered again into the life of his own 
              peoplewas when he worked, and was happy at work. Sometimes, in the 
              evening,he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pit-bottle. 
              Thenhe always wanted several attendants, and the children enjoyed 
              it. They united with him in the work, in the actual doing of something,when 
              he was his real self again.</p>
            <p>　　He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was in 
              agood humour, always sang. He had whole periods, months, almost 
              years,of friction and nasty temper. Then sometimes he was jolly 
              again. It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron intothe 
              scullery, crying:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Out of my road--out of my road!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,and 
              made the shape he wanted. Or he sat absorbed for a moment,soldering. 
              Then the children watched with joy as the metal sanksuddenly molten, 
              and was shoved about against the nose of thesoldering-iron, while 
              the room was full of a scent of burnt resinand hot tin, and Morel 
              was silent and intent for a minute. He alwayssang when he mended 
              boots because of the jolly sound of hammering. And he was rather 
              happy when he sat putting great patches on hismoleskin pit trousers, 
              which he would often do, considering themtoo dirty, and the stuff 
              too hard, for his wife to mend.</p>
            <p>　　But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses. 
              Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic. 
              These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like astalk 
              of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths ofabout six 
              inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottomof each piece. 
              He always had a beautifully sharp knife that couldcut a straw clean 
              without hurting it. Then he set in the middleof the table a heap 
              of gunpowder, a little pile of black grainsupon the white-scrubbed 
              board. He made and trimmed the strawswhile Paul and Annie rifled 
              and plugged them. Paul loved to seethe black grains trickle down 
              a crack in his palm into the mouthof the straw, peppering jollily 
              downwards till the straw was full. Then he bunged up the mouth with 
              a bit of soap--which he got onhis thumb-nail from a pat in a saucer--and 
              the straw was finished.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Look, dad!&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;That's right, my beauty,&quot; replied Morel, who was peculiarlylavish 
              of endearments to his second son. Paul popped the fuse intothe powder-tin, 
              ready for the morning, when Morel would take itto the pit, and use 
              it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.</p>
            <p>　　Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would leanon the arm 
              of Morel's chair and say:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Tell us about down pit, daddy.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　This Morel loved to do.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, there's one little 'oss--we call 'im Taffy,&quot; 
              he would begin. &quot;An' he's a fawce 'un!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Morel had a warm way of telling a story. He made one feelTaffy's 
              cunning.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He's a brown 'un,&quot; he would answer, &quot;an' not 
              very high. Well, he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 
              'ear 'im sneeze.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein'some 
              snuff?'</p>
            <p>　　&quot;An' 'e sneezes again. Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 
              'eadon yer, that cadin'.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;'What's want, Taff?' yo' say.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And what does he?&quot; Arthur always asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybodyloved 
              it.</p>
            <p>　　Or sometimes it was a new tale.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my 
              coaton at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And did you kill it?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I did, for they're a nuisance. The place is fair snied 
              wi' 'em.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;An' what do they live on?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;The corn as the 'osses drops--an' they'll get in your pocket 
              an'eat your snap, if you'll let 'em--no matter where yo' hing your 
              coat--the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　These happy evenings could not take place unless Morelhad some 
              job to do. And then he always went to bed very early,often before 
              the children. There was nothing remaining for himto stay up for, 
              when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmedthe headlines of 
              the newspaper.</p>
            <p>　　And the children felt secure when their father was in bed. They 
              lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lightswent 
              suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swungin 
              the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to takethe 
              nine o'clock shift. They listened to the voices of the men,imagined 
              them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes theywent to the 
              window and watched the three or four lamps growingtinier and tinier, 
              swaying down the fields in the darkness. Then it was a joy to rush 
              back to bed and cuddle closely inthe warmth.</p>
            <p>　　Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis. The others 
              were all quite strong; so this was another reasonfor his mother's 
              difference in feeling for him. One day he camehome at dinner-time 
              feeling ill. But it was not a family to makeany fuss.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What's the matter with YOU?&quot; his mother asked sharply.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nothing,&quot; he replied.</p>
            <p>　　But he ate no dinner.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school,&quot; 
              she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;That's why.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintzcushions 
              the children loved. Then he fell into a kind of doze. That afternoon 
              Mrs. Morel was ironing. She listened to the small,restless noise 
              the boy made in his throat as she worked. Again rosein her heart 
              the old, almost weary feeling towards him. She hadnever expected 
              him to live. And yet he had a great vitality in his young body. 
              Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died. 
              She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.</p>
            <p>　　He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware ofthe clatter 
              of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud,thud on the ironing-board. 
              Once roused, he opened his eyes to seehis mother standing on the 
              hearthrug with the hot iron nearher cheek, listening, as it were, 
              to the heat. Her still face,with the mouth closed tight from suffering 
              and disillusion andself-denial, and her nose the smallest bit on 
              one side, and her blueeyes so young, quick, and warm, made his heart 
              contract with love. When she was quiet, so, she looked brave and 
              rich with life, but asif she had been done out of her rights. It 
              hurt the boy keenly,this feeling about her that she had never had 
              her life's fulfilment: and his own incapability to make up to her 
              hurt him with a sense ofimpotence, yet made him patiently dogged 
              inside. It was his childish aim.</p>
            <p>　　She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded,raced 
              off the dark, glossy surface. Then, kneeling, she rubbedthe iron 
              on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously. She waswarm in the 
              ruddy firelight. Paul loved the way she crouchedand put her head 
              on one side. Her movements were light and quick. It was always a 
              pleasure to watch her. Nothing she ever did,no movement she ever 
              made, could have been found fault with byher children. The room 
              was warm and full of the scent of hot linen. Later on the clergyman 
              came and talked softly with her.</p>
            <p>　　Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis. He did notmind 
              much. What happened happened, and it was no good kickingagainst 
              the pricks. He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock,when the 
              light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames springover 
              the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadowswaving 
              and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.</p>
            <p>　　On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom. 
              He was always very gentle if anyone were ill. But he disturbed theatmosphere 
              for the boy.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Are ter asleep, my darlin'?&quot; Morel asked softly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No; is my mother comin'?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes. Do you want anything?&quot; 
              Morel rarely &quot;thee'd&quot; his son.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't want nothing. But how long will she be?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Not long, my duckie.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a momentor 
              two. He felt his son did not want him. Then he went to the topof 
              the stairs and said to his wife:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She says you're to go to sleep,&quot; the father repeated 
              gentlyto Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, I want HER to come,&quot; insisted the boy.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He says he can't go off till you come,&quot; Morel called 
              downstairs.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Eh, dear! I shan't be long. And do stop shouting downstairs. 
              There's the other children---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire. He 
              loved a fire dearly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She says she won't be long,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　He loitered about indefinitely. The boy began to get feverishwith 
              irritation. His father's presence seemed to aggravate allhis sick 
              impatience. At last Morel, after having stood lookingat his son 
              awhile, said softly:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Good-night, my darling.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Good-night,&quot; Paul replied, turning round in relief 
              to be alone.</p>
            <p>　　Paul loved to sleep with his mother. Sleep is still most perfect,in 
              spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved. The warmth, 
              the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort fromthe touch 
              of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the bodyand soul 
              completely in its healing. Paul lay against her and slept,and got 
              better; whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later oninto a profound 
              sleep that seemed to give her faith.</p>
            <p>　　In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffyhorses 
              feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hayon the 
              trodden yellow snow; watch the miners troop home--small,black figures 
              trailing slowly in gangs across the white field. Then the night 
              came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.</p>
            <p>　　In convalescence everything was wonderful. The snowflakes,suddenly 
              arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like swallows,then 
              were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down the glass. The 
              snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,like pigeons dashing 
              by. Away across the valley the little blacktrain crawled doubtfully 
              over the great whiteness.</p>
            <p>　　While they were so poor, the children were delighted if theycould 
              do anything to help economically. Annie and Paul and Arthurwent 
              out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,hunting 
              through the wet grass, from which the larks were rising,for the 
              white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly inthe green. 
              And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy: there 
              was the joy of finding something, the joy of accepting somethingstraight 
              from the hand of Nature, and the joy of contributing tothe family 
              exchequer.</p>
            <p>　　But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,was 
              the blackberries. Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings onthe Saturdays; 
              also she liked blackberries. So Paul and Arthur scouredthe coppices 
              and woods and old quarries, so long as a blackberrywas to be found, 
              every week-end going on their search. In thatregion of mining villages 
              blackberries became a comparative rarity. But Paul hunted far and 
              wide. He loved being out in the country,among the bushes. But he 
              also could not bear to go home to hismother empty. That, he felt, 
              would disappoint her, and he wouldhave died rather.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Good gracious!&quot; she would exclaim as the lads came 
              in,late, and tired to death, and hungry, &quot;wherever have you 
              been?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well,&quot; replied Paul, &quot;there wasn't any, so we 
              went overMisk Hills. And look here, our mother!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She peeped into the basket.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Now, those are fine ones!&quot; she exclaimed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And there's over two pounds-isn't there over two pounds&quot;?</p>
            <p>　　She tried the basket.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered doubtfully.</p>
            <p>　　Then Paul fished out a little spray. He always brought herone 
              spray, the best he could find.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Pretty!&quot; she said, in a curious tone, of a woman acceptinga 
              love-token.</p>
            <p>　　The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather thanown 
              himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed. She neverrealised 
              this, whilst he was young. She was a woman who waitedfor her children 
              to grow up. And William occupied her chiefly.</p>
            <p>　　But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much athome, 
              the mother made a companion of Paul. The latter wasunconsciously 
              jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him. At the same 
              time, they were good friends.</p>

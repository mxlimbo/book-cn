            <p align="center"><b>THE BIRTH OF PAUL, AND ANOTHER BATTLE（I）</b></p>
            <p>　　AFTER such a scene as the last, Walter Morel was for some days 
              abashedand ashamed, but he soon regained his old bullying indifference. 
              Yet there was a slight shrinking, a diminishing in his assurance. 
              Physically even, he shrank, and his fine full presence waned. He 
              never grew in the least stout, so that, as he sank from his erect,assertive 
              bearing, his physique seemed to contract along with his prideand 
              moral strength.</p>
            <p>　　But now he realised how hard it was for his wife to dragabout 
              at her work, and, his sympathy quickened by penitence,hastened forward 
              with his help. He came straight home from the pit,and stayed in 
              at evening till Friday, and then he could not remainat home. But 
              he was back again by ten o'clock, almost quite sober.</p>
            <p>　　He always made his own breakfast. Being a man who rose earlyand 
              had plenty of time he did not, as some miners do, drag his wifeout 
              of bed at six o'clock. At five, sometimes earlier, he woke,got straight 
              out of bed, and went downstairs. When she could not sleep,his wife 
              lay waiting for this time, as for a period of peace.The only real 
              rest seemed to be when he was out of the house.</p>
            <p>　　He went downstairs in his shirt and then struggled into hispit-trousers, 
              which were left on the hearth to warm all night. There was always 
              a fire, because Mrs. Morel raked. And the firstsound in the house 
              was the bang, bang of the poker against the raker,as Morel smashed 
              the remainder of the coal to make the kettle,which was filled and 
              left on the hob, finally boil. His cup and knifeand fork, all he 
              wanted except just the food, was laid ready onthe table on a newspaper. 
              Then he got his breakfast, made the tea,packed the bottom of the 
              doors with rugs to shut out the draught,piled a big fire, and sat 
              down to an hour of joy. He toastedhis bacon on a fork and caught 
              the drops of fat on his bread;then he put the rasher on his thick 
              slice of bread, and cut off chunkswith a clasp-knife, poured his 
              tea into his saucer, and was happy. With his family about, meals 
              were never so pleasant. He loatheda fork: it is a modern introduction 
              which has still scarcely reachedcommon people. What Morel preferred 
              was a clasp-knife. Then,in solitude, he ate and drank, often sitting, 
              in cold weather,on a little stool with his back to the warm chimney-piece, 
              his foodon the fender, his cup on the hearth. And then he read the 
              lastnight's newspaper--what of it he could--spelling it over laboriously. 
              He preferred to keep the blinds down and the candle lit even when 
              itwas daylight; it was the habit of the mine.</p>
            <p>　　At a quarter to six he rose, cut two thick slices of breadand 
              butter, and put them in the white calico snap-bag. He filled histin 
              bottle with tea. Cold tea without milk or sugar was the drinkhe 
              preferred for the pit. Then he pulled off his shirt, and puton his 
              pit-singlet, a vest of thick flannel cut low round the neck,and 
              with short sleeves like a chemise.</p>
            <p>　　Then he went upstairs to his wife with a cup of tea because shewas 
              ill, and because it occurred to him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I've brought thee a cup o' tea, lass,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, you needn't, for you know I don't like it,&quot; 
              she replied.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Drink it up; it'll pop thee off to sleep again.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She accepted the tea. It pleased him to see her take itand sip 
              it.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'll back my life there's no sugar in,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yi--there's one big 'un,&quot; he replied, injured.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's a wonder,&quot; she said, sipping again.</p>
            <p>　　She had a winsome face when her hair was loose. He loved herto 
              grumble at him in this manner. He looked at her again, and went,without 
              any sort of leave-taking. He never took more than two slicesof bread 
              and butter to eat in the pit, so an apple or an orange wasa treat 
              to him. He always liked it when she put one out for him. He tied 
              a scarf round his neck, put on his great, heavy boots, his coat,with 
              the big pocket, that carried his snap-bag and his bottle of tea,and 
              went forth into the fresh morning air, closing, without locking,the 
              door behind him. He loved the early morning, and the walk acrossthe 
              fields. So he appeared at the pit-top, often with a stalkfrom the 
              hedge between his teeth, which he chewed all day to keephis mouth 
              moist, down the mine, feeling quite as happy as when hewas in the 
              field.</p>
            <p>　　Later, when the time for the baby grew nearer, he wouldbustle 
              round in his slovenly fashion, poking out the ashes,rubbing the 
              fireplace, sweeping the house before he went to work. Then, feeling 
              very self-righteous, he went upstairs.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Now I'm cleaned up for thee: tha's no 'casions ter stira 
              peg all day, but sit and read thy books.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Which made her laugh, in spite of her indignation.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And the dinner cooks itself?&quot; she answered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Eh, I know nowt about th' dinner.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You'd know if there weren't any.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ay, 'appen so,&quot; he answered, departing.</p>
            <p>　　When she got downstairs, she would find the house tidy,but dirty. 
              She could not rest until she had thoroughly cleaned;so she went 
              down to the ash-pit with her dustpan. Mrs. Kirk,spying her, would 
              contrive to have to go to her own coal-place atthat minute. Then, 
              across the wooden fence, she would call:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;So you keep wagging on, then?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ay,&quot; answered Mrs. Morel deprecatingly. &quot;There's 
              nothingelse for it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Have you seen Hose?&quot; called a very small woman from 
              acrossthe road. It was Mrs. Anthony, a black-haired, strange little 
              body,who always wore a brown velvet dress, tight fitting.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I haven't,&quot; said Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Eh, I wish he'd come. I've got a copperful of clothes, 
              an'I'm sure I heered his bell.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Hark! He's at the end.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The two women looked down the alley. At the end of the Bottomsa 
              man stood in a sort of old-fashioned trap, bending over bundlesof 
              cream-coloured stuff; while a cluster of women held up theirarms 
              to him, some with bundles. Mrs. Anthony herself had a heapof creamy, 
              undyed stockings hanging over her arm.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I've done ten dozen this week,&quot; she said proudly to 
              Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;T-t-t!&quot; went the other. &quot;I don't know how you 
              can find time.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Eh!&quot; said Mrs. Anthony. &quot;You can find time if 
              you make time.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know how you do it,&quot; said Mrs. Morel. &quot;And 
              how muchshall you get for those many?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Tuppence-ha'penny a dozen,&quot; replied the other.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well,&quot; said Mrs. Morel. &quot;I'd starve before I'd 
              sit downand seam twenty-four stockings for twopence ha'penny.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, I don't know,&quot; said Mrs. Anthony. &quot;You can 
              rip alongwith 'em.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Hose was coming along, ringing his bell. Women were waiting atthe 
              yard-ends with their seamed stockings hanging over their arms. The 
              man, a common fellow, made jokes with them, tried to swindle them,and 
              bullied them. Mrs. Morel went up her yard disdainfully.</p>
            <p>　　It was an understood thing that if one woman wantedher neighbour, 
              she should put the poker in the fire and bang atthe back of the 
              fireplace, which, as the fires were back to back,would make a great 
              noise in the adjoining house. One morningMrs. Kirk, mixing a pudding, 
              nearly started out of her skin as sheheard the thud, thud, in her 
              grate. With her hands all floury,she rushed to the fence.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Did you knock, Mrs. Morel?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;If you wouldn't mind, Mrs. Kirk.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Kirk climbed on to her copper, got over the wallon to Mrs. 
              Morel's copper, and ran in to her neighbour.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Eh, dear, how are you feeling?&quot; she cried in concern.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You might fetch Mrs. Bower,&quot; said Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Kirk went into the yard, lifted up her strong, shrill voice,and 
              called:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ag-gie--Ag-gie!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The sound was heard from one end of the Bottoms to the other. 
              At last Aggie came running up, and was sent for Mrs. Bower,whilst 
              Mrs. Kirk left her pudding and stayed with her neighbour.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel went to bed. Mrs. Kirk had Annie and Williamfor dinner. 
              Mrs. Bower, fat and waddling, bossed the house.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Hash some cold meat up for the master's dinner, and make 
              himan apple-charlotte pudding,&quot; said Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He may go without pudding this day,&quot; said Mrs. Bower.</p>
            <p>　　Morel was not as a rule one of the first to appear at the bottomof 
              the pit, ready to come up. Some men were there before four o'clock,when 
              the whistle blew loose-all; but Morel, whose stall, a poor one,was 
              at this time about a mile and a half away from the bottom,worked 
              usually till the first mate stopped, then he finished also. This 
              day, however, the miner was sick of the work. At two o'clockhe looked 
              at his watch, by the light of the green candle--hewas in a safe 
              working--and again at half-past two. He was hewingat a piece of 
              rock that was in the way for the next day's work. As he sat on his 
              heels, or kneeled, giving hard blows with his pick,&quot;Uszza--uszza!&quot; 
              he went.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Shall ter finish, Sorry?&quot; cried Barker, his fellow 
              butty.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Finish? Niver while the world stands!&quot; growled Morel.</p>
            <p>　　And he went on striking. He was tired.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's a heart-breaking job,&quot; said Barker.</p>
            <p>　　But Morel was too exasperated, at the end of his tether,to answer. 
              Still he struck and hacked with all his might.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Tha might as well leave it, Walter,&quot; said Barker. 
              &quot;It'll do to-morrow, without thee hackin' thy guts out.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'll lay no b--- finger on this to-morrow, Isr'el!&quot; 
              cried Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, well, if tha wunna, somebody else'll ha'e to,&quot; 
              said Israel.</p>
            <p>　　Then Morel continued to strike.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Hey-up there--LOOSE-A'!&quot; cried the men, leaving the 
              next stall.</p>
            <p>　　Morel continued to strike.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Tha'll happen catch me up,&quot; said Barker, departing.</p>
            <p>　　When he had gone, Morel, left alone, felt savage. He hadnot finished 
              his job. He had overworked himself into a frenzy. Rising, wet with 
              sweat, he threw his tool down, pulled on his coat,blew out his candle, 
              took his lamp, and went. Down the main roadthe lights of the other 
              men went swinging. There was a hollowsound of many voices. It was 
              a long, heavy tramp underground.</p>
            <p>　　He sat at the bottom of the pit, where the great drops of waterfell 
              plash. Many colliers were waiting their turns to go up,talking noisily. 
              Morel gave his answers short and disagreeable.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's rainin', Sorry,&quot; said old Giles, who had had 
              the newsfrom the top.</p>
            <p>　　Morel found one comfort. He had his old umbrella, which he loved,in 
              the lamp cabin. At last he took his stand on the chair,and was at 
              the top in a moment. Then he handed in his lamp and gothis umbrella, 
              which he had bought at an auction for one-and-six. Hestood on the 
              edge of the pit-bank for a moment, looking out overthe fields; grey 
              rain was falling. The trucks stood full of wet,bright coal. Water 
              ran down the sides of the waggons, over thewhite &quot;C.W. and 
              Co.&quot;. Colliers, walking indifferent to the rain,were streaming 
              down the line and up the field, a grey, dismal host. Morel put up 
              his umbrella, and took pleasure from the peppering ofthe drops thereon.</p>
            <p>　　All along the road to Bestwood the miners tramped, wet andgrey 
              and dirty, but their red mouths talking with animation. Morel also 
              walked with a gang, but he said nothing. He frownedpeevishly as 
              he went. Many men passed into the Prince of Wales or intoEllen's. 
              Morel, feeling sufficiently disagreeable to resist temptation,trudged 
              along under the dripping trees that overhung the park wall,and down 
              the mud of Greenhill Lane.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel lay in bed, listening to the rain, and the feetof 
              the colliers from Minton, their voices, and the bang, bang ofthe 
              gates as they went through the stile up the field.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;There's some herb beer behind the pantry door,&quot; she 
              said. &quot;Th' master'll want a drink, if he doesn't stop.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　But he was late, so she concluded he had called for a drink,since 
              it was raining. What did he care about the child or her?</p>
            <p>　　She was very ill when her children were born.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What is it?&quot; she asked, feeling sick to death.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;A boy.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And she took consolation in that. The thought of being themother 
              of men was warming to her heart. She looked at the child. It had 
              blue eyes, and a lot of fair hair, and was bonny. Her love came 
              up hot, in spite of everything. She had it in bedwith her.</p>
            <p>　　Morel, thinking nothing, dragged his way up the garden path,wearily 
              and angrily. He closed his umbrella, and stood it in thesink; then 
              he sluthered his heavy boots into the kitchen. Mrs. Bower appeared 
              in the inner doorway.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;she's about as bad as she can 
              be. It's a boy childt.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The miner grunted, put his empty snap-bag and his tin bottleon 
              the dresser, went back into the scullery and hung up his coat,then 
              came and dropped into his chair.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Han yer got a drink?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　The woman went into the pantry. There was heard the popof a cork. 
              She set the mug, with a little, disgusted rap, on thetable before 
              Morel. He drank, gasped, wiped his big moustache onthe end of his 
              scarf, drank, gasped, and lay back in his chair. The woman would 
              not speak to him again. She set his dinner before him,and went upstairs.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Was that the master?&quot; asked Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I've gave him his dinner,&quot; replied Mrs. Bower.</p>
            <p>　　After he had sat with his arms on the table--he resentedthe fact 
              that Mrs. Bower put no cloth on for him, and gave hima little plate, 
              instead of a full-sized dinner-plate--he beganto eat. The fact that 
              his wife was ill, that he had another boy,was nothing to him at 
              that moment. He was too tired; he wantedhis dinner; he wanted to 
              sit with his arms lying on the board;he did not like having Mrs. 
              Bower about. The fire was too smallto please him.</p>
            <p>　　After he had finished his meal, he sat for twenty minutes;then 
              he stoked up a big fire. Then, in his stockinged feet,he went reluctantly 
              upstairs. It was a struggle to face his wifeat this moment, and 
              he was tired. His face was black, and smearedwith sweat. His singlet 
              had dried again, soaking the dirt in. He had a dirty woollen scarf 
              round his throat. So he stood at the footof the bed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, how are ter, then?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I s'll be all right,&quot; she answered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;H'm!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He stood at a loss what to say next. He was tired, and thisbother 
              was rather a nuisance to him, and he didn't quite knowwhere he was.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;A lad, tha says,&quot; he stammered.</p>
            <p>　　She turned down the sheet and showed the child.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Bless him!&quot; he murmured. Which made her laugh, because 
              heblessed by rote--pretending paternal emotion, which he did not 
              feeljust then.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Go now,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I will, my lass,&quot; he answered, turning away.</p>
            <p>　　Dismissed, he wanted to kiss her, but he dared not. She halfwanted 
              him to kiss her, but could not bring herself to give any sign. She 
              only breathed freely when he was gone out of the room again,leaving 
              behind him a faint smell of pit-dirt.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel had a visit every day from the Congregational clergyman. 
              Mr. Heaton was young, and very poor. His wife had died at thebirth 
              of his first baby, so he remained alone in the manse. He was a Bachelor 
              of Arts of Cambridge, very shy, and no preacher. Mrs. Morel was 
              fond of him, and he depended on her. For hourshe talked to her, 
              when she was well. He became the god-parentof the child.</p>
            <p>　　Occasionally the minister stayed to tea with Mrs. Morel. Then 
              shelaid the cloth early, got out her best cups, with a little green 
              rim,and hoped Morel would not come too soon; indeed, if he stayed 
              for a pint,she would not mind this day. She had always two dinners 
              to cook,because she believed children should have their chief meal 
              at midday,whereas Morel needed his at five o'clock. So Mr. Heaton 
              would holdthe baby, whilst Mrs. Morel beat up a batter-pudding or 
              peeledthe potatoes, and he, watching her all the time, would discusshis 
              next sermon. His ideas were quaint and fantastic. She broughthim 
              judiciously to earth. It was a discussion of the wedding at Cana.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;When He changed the water into wine at Cana,&quot; he said,&quot;that 
              is a symbol that the ordinary life, even the blood,of the married 
              husband and wife, which had before been uninspired,like water, became 
              filled with the Spirit, and was as wine, because,when love enters, 
              the whole spiritual constitution of a man changes,is filled with 
              the Holy Ghost, and almost his form is altered.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel thought to herself:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, poor fellow, his young wife is dead; that is why hemakes 
              his love into the Holy Ghost.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They were halfway down their first cup of tea when they heardthe 
              sluther of pit-boots.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Good gracious!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Morel, in spite of 
              herself.</p>
            <p>　　The minister looked rather scared. Morel entered. He wasfeeling 
              rather savage. He nodded a &quot;How d'yer do&quot; to the clergyman,who 
              rose to shake hands with him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nay,&quot; said Morel, showing his hand, &quot;look thee 
              at it! Tha niver wants ter shake hands wi' a hand like that, does 
              ter? There's too much pick-haft and shovel-dirt on it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The minister flushed with confusion, and sat down again. Mrs. 
              Morel rose, carried out the steaming saucepan. Morel took offhis 
              coat, dragged his armchair to table, and sat down heavily.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Are you tired?&quot; asked the clergyman.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Tired? I ham that,&quot; replied Morel. &quot;YOU don't 
              know what itis to be tired, as I'M tired.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; replied the clergyman.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why, look yer 'ere,&quot; said the miner, showing the shouldersof 
              his singlet. &quot;It's a bit dry now, but it's wet as a cloutwith 
              sweat even yet. Feel it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Goodness!&quot; cried Mrs. Morel. &quot;Mr. Heaton doesn't 
              want to feelyour nasty singlet.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The clergyman put out his hand gingerly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, perhaps he doesn't,&quot; said Morel; &quot;but it'sall 
              come out of me, whether or not. An' iv'ry dayalike my singlet's 
              wringin' wet. 'Aven't you gota drink, Missis, for a man when he 
              comes home barkled up from the pit?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You know you drank all the beer,&quot; said Mrs. Morel, 
              pouring outhis tea.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;An' was there no more to be got?&quot; Turning to the clergyman--&quot;Aman 
              gets that caked up wi' th' dust, you know,--that clogged updown 
              a coal-mine, he NEEDS a drink when he comes home.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I am sure he does,&quot; said the clergyman.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But it's ten to one if there's owt for him.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;There's water--and there's tea,&quot; said Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Water! It's not water as'll clear his throat.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He poured out a saucerful of tea, blew it, and sucked it upthrough 
              his great black moustache, sighing afterwards. Then hepoured out 
              another saucerful, and stood his cup on the table.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;My cloth!&quot; said Mrs. Morel, putting it on a plate.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;A man as comes home as I do 's too tired to care about 
              cloths,&quot;said Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Pity!&quot; exclaimed his wife, sarcastically.</p>
            <p>　　The room was full of the smell of meat and vegetablesand pit-clothes.</p>
            <p>　　He leaned over to the minister, his great moustache thrust forward,his 
              mouth very red in his black face.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Mr. Heaton,&quot; he said, &quot;a man as has been down 
              the blackhole all day, dingin' away at a coal-face, yi, a sight 
              harderthan that wall---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Needn't make a moan of it,&quot; put in Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　She hated her husband because, whenever he had an audience,he 
              whined and played for sympathy. William, sitting nursingthe baby, 
              hated him, with a boy's hatred for false sentiment,and for the stupid 
              treatment of his mother. Annie had never liked him;she merely avoided 
              him.</p>
            <p>　　When the minister had gone, Mrs. Morel looked at her cloth.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;A fine mess!&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Dos't think I'm goin' to sit wi' my arms danglin', cos 
              tha'sgot a parson for tea wi' thee?&quot; he bawled.</p>

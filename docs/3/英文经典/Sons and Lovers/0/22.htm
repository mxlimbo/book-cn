            <p>　　But she walked with her head up, and still did not answer. He 
              could tell by the way she moved, as if she didn't care,that she 
              suffered.</p>
            <p>　　At this time Paul took his mother to Lincoln. She was brightand 
              enthusiastic as ever, but as he sat opposite her in therailway carriage, 
              she seemed to look frail. He had a momentarysensation as if she 
              were slipping away from him. Then hewanted to get hold of her, to 
              fasten her, almost to chain her. He felt he must keep hold of her 
              with his hand.</p>
            <p>　　They drew near to the city. Both were at the window lookingfor 
              the cathedral.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;There she is, mother!&quot; he cried.</p>
            <p>　　They saw the great cathedral lying couchant above the plain.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ah!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;So she is!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He looked at his mother. Her blue eyes were watching thecathedral 
              quietly. She seemed again to be beyond him. Something inthe eternal 
              repose of the uplifted cathedral, blue and nobleagainst the sky, 
              was reflected in her, something of the fatality. What was, WAS. 
              With all his young will he could not alter it. He saw her face, 
              the skin still fresh and pink and downy,but crow's-feet near her 
              eyes, her eyelids steady, sinking a little,her mouth always closed 
              with disillusion; and there was on her the sameeternal look, as 
              if she knew fate at last. He beat against itwith all the strength 
              of his soul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Look, mother, how big she is above the town! Think, there 
              are streetsand streets below her! She looks bigger than the city 
              altogether.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;So she does!&quot; exclaimed his mother, breaking brightinto 
              life again. But he had seen her sitting, looking steadyout of the 
              window at the cathedral, her face and eyes fixed,reflecting the 
              relentlessness of life. And the crow's-feet nearher eyes, and her 
              mouth shut so hard, made him feel he would go mad.</p>
            <p>　　They ate a meal that she considered wildly extravagant.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't imagine I like it,&quot; she said, as she ate her 
              cutlet. &quot;I DON'T like it, I really don't! Just THINK of your 
              money wasted!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You never mind my money,&quot; he said. &quot;You forget 
              I'm a fellowtaking his girl for an outing.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And he bought her some blue violets.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Stop it at once, sir!&quot; she commanded. &quot;How can 
              I do it?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You've got nothing to do. Stand still!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And in the middle of High Street he stuck the flowers in her 
              coat.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;An old thing like me!&quot; she said, sniffing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You see,&quot; he said, &quot;I want people to think we're 
              awful swells. So look ikey.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'll jowl your head,&quot; she laughed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Strut!&quot; he commanded. &quot;Be a fantail pigeon.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　It took him an hour to get her through the street. She stoodabove 
              Glory Hole, she stood before Stone Bow, she stood everywhere,and 
              exclaimed.</p>
            <p>　　A man came up, took off his hat, and bowed to her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Can I show you the town, madam?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, thank you,&quot; she answered. &quot;I've got my son.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Then Paul was cross with her for not answering with more dignity.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You go away with you!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Ha! that'sthe 
              Jew's House. Now, do you remember that lecture, Paul--?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　But she could scarcely climb the cathedral hill. He did not notice. 
              Then suddenly he found her unable to speak. He took her into a little 
              public-house, where she rested.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's nothing,&quot; she said. &quot;My heart is only a 
              bit old;one must expect it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He did not answer, but looked at her. Again his heart wascrushed 
              in a hot grip. He wanted to cry, he wanted to smash thingsin fury.</p>
            <p>　　They set off again, pace by pace, so slowly. And everystep seemed 
              like a weight on his chest. He felt as if his heartwould burst. 
              At last they came to the top. She stood enchanted,looking at the 
              castle gate, looking at the cathedral front. She had quite forgotten 
              herself.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Now THIS is better than I thought it could be!&quot; she 
              cried.</p>
            <p>　　But he hated it. Everywhere he followed her, brooding. They sat 
              together in the cathedral. They attended a little servicein the 
              choir. She was timid.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I suppose it is open to anybody?&quot; she asked him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; he replied. &quot;Do you think they'd have the 
              damned cheekto send us away.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, I'm sure,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;they would if 
              they heardyour language.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Her face seemed to shine again with joy and peace duringthe service. 
              And all the time he was wanting to rage and smashthings and cry.</p>
            <p>　　Afterwards, when they were leaning over the wall, looking atthe 
              town below, he blurted suddenly:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why can't a man have a YOUNG mother? What is she old for?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well,&quot; his mother laughed, &quot;she can scarcely 
              help it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And why wasn't I the oldest son? Look--they say the youngones 
              have the advantage--but look, THEY had the young mother.You should 
              have had me for your eldest son.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I didn't arrange it,&quot; she remonstrated. &quot;Come 
              to consider,you're as much to blame as me.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He turned on her, white, his eyes furious.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What are you old for!&quot; he said, mad with his impotence. 
              &quot;WHY can't you walk? WHY can't you come with me to places?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;At one time,&quot; she replied, &quot;I could have run 
              up that hilla good deal better than you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What's the good of that to ME?&quot; he cried, hitting 
              his fiston the wall. Then he became plaintive. &quot;It's too bad 
              of youto be ill. Little, it is--&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ill!&quot; she cried. &quot;I'm a bit old, and you'll have 
              to put upwith it, that's all.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They were quiet. But it was as much as they could bear. They 
              gotjolly again over tea. As they sat by Brayford, watching the boats,he 
              told her about Clara. His mother asked him innumerable questions.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then who does she live with?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;With her mother, on Bluebell Hill.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And have they enough to keep them?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't think so. I think they do lace work.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And wherein lies her charm, my boy?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know that she's charming, mother. But she's nice. 
              And she seems straight, you know--not a bit deep, not a bit.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But she's a good deal older than you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She's thirty, I'm going on twenty-three.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You haven't told me what you like her for.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Because I don't know--a sort of defiant way she's got--a 
              sortof angry way.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel considered. She would have been glad now for her sonto 
              fall in love with some woman who would--she did not know what. But 
              he fretted so, got so furious suddenly, and again was melancholic. 
              She wished he knew some nice woman-- She did not know what she wished,but 
              left it vague. At any rate, she was not hostile to the ideaof Clara.</p>
            <p>　　Annie, too, was getting married. Leonard had gone away to workin 
              Birmingham. One week-end when he was home she had said to him:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You don't look very well, my lad.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I dunno,&quot; he said. &quot;I feel anyhow or nohow, ma.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He called her &quot;ma&quot; already in his boyish fashion.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Are you sure they're good lodgings?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes--yes. Only--it's a winder when you have to pour your 
              owntea out--an' nobody to grouse if you team it in your saucer and 
              supit up. It somehow takes a' the taste out of it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel laughed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And so it knocks you up?&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I dunno. I want to get married,&quot; he blurted, twisting 
              hisfingers and looking down at his boots. There was a silence.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;I thought you said you'd 
              wait another year.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, I did say so,&quot; he replied stubbornly.</p>
            <p>　　Again she considered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And you know,&quot; she said, &quot;Annie's a bit of a 
              spendthrift. She's saved no more than eleven pounds. And I know, 
              lad, you haven'thad much chance.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He coloured up to the ears.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I've got thirty-three quid,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It doesn't go far,&quot; she answered.</p>
            <p>　　He said nothing, but twisted his fingers.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And you know,&quot; she said, &quot;I've nothing---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I didn't want, ma!&quot; he cried, very red, suffering 
              and remonstrating.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, my lad, I know. I was only wishing I had. And take 
              awayfive pounds for the wedding and things--it leaves twenty-nine 
              pounds. You won't do much on that.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He twisted still, impotent, stubborn, not looking up.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But do you really want to get married?&quot; she asked. 
              &quot;Do youfeel as if you ought?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He gave her one straight look from his blue eyes.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then,&quot; she replied, &quot;we must all do the best 
              we can for it, lad.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The next time he looked up there were tears in his eyes.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't want Annie to feel handicapped,&quot; he said, 
              struggling.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;My lad,&quot; she said, &quot;you're steady--you've got 
              a decent place. If a man had NEEDED me I'd have married him on his 
              last week's wages. She may find it a bit hard to start humbly. Young 
              girls ARE like that. They look forward to the fine home they think 
              they'll have. But I had expensive furniture. It's not everything.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　So the wedding took place almost immediately. Arthur came home,and 
              was splendid in uniform. Annie looked nice in a dove-greydress that 
              she could take for Sundays. Morel called her a foolfor getting married, 
              and was cool with his son-in-law. Mrs. Morelhad white tips in her 
              bonnet, and some white on her blouse,and was teased by both her 
              sons for fancying herself so grand. Leonard was jolly and cordial, 
              and felt a fearful fool. Paul couldnot quite see what Annie wanted 
              to get married for. He was fond of her,and she of him. Still, he 
              hoped rather lugubriously that it wouldturn out all right. Arthur 
              was astonishingly handsome in his scarletand yellow, and he knew 
              it well, but was secretly ashamed of the uniform. Annie cried her 
              eyes up in the kitchen, on leaving her mother. Mrs. Morel cried 
              a little, then patted her on the back and said:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But don't cry, child, he'll be good to you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Morel stamped and said she was a fool to go and tie herself up. 
              Leonard looked white and overwrought. Mrs. Morel said to him:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I s'll trust her to you, my lad, and hold you responsiblefor 
              her.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You can,&quot; he said, nearly dead with the ordeal. And 
              itwas all over.</p>
            <p>　　When Morel and Arthur were in bed, Paul sat talking, as heoften 
              did, with his mother.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You're not sorry she's married, mother, are you?&quot; 
              he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm not sorry she's married--but--it seems strange that 
              sheshould go from me. It even seems to me hard that she can preferto 
              go with her Leonard. That's how mothers are--I know it's silly.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And shall you be miserable about her?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;When I think of my own wedding day,&quot; his mother answered,&quot;I 
              can only hope her life will be different.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But you can trust him to be good to her?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, yes. They say he's not good enough for her. But I 
              sayif a man is GENUINE, as he is, and a girl is fond of him--then--itshould 
              be all right. He's as good as she.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;So you don't mind?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I would NEVER have let a daughter of mine marry a man I 
              didn'tFEEL to be genuine through and through. And yet, there's a 
              gapnow she's gone.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They were both miserable, and wanted her back again. It seemed 
              to Paul his mother looked lonely, in her new black silkblouse with 
              its bit of white trimming.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;At any rate, mother, I s'll never marry,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ay, they all say that, my lad. You've not met the one yet. 
              Only wait a year or two.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But I shan't marry, mother. I shall live with you, and 
              we'llhave a servant.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ay, my lad, it's easy to talk. We'll see when the time 
              comes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What time? I'm nearly twenty-three.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, you're not one that would marry young. But inthree 
              years' time---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I shall be with you just the same.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;We'll see, my boy, we'll see.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But you don't want me to marry?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I shouldn't like to think of you going through your lifewithout 
              anybody to care for you and do--no.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And you think I ought to marry?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Sooner or later every man ought.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But you'd rather it were later.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It would be hard--and very hard. It's as they say:</p>
            <p>　　 &quot;'A son's my son till he takes him a wife, But my daughter's 
              my daughter the whole of her life.'&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And you think I'd let a wife take me from you?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, you wouldn't ask her to marry your mother as well 
              as you,&quot;Mrs. Morel smiled.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She could do what she liked; she wouldn't have to interfere.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She wouldn't--till she'd got you--and then you'd see.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I never will see. I'll never marry while I've got you--I 
              won't.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But I shouldn't like to leave you with nobody, my boy,&quot;she 
              cried.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You're not going to leave me. What are you? Fifty-three! 
              I'llgive you till seventy-five. There you are, I'm fat and forty-four.Then 
              I'll marry a staid body. See!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　His mother sat and laughed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Go to bed,&quot; she said--&quot;go to bed.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And we'll have a pretty house, you and me, and a servant,and 
              it'll be just all right. I s'll perhaps be rich with my painting.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Will you go to bed!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And then you s'll have a pony-carriage. See yourself--a 
              littleQueen Victoria trotting round.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I tell you to go to bed,&quot; she laughed.</p>
            <p>　　He kissed her and went. His plans for the future were alwaysthe 
              same.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel sat brooding--about her daughter, about Paul,about 
              Arthur. She fretted at losing Annie. The family was veryclosely 
              bound. And she felt she MUST live now, to be with herchildren. Life 
              was so rich for her. Paul wanted her, and so did Arthur. Arthur 
              never knew how deeply he loved her. He was a creatureof the moment. 
              Never yet had he been forced to realise himself. The army had disciplined 
              his body, but not his soul. He was inperfect health and very handsome. 
              His dark, vigorous hair sat closeto his smallish head. There was 
              something childish about his nose,something almost girlish about 
              his dark blue eyes. But he had the funred mouth of a man under his 
              brown moustache, and his jaw was strong. It was his father's mouth; 
              it was the nose and eyes of her own mother'speople--good-looking, 
              weak-principled folk. Mrs. Morel was anxiousabout him. Once he had 
              really run the rig he was safe. But how farwould he go?</p>
            <p>　　The army had not really done him any good. He resentedbitterly 
              the authority of the officers. He hated having to obeyas if he were 
              an animal. But he had too much sense to kick. So he turned his attention 
              to getting the best out of it. He could sing, he was a boon-companion. 
              Often he got into scrapes,but they were the manly scrapes that are 
              easily condoned. So he madea good time out of it, whilst his self-respect 
              was in suppression. He trusted to his good looks and handsome figure, 
              his refinement,his decent education to get him most of what he wanted, 
              and hewas not disappointed. Yet he was restless. Something seemedto 
              gnaw him inside. He was never still, he was never alone. With his 
              mother he was rather humble. Paul he admired and lovedand despised 
              slightly. And Paul admired and loved and despisedhim slightly.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel had had a few pounds left to her by her father,and 
              she decided to buy her son out of the army. He was wild with joy. 
              Now he was like a lad taking a holiday.</p>
            <p>　　He had always been fond of Beatrice Wyld, and during his furloughhe 
              picked up with her again. She was stronger and better in health. 
              The two often went long walks together, Arthur taking her armin 
              soldier's fashion, rather stiffly. And she came to play thepiano 
              whilst he sang. Then Arthur would unhook his tunic collar. He grew 
              flushed, his eyes were bright, he sang in a manly tenor. Afterwards 
              they sat together on the sofa. He seemed to flaunthis body: she 
              was aware of him so--the strong chest, the sides,the thighs in their 
              close-fitting trousers.</p>
            <p>　　He liked to lapse into the dialect when he talked to her. She 
              would sometimes smoke with him. Occasionally shewould only take 
              a few whiffs at his cigarette.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nay,&quot; he said to her one evening, when she reachedfor 
              his cigarette. &quot;Nay, tha doesna. I'll gi'e thee a smokekiss 
              if ter's a mind.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I wanted a whiff, no kiss at all,&quot; she answered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, an' tha s'lt ha'e a whiff,&quot; he said, &quot;along 
              wi' t' kiss.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I want a draw at thy fag,&quot; she cried, snatching for 
              thecigarette between his lips.</p>
            <p>　　He was sitting with his shoulder touching her. She was smalland 
              quick as lightning. He just escaped.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'll gi'e thee a smoke kiss,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Tha'rt a knivey nuisance, Arty Morel,&quot; she said, sitting 
              back.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ha'e a smoke kiss?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The soldier leaned forward to her, smiling. His face wasnear 
              hers.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Shonna!&quot; she replied, turning away her head.</p>
            <p>　　He took a draw at his cigarette, and pursed up his mouth,and 
              put his lips close to her. His dark-brown cropped moustachestood 
              out like a brush. She looked at the puckered crimson lips,then suddenly 
              snatched the cigarette from his fingers and darted away. He, leaping 
              after her, seized the comb from her back hair. She turned,threw 
              the cigarette at him. He picked it up, put it in his mouth,and sat 
              down.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nuisance!&quot; she cried. &quot;Give me my comb!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She was afraid that her hair, specially done for him,would come 
              down. She stood with her hands to her head. He hidthe comb between 
              his knees.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I've non got it,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　The cigarette trembled between his lips with laughter as he spoke.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Liar!&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;'S true as I'm here!&quot; he laughed, showing his hands.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You brazen imp!&quot; she exclaimed, rushing and scuffling 
              forthe comb, which he had under his knees. As she wrestled with 
              him,pulling at his smooth, tight-covered knees, he laughed till 
              helay back on the sofa shaking with laughter. The cigarette fellfrom 
              his mouth almost singeing his throat. Under his delicate tanthe 
              blood flushed up, and he laughed till his blue eyes were blinded,his 
              throat swollen almost to choking. Then he sat up. Beatrice wasputting 
              in her comb.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Tha tickled me, Beat,&quot; he said thickly.</p>
            <p>　　Like a flash her small white hand went out and smacked his face. 
              He started up, glaring at her. They stared at each other. Slowly 
              the flush mounted her cheek, she dropped her eyes, then her head. 
              He sat down sulkily. She went into the scullery to adjust her hair. 
              In private there she shed a few tears, she did not know what for.</p>
            <p>　　When she returned she was pursed up close. But it was only a 
              filmover her fire. He, with ruffled hair, was sulking upon the sofa. 
              She sat down opposite, in the armchair, and neither spoke. The clock 
              ticked in the silence like blows.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You are a little cat, Beat,&quot; he said at length, half 
              apologetically.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, you shouldn't be brazen,&quot; she replied.</p>
            <p>　　There was again a long silence. He whistled to himselflike a 
              man much agitated but defiant. Suddenly she went acrossto him and 
              kissed him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Did it, pore fing!&quot; she mocked.</p>
            <p>　　He lifted his face, smiling curiously.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Kiss?&quot; he invited her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Daren't I?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Go on!&quot; he challenged, his mouth lifted to her.</p>
            <p>　　Deliberately, and with a peculiar quivering smile thatseemed 
              to overspread her whole body, she put her mouth on his. Immediately 
              his arms folded round her. As soon as the long kiss wasfinished 
              she drew back her head from him, put her delicate fingerson his 
              neck, through the open collar. Then she closed her eyes,giving herself 
              up again in a kiss.</p>
            <p>　　She acted of her own free will. What she would do she did,and 
              made nobody responsible.</p>
            <p>　　Paul felt life changing around him. The conditions of youthwere 
              gone. Now it was a home of grown-up people. Annie wasa married woman, 
              Arthur was following his own pleasure in a wayunknown to his folk. 
              For so long they had all lived at home,and gone out to pass their 
              time. But now, for Annie and Arthur,life lay outside their mother's 
              house. They came home for holidayand for rest. So there was that 
              strange, half-empty feeling aboutthe house, as if the birds had 
              flown. Paul became more and moreunsettled. Annie and Arthur had 
              gone. He was restless to follow.Yet home was for him beside his 
              mother. And still there wassomething else, something outside, something 
              he wanted.</p>
            <p>　　He grew more and more restless. Miriam did not satisfy him. His 
              old mad desire to be with her grew weaker. Sometimes he metClara 
              in Nottingham, sometimes he went to meetings with her,sometimes 
              he saw her at Willey Farm. But on these last occasionsthe situation 
              became strained. There was a triangle of antagonismbetween Paul 
              and Clara and Miriam. With Clara he took on a smart,worldly, mocking 
              tone very antagonistic to Miriam. It did notmatter what went before. 
              She might be intimate and sad with him. Then as soon as Clara appeared, 
              it all vanished, and he played tothe newcomer.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam had one beautiful evening with him in the hay. He had 
              been on the horse-rake, and having finished, came to helpher to 
              put the hay in cocks. Then he talked to her of his hopesand despairs, 
              and his whole soul seemed to lie bare before her. She felt as if 
              she watched the very quivering stuff of life in him. The moon came 
              out: they walked home together: he seemed to havecome to her because 
              he needed her so badly, and she listened to him,gave him all her 
              love and her faith. It seemed to her he broughther the best of himself 
              to keep, and that she would guard it allher life. Nay, the sky did 
              not cherish the stars more surely andeternally than she would guard 
              the good in the soul of Paul Morel. She went on home alone, feeling 
              exalted, glad in her faith.</p>
            <p>　　And then, the next day, Clara came. They were to have teain the 
              hayfield. Miriam watched the evening drawing to goldand shadow. 
              And all the time Paul was sporting with Clara. He made higher and 
              higher heaps of hay that they were jumping over. Miriam did not 
              care for the game, and stood aside. Edgar and Geoffreyand Maurice 
              and Clara and Paul jumped. Paul won, because hewas light. Clara's 
              blood was roused. She could run like an Amazon. Paul loved the determined 
              way she rushed at the hay-cock and leaped,landed on the other side, 
              her breasts shaken, her thick haircome undone.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You touched!&quot; he cried. &quot;You touched!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No!&quot; she flashed, turning to Edgar. &quot;I didn't 
              touch, did I? Wasn't I clear?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I couldn't say,&quot; laughed Edgar.</p>
            <p>　　None of them could say.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But you touched,&quot; said Paul. &quot;You're beaten.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I did NOT touch!&quot; she cried.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;As plain as anything,&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Box his ears for me!&quot; she cried to Edgar.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nay,&quot; Edgar laughed. &quot;I daren't. You must do 
              it yourself.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And nothing can alter the fact that you touched,&quot; 
              laughed Paul.</p>
            <p>　　She was furious with him. Her little triumph before theselads 
              and men was gone. She had forgotten herself in the game. Now he 
              was to humble her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I think you are despicable!&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　And again he laughed, in a way that tortured Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And I KNEW you couldn't jump that heap,&quot; he teased.</p>
            <p>　　She turned her back on him. Yet everybody could see thatthe only 
              person she listened to, or was conscious of, was he,and he of her. 
              It pleased the men to see this battle between them. But Miriam was 
              tortured.</p>
            <p>　　Paul could choose the lesser in place of the higher, she saw. 
              He could be unfaithful to himself, unfaithful to the real,deep Paul 
              Morel. There was a danger of his becoming frivolous, of hisrunning 
              after his satisfaction like any Arthur, or like his father. It made 
              Miriam bitter to think that he should throw away his soulfor this 
              flippant traffic of triviality with Clara. She walkedin bitterness 
              and silence, while the other two rallied each other,and Paul sported.</p>
            <p>　　And afterwards, he would not own it, but he was ratherashamed 
              of himself, and prostrated himself before Miriam. Then again he 
              rebelled.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's not religious to be religious,&quot; he said. &quot;I 
              reckona crow is religious when it sails across the sky. But it onlydoes 
              it because it feels itself carried to where it's going,not because 
              it thinks it is being eternal.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　But Miriam knew that one should be religious in everything,have 
              God, whatever God might be, present in everything.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't believe God knows such a lot about Himself,&quot;he 
              cried. &quot;God doesn't KNOW things, He IS things.And I'm sure 
              He's not soulful.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And then it seemed to her that Paul was arguing God on to hisown 
              side, because he wanted his own way and his own pleasure. There 
              was a long battle between him and her. He was utterlyunfaithful 
              to her even in her own presence; then he was ashamed,then repentant; 
              then he hated her, and went off again. Those werethe ever-recurring 
              conditions.</p>
            <p>　　She fretted him to the bottom of his soul. There sheremained--sad, 
              pensive, a worshipper. And he caused her sorrow. Half the time he 
              grieved for her, half the time he hated her. She was his conscience; 
              and he felt, somehow, he had got a consciencethat was too much for 
              him. He could not leave her, because in oneway she did hold the 
              best of him. He could not stay with herbecause she did not take 
              the rest of him, which was three-quarters.So he chafed himself into 
              rawness over her.</p>
            <p>　　When she was twenty-one he wrote her a letter which couldonly 
              have been written to her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;May I speak of our old, worn love, this last time. It, 
              too,is changing, is it not? Say, has not the body of that love died,and 
              left you its invulnerable soul? You see, I can give youa spirit 
              love, I have given it you this long, long time; but notembodied 
              passion. See, you are a nun. I have given you what Iwould give a 
              holy nun--as a mystic monk to a mystic nun. Surely youesteem it 
              best. Yet you regret--no, have regretted--the other. In all our 
              relations no body enters. I do not talk to you throughthe senses--rather 
              through the spirit. That is why we cannot lovein the common sense. 
              Ours is not an everyday affection. As yet weare mortal, and to live 
              side by side with one another would be dreadful,for somehow with 
              you I cannot long be trivial, and, you know,to be always beyond 
              this mortal state would be to lose it. If people marry, they must 
              live together as affectionate humans,who may be commonplace with 
              each other without feeling awkward--notas two souls. So I feel it.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ought I to send this letter?--I doubt it. But there--itis 
              best to understand. Au revoir.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Miriam read this letter twice, after which she sealed it up. 
              A year later she broke the seal to show her mother the letter.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You are a nun--you are a nun.&quot; The words went into 
              her heartagain and again. Nothing he ever had said had gone into 
              herso deeply, fixedly, like a mortal wound.</p>
            <p>　　She answered him two days after the party.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;'Our intimacy would have been all-beautiful but for onelittle 
              mistake,'&quot; she quoted. &quot;Was the mistake mine?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Almost immediately he replied to her from Nottingham,sending 
              her at the same time a little &quot;Omar Khayyam.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I am glad you answered; you are so calm and natural you 
              putme to shame. What a ranter I am! We are often out of sympathy. 
              But in fundamentals we may always be together I think.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I must thank you for your sympathy with my painting and 
              drawing. Many a sketch is dedicated to you. I do look forward to 
              your criticisms,which, to my shame and glory, are always grand appreciations. 
              It is a lovely joke, that. Au revoir.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　This was the end of the first phase of Paul's love affair. He 
              was now about twenty-three years old, and, though still virgin,the 
              sex instinct that Miriam had over-refined for so long nowgrew particularly 
              strong. Often, as he talked to Clara Dawes,came that thickening 
              and quickening of his blood, that peculiarconcentration in the breast, 
              as if something were alive there,a new self or a new centre of consciousness, 
              warning him thatsooner or later he would have to ask one woman or 
              another. But hebelonged to Miriam. Of that she was so fixedly sure

            <p>　　Then he took her in his arms, and held her fast. She movedaside 
              her mouth to ask, dogged and low:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What time is it?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It doesn't matter,&quot; he pleaded thickly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes it does--yes! I must go!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's early yet,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What time is it?&quot; she insisted.</p>
            <p>　　All round lay the black night, speckled and spangled with lights.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She put her hand on his chest, feeling for his watch. He felt 
              the joints fuse into fire. She groped in his waistcoat pocket,while 
              he stood panting. In the darkness she could see the round,pale face 
              of the watch, but not the figures. She stooped over it. He was panting 
              till he could take her in his arms again.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I can't see,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then don't bother.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; I'm going!&quot; she said, turning away.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Wait! I'll look!&quot; But he could not see. &quot;I'll 
              strikea match.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He secretly hoped it was too late to catch the train. She saw 
              the glowing lantern of his hands as he cradled the light: then his 
              face lit up, his eyes fixed on the watch. Instantly all wasdark 
              again. All was black before her eyes; only a glowing match wasred 
              near her feet. Where was he?</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What is it?&quot; she asked, afraid.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You can't do it,&quot; his voice answered out of the darkness.</p>
            <p>　　There was a pause. She felt in his power. She had heardthe ring 
              in his voice. It frightened her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What time is it?&quot; she asked, quiet, definite, hopeless.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Two minutes to nine,&quot; he replied, telling the truth 
              witha struggle.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And can I get from here to the station in fourteen minutes?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No. At any rate---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She could distinguish his dark form again a yard or so away. 
              She wanted to escape.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But can't I do it?&quot; she pleaded.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;If you hurry,&quot; he said brusquely. &quot;But you could 
              easilywalk it, Clara; it's only seven miles to the tram. I'll comewith 
              you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No; I want to catch the train.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But why?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I do--I want to catch the train.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Suddenly his voice altered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Very well,&quot; he said, dry and hard. &quot;Come along, 
              then.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And he plunged ahead into the darkness. She ran after him,wanting 
              to cry. Now he was hard and cruel to her. She ran overthe rough, 
              dark fields behind him, out of breath, ready to drop. But the double 
              row of lights at the station drew nearer. Suddenly:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;There she is!&quot; he cried, breaking into a run.</p>
            <p>　　There was a faint rattling noise. Away to the right the train,like 
              a luminous caterpillar, was threading across the night. The rattling 
              ceased.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She's over the viaduct. You'll just do it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Clara ran, quite out of breath, and fell at last into the train. 
              The whistle blew. He was gone. Gone!--and she was in a carriagefull 
              of people. She felt the cruelty of it.</p>
            <p>　　He turned round and plunged home. Before he knew wherehe was 
              he was in the kitchen at home. He was very pale. His eyes were dark 
              and dangerous-looking, as if he were drunk. His mother looked at 
              him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, I must say your boots are in a nice state!&quot; 
              she said.</p>
            <p>　　He looked at his feet. Then he took off his overcoat. His mother 
              wondered if he were drunk.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She caught the train then?&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I hope HER feet weren't so filthy. Where on earth you draggedher 
              I don't know!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He was silent and motionless for some time.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Did you like her?&quot; he asked grudgingly at last.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, I liked her. But you'll tire of her, my son; you knowyou 
              will.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He did not answer. She noticed how he laboured in his breathing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Have you been running?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;We had to run for the train.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You'll go and knock yourself up. You'd better drink hot 
              milk.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　It was as good a stimulant as he could have, but he refusedand 
              went to bed. There he lay face down on the counterpane,and shed 
              tears of rage and pain. There was a physical painthat made him bite 
              his lips till they bled, and the chaos insidehim left him unable 
              to think, almost to feel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;This is how she serves me, is it?&quot; he said in his 
              heart,over and over, pressing his face in the quilt. And he hated 
              her. Again he went over the scene, and again he hated her.</p>
            <p>　　The next day there was a new aloofness about him. Clara wasvery 
              gentle, almost loving. But he treated her distantly,with a touch 
              of contempt. She sighed, continuing to be gentle. He came round.</p>
            <p>　　One evening of that week Sarah Bernhardt was at the Theatre Royalin 
              Nottingham, giving &quot;La Dame aux Camelias&quot;. Paul wanted 
              to seethis old and famous actress, and he asked Clara to accompany 
              him. He told his mother to leave the key in the window for him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Shall I book seats?&quot; he asked of Clara.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes. And put on an evening suit, will you? I've never seenyou 
              in it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But, good Lord, Clara! Think of ME in evening suitat the 
              theatre!&quot; he remonstrated.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Would you rather not?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I will if you WANT me to; but I s'll feel a fool.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She laughed at him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then feel a fool for my sake, once, won't you?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The request made his blood flush up.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I suppose I s'll have to.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What are you taking a suitcase for?&quot; his mother asked.</p>
            <p>　　He blushed furiously.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Clara asked me,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And what seats are you going in?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Circle--three-and-six each!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, I'm sure!&quot; exclaimed his mother sarcastically.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's only once in the bluest of blue moons,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　He dressed at Jordan's, put on an overcoat and a cap, and metClara 
              in a cafe. She was with one of her suffragette friends. She wore 
              an old long coat, which did not suit her, and had a little wrapover 
              her head, which he hated. The three went to the theatre together.</p>
            <p>　　Clara took off her coat on the stairs, and he discovered shewas 
              in a sort of semi-evening dress, that left her arms and neckand 
              part of her breast bare. Her hair was done fashionably. The dress, 
              a simple thing of green crape, suited her. She lookedquite grand, 
              he thought. He could see her figure inside the frock,as if that 
              were wrapped closely round her. The firmness and thesoftness of 
              her upright body could almost be felt as he looked at her. He clenched 
              his fists.</p>
            <p>　　And he was to sit all the evening beside her beautiful naked 
              arm,watching the strong throat rise from the strong chest, watching 
              thebreasts under the green stuff, the curve of her limbs in the 
              tight dress. Something in him hated her again for submitting him 
              to this tortureof nearness. And he loved her as she balanced her 
              head and staredstraight in front of her, pouting, wistful, immobile, 
              as if sheyielded herself to her fate because it was too strong for 
              her. She could not help herself; she was in the grip of somethingbigger 
              than herself. A kind of eternal look about her, as if shewere a 
              wistful sphinx, made it necessary for him to kiss her. He dropped 
              his programme, and crouched down on the floor to get it,so that 
              he could kiss her hand and wrist. Her beauty was a tortureto him. 
              She sat immobile. Only, when the lights went down,she sank a little 
              against him, and he caressed her hand and armwith his fingers. He 
              could smell her faint perfume. All the timehis blood kept sweeping 
              up in great white-hot waves that killed hisconsciousness momentarily.</p>
            <p>　　The drama continued. He saw it all in the distance, going onsomewhere; 
              he did not know where, but it seemed far away inside him. He was 
              Clara's white heavy arms, her throat, her moving bosom. That seemed 
              to be himself. Then away somewhere the play went on,and he was identified 
              with that also. There was no himself. The grey and black eyes of 
              Clara, her bosom comingdown on him, her arm that he held gripped 
              between his hands,were all that existed. Then he felt himself small 
              and helpless,her towering in her force above him.</p>
            <p>　　Only the intervals, when the lights came up, hurt him expressibly. 
              He wanted to run anywhere, so long as it would be dark again. In 
              a maze, he wandered out for a drink. Then the lights were out,and 
              the strange, insane reality of Clara and the drama took hold ofhim 
              again.</p>
            <p>　　The play went on. But he was obsessed by the desire tokiss the 
              tiny blue vein that nestled in the bend of her arm. He could feel 
              it. His whole face seemed suspended till he hadput his lips there. 
              It must be done. And the other people! At last he bent quickly forward 
              and touched it with his lips. His moustache brushed the sensitive 
              flesh. Clara shivered, drew awayher arm.</p>
            <p>　　When all was over, the lights up, the people clapping,he came 
              to himself and looked at his watch. His train was gone.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I s'll have to walk home!&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　Clara looked at him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It is too late?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　He nodded. Then he helped her on with her coat.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I love you! You look beautiful in that dress,&quot; he 
              murmuredover her shoulder, among the throng of bustling people.</p>
            <p>　　She remained quiet. Together they went out of the theatre. He 
              saw the cabs waiting, the people passing. It seemed he meta pair 
              of brown eyes which hated him. But he did not know. He and Clara 
              turned away, mechanically taking the direction tothe station.</p>
            <p>　　The train had gone. He would have to walk the ten miles home.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It doesn't matter,&quot; he said. &quot;I shall enjoy it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Won't you,&quot; she said, flushing, &quot;come home for 
              the night? I can sleep with mother.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He looked at her. Their eyes met.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What will your mother say?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She won't mind.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You're sure?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Quite! &quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;SHALL I come?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;If you will.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Very well.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And they turned away. At the first stopping-place they tookthe 
              car. The wind blew fresh in their faces. The town was dark;the tram 
              tipped in its haste. He sat with her hand fast in his.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Will your mother be gone to bed?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She may be. I hope not.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They hurried along the silent, dark little street, the onlypeople 
              out of doors. Clara quickly entered the house. He hesitated.</p>
            <p>　　He leaped up the step and was in the room. Her mother appearedin 
              the inner doorway, large and hostile.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Who have you got there?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's Mr. Morel; he has missed his train. I thought we mightput 
              him up for the night, and save him a ten-mile walk.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;H'm,&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Radford. &quot;That's your lookout! 
              If you've invited him, he's very welcome as far as I'm concerned. 
              YOU keep the house!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;If you don't like me, I'll go away again,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nay, nay, you needn't! Come along in! I dunno what you'llthink 
              of the supper I'd got her.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　It was a little dish of chip potatoes and a piece of bacon. The 
              table was roughly laid for one.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You can have some more bacon,&quot; continued Mrs. Radford. 
              &quot;More chips you can't have.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's a shame to bother you,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, don't you be apologetic! It doesn't DO wi' me! You 
              treated herto the theatre, didn't you?&quot; There was a sarcasm 
              in the last question.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well?&quot; laughed Paul uncomfortably.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, and what's an inch of bacon! Take your coat off.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The big, straight-standing woman was trying to estimatethe situation. 
              She moved about the cupboard. Clara took his coat. The room was 
              very warm and cosy in the lamplight.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;My sirs!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Radford; &quot;but you two's 
              a pairof bright beauties, I must say! What's all that get-up for?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I believe we don't know,&quot; he said, feeling a victim.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;There isn't room in THIS house for two such bobby-dazzlers, 
              ifyou fly your kites THAT high!&quot; she rallied them. It was a 
              nasty thrust.</p>
            <p>　　He in his dinner jacket, and Clara in her green dressand bare 
              arms, were confused. They felt they must sheltereach other in that 
              little kitchen.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And look at THAT blossom! &quot; continued Mrs. Radford,pointing 
              to Clara. &quot;What does she reckon she did it for?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Paul looked at Clara. She was rosy; her neck was warmwith blushes. 
              There was a moment of silence.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You like to see it, don't you?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　The mother had them in her power. All the time his heartwas beating 
              hard, and he was tight with anxiety. But he wouldfight her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Me like to see it!&quot; exclaimed the old woman. &quot;What 
              should Ilike to see her make a fool of herself for?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I've seen people look bigger fools,&quot; he said. Clara 
              wasunder his protection now.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, ay! and when was that?&quot; came the sarcastic rejoinder.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;When they made frights of themselves,&quot; he answered.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Radford, large and threatening, stood suspendedon the hearthrug, 
              holding her fork.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;They're fools either road,&quot; she answered at length,turning 
              to the Dutch oven.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; he said, fighting stoutly. &quot;Folk ought to 
              look as wellas they can.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And do you call THAT looking nice!&quot; cried the mother,pointing 
              a scornful fork at Clara. &quot;That--that looks as if itwasn't 
              properly dressed!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I believe you're jealous that you can't swank as well,&quot;he 
              said laughing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Me! I could have worn evening dress with anybody, if I'dwanted 
              to!&quot; came the scornful answer.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And why didn't you want to?&quot; he asked pertinently. 
              &quot;Or DIDyou wear it?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　There was a long pause. Mrs. Radford readjusted the baconin the 
              Dutch oven. His heart beat fast, for fear he had offended her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Me!&quot; she exclaimed at last. &quot;No, I didn't! And 
              when I wasin service, I knew as soon as one of the maids came out 
              in bareshoulders what sort SHE was, going to her sixpenny hop!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Were you too good to go to a sixpenny hop?&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　Clara sat with bowed head. His eyes were dark and glittering. 
              Mrs. Radford took the Dutch oven from the fire, and stood near him,putting 
              bits of bacon on his plate.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;THERE'S a nice crozzly bit!&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't give me the best!&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;SHE'S got what SHE wants,&quot; was the answer.</p>
            <p>　　There was a sort of scornful forbearance in the woman's tonethat 
              made Paul know she was mollified.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But DO have some!&quot; he said to Clara.</p>
            <p>　　She looked up at him with her grey eyes, humiliated and lonely.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No thanks!&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why won't you?&quot; he answered carelessly.</p>
            <p>　　The blood was beating up like fire in his veins. Mrs. Radfordsat 
              down again, large and impressive and aloof. He left Claraaltogether 
              to attend to the mother.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;They say Sarah Bernhardt's fifty,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Fifty! She's turned sixty!&quot; came the scornful answer.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;you'd never think it! She made 
              me wantto howl even now.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I should like to see myself howling at THAT bad old baggage!&quot;said 
              Mrs. Radford. &quot;It's time she began to think herself a grandmother,not 
              a shrieking catamaran---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He laughed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;A catamaran is a boat the Malays use,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And it's a word as I use,&quot; she retorted.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;My mother does sometimes, and it's no good my telling her,&quot;he 
              said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I s'd think she boxes your ears,&quot; said Mrs. Radford,good-humouredly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She'd like to, and she says she will, so I give her a littlestool 
              to stand on.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;That's the worst of my mother,&quot; said Clara. &quot;She 
              never wantsa stool for anything.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But she often can't touch THAT lady with a long prop,&quot;retorted 
              Mrs. Radford to Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I s'd think she doesn't want touching with a prop,&quot; 
              he laughed. &quot;I shouldn't.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It might do the pair of you good to give you a crackon 
              the head with one,&quot; said the mother, laughing suddenly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why are you so vindictive towards me?&quot; he said. &quot;I've 
              notstolen anything from you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No; I'll watch that,&quot; laughed the older woman.</p>
            <p>　　Soon the supper was finished. Mrs. Radford sat guard in herchair. 
              Paul lit a cigarette. Clara went upstairs, returning with a sleeping-suit, 
              which she spread on the fender to air.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why, I'd forgot all about THEM!&quot; said Mrs. Radford. 
              &quot;Where have they sprung from?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Out of my drawer.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;H'm! You bought 'em for Baxter, an' he wouldn't wear 'em,would 
              he?&quot;--laughing. &quot;Said he reckoned to do wi'out trousers 
              i'bed.&quot; She turned confidentially to Paul, saying: &quot;He 
              couldn'tBEAR 'em, them pyjama things.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The young man sat making rings of smoke.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, it's everyone to his taste,&quot; he laughed.</p>
            <p>　　Then followed a little discussion of the merits of pyjamas.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;My mother loves me in them,&quot; he said. &quot;She says 
              I'm a pierrot.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I can imagine they'd suit you,&quot; said Mrs. Radford.</p>
            <p>　　After a while he glanced at the little clock that was tickingon 
              the mantelpiece. It was half-past twelve.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It is funny,&quot; he said, &quot;but it takes hours to 
              settle downto sleep after the theatre.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's about time you did,&quot; said Mrs. Radford, clearing 
              the table.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Are YOU tired?&quot; he asked of Clara.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Not the least bit,&quot; she answered, avoiding his eyes.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Shall we have a game at cribbage?&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I've forgotten it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, I'll teach you again. May we play crib, Mrs. Radford?&quot;he 
              asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You'll please yourselves,&quot; she said; &quot;but it's 
              pretty late.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;A game or so will make us sleepy,&quot; he answered.</p>
            <p>　　Clara brought the cards, and sat spinning her wedding-ring whilsthe 
              shuffled them. Mrs. Radford was washing up in the scullery. As it 
              grew later Paul felt the situation getting more and more tense.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Fifteen two, fifteen four, fifteen six, and two's eight---!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The clock struck one. Still the game continued. Mrs. Radfordhad 
              done all the little jobs preparatory to going to bed,had locked 
              the door and filled the kettle. Still Paul went ondealing and counting. 
              He was obsessed by Clara's arms and throat. He believed he could 
              see where the division was just beginningfor her breasts. He could 
              not leave her. She watched his hands,and felt her joints melt as 
              they moved quickly. She was so near;it was almost as if he touched 
              her, and yet not quite. His mettle was roused. He hated Mrs. Radford. 
              She sat on, nearly dropping asleep, but determined and obstinate 
              in her chair. Paul glanced at her, then at Clara. She met his eyes, 
              that were angry, mocking, and hard as steel. Her own answered him 
              in shame. He knew SHE, at any rate, was of his mind. He played on.</p>
            <p>　　At last Mrs. Radford roused herself stiffly, and said:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Isn't it nigh on time you two was thinking o' bed?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Paul played on without answering. He hated her sufficientlyto 
              murder her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Half a minute,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　The elder woman rose and sailed stubbornly into the scullery,returning 
              with his candle, which she put on the mantelpiece. Then she sat 
              down again. The hatred of her went so hot down his veins, he dropped 
              his cards.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;We'll stop, then,&quot; he said, but his voice was still 
              a challenge.</p>
            <p>　　Clara saw his mouth shut hard. Again he glanced at her. It seemed 
              like an agreement. She bent over the cards, coughing,to clear her 
              throat.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, I'm glad you've finished,&quot; said Mrs. Radford. 
              &quot;Here, take your things&quot;--she thrust the warm suit in 
              his hand--&quot;andthis is your candle. Your room's over this; there's 
              only two,so you can't go far wrong. Well, good-night. I hope you'll 
              rest well.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm sure I shall; I always do,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; and so you ought at your age,&quot; she replied.</p>
            <p>　　He bade good-night to Clara, and went. The twisting stairsof 
              white, scrubbed wood creaked and clanged at every step. He went 
              doggedly. The two doors faced each other. He went in his room,pushed 
              the door to, without fastening the latch.</p>
            <p>　　It was a small room with a large bed. Some of Clara'shair-pins 
              were on the dressing-table--her hair-brush. Her clothesand some 
              skirts hung under a cloth in a corner. There was actuallya pair 
              of stockings over a chair. He explored the room. Two books of his 
              own were there on the shelf. He undressed,folded his suit, and sat 
              on the bed, listening. Then he blewout the candle, lay down, and 
              in two minutes was almost asleep. Then click!--he was wide awake 
              and writhing in torment. It was as if,when he had nearly got to 
              sleep, something had bitten him suddenlyand sent him mad. He sat 
              up and looked at the room in the darkness,his feet doubled under 
              him, perfectly motionless, listening. He heard a cat somewhere away 
              outside; then the heavy, poised tread of the mother; then Clara's 
              distinct voice:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Will you unfasten my dress?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　There was silence for some time. At last the mother said:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Now then! aren't you coming up?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, not yet,&quot; replied the daughter calmly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, very well then! If it's not late enough, stop a bit 
              longer. Only you needn't come waking me up when I've got to sleep.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I shan't be long,&quot; said Clara.</p>
            <p>　　Immediately afterwards Paul heard the mother slowly mountingthe 
              stairs. The candlelight flashed through the cracks in his door. 
              Her dress brushed the door, and his heart jumped. Then it was dark,and 
              he heard the clatter of her latch. She was very leisurely indeedin 
              her preparations for sleep. After a long time it was quite still. 
              He sat strung up on the bed, shivering slightly. His door wasan 
              inch open. As Clara came upstairs, he would intercept her. He waited. 
              All was dead silence. The clock struck two. Then heheard a slight 
              scrape of the fender downstairs. Now he could nothelp himself. His 
              shivering was uncontrollable. He felt he must goor die.</p>
            <p>　　He stepped off the bed, and stood a moment, shuddering. Then 
              he went straight to the door. He tried to step lightly. The first 
              stair cracked like a shot. He listened. The old womanstirred in 
              her bed. The staircase was dark. There was a slitof light under 
              the stair-foot door, which opened into the kitchen. He stood a moment. 
              Then he went on, mechanically. Every step creaked,and his back was 
              creeping, lest the old woman's door should openbehind him up above. 
              He fumbled with the door at the bottom. The latch opened with a 
              loud clack. He went through into the kitchen,and shut the door noisily 
              behind him. The old woman daren'tcome now.</p>
            <p>　　Then he stood, arrested. Clara was kneeling on a pile of whiteunderclothing 
              on the hearthrug, her back towards him, warming herself. She did 
              not look round, but sat crouching on her heels, and herrounded beautiful 
              back was towards him, and her face was hidden. She was warming her 
              body at the fire for consolation. The glowwas rosy on one side, 
              the shadow was dark and warm on the other. Her arms hung slack.</p>
            <p>　　He shuddered violently, clenching his teeth and fists hardto 
              keep control. Then he went forward to her. He put one handon her 
              shoulder, the fingers of the other hand under her chin toraise her 
              face. A convulsed shiver ran through her, once, twice,at his touch. 
              She kept her head bent.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Sorry!&quot; he murmured, realising that his hands were 
              very cold.</p>
            <p>　　Then she looked up at him, frightened, like a thing that isafraid 
              of death.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;My hands are so cold,&quot; he murmured.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I like it,&quot; she whispered, closing her eyes.</p>
            <p>　　The breath of her words were on his mouth. Her arms claspedhis 
              knees. The cord of his sleeping-suit dangled against her and madeher 
              shiver. As the warmth went into him, his shuddering became less.</p>
            <p>　　At length, unable to stand so any more, he raised her, and sheburied 
              her head on his shoulder. His hands went over her slowlywith an 
              infinite tenderness of caress. She clung close to him,trying to 
              hide herself against him. He clasped her very fast. Then at last 
              she looked at him, mute, imploring, looking to see if shemust be 
              ashamed.</p>
            <p>　　His eyes were dark, very deep, and very quiet. It was as if herbeauty 
              and his taking it hurt him, made him sorrowful. He looked ather 
              with a little pain, and was afraid. He was so humble before her. 
              She kissed him fervently on the eyes, first one, then the other,and 
              she folded herself to him. She gave herself. He held her fast. It 
              was a moment intense almost to agony.</p>
            <p>　　She stood letting him adore her and tremble with joy of her. 
              It healed her hurt pride. It healed her; it made her glad. It madeher 
              feel erect and proud again. Her pride had been wounded inside her. 
              She had been cheapened. Now she radiated with joy and pride again. 
              It was her restoration and her recognition.</p>
            <p>　　Then he looked at her, his face radiant. They laughed toeach 
              other, and he strained her to his chest. The seconds ticked off,the 
              minutes passed, and still the two stood clasped rigid together,mouth 
              to mouth, like a statue in one block.</p>
            <p>　　But again his fingers went seeking over her, restless,wandering, 
              dissatisfied. The hot blood came up wave upon wave. She laid her 
              head on his shoulder.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Come you to my room,&quot; he murmured.</p>
            <p>　　She looked at him and shook her head, her mouth poutingdisconsolately, 
              her eyes heavy with passion. He watched her fixedly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes!&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　Again she shook her head.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why not?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　She looked at him still heavily, sorrowfully, and again sheshook 
              her head. His eyes hardened, and he gave way.</p>
            <p>　　When, later on, he was back in bed, he wondered why she hadrefused 
              to come to him openly, so that her mother would know. At any rate, 
              then things would have been definite. And she couldhave stayed with 
              him the night, without having to go, as she was,to her mother's 
              bed. It was strange, and he could not understand it. And then almost 
              immediately he fell asleep.</p>
            <p>　　He awoke in the morning with someone speaking to him. Opening 
              his eyes, he saw Mrs. Radford, big and stately, looking downon him. 
              She held a cup of tea in her hand.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you think you're going to sleep till Doomsday?&quot; 
              she said.</p>
            <p>　　He laughed at once.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It ought only to be about five o'clock,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well,&quot; she answered, &quot;it's half-past seven, whether 
              or not. Here, I've brought you a cup of tea.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He rubbed his face, pushed the tumbled hair off his forehead,and 
              roused himself.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What's it so late for!&quot; he grumbled.</p>
            <p>　　He resented being wakened. It amused her. She saw his neckin 
              the flannel sleeping-jacket, as white and round as a girl's. Herubbed 
              his hair crossly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's no good your scratching your head,&quot; she said. 
              &quot;It won't make it no earlier. Here, an' how long d'you think 
              I'mgoing to stand waiting wi' this here cup?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, dash the cup!&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You should go to bed earlier,&quot; said the woman.</p>
            <p>　　He looked up at her, laughing with impudence.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I went to bed before YOU did,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, my Guyney, you did!&quot; she exclaimed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Fancy,&quot; he said, stirring his tea, &quot;having tea 
              brought to bedto me! My mother'll think I'm ruined for life.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't she never do it?&quot; asked Mrs. Radford.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She'd as leave think of flying.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ah, I always spoilt my lot! That's why they've turned outsuch 
              bad uns,&quot; said the elderly woman.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You'd only Clara,&quot; he said. &quot;And Mr. Radford's 
              in heaven. So I suppose there's only you left to be the bad un.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm not bad; I'm only soft,&quot; she said, as she went 
              outof the bedroom. &quot;I'm only a fool, I am!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Clara was very quiet at breakfast, but she had a sort of airof 
              proprietorship over him that pleased him infinitely. Mrs. Radfordwas 
              evidently fond of him. He began to talk of his painting.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What's the good,&quot; exclaimed the mother, &quot;of your 
              whittlingand worrying and twistin' and too-in' at that painting 
              of yours? What GOOD does it do you, I should like to know? You'd 
              betterbe enjoyin' yourself.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, but,&quot; exclaimed Paul, &quot;I made over thirty 
              guineas last year.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Did you! Well, that's a consideration, but it's nothingto 
              the time you put in.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And I've got four pounds owing. A man said he'd give me 
              fivepounds if I'd paint him and his missis and the dog and the cottage. 
              And I went and put the fowls in instead of the dog, and he was waxy,so 
              I had to knock a quid off. I was sick of it, and I didn't likethe 
              dog. I made a picture of it. What shall I do when he pays methe 
              four pounds?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nay! you know your own uses for your money,&quot; said 
              Mrs. Radford.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But I'm going to bust this four pounds. Should we goto 
              the seaside for a day or two?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Who?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You and Clara and me.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What, on your money!&quot; she exclaimed, half-wrathful.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;YOU wouldn't be long in breaking your neck at a hurdle 
              race!&quot;she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;So long as I get a good run for my money! Will you?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nay; you may settle that atween you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And you're willing?&quot; he asked, amazed and rejoicing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You'll do as you like,&quot; said Mrs. Radford, &quot;whether 
              I'mwilling or not.&quot;</p>

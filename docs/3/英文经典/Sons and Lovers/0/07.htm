            <p>　　Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle and 
              fine,perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest. It was the rulethat 
              Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons. The colliersof 
              the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually. All the 
              earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty,as contractor, 
              and he divided the wages again, either in thepublic-house or in 
              his own home. So that the children couldfetch the money, school 
              closed early on Friday afternoons. Each of the Morel children--William, 
              then Annie, then Paul--had fetchedthe money on Friday afternoons, 
              until they went themselves to work. Paul used to set off at half-past 
              three, with a little calico bagin his pocket. Down all the paths, 
              women, girls, children, and menwere seen trooping to the offices.</p>
            <p>　　These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,almost 
              like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end ofGreenhill 
              Lane. The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare roompaved with 
              blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall. Here 
              sat the colliers in their pit-dirt. They had come up early. The 
              women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths. 
              Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,because 
              in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots. Therewas a sound 
              of many voices. The women had on their Sunday hats. The girls chattered 
              loudly. Little dogs ran here and there. The green shrubs were silent 
              all around.</p>
            <p>　　Then from inside came the cry &quot;Spinney Park--Spinney Park.&quot; 
              All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside. When it was timefor 
              Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd. The pay-roomwas 
              quite small. A counter went across, dividing it into half. Behind 
              the counter stood two men--Mr. Braithwaite and his clerk,Mr. Winterbottom. 
              Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the sternpatriarch in appearance, 
              having a rather thin white beard. He was usually muffled in an enormous 
              silk neckerchief, and rightup to the hot summer a huge fire burned 
              in the open grate. No window was open. Sometimes in winter the air 
              scorched the throatsof the people, coming in from the freshness. 
              Mr. Winterbottomwas rather small and fat, and very bald. He made 
              remarks that werenot witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal 
              admonitionsagainst the colliers.</p>
            <p>　　The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who hadbeen 
              home and changed, and women, and one or two children, and usuallya 
              dog. Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to be jammedbehind 
              the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched him. He knew the 
              order of the names--they went according to stall number.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Holliday,&quot; came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite. 
              Then Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Bower--John Bower.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　A boy stepped to the counter. Mr. Braithwaite, large and irascible,glowered 
              at him over his spectacles.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;John Bower!&quot; he repeated.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's me,&quot; said the boy.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that,&quot; 
              said glossyMr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter. The people 
              tittered,thinking of John Bower senior.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;How is it your father's not come!&quot; said Mr. Braithwaite,in 
              a large and magisterial voice.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He's badly,&quot; piped the boy.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You should tell him to keep off the drink,&quot; pronounced 
              thegreat cashier.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer,&quot; said 
              a mockingvoice from behind.</p>
            <p>　　All the men laughed. The large and important cashier lookeddown 
              at his next sheet.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Fred Pilkington!&quot; he called, quite indifferent.</p>
            <p>　　Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.</p>
            <p>　　Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat. 
              He was pushed against the chimney-piece. His calves were burning. 
              But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Walter Morel!&quot; came the ringing voice.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Here!&quot; piped Paul, small and inadequate.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Morel--Walter Morel!&quot; the cashier repeated, his fingerand 
              thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.</p>
            <p>　　Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and couldnot 
              or would not shout. The backs of the men obliterated him. Then Mr. 
              Winterbottom came to the rescue.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He's here. Where is he? Morel's lad?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes. He 
              pointed at the fireplace. The colliers looked round, moved aside,and 
              disclosed the boy.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Here he is!&quot; said Mr. Winterbottom.</p>
            <p>　　Paul went to the counter.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence. Why don't youshout 
              up when you're called?&quot; said Mr. Braithwaite. He bangedon to 
              the invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicateand pretty 
              movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold,and plumped 
              it beside the silver. The gold slid in a bright streamover the paper. 
              The cashier finished counting off the money;the boy dragged the 
              whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,to whom the stoppages 
              for rent and tools must be paid. Here hesuffered again.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Sixteen an' six,&quot; said Mr. Winterbottom.</p>
            <p>　　The lad was too much upset to count. He pushed forward someloose 
              silver and half a sovereign.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;How much do you think you've given me?&quot; asked Mr. 
              Winterbottom.</p>
            <p>　　The boy looked at him, but said nothing. He had not thefaintest 
              notion.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Haven't you got a tongue in your head?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?&quot; 
              he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nowt but algibbra an' French,&quot; said a collier.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;An' cheek an' impidence,&quot; said another.</p>
            <p>　　Paul was keeping someone waiting. With trembling fingers hegot 
              his money into the bag and slid out. He suffered the torturesof 
              the damned on these occasions.</p>
            <p>　　His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along theMansfield 
              Road, was infinite. On the park wall the mosses were green. There 
              were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the appletrees 
              of an orchard. The colliers were walking home in a stream. The boy 
              went near the wall, self-consciously. He knew many of the men,but 
              could not recognise them in their dirt. And this was a newtorture 
              to him.</p>
            <p>　　When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was notyet 
              come. Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him. His grandmother,Morel's 
              mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Your father's not come yet,&quot; said the landlady, in 
              the peculiarhalf-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who 
              talks chieflyto grown men. &quot;Sit you down.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar. Some colliers 
              were &quot;reckoning&quot;--sharing out their money--in a corner;others 
              came in. They all glanced at the boy without speaking. At last Morel 
              came; brisk, and with something of an air, even inhis blackness.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Hello!&quot; he said rather tenderly to his son. &quot;Have 
              you bested me? Shall you have a drink of something?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists,and 
              he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before allthe 
              men than in having a tooth drawn.</p>
            <p>　　The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,and 
              at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality. Paul went 
              home, glowering. He entered the house silently. Friday was baking 
              day, and there was usually a hot bun. His motherput it before him.</p>
            <p>　　Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm NOT going to the office any more,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why, what's the matter?&quot; his mother asked in surprise. 
              His sudden rages rather amused her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm NOT going any more,&quot; he declared.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, very well, tell your father so.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He chewed his bun as if he hated it.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm not--I'm not going to fetch the money.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enoughof 
              the sixpence,&quot; said Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　This sixpence was Paul's only income. It mostly went in buyingbirthday 
              presents; but it WAS an income, and he treasured it. But---</p>
            <p>　　&quot;They can have it, then!&quot; he said. &quot;I don't want 
              it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, very well,&quot; said his mother. &quot;But you needn't 
              bully MEabout it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are,and 
              I'm not going any more. Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an'Mr. 
              Winterbottom says 'You was'.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And is that why you won't go any more?&quot; smiled Mrs. 
              Morel.</p>
            <p>　　The boy was silent for some time. His face was pale, his eyesdark 
              and furious. His mother movedabout at her work, taking no notice 
              of him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out,&quot;he 
              said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, my lad, you've only to ASK them,&quot; she replied.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach 
              youat the Board-school?'&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;They never taught HIM much,&quot; said Mrs. Morel, &quot;that 
              is a fact--neither manners nor wit--and his cunning he was born 
              with.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　So, in her own way, she soothed him. His ridiculous hypersensitiveness 
              made herheart ache. And sometimes the fury in his eyesroused her, 
              made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment, surprised.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What was the cheque?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteenand six 
              stoppages,&quot; replied the boy. &quot;It's a good week;and only 
              five shillings stoppages for my father.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,and 
              could call him to account if he gave her short money. Morel always 
              kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.</p>
            <p>　　Friday was the baking night and market night. It was therule 
              that Paul should stay at home and bake. He loved to stopin and draw 
              or read; he was very fond of drawing. Annie always&quot;gallivanted&quot; 
              on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual. So the boy 
              remained alone.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel loved her marketing. In the tiny market-place onthe 
              top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,Ilkeston 
              and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected. Brakes ranin from 
              surrounding villages. The market-place was full of women,the streets 
              packed with men. It was amazing to see so many meneverywhere in 
              the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled withher lace woman, sympathised 
              with her fruit man--who was a gabey,but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed 
              with the fish man--who wasa scamp but so droll--put the linoleum 
              man in his place, was coldwith the odd-wares man, and only went 
              to the crockery man when shewas driven--or drawn by the cornflowers 
              on a little dish; then shewas coldly polite.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I wondered how much that little dish was,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Sevenpence to you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leavethe 
              market-place without it. Again she went by where the potslay coldly 
              on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,pretending not 
              to.</p>
            <p>　　She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume. Her 
              bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Mother!&quot; the girl implored, &quot;don't wear that 
              nubbly little bonnet.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then what else shall I wear,&quot; replied the mother tartly. 
              &quot;And I'm sure it's right enough.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now wasreduced 
              to black lace and a bit of jet.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It looks rather come down,&quot; said Paul. &quot;Couldn't 
              you giveit a pick-me-up?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'll jowl your head for impudence,&quot; said Mrs. Morel, 
              and shetied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her 
              chin.</p>
            <p>　　She glanced at the dish again. Both she and her enemy,the pot 
              man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were somethingbetween 
              them. Suddenly he shouted:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you want it for fivepence?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She started. Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and tookup 
              her dish.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'll have it,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yer'll do me the favour, like?&quot; he said. &quot;Yer'd 
              better spitin it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't see you give it me,&quot; she said. &quot;You wouldn't 
              let mehave it for fivepence if you didn't want to.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself 
              luckyif you can give your things away,&quot; he growled.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; there are bad times, and good,&quot; said Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　But she had forgiven the pot man. They were friends. She dare 
              now finger his pots. So she was happy.</p>
            <p>　　Paul was waiting for her. He loved her home-coming. Shewas always 
              her best so--triumphant, tired, laden with parcels,feeling rich 
              in spirit. He heard her quick, light step in the entryand looked 
              up from his drawing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh!&quot; she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;My word, you ARE loaded!&quot; he exclaimed, putting down 
              his brush.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I am!&quot; she gasped. &quot;That brazen Annie said she'd 
              meet me. SUCH a weight!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Is the bread done?&quot; she asked, going to the oven.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;The last one is soaking,&quot; he replied. &quot;You needn't 
              look,I've not forgotten it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, that pot man!&quot; she said, closing the oven door. 
              &quot;You know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think 
              he'squite so bad.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't you?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The boy was attentive to her. She took off her littleblack bonnet.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No. I think he can't make any money--well, it's everybody'scry 
              alike nowadays--and it makes him disagreeable.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It would ME,&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, one can't wonder at it. And he let me have--how muchdo 
              you think he let me have THIS for?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stoodlooking 
              on it with joy.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Show me!&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　The two stood together gloating over the dish.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I LOVE cornflowers on things,&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;One and three,&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Fivepence!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's not enough, mother.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No. Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it. But I'dbeen 
              extravagant, I couldn't afford any more. And he needn'thave let 
              me have it if he hadn't wanted to.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, he needn't, need he,&quot; said Paul, and the two comfortedeach 
              other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;We c'n have stewed fruit in it,&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Or custard, or a jelly,&quot; said his mother.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Or radishes and lettuce,&quot; said he.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't forget that bread,&quot; she said, her voice bright 
              with glee.</p>
            <p>　　Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's done,&quot; he said, giving it to her.</p>
            <p>　　She tapped it also.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied, going to unpack her bag. &quot;Oh, 
              and I'ma wicked, extravagant woman. I know I s'll come to want.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance. 
              She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots 
              ofpansies and of crimson daisies.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Four penn'orth!&quot; she moaned.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;How CHEAP!&quot; he cried.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, but I couldn't afford it THIS week of all weeks.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But lovely!&quot; he cried.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Aren't they!&quot; she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy. 
              &quot;Paul, look at this yellow one, isn't it--and a face just like 
              anold man!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Just!&quot; cried Paul, stooping to sniff. &quot;And smells 
              that nice! But he's a bit splashed.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefullywashed 
              the pansy.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;NOW look at him now he's wet!&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes!&quot; she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.</p>
            <p>　　The children of Scargill Street felt quite select. At theend 
              where the Morels lived there were not many young things. So the 
              few were more united. Boys and girls played together,the girls joining 
              in the fights and the rough games, the boys takingpart in the dancing 
              games and rings and make-belief of the girls.</p>
            <p>　　Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings,when it was 
              not wet. They stayed indoors till the collierswere all gone home, 
              till it was thick dark, and the street wouldbe deserted. Then they 
              tied their scarves round their necks,for they scorned overcoats, 
              as all the colliers' children did,and went out. The entry was very 
              dark, and at the end the wholegreat night opened out, in a hollow, 
              with a little tangle of lightsbelow where Minton pit lay, and another 
              far away opposite for Selby. The farthest tiny lights seemed to 
              stretch out the darkness for ever. The children looked anxiously 
              down the road at the one lamp-post,which stood at the end of the 
              field path. If the little,luminous space were deserted, the two 
              boys felt genuine desolation. They stood with their hands in their 
              pockets under the lamp,turning their backs on the night, quite miserable, 
              watching thedark houses. Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat 
              was seen,and a long-legged girl came flying up.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　But it did not matter so much--there were three now. They setup 
              a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling. 
              Then the play went fast and furious.</p>
            <p>　　There was only this one lamp-post. Behind was the great scoopof 
              darkness, as if all the night were there. In front, another wide,dark 
              way opened over the hill brow. Occasionally somebody cameout of 
              this way and went into the field down the path. In a dozenyards 
              the night had swallowed them. The children played on.</p>
            <p>　　They were brought exceedingly close together owing totheir isolation. 
              If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt. Arthur was very 
              touchy, and Billy Pillins--really Philips--was worse. Then Paul 
              had to side with Arthur, and on Paul's side went Alice,while Billy 
              Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to backhim up. Then 
              the six would fight, hate with a fury of hatred,and flee home in 
              terror. Paul never forgot, after one of these fierceinternecine 
              fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly,between the 
              waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird. And he 
              thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood. And 
              the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins. And 
              then the wild, intense games went on again under the lamp-post,surrounded 
              by so much darkness. Mrs. Morel, going into her parlour,would hear 
              the children singing away:</p>
            <p>　　 &quot;My shoes are made of Spanish leather, My socks are made 
              of silk; I wear a ring on every finger, I wash myself in milk.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices 
              cameout of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures singing. 
              It stirred the mother; and she understood when they came in at eighto'clock, 
              ruddy, with brilliant eyes, and quick, passionate speech.</p>
            <p>　　They all loved the Scargill Street house for its openness,for 
              the great scallop of the world it had in view. On summer eveningsthe 
              women would stand against the field fence, gossiping, facingthe 
              west, watching the sunsets flare quickly out, till the Derbyshirehills 
              ridged across the crimson far away, like the black crestof a newt.</p>
            <p>　　In this summer season the pits never turned full time,particularly 
              the soft coal. Mrs. Dakin, who lived next doorto Mrs. Morel, going 
              to the field fence to shake her hearthrug,would spy men coming slowly 
              up the hill. She saw at once theywere colliers. Then she waited, 
              a tall, thin, shrew-faced woman,standing on the hill brow, almost 
              like a menace to the poor collierswho were toiling up. It was only 
              eleven o'clock. From the far-offwooded hills the haze that hangs 
              like fine black crape at the backof a summer morning had not yet 
              dissipated. The first man cameto the stile. &quot;Chock-chock!&quot; 
              went the gate under his thrust.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What, han' yer knocked off?&quot; cried Mrs. Dakin.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;We han, missis.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's a pity as they letn yer goo,&quot; she said sarcastically.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It is that,&quot; replied the man.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nay, you know you're flig to come up again,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　And the man went on. Mrs. Dakin, going up her yard,spied Mrs. 
              Morel taking the ashes to the ash-pit.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I reckon Minton's knocked off, missis,&quot; she cried.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Isn't it sickenin!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Morel in wrath.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ha! But I'n just seed Jont Hutchby.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;They might as well have saved their shoe-leather,&quot;said 
              Mrs. Morel. And both women went indoors disgusted.</p>
            <p>　　The colliers, their faces scarcely blackened, were troopinghome 
              again. Morel hated to go back. He loved the sunny morning. But he 
              had gone to pit to work, and to be sent home again spoilthis temper.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Good gracious, at this time!&quot; exclaimed his wife, 
              as he entered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Can I help it, woman?&quot; he shouted.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And I've not done half enough dinner.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then I'll eat my bit o' snap as I took with me,&quot;he 
              bawled pathetically. He felt ignominious and sore.</p>
            <p>　　And the children, coming home from school, would wonder to seetheir 
              father eating with his dinner the two thick slices of ratherdry 
              and dirty bread-and-butter that had been to pit and back.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What's my dad eating his snap for now?&quot; asked Arthur.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I should ha'e it holled at me if I didna,&quot; snorted 
              Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What a story!&quot; exclaimed his wife.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;An' is it goin' to be wasted?&quot; said Morel. &quot;I'm 
              not sucha extravagant mortal as you lot, with your waste. If I dropa 
              bit of bread at pit, in all the dust an' dirt, I pick it up an'eat 
              it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;The mice would eat it,&quot; said Paul. &quot;It wouldn't 
              be wasted.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Good bread-an'-butter's not for mice, either,&quot; said 
              Morel. &quot;Dirty or not dirty, I'd eat it rather than it should 
              be wasted.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You might leave it for the mice and pay for it out of yournext 
              pint,&quot; said Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, might I?&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
            <p>　　They were very poor that autumn. William had just gone awayto 
              London, and his mother missed his money. He sent ten shillings onceor 
              twice, but he had many things to pay for at first. His letterscame 
              regularly once a week. He wrote a good deal to his mother,telling 
              her all his life, how he made friends, and was exchanginglessons 
              with a Frenchman, how he enjoyed London. His mother feltagain he 
              was remaining to her just as when he was at home. She wroteto him 
              every week her direct, rather witty letters. All day long,as she 
              cleaned the house, she thought of him. He was in London: he would 
              do well. Almost, he was like her knight who wore HERfavour in the 
              battle.</p>
            <p>　　He was coming at Christmas for five days. There had neverbeen 
              such preparations. Paul and Arthur scoured the landfor holly and 
              evergreens. Annie made the pretty paper hoopsin the old-fashioned 
              way. And there was unheard-of extravagancein the larder. Mrs. Morel 
              made a big and magnificent cake. Then, feeling queenly, she showed 
              Paul how to blanch almonds. He skinned the long nuts reverently, 
              counting them all, to see notone was lost. It was said that eggs 
              whisked better in a cold place. So the boy stood in the scullery, 
              where the temperature was nearlyat freezing-point, and whisked and 
              whisked, and flew in excitementto his mother as the white of egg 
              grew stiffer and more snowy.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Just look, mother! Isn't it lovely?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And he balanced a bit on his nose, then blew it in the air.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Now, don't waste it,&quot; said the mother.</p>
            <p>　　Everybody was mad with excitement. William was coming onChristmas 
              Eve. Mrs. Morel surveyed her pantry. There was a bigplum cake, and 
              a rice cake, jam tarts, lemon tarts, and mince-pies--two enormous 
              dishes. She was finishing cooking--Spanish tartsand cheese-cakes. 
              Everywhere was decorated. The kissing bunchof berried holly hung 
              with bright and glittering things, spun slowlyover Mrs. Morel's 
              head as she trimmed her little tarts in the kitchen. A great fire 
              roared. There was a scent of cooked pastry. He was dueat seven o'clock, 
              but he would be late. The three children had goneto meet him. She 
              was alone. But at a quarter to seven Morel camein again. Neither 
              wife nor husband spoke. He sat in his armchair,quite awkward with 
              excitement, and she quietly went on with her baking. Only by the 
              careful way in which she did things could it be toldhow much moved 
              she was. The clock ticked on.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What time dost say he's coming?&quot; Morel asked for the 
              fifth time.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;The train gets in at half-past six,&quot; she replied emphatically.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then he'll be here at ten past seven.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Eh, bless you, it'll be hours late on the Midland,&quot;she 
              said indifferently. But she hoped, by expecting him late,to bring 
              him early. Morel went down the entry to look for him. Then he came 
              back.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Goodness, man!&quot; she said. &quot;You're like an ill-sitting 
              hen.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Hadna you better be gettin' him summat t' eat ready?&quot;asked 
              the father.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;There's plenty of time,&quot; she answered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;There's not so much as I can see on,&quot; he answered,turning 
              crossly in his chair. She began to clear her table. The kettle was 
              singing. They waited and waited.</p>
            <p>　　Meantime the three children were on the platform at Sethley Bridge,on 
              the Midland main line, two miles from home. They waited one hour. 
              A train came--he was not there. Down the line the red and greenlights 
              shone. It was very dark and very cold.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ask him if the London train's come,&quot; said Paul to 
              Annie,when they saw a man in a tip cap.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm not,&quot; said Annie. &quot;You be quiet--he might 
              send us off.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　But Paul was dying for the man to know they were expectingsomeone 
              by the London train: it sounded so grand. Yet he was muchtoo much 
              scared of broaching any man, let alone one in a peaked cap,to dare 
              to ask. The three children could scarcely go into thewaiting-room 
              for fear of being sent away, and for fearsomething should happen 
              whilst they were off the platform. Still they waited in the dark 
              and cold.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's an hour an' a half late,&quot; said Arthur pathetically.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well,&quot; said Annie, &quot;it's Christmas Eve.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They all grew silent. He wasn't coming. They lookeddown the darkness 
              of the railway. There was London! It seemedthe utter-most of distance. 
              They thought anything might happenif one came from London. They 
              were all too troubled to talk. Cold, and unhappy, and silent, they 
              huddled together on the platform.</p>
            <p>　　At last, after more than two hours, they saw the lights of anengine 
              peering round, away down the darkness. A porter ran out. The children 
              drew back with beating hearts. A great train,bound for Manchester, 
              drew up. Two doors opened, and from oneof them, William. They flew 
              to him. He handed parcels to themcheerily, and immediately began 
              to explain that this great train hadstopped for HIS sake at such 
              a small station as Sethley Bridge: it was not booked to stop.</p>
            <p>　　Meanwhile the parents were getting anxious. The table was set,the 
              chop was cooked, everything was ready. Mrs. Morel put onher black 
              apron. She was wearing her best dress. Then she sat,pretending to 
              read. The minutes were a torture to her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;H'm!&quot; said Morel. &quot;It's an hour an' a ha'ef.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And those children waiting!&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Th' train canna ha' come in yet,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I tell you, on Christmas Eve they're HOURS wrong.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They were both a bit cross with each other, so gnawedwith anxiety. 
              The ash tree moaned outside in a cold, raw wind. And all that space 
              of night from London home! Mrs. Morel suffered. The slight click 
              of the works inside the clock irritated her. It was getting so late; 
              it was getting unbearable.</p>
            <p>　　At last there was a sound of voices, and a footstep in the entry.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ha's here!&quot; cried Morel, jumping up.</p>
            <p>　　Then he stood back. The mother ran a few steps towardsthe door 
              and waited. There was a rush and a patter of feet,the door burst 
              open. William was there. He dropped his Gladstonebag and took his 
              mother in his arms.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Mater!&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;My boy!&quot; she cried.</p>
            <p>　　And for two seconds, no longer, she clasped him and kissed him. 
              Then she withdrew and said, trying to be quite normal:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But how late you are!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Aren't I!&quot; he cried, turning to his father. &quot;Well, 
              dad!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The two men shook hands.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, my lad!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Morel's eyes were wet.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;We thought tha'd niver be commin',&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, I'd come!&quot; exclaimed William.</p>
            <p>　　Then the son turned round to his mother.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But you look well,&quot; she said proudly, laughing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I should think so--coming 
              home!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He was a fine fellow, big, straight, and fearless-looking. Helooked 
              round at the evergreens and the kissing bunch, and the littletarts 
              that lay in their tins on the hearth.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;By jove! mother, it's not different!&quot; he said, as 
              if in relief.</p>
            <p>　　Everybody was still for a second. Then he suddenly sprang forward,picked 
              a tart from the hearth, and pushed it whole into his mouth.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, did iver you see such a parish oven!&quot; the father 
              exclaimed.</p>
            <p>　　He had brought them endless presents. Every penny he had he hadspent 
              on them. There was a sense of luxury overflowing in the house. For 
              his mother there was an umbrella with gold on the pale handle. She 
              kept it to her dying day, and would have lost anything ratherthan 
              that. Everybody had something gorgeous, and besides, there werepounds 
              of unknown sweets: Turkish delight, crystallised pineapple,and such-like 
              things which, the children thought, only the splendourof London 
              could provide. And Paul boasted of these sweets amonghis friends.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Real pineapple, cut off in slices, and then turned intocrystal--fair 
              grand!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Everybody was mad with happiness in the family. Home was home,and 
              they loved it with a passion of love, whatever the sufferinghad 
              been. There were parties, there were rejoicings. People camein to 
              see William, to see what difference London had made to him. And 
              they all found him &quot;such a gentleman, and SUCH a fine fellow,my 
              word&quot;!</p>
            <p>　　When he went away again the children retired to various placesto 
              weep alone. Morel went to bed in misery, and Mrs. Morel felt asif 
              she were numbed by some drug, as if her feelings were paralysed. 
              She loved him passionately.</p>
            <p>　　He was in the office of a lawyer connected with a largeshipping 
              firm, and at the midsummer his chief offered him a tripin the Mediterranean 
              on one of the boats, for quite a small cost. Mrs. Morel wrote: &quot;Go, 
              go, my boy. You may never have a chance again,and I should love 
              to think of you cruising there in the Mediterraneanalmost better 
              than to have you at home.&quot; But William came home forhis fortnight's 
              holiday. Not even the Mediterranean, which pulledat all his young 
              man's desire to travel, and at his poor man's wonderat the glamorous 
              south, could take him away when he might come home. That compensated 
              his mother for much.</p>

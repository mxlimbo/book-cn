            <p>　　Clara glanced round negligently. She was making an elasticstocking 
              of heliotrope silk, turning the Spiral machine with slow,balanced 
              regularity, occasionally bending down to see her work or toadjust 
              the needles; then her magnificent neck, with its down and finepencils 
              of hair, shone white against the lavender, lustrous silk. She tumed 
              a few more rounds, and stopped.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What did you say?&quot; she asked, smiling sweetly.</p>
            <p>　　Paul's eyes glittered at her insolent indifference to him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I did not know you read French,&quot; he said, very polite.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Did you not?&quot; she replied, with a faint, sarcastic 
              smile.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Rotten swank!&quot; he said, but scarcely loud enough to 
              be heard.</p>
            <p>　　He shut his mouth angrily as he watched her. She seemedto scorn 
              the work she mechanically produced; yet the hose shemade were as 
              nearly perfect as possible.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You don't like Spiral work,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, well, all work is work,&quot; she answered, as if she 
              knewall about it.</p>
            <p>　　He marvelled at her coldness. He had to do everything hotly. 
              She must be something special.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What would you prefer to do?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　She laughed at him indulgently, as she said:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;There is so little likelihood of my ever being given a 
              choice,that I haven't wasted time considering.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Pah!&quot; he said, contemptuous on his side now. &quot;You 
              only saythat because you're too proud to own up what you want and 
              can't get.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You know me very well,&quot; she replied coldly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I know you think you're terrific great shakes, and that 
              youlive under the eternal insult of working in a factory.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He was very angry and very rude. She merely tumed away fromhim 
              in disdain. He walked whistling down the room, flirted andlaughed 
              with Hilda.</p>
            <p>　　Later on he said to himself:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What was I so impudent to Clara for?&quot; He was rather 
              annoyedwith himself, at the same time glad. &quot;Serve her right; 
              she stinkswith silent pride,&quot; he said to himself angrily.</p>
            <p>　　In the afternoon he came down. There was a certain weighton his 
              heart which he wanted to remove. He thought to do itby offering 
              her chocolates.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Have one?&quot; he said. &quot;I bought a handful to sweeten 
              me up.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　To his great relief, she accepted. He sat on the work-benchbeside 
              her machine, twisting a piece of silk round his finger. She loved 
              him for his quick, unexpected movements, like a young animal. His 
              feet swung as he pondered. The sweets lay strewn on the bench. She 
              bent over her machine, grinding rhythmically, then stoopingto see 
              the stocking that hung beneath, pulled down by the weight. He watched 
              the handsome crouching of her back, and the apron-stringscurling 
              on the floor.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;There is always about you,&quot; he said, &quot;a sort 
              of waiting. Whatever I see you doing, you're not really there: you 
              arewaiting--like Penelope when she did her weaving.&quot; He could 
              not helpa spurt of wickedness. &quot;I'll call you Penelope,&quot; 
              he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Would it make any difference?&quot; she said, carefully 
              removingone of her needles.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;That doesn't matter, so long as it pleases me. Here, I 
              say,you seem to forget I'm your boss. It just occurs to me.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And what does that mean?&quot; she asked coolly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It means I've got a right to boss you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Is there anything you want to complain about?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, I say, you needn't be nasty,&quot; he said angrily.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know what you want,&quot; she said, continuing 
              her task.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I want you to treat me nicely and respectfully.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Call you 'sir', perhaps?&quot; she asked quietly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, call me 'sir'. I should love it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then I wish you would go upstairs, sir.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　His mouth closed, and a frown came on his face. He jumpedsuddenly 
              down.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You're too blessed superior for anything,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　And he went away to the other girls. He felt he was beingangrier 
              than he had any need to be. In fact, he doubted slightlythat he 
              was showing off. But if he were, then he would. Clara heardhim laughing, 
              in a way she hated, with the girls down the next room.</p>
            <p>　　When at evening he went through the department afterthe girls 
              had gone, he saw his chocolates lying untouchedin front of Clara's 
              machine. He left them. In the morningthey were still there, and 
              Clara was at work. Later on Minnie,a little brunette they called 
              Pussy, called to him:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Hey, haven't you got a chocolate for anybody?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Sorry, Pussy,&quot; he replied. &quot;I meant to have offered 
              them;then I went and forgot 'em.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I think you did,&quot; she answered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'll bring you some this afternoon. You don't want themafter 
              they've been lying about, do you?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, I'm not particular,&quot; smiled Pussy.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh no,&quot; he said. &quot;They'll be dusty.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He went up to Clara's bench.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Sorry I left these things littering about,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　She flushed scarlet. He gathered them together in his fist.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;They'll be dirty now,&quot; he said. &quot;You should have 
              taken them. I wonder why you didn't. I meant to have told you I 
              wanted you to.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He flung them out of the window into the yard below. He just 
              glanced at her. She winced from his eyes.</p>
            <p>　　In the afternoon he brought another packet.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Will you take some?&quot; he said, offering them first 
              to Clara. &quot;These are fresh.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She accepted one, and put it on to the bench.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, take several--for luck,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　She took a couple more, and put them on the bench also. Then 
              she turned in confusion to her work. He went on up the room.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Here you are, Pussy,&quot; he said. &quot;Don't be greedy!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Are they all for her?&quot; cried the others, rushing up.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Of course they're not,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　The girls clamoured round. Pussy drew back from her mates.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Come out!&quot; she cried. &quot;I can have first pick, 
              can't I, Paul?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Be nice with 'em,&quot; he said, and went away.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You ARE a dear,&quot; the girls cried.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Tenpence,&quot; he answered.</p>
            <p>　　He went past Clara without speaking. She felt the threechocolate 
              creams would burn her if she touched them. It neededall her courage 
              to slip them into the pocket of her apron.</p>
            <p>　　The girls loved him and were afraid of him. He was so nicewhile 
              he was nice, but if he were offended, so distant, treating themas 
              if they scarcely existed, or not more than the bobbins of thread. 
              And then, if they were impudent, he said quietly: &quot;Do you mindgoing 
              on with your work,&quot; and stood and watched.</p>
            <p>　　When he celebrated his twenty-third birthday, the house wasin 
              trouble. Arthur was just going to be married. His mother wasnot 
              well. His father, getting an old man, and lame from his accidents,was 
              given a paltry, poor job. Miriam was an eternal reproach. He felt 
              he owed himself to her, yet could not give himself. The house,moreover, 
              needed his support. He was pulled in all directions. He was not 
              glad it was his birthday. It made him bitter.</p>
            <p>　　He got to work at eight o'clock. Most of the clerks had notturned 
              up. The girls were not due till 8.30. As he was changinghis coat, 
              he heard a voice behind him say:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Paul, Paul, I want you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　It was Fanny, the hunchback, standing at the top of her stairs,her 
              face radiant with a secret. Paul looked at her in astonishment.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I want you,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　He stood, at a loss.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Come on,&quot; she coaxed. &quot;Come before you begin 
              on the letters.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He went down the half-dozen steps into her dry, narrow,&quot;finishing-off&quot; 
              room. Fanny walked before him: her black bodice wasshort--the waist 
              was under her armpits--and her green-black cashmere skirtseemed 
              very long, as she strode with big strides before the young man,himself 
              so graceful. She went to her seat at the narrow end of the room,where 
              the window opened on to chimney-pots. Paul watched her thinhands 
              and her flat red wrists as she excitedly twitched her whiteapron, 
              which was spread on the bench in front of her. She hesitated.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You didn't think we'd forgot you?&quot; she asked, reproachful.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why?&quot; he asked. He had forgotten his birthday himself.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;'Why,' he says! 'Why!' Why, look here!&quot; She pointedto 
              the calendar, and he saw, surrounding the big black number&quot;21&quot;, 
              hundreds of little crosses in black-lead.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, kisses for my birthday,&quot; he laughed. &quot;How 
              did you know?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, you want to know, don't you?&quot; Fanny mocked, hugely 
              delighted. &quot;There's one from everybody--except Lady Clara--and 
              two from some. But I shan't tell you how many I put.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, I know, you're spooney,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;There you ARE mistaken!&quot; she cried, indignant. &quot;I 
              couldnever be so soft.&quot; Her voice was strong and contralto.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You always pretend to be such a hard-hearted hussy,&quot; 
              he laughed. &quot;And you know you're as sentimental---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'd rather be called sentimental than frozen meat,&quot;Fanny 
              blurted. Paul knew she referred to Clara, and he smiled.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you say such nasty things about me?&quot; he laughed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, my duck,&quot; the hunchback woman answered, lavishly 
              tender. She was thirty-nine. &quot;No, my duck, because you don't 
              think yourselfa fine figure in marble and us nothing but dirt. I'm 
              as good as you,aren't I, Paul?&quot; and the question delighted 
              her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why, we're not better than one another, are we?&quot; he 
              replied.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But I'm as good as you, aren't I, Paul?&quot; she persisted 
              daringly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Of course you are. If it comes to goodness, you're better.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She was rather afraid of the situation. She might get hysterical.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I thought I'd get here before the others--won't they say 
              I'm deep! Now shut your eyes---&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And open your mouth, and see what God sends you,&quot; 
              he continued,suiting action to words, and expecting a piece of chocolate. 
              He heard the rustle of the apron, and a faint clink of metal. &quot;I'm 
              going to look,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　He opened his eyes. Fanny, her long cheeks flushed,her blue eyes 
              shining, was gazing at him. There was a littlebundle of paint-tubes 
              on the bench before him. He turned pale.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, Fanny,&quot; he said quickly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;From us all,&quot; she answered hastily.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, but---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Are they the right sort?&quot; she asked, rocking herself 
              with delight.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Jove! they're the best in the catalogue.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But they're the right sorts?&quot; she cried.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;They're off the little list I'd made to get when my shipcame 
              in.&quot; He bit his lip.</p>
            <p>　　Fanny was overcome with emotion. She must turn the conversation.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;They was all on thorns to do it; they all paid their shares,all 
              except the Queen of Sheba.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The Queen of Sheba was Clara.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And wouldn't she join?&quot; Paul asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She didn't get the chance; we never told her; we wasn't 
              goingto have HER bossing THIS show. We didn't WANT her to join.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Paul laughed at the woman. He was much moved. At last hemust 
              go. She was very close to him. Suddenly she flung her armsround 
              his neck and kissed him vehemently.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I can give you a kiss to-day,&quot; she said apologetically. 
              &quot;You've looked so white, it's made my heart ache.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Paul kissed her, and left her. Her arms were so pitifullythin 
              that his heart ached also.</p>
            <p>　　That day he met Clara as he ran downstairs to wash his handsat 
              dinner-time.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You have stayed to dinner!&quot; he exclaimed. It was unusualfor 
              her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; and I seem to have dined on old surgical-appliance 
              stock. I MUST go out now, or I shall feel stale india-rubber right 
              through.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She lingered. He instantly caught at her wish.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You are going anywhere?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　They went together up to the Castle. Outdoors she dressedvery 
              plainly, down to ugliness; indoors she always looked nice. She walked 
              with hesitating steps alongside Paul, bowing and turningaway from 
              him. Dowdy in dress, and drooping, she showed togreat disadvantage. 
              He could scarcely recognise her strong form,that seemed to slumber 
              with power. She appeared almost insignificant,drowning her stature 
              in her stoop, as she shrank from the public gaze.</p>
            <p>　　The Castle grounds were very green and fresh. Climbing theprecipitous 
              ascent, he laughed and chattered, but she was silent,seeming to 
              brood over something. There was scarcely time to goinside the squat, 
              square building that crowns the bluff of rock. They leaned upon 
              the wall where the cliff runs sheer down to the Park. Below them, 
              in their holes in the sandstone, pigeons preenedthemselves and cooed 
              softly. Away down upon the boulevard atthe foot of the rock, tiny 
              trees stood in their own pools of shadow,and tiny people went scurrying 
              about in almost ludicrous importance.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You feel as if you could scoop up the folk like tadpoles,and 
              have a handful of them,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　She laughed, answering:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; it is not necessary to get far off in order to seeus 
              proportionately. The trees are much more significant.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Bulk only,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　She laughed cynically.</p>
            <p>　　Away beyond the boulevard the thin stripes of the metalsshowed 
              upon the railway-track, whose margin was crowded with littlestacks 
              of timber, beside which smoking toy engines fussed. Then the silver 
              string of the canal lay at random among theblack heaps. Beyond, 
              the dwellings, very dense on the river flat,looked like black, poisonous 
              herbage, in thick rows and crowded beds,stretching right away, broken 
              now and then by taller plants,right to where the river glistened 
              in a hieroglyph across the country. The steep scarp cliffs across 
              the river looked puny. Great stretchesof country darkened with trees 
              and faintly brightened with corn-land,spread towards the haze, where 
              the hills rose blue beyond grey.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It is comforting,&quot; said Mrs. Dawes, &quot;to think 
              the town goesno farther. It is only a LITTLE sore upon the country 
              yet.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;A little scab,&quot; Paul said.</p>
            <p>　　She shivered. She loathed the town. Looking drearily acrossat 
              the country which was forbidden her, her impassive face, paleand 
              hostile, she reminded Paul of one of the bitter, remorseful angels.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But the town's all right,&quot; he said; &quot;it's only 
              temporary. This is the crude, clumsy make-shift we've practised 
              on, till we findout what the idea is. The town will come all right.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The pigeons in the pockets of rock, among the perched bushes,cooed 
              comfortably. To the left the large church of St. Mary roseinto space, 
              to keep close company with the Castle, above the heapedrubble of 
              the town. Mrs. Dawes smiled brightly as she looked acrossthe country.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I feel better,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Thank you,&quot; he replied. &quot;Great compliment!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, my brother!&quot; she laughed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;H'm! that's snatching back with the left hand what you 
              gavewith the right, and no mistake,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　She laughed in amusement at him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But what was the matter with you?&quot; he asked. &quot;I 
              know youwere brooding something special. I can see the stamp of 
              iton your face yet.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I think I will not tell you,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;All right, hug it,&quot; he answered.</p>
            <p>　　She flushed and bit her lip.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; she said, &quot;it was the girls.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What about 'em?&quot; Paul asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;They have been plotting something for a week now, and to-daythey 
              seem particularly full of it. All alike; they insult mewith their 
              secrecy.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do they?&quot; he asked in concern.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I should not mind,&quot; she went on, in the metallic, 
              angry tone,&quot;if they did not thrust it into my face--the fact 
              that they havea secret.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Just like women,&quot; said he.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It is hateful, their mean gloating,&quot; she said intensely.</p>
            <p>　　Paul was silent. He knew what the girls gloated over. He was 
              sorry to be the cause of this new dissension.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;They can have all the secrets in the world,&quot; she went 
              on,brooding bitterly; &quot;but they might refrain from glorying 
              in them,and making me feel more out of it than ever. It is--it isalmost 
              unbearable.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Paul thought for a few minutes. He was much perturbed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I will tell you what it's all about,&quot; he said, pale 
              and nervous. &quot;It's my birthday, and they've bought me a fine 
              lot of paints,all the girls. They're jealous of you&quot;--he felt 
              her stiffen coldlyat the word 'jealous'--&quot;merely because I 
              sometimes bring you a book,&quot;he added slowly. &quot;But, you 
              see, it's only a trifle. Don't botherabout it, will you--because&quot;--he 
              laughed quickly--&quot;well, what would theysay if they saw us here 
              now, in spite of their victory?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She was angry with him for his clumsy reference totheir present 
              intimacy. It was almost insolent of him. Yet he was so quiet, she 
              forgave him, although it cost her an effort.</p>
            <p>　　Their two hands lay on the rough stone parapet of the Castle 
              wall. He had inherited from his mother a fineness of mould, so thathis 
              hands were small and vigorous. Hers were large, to match herlarge 
              limbs, but white and powerful looking. As Paul looked at themhe 
              knew her. &quot;She is wanting somebody to take her hands--for all 
              sheis so contemptuous of us,&quot; he said to himself. And she saw 
              nothing buthis two hands, so warm and alive, which seemed to live 
              for her. He wasbrooding now, staring out over the country from under 
              sullen brows. The little, interesting diversity of shapes had vanished 
              from the scene;all that remained was a vast, dark matrix of sorrow 
              and tragedy,the same in all the houses and the river-flats and the 
              people andthe birds; they were only shapen differently. And now 
              that the formsseemed to have melted away, there remained the mass 
              from which allthe landscape was composed, a dark mass of struggle 
              and pain. The factory, the girls, his mother, the large, uplifted 
              church,the thicket of the town, merged into one atmosphere--dark, 
              brooding,and sorrowful, every bit.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Is that two o'clock striking?&quot; Mrs. Dawes said in 
              surprise.</p>
            <p>　　Paul started, and everything sprang into form, regainedits individuality, 
              its forgetfulness, and its cheerfulness.</p>
            <p>　　They hurried back to work.</p>
            <p>　　When he was in the rush of preparing for the night's post,examining 
              the work up from Fanny's room, which smelt of ironing,the evening 
              postman came in.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;'Mr. Paul Morel,'&quot; he said, smiling, handing Paul 
              a package. &quot;A lady's handwriting! Don't let the girls see it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The postman, himself a favourite, was pleased to make funof the 
              girls' affection for Paul.</p>
            <p>　　It was a volume of verse with a brief note: &quot;You will allow 
              meto send you this, and so spare me my isolation. I also sympathiseand 
              wish you well.--C.D.&quot; Paul flushed hot.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Good Lord! Mrs. Dawes. She can't afford it. Good Lord,who 
              ever'd have thought it!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He was suddenly intensely moved. He was filled with the warmthof 
              her. In the glow he could almost feel her as if she werepresent--her 
              arms, her shoulders, her bosom, see them, feel them,almost contain 
              them.</p>
            <p>　　This move on the part of Clara brought them into closer intimacy. 
              The other girls noticed that when Paul met Mrs. Dawes his eyes liftedand 
              gave that peculiar bright greeting which they could interpret. Knowing 
              he was unaware, Clara made no sign, save thatoccasionally she turned 
              aside her face from him when he came upon her.</p>
            <p>　　They walked out together very often at dinner-time; it wasquite 
              open, quite frank. Everybody seemed to feel that he was quiteunaware 
              of the state of his own feeling, and that nothing was wrong. He 
              talked to her now with some of the old fervour with which hehad 
              talked to Miriam, but he cared less about the talk; he didnot bother 
              about his conclusions.</p>
            <p>　　One day in October they went out to Lambley for tea. Suddenly 
              they came to a halt on top of the hill. He climbed and saton a gate, 
              she sat on the stile. The afternoon was perfectly still,with a dim 
              haze, and yellow sheaves glowing through. They were quiet.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;How old were you when you married?&quot; he asked quietly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Twenty-two.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Her voice was subdued, almost submissive. She would tellhim now.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It is eight years ago?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And when did you leave him?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Three years ago.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Five years! Did you love him when you married him?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She was silent for some time; then she said slowly:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I thought I did--more or less. I didn't think much about 
              it. And he wanted me. I was very prudish then.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And you sort of walked into it without thinking?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes. I seemed to have been asleep nearly all my life.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Somnambule? But--when did you wake up?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know that I ever did, or ever have--since I was 
              a child.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You went to sleep as you grew to be a woman? How queer! 
              And he didn't wake you?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No; he never got there,&quot; she replied, in a monotone.</p>
            <p>　　The brown birds dashed over the hedges where the rose-hipsstood 
              naked and scarlet.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Got where?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;At me. He never really mattered to me.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The afternoon was so gently warm and dim. Red roofsof the cottages 
              burned among the blue haze. He loved the day. He could feel, but 
              he could not understand, what Clara was saying.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But why did you leave him? Was he horrid to you?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She shuddered lightly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He--he sort of degraded me. He wanted to bully me because 
              hehadn't got me. And then I felt as if I wanted to run, as if Iwas 
              fastened and bound up. And he seemed dirty.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I see.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He did not at all see.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And was he always dirty?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;A bit,&quot; she replied slowly. &quot;And then he seemed 
              as if hecouldn't get AT me, really. And then he got brutal--he WAS 
              brutal!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And why did you leave him finally?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Because--because he was unfaithful to me---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They were both silent for some time. Her hand lay on the gate-postas 
              she balanced. He put his own over it. His heart beat quickly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But did you--were you ever--did you ever give him a chance?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Chance? How?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;To come near to you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I married him--and I was willing---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They both strove to keep their voices steady.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I believe he loves you,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It looks like it,&quot; she replied.</p>
            <p>　　He wanted to take his hand away, and could not. She savedhim 
              by removing her own. After a silence, he began again:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Did you leave him out of count all along?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He left me,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And I suppose he couldn't MAKE himself mean everything 
              to you?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He tried to bully me into it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　But the conversation had got them both out of their depth. Suddenly 
              Paul jumped down.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Come on,&quot; he said. &quot;Let's go and get some tea.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They found a cottage, where they sat in the cold parlour. She 
              poured out his tea. She was very quiet. He felt she had withdrawnagain 
              from him. After tea, she stared broodingly into her tea-cup,twisting 
              her wedding ring all the time. In her abstraction she tookthe ring 
              off her finger, stood it up, and spun it upon the table. The gold 
              became a diaphanous, glittering globe. It fell, and thering was 
              quivering upon the table. She spun it again and again. Paul watched, 
              fascinated.</p>
            <p>　　But she was a married woman, and he believed in simple friendship. 
              And he considered that he was perfectly honourable with regard to 
              her. It was only a friendship between man and woman, such as any 
              civilisedpersons might have.</p>
            <p>　　He was like so many young men of his own age. Sex had becomeso 
              complicated in him that he would have denied that he evercould want 
              Clara or Miriam or any woman whom he knew. Sex desirewas a sort 
              of detached thing, that did not belong to a woman. He loved Miriam 
              with his soul. He grew warm at the thoughtof Clara, he battled with 
              her, he knew the curves of her breastand shoulders as if they had 
              been moulded inside him; and yet hedid not positively desire her. 
              He would have denied it for ever. He believed himself really bound 
              to Miriam. If ever he should marry,some time in the far future, 
              it would be his duty to marry Miriam. That he gave Clara to understand, 
              and she said nothing, but left himto his courses. He came to her, 
              Mrs. Dawes, whenever he could. Then he wrote frequently to Miriam, 
              and visited the girl occasionally. So he went on through the winter; 
              but he seemed not so fretted. His mother was easier about him. She 
              thought he was getting awayfrom Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam knew now how strong was the attraction of Clara for him;but 
              still she was certain that the best in him would triumph. His feeling 
              for Mrs. Dawes--who, moreover, was a married woman--was shallow 
              and temporal, compared with his love for herself. He would come 
              back to her, she was sure; with some of his youngfreshness gone, 
              perhaps, but cured of his desire for the lesser thingswhich other 
              women than herself could give him. She could bear allif he were 
              inwardly true to her and must come back.</p>
            <p>　　He saw none of the anomaly of his position. Miriam was hisold 
              friend, lover, and she belonged to Bestwood and home and his youth. 
              Clara was a newer friend, and she belonged to Nottingham, to life,to 
              the world. It seemed to him quite plain.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Dawes and he had many periods of coolness, when they sawlittle 
              of each other; but they always came together again.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Were you horrid with Baxter Dawes?&quot; he asked her. 
              It wasa thing that seemed to trouble him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;In what way?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, I don't know. But weren't you horrid with him? Didn't 
              you do something that knocked him to pieces?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What, pray?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Making him feel as if he were nothing--I know,&quot; Paul 
              declared.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You are so clever, my friend,&quot; she said coolly.</p>
            <p>　　The conversation broke off there. But it made her coolwith him 
              for some time.</p>
            <p>　　She very rarely saw Miriam now. The friendship betweenthe two 
              women was not broken off, but considerably weakened.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Will you come in to the concert on Sunday afternoon?&quot; 
              Clara asked him just after Christmas.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I promised to go up to Willey Farm,&quot; he replied.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, very well.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You don't mind, do you?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why should I?&quot; she answered.</p>
            <p>　　Which almost annoyed him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You know,&quot; he said, &quot;Miriam and I have been a 
              lot to eachother ever since I was sixteen--that's seven years now.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's a long time,&quot; Clara replied.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; but somehow she--it doesn't go right---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;How?&quot; asked Clara.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She seems to draw me and draw me, and she wouldn't leavea 
              single hair of me free to fall out and blow away--she'd keep it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But you like to be kept.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;I don't. I wish it could be normal, 
              give and take--like me and you. I want a woman to keep me, but not 
              in her pocket.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But if you love her, it couldn't be normal, like me and 
              you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; I should love her better then. She sort of wants meso 
              much that I can't give myself.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Wants you how?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Wants the soul out of my body. I can't help shrinking backfrom 
              her.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And yet you love her!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, I don't love her. I never even kiss her.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why not?&quot; Clara asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I suppose you're afraid,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm not. Something in me shrinks from her like hell--she'sso 
              good, when I'm not good.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;How do you know what she is?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I do! I know she wants a sort of soul union.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But how do you know what she wants?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I've been with her for seven years.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And you haven't found out the very first thing about her.&quot;</p>

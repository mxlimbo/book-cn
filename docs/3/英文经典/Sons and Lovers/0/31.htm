            <p>　　Clara was, indeed, passionately in love with him, and he with 
              her,as far as passion went. In the daytime he forgot her a good 
              deal. She was working in the same building, but he was not aware 
              of it. He was busy, and her existence was of no matter to him. But 
              all thetime she was in her Spiral room she had a sense that he was 
              upstairs,a physical sense of his person in the same building. Every 
              secondshe expected him to come through the door, and when he came 
              itwas a shock to her. But he was often short and offhand with her. 
              He gave her his directions in an official manner, keeping her at 
              bay. With what wits she had left she listened to him. She dared 
              notmisunderstand or fail to remember, but it was a cruelty to her. 
              She wanted to touch his chest. She knew exactly how his breast wasshapen 
              under the waistcoat, and she wanted to touch it. It maddenedher 
              to hear his mechanical voice giving orders about the work. She wanted 
              to break through the sham of it, smash the trivial coatingof business 
              which covered him with hardness, get at the man again;but she was 
              afraid, and before she could feel one touch of his warmth hewas 
              gone, and she ached again.</p>
            <p>　　He knew that she was dreary every evening she did not see him,so 
              he gave her a good deal of his time. The days were oftena misery 
              to her, but the evenings and the nights were usuallya bliss to them 
              both. Then they were silent. For hours theysat together, or walked 
              together in the dark, and talked onlya few, almost meaningless words. 
              But he had her hand in his,and her bosom left its warmth in his 
              chest, making him feel whole.</p>
            <p>　　One evening they were walking down by the canal,and something 
              was troubling him. She knew she had not got him. All the time he 
              whistled softly and persistently to himself. She listened, feeling 
              she could learn more from his whistling thanfrom his speech. It 
              was a sad dissatisfied tune--a tune that madeher feel he would not 
              stay with her. She walked on in silence. When they came to the swing 
              bridge he sat down on the great pole,looking at the stars in the 
              water. He was a long way from her. She had been thinking.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Will you always stay at Jordan's?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; he answered without reflecting. &quot;No; I s'll 
              leaveNottingham and go abroad--soon.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Go abroad! What for?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I dunno! I feel restless.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But what shall you do?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I shall have to get some steady designing work, and some 
              sortof sale for my pictures first,&quot; he said. &quot;I am gradually 
              makingmy way. I know I am.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And when do you think you'll go?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know. I shall hardly go for long, while there'smy 
              mother.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You couldn't leave her?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Not for long.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She looked at the stars in the black water. They lay verywhite 
              and staring. It was an agony to know he would leave her,but it was 
              almost an agony to have him near her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And if you made a nice lot of money, what would you do?&quot;she 
              asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Go somewhere in a pretty house near London with my mother.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I see.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　There was a long pause.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I could still come and see you,&quot; he said. &quot;I 
              don't know. Don't ask me what I should do; I don't know.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　There was a silence. The stars shuddered and broke uponthe water. 
              There came a breath of wind. He went suddenly to her,and put his 
              hand on her shoulder.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't ask me anything about the future,&quot; he said miserably. 
              &quot;I don't know anything. Be with me now, will you, no matter 
              whatit is?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And she took him in her arms. After all, she was a married woman,and 
              she had no right even to what he gave her. He needed her badly. 
              She had him in her arms, and he was miserable. With her warmth shefolded 
              him over, consoled him, loved him. She would let the momentstand 
              for itself.</p>
            <p>　　After a moment he lifted his head as if he wanted to speak.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Clara,&quot; he said, struggling.</p>
            <p>　　She caught him passionately to her, pressed his head down on 
              herbreast with her hand. She could not bear the suffering in his 
              voice. She was afraid in her soul. He might have anything of her--anything;but 
              she did not want to KNOW. She felt she could not bear it. She wanted 
              him to be soothed upon her--soothed. She stood clasping himand caressing 
              him, and he was something unknown to her--somethingalmost uncanny. 
              She wanted to soothe him into forgetfulness.</p>
            <p>　　And soon the struggle went down in his soul, and he forgot. But 
              then Clara was not there for him, only a woman, warm, something 
              heloved and almost worshipped, there in the dark. But it was not 
              Clara,and she submitted to him. The naked hunger and inevitabilityof 
              his loving her, something strong and blind and ruthlessin its primitiveness, 
              made the hour almost terrible to her. She knew how stark and alone 
              he was, and she felt it was greatthat he came to her; and she took 
              him simply because his need wasbigger either than her or him, and 
              her soul was still within her. She did this for him in his need, 
              even if he left her, for sheloved him.</p>
            <p>　　All the while the peewits were screaming in the field. When he 
              came to, he wondered what was near his eyes, curving andstrong with 
              life in the dark, and what voice it was speaking. Then he realised 
              it was the grass, and the peewit was calling. The warmth was Clara's 
              breathing heaving. He lifted his head,and looked into her eyes. 
              They were dark and shining and strange,life wild at the source staring 
              into his life, stranger to him,yet meeting him; and he put his face 
              down on her throat, afraid. What was she? A strong, strange, wild 
              life, that breathed with hisin the darkness through this hour. It 
              was all so much bigger thanthemselves that he was hushed. They had 
              met, and included in theirmeeting the thrust of the manifold grass 
              stems, the cry of the peewit,the wheel of the stars.</p>
            <p>　　When they stood up they saw other lovers stealing down theopposite 
              hedge. It seemed natural they were there; the nightcontained them.</p>
            <p>　　And after such an evening they both were very still, having knownthe 
              immensity of passion. They felt small, half-afraid, childishand 
              wondering, like Adam and Eve when they lost their innocenceand realised 
              the magnificence of the power which drovethem out of Paradise and 
              across the great night and the great dayof humanity. It was for 
              each of them an initiation and a satisfaction.To know their own 
              nothingness, to know the tremendous living floodwhich carried them 
              always, gave them rest within themselves. If so great a magnificent 
              power could overwhelm them, identify themaltogether with itself, 
              so that they knew they were only grains inthe tremendous heave that 
              lifted every grass blade its little height,and every tree, and living 
              thing, then why fret about themselves? They could let themselves 
              be carried by life, and they felt a sortof peace each in the other. 
              There was a verification which they hadhad together. Nothing could 
              nullify it, nothing could take it away;it was almost their belief 
              in life.</p>
            <p>　　But Clara was not satisfied. Something great was there,she knew; 
              something great enveloped her. But it did not keep her. In the morning 
              it was not the same. They had KNOWN, but shecould not keep the moment. 
              She wanted it again; she wantedsomething permanent. She had not 
              realised fully. She thoughtit was he whom she wanted. He was not 
              safe to her. This thathad been between them might never be again; 
              he might leave her. She had not got him; she was not satisfied. 
              She had been there,but she had not gripped the--the something--she 
              knew not what--which shewas mad to have.</p>
            <p>　　In the morning he had considerable peace, and was happyin himself. 
              It seemed almost as if he had known the baptism offire in passion, 
              and it left him at rest. But it was not Clara. It was something 
              that happened because of her, but it was not her. They were scarcely 
              any nearer each other. It was as if they had beenblind agents of 
              a great force.</p>
            <p>　　When she saw him that day at the factory her heart melted likea 
              drop of fire. It was his body, his brows. The drop of fire grewmore 
              intense in her breast; she must hold him. But he, very quiet,very 
              subdued this morning, went on giving his instruction. She followedhim 
              into the dark, ugly basement, and lifted her arms to him. He kissed 
              her, and the intensity of passion began to burn him again. Somebody 
              was at the door. He ran upstairs; she returned to her room,moving 
              as if in a trance.</p>
            <p>　　After that the fire slowly went down. He felt more and more thathis 
              experience had been impersonal, and not Clara. He loved her. There 
              was a big tenderness, as after a strong emotion theyhad known together; 
              but it was not she who could keep his soul steady. He had wanted 
              her to be something she could not be.</p>
            <p>　　And she was mad with desire of him. She could not seehim without 
              touching him. In the factory, as he talked to herabout Spiral hose, 
              she ran her hand secretly along his side. She followed him out into 
              the basement for a quick kiss; her eyes,always mute and yearning, 
              full of unrestrained passion, she keptfixed on his. He was afraid 
              of her, lest she should too flagrantlygive herself away before the 
              other girls. She invariably waitedfor him at dinnertime for him 
              to embrace her before she went. He felt as if she were helpless, 
              almost a burden to him, and itirritated him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But what do you always want to be kissing and embracing 
              for?&quot;he said. &quot;Surely there's a time for everything.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She looked up at him, and the hate came into her eyes.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;DO I always want to be kissing you?&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Always, even if I come to ask you about the work. I don'twant 
              anything to do with love when I'm at work. Work's work---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And what is love?&quot; she asked. &quot;Has it to have 
              special hours?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; out of work hours.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And you'll regulate it according to Mr. Jordan's closing 
              time?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; and according to the freedom from business of any 
              sort.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It is only to exist in spare time?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;That's all, and not always then--not the kissing sort of 
              love.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And that's all you think of it?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's quite enough.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm glad you think so.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And she was cold to him for some time--she hated him; and whileshe 
              was cold and contemptuous, he was uneasy till she had forgivenhim 
              again. But when they started afresh they were not any nearer. He 
              kept her because he never satisfied her.</p>
            <p>　　In the spring they went together to the seaside. They had roomsat 
              a little cottage near Theddlethorpe, and lived as man and wife. 
              Mrs. Radford sometimes went with them.</p>
            <p>　　It was known in Nottingham that Paul Morel and Mrs. Daweswere 
              going together, but as nothing was very obvious, and Claraalways 
              a solitary person, and he seemed so simple and innocent,it did not 
              make much difference.</p>
            <p>　　He loved the Lincolnshire coast, and she loved the sea. In the 
              early morning they often went out together to bathe. The grey of 
              the dawn, the far, desolate reaches of the fenland smitten with 
              winter, the sea-meadows rank with herbage, were stark enough to 
              rejoice his soul. As they stepped on to the highroad from their 
              plank bridge, and looked round at the endless monotony of levels, 
              the land a little darker than the sky, the sea sounding small beyond 
              the sandhills, his heart filled strong with the sweeping relentlessness 
              of life. She loved him then. He was solitary and strong, and his 
              eyes had a beautiful light.</p>
            <p>　　They shuddered with cold; then he raced her down the road tothe 
              green turf bridge. She could run well. Her colour soon came,her 
              throat was bare, her eyes shone. He loved her for being soluxuriously 
              heavy, and yet so quick. Himself was light; she wentwith a beautiful 
              rush. They grew warm, and walked hand in hand.</p>
            <p>　　A flush came into the sky, the wan moon, half-way downthe west, 
              sank into insignificance. On the shadowy land thingsbegan to take 
              life, plants with great leaves became distinct. They came through 
              a pass in the big, cold sandhills on to the beach. The long waste 
              of foreshore lay moaning under the dawn and the sea;the ocean was 
              a flat dark strip with a white edge. Over the gloomysea the sky 
              grew red. Quickly the fire spread among the cloudsand scattered 
              them. Crimson burned to orange, orange to dull gold,and in a golden 
              glitter the sun came up, dribbling fierily over thewaves in little 
              splashes, as if someone had gone along and the lighthad spilled 
              from her pail as she walked.</p>
            <p>　　The breakers ran down the shore in long, hoarse strokes. Tiny 
              seagulls, like specks of spray, wheeled above the line of surf. 
              Their crying seemed larger than they. Far away the coast reached 
              out,and melted into the morning, the tussocky sandhills seemed to 
              sinkto a level with the beach. Mablethorpe was tiny on their right. 
              They had alone the space of all this level shore, the sea, and theupcoming 
              sun, the faint noise of the waters, the sharp crying ofthe gulls.</p>
            <p>　　They had a warm hollow in the sandhills where the wind didnot 
              come. He stood looking out to sea.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's very fine,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Now don't get sentimental,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　It irritated her to see him standing gazing at the sea, like 
              asolitary and poetic person. He laughed. She quickly undressed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;There are some fine waves this morning,&quot; she said 
              triumphantly.</p>
            <p>　　She was a better swimmer than he; he stood idly watching her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Aren't you coming?&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;In a minute,&quot; he answered.</p>
            <p>　　She was white and velvet skinned, with heavy shoulders. A little 
              wind, coming from the sea, blew across her body and ruffledher hair.</p>
            <p>　　The morning was of a lovely limpid gold colour. Veils of shadowseemed 
              to be drifting away on the north and the south. Clara stoodshrinking 
              slightly from the touch of the wind, twisting her hair. The sea-grass 
              rose behind the white stripped woman. She glancedat the sea, then 
              looked at him. He was watching her with dark eyeswhich she loved 
              and could not understand. She hugged her breastsbetween her arms, 
              cringing, laughing:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oo, it will be so cold!&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　He bent forward and kissed her, held her suddenly close,and kissed 
              her again. She stood waiting. He looked into her eyes,then away 
              at the pale sands.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Go, then!&quot; he said quietly.</p>
            <p>　　She flung her arms round his neck, drew him against her,kissed 
              him passionately, and went, saying:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But you'll come in?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;In a minute.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She went plodding heavily over the sand that was soft as velvet. 
              He, on the sandhills, watched the great pale coast envelop her. 
              She grew smaller, lost proportion, seemed only like a large whitebird 
              toiling forward.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Not much more than a big white pebble on the beach, not 
              muchmore than a clot of foam being blown and rolled over the sand,&quot;he 
              said to himself.</p>
            <p>　　She seemed to move very slowly across the vast sounding shore. 
              As he watched, he lost her. She was dazzled out of sight bythe sunshine. 
              Again he saw her, the merest white speck movingagainst the white, 
              muttering sea-edge.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Look how little she is!&quot; he said to himself. &quot;She's 
              lost likea grain of sand in the beach--just a concentrated speck 
              blown along,a tiny white foam-bubble, almost nothing among the morning. 
              Why does she absorb me?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The morning was altogether uninterrupted: she was gone inthe 
              water. Far and wide the beach, the sandhills with their blue marrain,the 
              shining water, glowed together in immense, unbroken solitude.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What is she, after all?&quot; he said to himself. &quot;Here's 
              theseacoast morning, big and permanent and beautiful; there is she,fretting, 
              always unsatisfied, and temporary as a bubble of foam. What does 
              she mean to me, after all? She represents something,like a bubble 
              of foam represents the sea. But what is she? It's not her I care 
              for.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Then, startled by his own unconscious thoughts, that seemedto 
              speak so distinctly that all the morning could hear, he undressedand 
              ran quickly down the sands. She was watching for him. Her armflashed 
              up to him, she heaved on a wave, subsided, her shouldersin a pool 
              of liquid silver. He jumped through the breakers,and in a moment 
              her hand was on his shoulder.</p>
            <p>　　He was a poor swimmer, and could not stay long in the water. 
              She played round him in triumph, sporting with her superiority,which 
              he begrudged her. The sunshine stood deep and fine on the water. 
              They laughed in the sea for a minute or two, then raced each other 
              backto the sandhills.</p>
            <p>　　When they were drying themselves, panting heavily,he watched 
              her laughing, breathless face, her bright shoulders,her breasts 
              that swayed and made him frightened as she rubbed them,and he thought 
              again:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But she is magnificent, and even bigger than the morningand 
              the sea. Is she---? Is she---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She, seeing his dark eyes fixed on her, broke off from herdrying 
              with a laugh.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What are you looking at?&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You,&quot; he answered, laughing.</p>
            <p>　　Her eyes met his, and in a moment he was kissingher white &quot;goose-fleshed&quot; 
              shoulder, and thinking:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What is she? What is she?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She loved him in the morning. There was something detached,hard, 
              and elemental about his kisses then, as if he were onlyconscious 
              of his own will, not in the least of her and her wanting him.</p>
            <p>　　Later in the day he went out sketching.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You,&quot; he said to her, &quot;go with your mother to 
              Sutton. I am so dull.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She stood and looked at him. He knew she wanted to comewith him, 
              but he preferred to be alone. She made him feel imprisonedwhen she 
              was there, as if he could not get a free deep breath,as if there 
              were something on top of him. She felt his desireto be free of her.</p>
            <p>　　In the evening he came back to her. They walked down the shorein 
              the darkness, then sat for a while in the shelter of the sandhills.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It seems,&quot; she said, as they stared over the darkness 
              of the sea,where no light was to be seen--&quot;it seemed as if 
              you only loved meat night--as if you didn't love me in the daytime.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He ran the cold sand through his fingers, feeling guiltyunder 
              the accusation.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;The night is free to you,&quot; he replied. &quot;In the 
              daytime Iwant to be by myself.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But why?&quot; she said. &quot;Why, even now, when we are 
              on thisshort holiday?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know. Love-making stifles me in the daytime.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But it needn't be always love-making,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It always is,&quot; he answered, &quot;when you and I are 
              together.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She sat feeling very bitter.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you ever want to marry me?&quot; he asked curiously.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you me?&quot; she replied.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, yes; I should like us to have children,&quot; he answered 
              slowly.</p>
            <p>　　She sat with her head bent, fingering the sand.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But you don't really want a divorce from Baxter, do you?&quot;he 
              said.</p>
            <p>　　It was some minutes before she replied.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; she said, very deliberately; &quot;I don't think 
              I do.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you feel as if you belonged to him?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No; I don't think so.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What, then?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I think he belongs to me,&quot; she replied.</p>
            <p>　　He was silent for some minutes, listening to the wind blowingover 
              the hoarse, dark sea.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And you never really intended to belong to ME?&quot; he 
              said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, I do belong to you,&quot; she answered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; he said; &quot;because you don't want to be divorced.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　It was a knot they could not untie, so they left it, took whatthey 
              could get, and what they could not attain they ignored.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I consider you treated Baxter rottenly,&quot; he said another 
              time.</p>
            <p>　　He half-expected Clara to answer him, as his mother would: &quot;You 
              consider your own affairs, and don't know so much aboutother people's.&quot; 
              But she took him seriously, almost to his own surprise.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why?&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I suppose you thought he was a lily of the valley, and 
              soyou put him in an appropriate pot, and tended him according. You 
              made up your mind he was a lily of the valley and it was nogood 
              his being a cow-parsnip. You wouldn't have it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I certainly never imagined him a lily of the valley.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You imagined him something he wasn't. That's just what 
              a woman is. She thinks she knows what's good for a man, and she's 
              going to seehe gets it; and no matter if he's starving, he may sit 
              and whistlefor what he needs, while she's got him, and is giving 
              him what'sgood for him.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And what are you doing?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm thinking what tune I shall whistle,&quot; he laughed.</p>
            <p>　　And instead of boxing his ears, she considered him in earnest.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You think I want to give you what's good for you?&quot; 
              she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I hope so; but love should give a sense of freedom,not 
              of prison. Miriam made me feel tied up like a donkey to a stake. 
              I must feed on her patch, and nowhere else. It's sickening!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And would YOU let a WOMAN do as she likes?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; I'll see that she likes to love me. If she doesn't--well,I 
              don't hold her.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;If you were as wonderful as you say---,&quot; replied Clara.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I should be the marvel I am,&quot; he laughed.</p>
            <p>　　There was a silence in which they hated each other,though they 
              laughed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Love's a dog in a manger,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And which of us is the dog?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh well, you, of course.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　So there went on a battle between them. She knew she never fullyhad 
              him. Some part, big and vital in him, she had no hold over;nor did 
              she ever try to get it, or even to realise what it was. And he knew 
              in some way that she held herself still as Mrs. Dawes. She did not 
              love Dawes, never had loved him; but she believed heloved her, at 
              least depended on her. She felt a certain suretyabout him that she 
              never felt with Paul Morel. Her passionfor the young man had filled 
              her soul, given her a certainsatisfaction, eased her of her self-mistrust, 
              her doubt. Whatever else she was, she was inwardly assured. It was 
              almostas if she had gained HERSELF, and stood now distinct and complete. 
              She had received her confirmation; but she never believed that herlife 
              belonged to Paul Morel, nor his to her. They would separatein the 
              end, and the rest of her life would be an ache after him. But at 
              any rate, she knew now, she was sure of herself. And thesame could 
              almost be said of him. Together they had receivedthe baptism of 
              life, each through the other; but now their missionswere separate. 
              Where he wanted to go she could not come with him. They would have 
              to part sooner or later. Even if they married,and were faithful 
              to each other, still he would have to leave her,go on alone, and 
              she would only have to attend to him when hecame home. But it was 
              not possible. Each wanted a mate to go sideby side with.</p>
            <p>　　Clara had gone to live with her mother upon Mapperley Plains. 
              One evening, as Paul and she were walking along Woodborough Road,they 
              met Dawes. Morel knew something about the bearing of theman approaching, 
              but he was absorbed in his thinking at the moment,so that only his 
              artist's eye watched the form of the stranger. Then he suddenly 
              turned to Clara with a laugh, and put his hand onher shoulder, saying, 
              laughing:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But we walk side by side, and yet I'm in London arguingwith 
              an imaginary Orpen; and where are you?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　At that instant Dawes passed, almost touching Morel. The young 
              man glanced, saw the dark brown eyes burning, full of hateand yet 
              tired.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Who was that?&quot; he asked of Clara.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It was Baxter,&quot; she replied.</p>
            <p>　　Paul took his hand from her shoulder and glanced round;then he 
              saw again distinctly the man's form as it approached him. Dawes 
              still walked erect, with his fine shoulders flung back, and hisface 
              lifted; but there was a furtive look in his eyes that gaveone the 
              impression he was trying to get unnoticed past every personhe met, 
              glancing suspiciously to see what they thought of him. And his hands 
              seemed to be wanting to hide. He wore old clothes,the trousers were 
              torn at the knee, and the handkerchief tied roundhis throat was 
              dirty; but his cap was still defiantly over one eye. As she saw 
              him, Clara felt guilty. There was a tiredness and despairon his 
              face that made her hate him, because it hurt her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He looks shady,&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　But the note of pity in his voice reproached her, and madeher 
              feel hard.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;His true commonness comes out,&quot; she answered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you hate him?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You talk,&quot; she said, &quot;about the cruelty of women; 
              I wish youknew the cruelty of men in their brute force. They simply 
              don'tknow that the woman exists.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't I?&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; she answered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't I know you exist?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;About ME you know nothing,&quot; she said bitterly--&quot;about 
              ME!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No more than Baxter knew?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Perhaps not as much.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He felt puzzled, and helpless, and angry. There she walkedunknown 
              to him, though they had been through such experience together.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But you know ME pretty well,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　She did not answer.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Did you know Baxter as well as you know me?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He wouldn't let me,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And I have let you know me?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's what men WON'T let you do. They won't let you getreally 
              near to them,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And haven't I let you?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered slowly; &quot;but you've never 
              come near to me. You can't come out of yourself, you can't. Baxter 
              could do that betterthan you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He walked on pondering. He was angry with her for preferingBaxter 
              to him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You begin to value Baxter now you've not got him,&quot; 
              he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No; I can only see where he was different from you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　But he felt she had a grudge against him.</p>
            <p>　　One evening, as they were coming home over the fields,she startled 
              him by asking:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you think it's worth it--the--the sex part?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;The act of loving, itself?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; is it worth anything to you?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But how can you separate it?&quot; he said. &quot;It's 
              the culminationof everything. All our intimacy culminates then.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Not for me,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　He was silent. A flash of hate for her came up. After all,she 
              was dissatisfied with him, even there, where he thought theyfulfilled 
              each other. But he believed her too implicitly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I feel,&quot; she continued slowly, &quot;as if I hadn't 
              got you,as if all of you weren't there, and as if it weren't ME 
              you were taking---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Who, then?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Something just for yourself. It has been fine, so that 
              Idaren't think of it. But is it ME you want, or is it IT?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He again felt guilty. Did he leave Clara out of count,and take 
              simply women? But he thought that was splitting a hair.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;When I had Baxter, actually had him, then I DID feel as 
              if Ihad all of him,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And it was better?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, yes; it was more whole. I don't say you haven't givenme 
              more than he ever gave me.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Or could give you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, perhaps; but you've never given me yourself.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He knitted his brows angrily.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;If I start to make love to you,&quot; he said, &quot;I 
              just go likea leaf down the wind.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And leave me out of count,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And then is it nothing to you?&quot; he asked, almost rigidwith 
              chagrin.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's something; and sometimes you have carried me away--rightaway--I 
              know--and--I reverence you for it--but---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't 'but' me,&quot; he said, kissing her quickly, as 
              a fire ranthrough him.</p>
            <p>　　She submitted, and was silent.</p>

            <p>　　His father looked so forlorn. Morel had been a man withoutfear--simply 
              nothing frightened him. Paul realised with a start thathe had been 
              afraid to go to bed, alone in the house with his dead. He was sorry.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I forgot you'd be alone, father,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Dost want owt to eat?&quot; asked Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Sithee--I made thee a drop o' hot milk. Get it down thee;it's 
              cold enough for owt.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Paul drank it.</p>
            <p>　　After a while Morel went to bed. He hurried past the closed door,and 
              left his own door open. Soon the son came upstairs also. He went 
              in to kiss her good-night, as usual. It was cold and dark. He wished 
              they had kept her fire burning. Still she dreamed heryoung dream. 
              But she would be cold.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;My dear!&quot; he whispered. &quot;My dear!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And he did not kiss her, for fear she should be coldand strange 
              to him. It eased him she slept so beautifully. He shut her door 
              softly, not to wake her, and went to bed.</p>
            <p>　　In the morning Morel summoned his courage, hearing Anniedownstairs 
              and Paul coughing in the room across the landing. He opened her 
              door, and went into the darkened room. He saw thewhite uplifted 
              form in the twilight, but her he dared not see. Bewildered, too 
              frightened to possess any of his faculties, he gotout of the room 
              again and left her. He never looked at her again. He had not seen 
              her for months, because he had not dared to look. And she looked 
              like his young wife again.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Have you seen her?&quot; Annie asked of him sharply after 
              breakfast.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And don't you think she looks nice?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He went out of the house soon after. And all the timeHe seemed 
              to be creeping aside to avoid it.</p>
            <p>　　Paul went about from place to place, doing the business ofthe 
              death. He met Clara in Nottingham, and they had tea togetherin a 
              cafe, when they were quite jolly again. She was infinitelyrelieved 
              to find he did not take it tragically.</p>
            <p>　　Later, when the relatives began to come for the funeral,the affair 
              became public, and the children became social beings. They put themselves 
              aside. They buried her in a furious stormof rain and wind. The wet 
              clay glistened, all the white flowerswere soaked. Annie gripped 
              his arm and leaned forward. Down below she saw a dark corner of 
              William's coffin. The oakbox sank steadily. She was gone. The rain 
              poured in the grave. The procession of black, with its umbrellas 
              glistening, turned away. The cemetery was deserted under the drenching 
              cold rain.</p>
            <p>　　Paul went home and busied himself supplying the guests with drinks. 
              His father sat in the kitchen with Mrs. Morel's relatives,&quot;superior&quot; 
              people, and wept, and said what a good lass she'd been,and how he'd 
              tried to do everything he could for her--everything.He had striven 
              all his life to do what he could for her, and he'dnothing to reproach 
              himself with. She was gone, but he'd donehis best for her. He wiped 
              his eyes with his white handkerchief. He'd nothing to reproach himself 
              for, he repeated. All his life he'ddone his best for her.</p>
            <p>　　And that was how he tried to dismiss her. He neverthought of 
              her personally. Everything deep in him he denied. Paul hated his 
              father for sitting sentimentalising over her. He knew he would do 
              it in the public-houses. For the real tragedywent on in Morel in 
              spite of himself. Sometimes, later, he camedown from his afternoon 
              sleep, white and cowering.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I HAVE been dreaming of thy mother,&quot; he said in a 
              small voice.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Have you, father? When I dream of her it's always just 
              as shewas when she was well. I dream of her often, but it seems 
              quitenice and natural, as if nothing had altered.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　But Morel crouched in front of the fire in terror.</p>
            <p>　　The weeks passed half-real, not much pain, not much of anything,perhaps 
              a little relief, mostly a nuit blanche. Paul went restlessfrom place 
              to place. For some months, since his mother had been worse,he had 
              not made love to Clara. She was, as it were, dumb to him,rather 
              distant. Dawes saw her very occasionally, but the twocould not get 
              an inch across the great distance between them. The three of them 
              were drifting forward.</p>
            <p>　　Dawes mended very slowly. He was in the convalescent homeat Skegness 
              at Christmas, nearly well again. Paul went to theseaside for a few 
              days. His father was with Annie in Sheffield. Dawes came to Paul's 
              lodgings. His time in the home was up. The two men, between whom 
              was such a big reserve, seemed faithfulto each other. Dawes depended 
              on Morel now. He knew Paul and Clarahad practically separated.</p>
            <p>　　Two days after Christmas Paul was to go back to Nottingham. The 
              evening before he sat with Dawes smoking before the fire.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You know Clara's coming down for the day to-morrow?&quot;he 
              said.</p>
            <p>　　The other man glanced at him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, you told me,&quot; he replied.</p>
            <p>　　Paul drank the remainder of his glass of whisky.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I told the landlady your wife was coming,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Did you?&quot; said Dawes, shrinking, but almost leaving 
              himselfin the other's hands. He got up rather stiffly, and reachedfor 
              Morel's glass.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Let me fill you up,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　Paul jumped up.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You sit still,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　But Dawes, with rather shaky hand, continued to mix the drink.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Say when,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Thanks!&quot; replied the other. &quot;But you've no business 
              to get up.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It does me good, lad,&quot; replied Dawes. &quot;I begin 
              to thinkI'm right again, then.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You are about right, you know.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I am, certainly I am,&quot; said Dawes, nodding to him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And Len says he can get you on in Sheffield.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Dawes glanced at him again, with dark eyes that agreed witheverything 
              the other would say, perhaps a trifle dominated by him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's funny,&quot; said Paul, &quot;starting again. I feel 
              in a lotbigger mess than you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;In what way, lad?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know. I don't know. It's as if I was in a tangledsort 
              of hole, rather dark and dreary, and no road anywhere.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I know--I understand it,&quot; Dawes said, nodding. &quot;But 
              you'llfind it'll come all right.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He spoke caressingly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I suppose so,&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　Dawes knocked his pipe in a hopeless fashion.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You've not done for yourself like I have,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　Morel saw the wrist and the white hand of the other mangripping 
              the stem of the pipe and knocking out the ash, as if hehad given 
              up.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;How old are you?&quot; Paul asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Thirty-nine,&quot; replied Dawes, glancing at him.</p>
            <p>　　Those brown eyes, full of the consciousness of failure,almost 
              pleading for reassurance, for someone to re-establish the manin 
              himself, to warm him, to set him up firm again, troubled Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You'll just be in your prime,&quot; said Morel. &quot;You 
              don't lookas if much life had gone out of you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The brown eyes of the other flashed suddenly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It hasn't,&quot; he said. &quot;The go is there.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Paul looked up and laughed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;We've both got plenty of life in us yet to make things 
              fly,&quot;he said.</p>
            <p>　　The eyes of the two men met. They exchanged one look. Having 
              recognised the stress of passion each in the other, they bothdrank 
              their whisky.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, begod!&quot; said Dawes, breathless.</p>
            <p>　　There was a pause.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And I don't see,&quot; said Paul, &quot;why you shouldn't 
              go on whereyou left off.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What---&quot; said Dawes, suggestively.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes--fit your old home together again.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Dawes hid his face and shook his head.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Couldn't be done,&quot; he said, and looked up with an 
              ironic smile.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why? Because you don't want?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Perhaps.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They smoked in silence. Dawes showed his teeth as he bithis pipe 
              stem.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You mean you don't want her?&quot; asked Paul.</p>
            <p>　　Dawes stared up at the picture with a caustic expressionon his 
              face.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I hardly know,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　The smoke floated softly up.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I believe she wants you,&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you?&quot; replied the other, soft, satirical, abstract.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes. She never really hitched on to me--you were always 
              therein the background. That's why she wouldn't get a divorce.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Dawes continued to stare in a satirical fashion at the pictureover 
              the mantelpiece.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;That's how women are with me,&quot; said Paul. &quot;They 
              want melike mad, but they don't want to belong to me. And she BELONGEDto 
              you all the time. I knew.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The triumphant male came up in Dawes. He showed his teethmore 
              distinctly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Perhaps I was a fool,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You were a big fool,&quot; said Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But perhaps even THEN you were a bigger fool,&quot; said 
              Dawes.</p>
            <p>　　There was a touch of triumph and malice in it.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you think so?&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　They were silent for some time.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;At any rate, I'm clearing out to-morrow,&quot; said Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I see,&quot; answered Dawes.</p>
            <p>　　Then they did not talk any more. The instinct to murdereach other 
              had returned. They almost avoided each other.</p>
            <p>　　They shared the same bedroom. When they retired Dawesseemed abstract, 
              thinking of something. He sat on the sideof the bed in his shirt, 
              looking at his legs.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Aren't you getting cold?&quot; asked Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I was lookin' at these legs,&quot; replied the other.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What's up with 'em? They look all right,&quot; replied 
              Paul,from his bed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;They look all right. But there's some water in 'em yet.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And what about it?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Come and look.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Paul reluctantly got out of bed and went to look at the ratherhandsome 
              legs of the other man that were covered with glistening,dark gold 
              hair.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Look here,&quot; said Dawes, pointing to his shin. &quot;Look 
              atthe water under here.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Where?&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　The man pressed in his finger-tips. They left little dentsthat 
              filled up slowly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's nothing,&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You feel,&quot; said Dawes.</p>
            <p>　　Paul tried with his fingers. It made little dents.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;H'm!&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Rotten, isn't it?&quot; said Dawes.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why? It's nothing much.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You're not much of a man with water in your legs.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I can't see as it makes any difference,&quot; said Morel. 
              &quot;I've got a weak chest.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He returned to his own bed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I suppose the rest of me's all right,&quot; said Dawes, 
              and heput out the light.</p>
            <p>　　In the morning it was raining. Morel packed his bag. The sea 
              was grey and shaggy and dismal. He seemed to be cuttinghimself off 
              from life more and more. It gave him a wicked pleasureto do it.</p>
            <p>　　The two men were at the station. Clara stepped out of the train,and 
              came along the platform, very erect and coldly composed. She wore 
              a long coat and a tweed hat. Both men hated herfor her composure. 
              Paul shook hands with her at the barrier. Dawes was leaning against 
              the bookstall, watching. His black overcoatwas buttoned up to the 
              chin because of the rain. He was pale,with almost a touch of nobility 
              in his quietness. He came forward,limping slightly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You ought to look better than this,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, I'm all right now.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The three stood at a loss. She kept the two men hesitatingnear 
              her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Shall we go to the lodging straight off,&quot; said Paul,&quot;or 
              somewhere else?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;We may as well go home,&quot; said Dawes.</p>
            <p>　　Paul walked on the outside of the pavement, then Dawes, then 
              Clara. They made polite conversation. The sitting-room faced the 
              sea,whose tide, grey and shaggy, hissed not far off.</p>
            <p>　　Morel swung up the big arm-chair.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Sit down, Jack,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't want that chair,&quot; said Dawes.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Sit down!&quot; Morel repeated.</p>
            <p>　　Clara took off her things and laid them on the couch. She hada 
              slight air of resentment. Lifting her hair with her fingers,she 
              sat down, rather aloof and composed. Paul ran downstairsto speak 
              to the landlady.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I should think you're cold,&quot; said Dawes to his wife. 
              &quot;Come nearer to the fire.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Thank you, I'm quite warm,&quot; she answered.</p>
            <p>　　She looked out of the window at the rain and at the sea.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;When are you going back?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, the rooms are taken until to-morrow, so he wants 
              meto stop. He's going back to-night.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And then you're thinking of going to Sheffield?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Are you fit to start work?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm going to start.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You've really got a place?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes--begin on Monday.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You don't look fit.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why don't I?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She looked again out of the window instead of answering.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And have you got lodgings in Sheffield?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Again she looked away out of the window. The panes wereblurred 
              with streaming rain.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And can you manage all right?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I s'd think so. I s'll have to!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They were silent when Morel returned.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I shall go by the four-twenty,&quot; he said as he entered.</p>
            <p>　　Nobody answered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I wish you'd take your boots off,&quot; he said to Clara.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;There's a pair of slippers of mine.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said. &quot;They aren't wet.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He put the slippers near her feet. She left them there.</p>
            <p>　　Morel sat down. Both the men seemed helpless, and each of themhad 
              a rather hunted look. But Dawes now carried himself quietly,seemed 
              to yield himself, while Paul seemed to screw himself up. Clara thought 
              she had never seen him look so small and mean. He was as if trying 
              to get himself into the smallest possible compass. And as he went 
              about arranging, and as he sat talking, there seemedsomething false 
              about him and out of tune. Watching him unknown,she said to herself 
              there was no stability about him. He was finein his way, passionate, 
              and able to give her drinks of pure lifewhen he was in one mood. 
              And now he looked paltry and insignificant. There was nothing stable 
              about him. Her husband had more manly dignity. At any rate HE did 
              not waft about with any wind. There was somethingevanescent about 
              Morel, she thought, something shifting and false. He would never 
              make sure ground for any woman to stand on. She despised him rather 
              for his shrinking together, getting smaller. Her husband at least 
              was manly, and when he was beaten gave in. But this other would 
              never own to being beaten. He would shift roundand round, prowl, 
              get smaller. She despised him. And yet she watchedhim rather than 
              Dawes, and it seemed as if their three fates lay inhis hands. She 
              hated him for it.</p>
            <p>　　She seemed to understand better now about men, and what they 
              couldor would do. She was less afraid of them, more sure of herself. 
              That they were not the small egoists she had imagined them madeher 
              more comfortable. She had learned a good deal--almost as muchas 
              she wanted to learn. Her cup had been full. It was still as fullas 
              she could carry. On the whole, she would not be sorry when hewas 
              gone.</p>
            <p>　　They had dinner, and sat eating nuts and drinking by the fire. 
              Not a serious word had been spoken. Yet Clara realised that Morelwas 
              withdrawing from the circle, leaving her the option to staywith 
              her husband. It angered her. He was a mean fellow, after all,to 
              take what he wanted and then give her back. She didnot remember 
              that she herself had had what she wanted,and really, at the bottom 
              of her heart, wished to be given back.</p>
            <p>　　Paul felt crumpled up and lonely. His mother had reallysupported 
              his life. He had loved her; they two had, in fact,faced the world 
              together. Now she was gone, and for ever behindhim was the gap in 
              life, the tear in the veil, through which hislife seemed to drift 
              slowly, as if he were drawn towards death. He wanted someone of 
              their own free initiative to help him. The lesserthings he began 
              to let go from him, for fear of this big thing,the lapse towards 
              death, following in the wake of his beloved. Clara could not stand 
              for him to hold on to. She wanted him,but not to understand him. 
              He felt she wanted the man on top,not the real him that was in trouble. 
              That would be too much troubleto her; he dared not give it her. 
              She could not cope with him. It made him ashamed. So, secretly ashamed 
              because he was in sucha mess, because his own hold on life was so 
              unsure, because nobodyheld him, feeling unsubstantial, shadowy, 
              as if he did not countfor much in this concrete world, he drew himself 
              together smallerand smaller. He did not want to die; he would not 
              give in. But he was not afraid of death. If nobody would help, he 
              would goon alone.</p>
            <p>　　Dawes had been driven to the extremity of life, until hewas afraid. 
              He could go to the brink of death, he could lie onthe edge and look 
              in. Then, cowed, afraid, he had to crawl back,and like a beggar 
              take what offered. There was a certain nobilityin it. As Clara saw, 
              he owned himself beaten, and he wantedto be taken back whether or 
              not. That she could do for him. It was three o'clock.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I am going by the four-twenty,&quot; said Paul again to 
              Clara. &quot;Are you coming then or later?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm meeting my father in Nottingham at seven-fifteen,&quot;he 
              said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then,&quot; she answered, &quot;I'll come later.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Dawes jerked suddenly, as if he had been held on a strain. He 
              looked out over the sea, but he saw nothing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;There are one or two books in the corner,&quot; said Morel. 
              &quot;I've done with 'em.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　At about four o'clock he went.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I shall see you both later,&quot; he said, as he shook 
              hands.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I suppose so,&quot; said Dawes. &quot;An' perhaps--one 
              day--I s'llbe able to pay you back the money as---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I shall come for it, you'll see,&quot; laughed Paul. &quot;I 
              s'llbe on the rocks before I'm very much older.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ay--well---&quot; said Dawes.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Good-bye,&quot; he said to Clara.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Good-bye,&quot; she said, giving him her hand. Then she 
              glancedat him for the last time, dumb and humble.</p>
            <p>　　He was gone. Dawes and his wife sat down again.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's a nasty day for travelling,&quot; said the man.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered.</p>
            <p>　　They talked in a desultory fashion until it grew dark. The landlady 
              brought in the tea. Dawes drew up his chair to thetable without 
              being invited, like a husband. Then he sat humblywaiting for his 
              cup. She served him as she would, like a wife,not consulting his 
              wish.</p>
            <p>　　After tea, as it drew near to six o'clock, he went to the window. 
              All was dark outside. The sea was roaring.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's raining yet,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Is it?&quot; she answered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You won't go to-night, shall you?&quot; he said, hesitating.</p>
            <p>　　She did not answer. He waited.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I shouldn't go in this rain,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you WANT me to stay?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　His hand as he held the dark curtain trembled.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　He remained with his back to her. She rose and went slowlyto 
              him. He let go the curtain, turned, hesitating, towards her. She 
              stood with her hands behind her back, looking up at him in a heavy,inscrutable 
              fashion.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you want me, Baxter?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　His voice was hoarse as he answered:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you want to come back to me?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She made a moaning noise, lifted her arms, and put them roundhis 
              neck, drawing him to her. He hid his face on her shoulder,holding 
              her clasped.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Take me back!&quot; she whispered, ecstatic. &quot;Take 
              me back,take me back!&quot; And she put her fingers through his 
              fine, thin dark hair,as if she were only semi-conscious. He tightened 
              his grasp on her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you want me again?&quot; he murmured, broken.</p>

            <p align="center"><b>DEATH IN THE FAMILY I</b></p>
            <p>　　ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive 
              boy,a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan 
              if hehad to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.</p>
            <p>　　In appearance he remained the flower of the family,being well 
              made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hairand fresh colouring, 
              and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded withlong lashes, together 
              with his generous manner and fiery temper,made him a favourite. 
              But as he grew older his temper became uncertain. He flew into rages 
              over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.</p>
            <p>　　His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes. He thought 
              only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all thatstood in his 
              way he hated, even if it were she. When he was in trouble he moaned 
              to her ceaselessly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Goodness, boy!&quot; she said, when he groaned about a 
              master who,he said, hated him, &quot;if you don't like it, alter 
              it, and if youcan't alter it, put up with it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,he 
              came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin. His 
              body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,shrank, 
              did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get meanand rather 
              despicable. There came over him a look of meannessand of paltriness. 
              And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied orordered the boy 
              about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's mannersgot worse and 
              worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When thechildren were growing 
              up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,the father was like some 
              ugly irritant to their souls. His mannersin the house were the same 
              as he used among the colliers down pit.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Dirty nuisance!&quot; Arthur would cry, jumping up and 
              goingstraight out of the house when his father disgusted him. And 
              Morel persisted the more because his children hated it. He seemed 
              to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,and driving them 
              nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitiveat the age of 
              fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growingup when his 
              father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worstof all.</p>
            <p>　　Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuoushatred 
              of his children.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;There's not a man tries harder for his family!&quot; he 
              would shout. &quot;He does his best for them, and then gets treated 
              like a dog. But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hardas 
              be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battlenow 
              went on nearly all between father and children, he persistingin 
              his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence. 
              They loathed him.</p>
            <p>　　Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when hewon 
              a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his motherdecided 
              to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and onlycome home 
              at week-ends.</p>
            <p>　　Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earningabout 
              four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,since 
              she had passed her examination, and there would be financialpeace 
              in the house.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant. 
              But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother. 
              Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming homein 
              the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all shehad pondered, 
              or of all that had occurred to her during the day. He sat and listened 
              with his earnestness. The two shared lives.</p>
            <p>　　William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought heran 
              engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gaspedat such 
              a fabulous price.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Eight guineas!&quot; said Morel. &quot;More fool him! If 
              he'd gen mesome on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Given YOU some of it!&quot; cried Mrs. Morel. &quot;Why 
              give YOUsome of it!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,and she 
              preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish. But now 
              the young man talked only of the dances to which he wentwith his 
              betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;or he 
              told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre likegreat 
              swells.</p>
            <p>　　He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said sheshould come 
              at the Christmas. This time William arrived witha lady, but with 
              no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper. Hearing footsteps, 
              she rose and went to the door. William entered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Hello, mother!&quot; He kissed her hastily, then stood 
              asideto present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume 
              of fineblack-and-white check, and furs.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Here's Gyp!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small 
              smile.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!&quot; she exclaimed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I am afraid you will be hungry,&quot; said Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, 
              Chubby?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;How should I?&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glancedround 
              the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with itsglittering 
              kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,its wooden chairs 
              and little deal table. At that moment Morelcame in.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Hello, dad!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The two shook hands, and William presented the lady. She gave 
              the same smile that showed her teeth.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;How do you do, Mr. Morel?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Morel bowed obsequiously.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourselfvery 
              welcome.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, thank you,&quot; she replied, rather amused.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You will like to go upstairs,&quot; said Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry upthis 
              box.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And don't be an hour dressing yourself up,&quot; said Williamto 
              his betrothed.</p>
            <p>　　Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,preceded 
              the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morelhad 
              vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight. The 
              colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Shall I unstrap the box?&quot; asked Annie.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, thank you very much!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I think she's rather tired, mother,&quot; said William. 
              &quot;It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Is there anything I can give her?&quot; asked Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh no, she'll be all right.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hourMiss 
              Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,very 
              fine for the collier's kitchen.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I told you you'd no need to change,&quot; said William 
              to her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, Chubby!&quot; Then she turned with that sweetish smileto 
              Mrs. Morel. &quot;Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Is he?&quot; said Mrs. Morel. &quot;That's not very nice 
              of him.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It isn't, really!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You are cold,&quot; said the mother. &quot;Won't you come 
              near the fire?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Morel jumped out of his armchair.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Come and sit you here!&quot; he cried. &quot;Come and sit 
              you here!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp,&quot; 
              said William.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, no!&quot; cried Morel. &quot;This cheer's warmest. 
              Come and sit here,Miss Wesson.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Thank you so much,&quot; said the girl, seating herselfin 
              the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,feeling 
              the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!&quot; she said, putting 
              up her mouthto him, and using the same intimate tone as if they 
              were alone;which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought 
              not tobe present. The young lady evidently did not realise them 
              as people: they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.</p>
            <p>　　In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have beena 
              lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,certainly 
              clownish--in short, the working classes. How was sheto adjust herself?</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'll go,&quot; said Annie.</p>
            <p>　　Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken. But 
              when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,she said: 
              &quot;Oh, thank you!&quot; in a gracious way.</p>
            <p>　　She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had beenso 
              poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,and 
              chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thicktwist 
              tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,as 
              he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,answered 
              quietly and rather briefly. The three children satround in silence 
              and admiration. Miss Western was the princess. Everything of the 
              best was got out for her: the best cups,the best spoons, the best 
              table cloth, the best coffee-jug. Thechildren thought she must find 
              it quite grand. She felt strange,not able to realise the people, 
              not knowing how to treat them. William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.</p>
            <p>　　At about ten o'clock he said to her:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Aren't you tired, Gyp?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Rather, Chubby,&quot; she answered, at once in the intimate 
              tonesand putting her head slightly on one side.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'll light her the candle, mother,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Very well,&quot; replied the mother.</p>
            <p>　　Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Good-night, Mrs. Morel,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tapinto 
              a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannelpit-singlet, 
              and kissed her mother good-night. She was to sharethe room with 
              the lady, because the house was full.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You wait a minute,&quot; said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And 
              Annie satnursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands 
              all round,to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded 
              by William. In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was 
              rather sore;he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody 
              had goneto bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his 
              legs apart,in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, mother?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, my son?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,for 
              his sake.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you like her?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; came the slow answer.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's differentfrom 
              her aunt's house, you know.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She does.&quot; Then he frowned swiftly. &quot;If only 
              she wouldn'tput on her BLESSED airs!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all 
              right.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;That's it, mother,&quot; he replied gratefully. But his 
              browwas gloomy. &quot;You know, she's not like you, mother. She's 
              not serious,and she can't think.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She's young, my boy.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when 
              she wasa child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't 
              bear. And her father was a rake. She's had no love.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No! Well, you must make up to her.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she'snever 
              had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLYfond 
              of me.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Anybody can see that.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us. Those 
              sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seemto 
              have the same principles.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You mustn't judge too hastily,&quot; said Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　But he seemed uneasy within himself.</p>
            <p>　　In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking roundthe 
              house.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Hello!&quot; he called, sitting on the stairs. &quot;Are 
              you getting up?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; her voice called faintly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Merry Christmas!&quot; he shouted to her.</p>
            <p>　　Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom. She 
              did not come down in half an hour.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?&quot; 
              he askedof Annie.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, she was,&quot; replied Annie.</p>
            <p>　　He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Happy New Year,&quot; he called.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Thank you, Chubby dear!&quot; came the laughing voice, 
              far away.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Buck up!&quot; he implored.</p>
            <p>　　It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her. Morel, 
              who always rose before six, looked at the clock.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, it's a winder!&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
            <p>　　The family had breakfasted, all but William. He wentto the foot 
              of the stairs.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?&quot; 
              he called,rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, 
              after thattime of preparation, something like magic. At last she 
              came,looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?&quot; 
              he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,Mrs. 
              Morel?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She played the grand lady at first. When she went with Williamto 
              chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her fursand London-made 
              costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expectedeverybody to bow to the 
              ground in admiration. And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at 
              the end of the road,watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the 
              father of princesand princesses.</p>
            <p>　　And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had beena sort 
              of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while shewas with 
              the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paulwait on 
              her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morelwith a certain 
              glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a dayor so she began 
              to change her tune.</p>
            <p>　　William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with themon their 
              walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul reallyDID admire 
              &quot;Gipsy&quot; wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcelyforgave 
              the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.</p>
            <p>　　On the second day, when Lily said: &quot;Oh, Annie, do you knowwhere 
              I left my muff?&quot; William replied:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But itangered 
              the young man that she made a servant of his sister.</p>
            <p>　　On the third evening William and Lily were sitting togetherin 
              the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to elevenMrs. 
              Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,followed 
              by his beloved.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Is it as late as that, mother?&quot; he said. She had beensitting 
              alone.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually 
              sit up.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Won't you go to bed, then?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Can't you trust us, mother?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till 
              elevenif you like, and I can read.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Go to bed, Gyp,&quot; he said to his girl. &quot;We won't 
              keepmater waiting.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Annie has left the candle burning, Lily,&quot; said Mrs. 
              Morel;&quot;I think you will see.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,and she 
              went. He returned to the kitchen.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Can't you trust us, mother?&quot; he repeated, rather offended.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two youngthings 
              like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mothergood-night.</p>
            <p>　　At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed hissweetheart 
              endlessly with his mother.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for 
              hera bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,when 
              I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's a queer sort of love to marry on,&quot; said Mrs. 
              Morel,&quot;if she holds you no more than that!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It IS funny!&quot; he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed 
              him. &quot;But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give 
              her up.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You know best,&quot; said Mrs. Morel. &quot;But if it is 
              as you say, Iwouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look 
              much like it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzledand 
              rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strengthand money 
              went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely affordto take his mother 
              to Nottingham when he came over.</p>
            <p>　　Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,to 
              his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his healthsuffered 
              from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,to whom he became 
              more and more significant, thought how to help.</p>
            <p>　　His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Mondaymorning 
              in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I think it will be a fine day.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He looked up in surprise. This meant something.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm. Well, 
              he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,and 
              I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I say, little woman, how lovely!&quot; he cried. &quot;And 
              we'll gothis afternoon?&quot;</p>

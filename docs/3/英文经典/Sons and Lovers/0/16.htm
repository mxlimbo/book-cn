            <p>　　They had expected a venerable and dignified monument. They found 
              a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like adecayed 
              mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field. Leonard 
              and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials,&quot;L. 
              W.&quot; and &quot;R. P.&quot;, in the old red sandstone; but Paul 
              desisted,because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks 
              aboutinitial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality. 
              Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.</p>
            <p>　　Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eatinglunch 
              or sporting about. Beyond was the garden of an old manor.It had 
              yew-hedges and thick clumps and bordersof yellow crocuses round 
              the lawn.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;See,&quot; said Paul to Miriam, &quot;what a quiet garden!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then shelooked 
              gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among allthese others; 
              he was different then--not her Paul, who understoodthe slightest 
              quiver of her innermost soul, but something else,speaking another 
              language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadenedher very perceptions. 
              Only when he came right back to her,leaving his other, his lesser 
              self, as she thought, would shefeel alive again. And now he asked 
              her to look at this garden,wanting the contact with her again. Impatient 
              of the set in the field,she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded 
              by sheaves of shut-up crocuses. A feeling of stillness, almost of 
              ecstasy, came over her. It felt almost as if she were alone with 
              him in this garden.</p>
            <p>　　Then he left her again and joined the others. Soon theystarted 
              home. Miriam loitered behind, alone. She did notfit in with the 
              others; she could very rarely get into humanrelations with anyone: 
              so her friend, her companion, her lover,was Nature. She saw the 
              sun declining wanly. In the dusky,cold hedgerows were some red leaves. 
              She lingered to gather them,tenderly, passionately. The love in 
              her finger-tips caressedthe leaves; the passion in her heart came 
              to a glow upon the leaves.</p>
            <p>　　Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road,and she 
              hurried forward. Turning a corner in the lane, she cameupon Paul, 
              who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it,working away 
              steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly. She hesitatedin her approach, 
              to watch.</p>
            <p>　　He remained concentrated in the middle of the road. Beyond,one 
              rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to makehim 
              stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm,as if the 
              setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took holdof her, and 
              she knew she must love him. And she had discovered him,discovered 
              in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness. Quivering 
              as at some &quot;annunciation&quot;, she went slowly forward.</p>
            <p>　　At last he looked up.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why,&quot; he exclaimed gratefully, &quot;have you waited 
              for me!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What is it?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;The spring broken here;&quot; and he showed her where his 
              umbrellawas injured.</p>
            <p>　　Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not donethe damage 
              himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,made 
              such a mountain of this molehill.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know,&quot;he 
              said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.</p>
            <p>　　The words went through Miriam like a blade. This, then, was theconfirmation 
              of her vision of him! She looked at him. But therewas about him 
              a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,not even speak 
              softly to him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Come on,&quot; he said. &quot;I can't do it;&quot; and 
              they went in silencealong the road.</p>
            <p>　　That same evening they were walking along under the treesby Nether 
              Green. He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to bestruggling to 
              convince himself.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You know,&quot; he said, with an effort, &quot;if one person 
              loves,the other does.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ah!&quot; she answered. &quot;Like mother said to me when 
              I was little,'Love begets love.'&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, something like that, I think it MUST be.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a veryterrible 
              thing,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, but it IS--at least with most people,&quot; he answered.</p>
            <p>　　And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strongin herself. 
              She always regarded that sudden coming upon himin the lane as a 
              revelation. And this conversation remainedgraven in her mind as 
              one of the letters of the law.</p>
            <p>　　Now she stood with him and for him. When, about this time,he 
              outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult,she 
              stuck to him, and believed he was right. And at this time shedreamed 
              dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable. These dreams cameagain later 
              on, developed to a more subtle psychological stage.</p>
            <p>　　On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursionto Wingfield 
              Manor. It was great excitement to Miriam to catch atrain at Sethley 
              Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd. They left 
              the train at Alfreton. Paul was interested in thestreet and in the 
              colliers with their dogs. Here was a new raceof miners. Miriam did 
              not live till they came to the church. They were all rather timid 
              of entering, with their bags of food,for fear of being turned out. 
              Leonard, a comic, thin fellow,went first; Paul, who would have died 
              rather than be sent back,went last. The place was decorated for 
              Easter. In the font hundredsof white narcissi seemed to be growing. 
              The air was dim and colouredfrom the windows and thrilled with a 
              subtle scent of liliesand narcissi. In that atmosphere Miriam's 
              soul came into a glow. Paul was afraid of the things he mustn't 
              do; and he was sensitiveto the feel of the place. Miriam turned 
              to him. He answered. They were together. He would not go beyond 
              the Communion-rail. Sheloved him for that. Her soul expanded into 
              prayer beside him. He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious 
              places. All his latent mysticism quivered into life. She was drawn 
              to him. He was a prayer along with her.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at oncebecame 
              awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent.</p>
            <p>　　It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor. 
              All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warmand 
              enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody wastip-top 
              full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft,atmospheric 
              grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everythingnear the ruin, 
              was perfect.</p>
            <p>　　The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other wallsare 
              blank and calm. The young folk were in raptures. They wentin trepidation, 
              almost afraid that the delight of exploring thisruin might be denied 
              them. In the first courtyard, within the highbroken walls, were 
              farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle onthe ground, the tyres 
              of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust. It was very still.</p>
            <p>　　All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly throughthe 
              fine clean arch of the inner courtyard. They were shy. Here on the 
              pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn treewas budding. 
              All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms werein the shadow 
              around them.</p>
            <p>　　After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin. This 
              time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guidesand expositors. 
              There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,where they 
              say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Think of the Queen going up here!&quot; said Miriam in 
              a low voice,as she climbed the hollow stairs.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;If she could get up,&quot; said Paul, &quot;for she had 
              rheumatismlike anything. I reckon they treated her rottenly.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You don't think she deserved it?&quot; asked Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, I don't. She was only lively.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They continued to mount the winding staircase. A high wind,blowing 
              through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft,and filled the 
              girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed,until he took 
              the hem of her dress and held it down for her. He did it perfectly 
              simply, as he would have picked up her glove. She remembered this 
              always.</p>
            <p>　　Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out,old and 
              handsome. Also, there were a few chill gillivers,in pale cold bud. 
              Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy,but he would not let her. 
              Instead, she had to wait behind him,and take from him each spray 
              as he gathered it and held it to her,each one separately, in the 
              purest manner of chivalry. The towerseemed to rock in the wind. 
              They looked over miles and milesof wooded country, and country with 
              gleams of pasture.</p>
            <p>　　The crypt underneath the manor was beautiful, and inperfect preservation. 
              Paul made a drawing: Miriam stayed with him. She was thinking of 
              Mary Queen of Scots looking with her strained,hopeless eyes, that 
              could not understand misery, over the hillswhence no help came, 
              or sitting in this crypt, being told of a Godas cold as the place 
              she sat in.</p>
            <p>　　They set off again gaily, looking round on their beloved manorthat 
              stood so clean and big on its hill.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Supposing you could have THAT farm,&quot; said Paul to 
              Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Wouldn't it be lovely to come and see you!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They were now in the bare country of stone walls, which he loved,and 
              which, though only ten miles from home, seemed so foreignto Miriam. 
              The party was straggling. As they were crossing alarge meadow that 
              sloped away from the sun, along a path embeddedwith innumerable 
              tiny glittering points, Paul, walkingalongside, laced his fingers 
              in the strings of the bag Miriamwas carrying, and instantly she 
              felt Annie behind, watchful and jealous. But the meadow was bathed 
              in a glory of sunshine, and the pathwas jewelled, and it was seldom 
              that he gave her any sign. She held her fingers very still among 
              the strings of the bag,his fingers touching; and the place was golden 
              as a vision.</p>
            <p>　　At last they came into the straggling grey village of Crich,that 
              lies high. Beyond the village was the famous Crich Standthat Paul 
              could see from the garden at home. The party pushed on. Great expanse 
              of country spread around and below. The lads wereeager to get to 
              the top of the hill. It was capped by a round knoll,half of which 
              was by now cut away, and on the top of which stoodan ancient monument, 
              sturdy and squat, for signalling in old days fardown into the level 
              lands of Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire.</p>
            <p>　　It was blowing so hard, high up there in the exposed place,that 
              the only way to be safe was to stand nailed by the windto the wan 
              of the tower. At their feet fell the precipicewhere the limestone 
              was quarried away. Below was a jumble ofhills and tiny villages--Mattock, 
              Ambergate, Stoney Middleton. The lads were eager to spy out the 
              church of Bestwood, far awayamong the rather crowded country on 
              the left. They were disgustedthat it seemed to stand on a plain. 
              They saw the hills of Derbyshirefall into the monotony of the Midlands 
              that swept away South.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam was somewhat scared by the wind, but the lads enjoyed 
              it. They went on, miles and miles, to Whatstandwell. All the foodwas 
              eaten, everybody was hungry, and there was very little money to 
              gethome with. But they managed to procure a loaf and a currant-loaf,which 
              they hacked to pieces with shut-knives, and ate sitting onthe wall 
              near the bridge, watching the bright Derwent rushing by,and the 
              brakes from Matlock pulling up at the inn.</p>
            <p>　　Paul was now pale with weariness. He had been responsiblefor 
              the party all day, and now he was done. Miriam understood,and kept 
              close to him, and he left himself in her hands.</p>
            <p>　　They had an hour to wait at Ambergate Station. Trains came,crowded 
              with excursionists returning to Manchester, Birmingham,and London.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;We might be going there--folk easily might think we're 
              goingthat far,&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　They got back rather late. Miriam, walking home with Geoffrey,watched 
              the moon rise big and red and misty. She felt somethingwas fulfilled 
              in her.</p>
            <p>　　She had an elder sister, Agatha, who was a school-teacher.Between 
              the two girls was a feud. Miriam considered Agatha worldly. And 
              she wanted herself to be a school-teacher.</p>
            <p>　　One Saturday afternoon Agatha and Miriam were upstairs dressing. 
              Their bedroom was over the stable. It was a low room, not very large,and 
              bare. Miriam had nailed on the wall a reproduction of Veronese's&quot;St. 
              Catherine&quot;. She loved the woman who sat in the window, dreaming. 
              Her own windows were too small to sit in. But the front one wasdripped 
              over with honeysuckle and virginia creeper, and lookedupon the tree-tops 
              of the oak-wood across the yard, while thelittle back window, no 
              bigger than a handkerchief, was a loopholeto the east, to the dawn 
              beating up against the beloved round hills.</p>
            <p>　　The two sisters did not talk much to each other. Agatha,who was 
              fair and small and determined, had rebelled againstthe home atmosphere, 
              against the doctrine of &quot;the other cheek&quot;.She was out 
              in the world now, in a fair way to be independent. And she insisted 
              on worldly values, on appearance, on manners,on position, which 
              Miriam would fain have ignored.</p>
            <p>　　Both girls liked to be upstairs, out of the way, when Paul came. 
              They preferred to come running down, open the stair-foot door,and 
              see him watching, expectant of them. Miriam stood painfullypulling 
              over her head a rosary he had given her. It caughtin the fine mesh 
              of her hair. But at last she had it on, and thered-brown wooden 
              beads looked well against her cool brown neck. She was a well-developed 
              girl, and very handsome. But in the littlelooking-glass nailed against 
              the whitewashed wall she could only seea fragment of herself at 
              a time. Agatha had bought a little mirrorof her own, which she propped 
              up to suit herself. Miriam was nearthe window. Suddenly she heard 
              the well-known click of the chain,and she saw Paul fling open the 
              gate, push his bicycle into the yard. She saw him look at the house, 
              and she shrank away. He walkedin a nonchalant fashion, and his bicycle 
              went with him as if itwere a live thing.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Paul's come!&quot; she exclaimed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Aren't you glad?&quot; said Agatha cuttingly.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam stood still in amazement and bewilderment.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, aren't you?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, but I'm not going to let him see it, and think I wanted 
              him.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Miriam was startled. She heard him putting his bicycle in thestable 
              underneath, and talking to Jimmy, who had been a pit-horse,and who 
              was seedy.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, Jimmy my lad, how are ter? Nobbut sick an'sadly, 
              like? Why, then, it's a shame, my owd lad.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She heard the rope run through the hole as the horse lifted itshead 
              from the lad's caress. How she loved to listen when he thoughtonly 
              the horse could hear. But there was a serpent in her Eden. She searched 
              earnestly in herself to see if she wanted Paul Morel. She felt there 
              would be some disgrace in it. Full of twisted feeling,she was afraid 
              she did want him. She stood self-convicted. Thencame an agony of 
              new shame. She shrank within herself in a coilof torture. Did she 
              want Paul Morel, and did he know she wanted him? What a subtle infamy 
              upon her. She felt as if her whole soul coiledinto knots of shame.</p>
            <p>　　Agatha was dressed first, and ran downstairs. Miriam heardher 
              greet the lad gaily, knew exactly how brilliant her greyeyes became 
              with that tone. She herself would have felt it boldto have greeted 
              him in such wise. Yet there she stood under theself-accusation of 
              wanting him, tied to that stake of torture. In bitter perplexity 
              she kneeled down and prayed:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;O Lord, let me not love Paul Morel. Keep me from loving 
              him,if I ought not to love him.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Something anomalous in the prayer arrested her. She liftedher 
              head and pondered. How could it be wrong to love him? Love wasGod's 
              gift. And yet it caused her shame. That was because of him,Paul 
              Morel. But, then, it was not his affair, it was her own,between 
              herself and God. She was to be a sacrifice. But it wasGod's sacrifice, 
              not Paul Morel's or her own. After a few minutesshe hid her face 
              in the pillow again, and said:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But, Lord, if it is Thy will that I should love him,make 
              me love him--as Christ would, who died for the souls of men. Make 
              me love him splendidly, because he is Thy son.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She remained kneeling for some time, quite still, and deeply 
              moved,her black hair against the red squares and the lavender-spriggedsquares 
              of the patchwork quilt. Prayer was almost essential to her.Then 
              she fell into that rapture of self-sacrifice,identifying herself 
              with a God who was sacrificed, which givesto so many human souls 
              their deepest bliss.</p>
            <p>　　When she went downstairs Paul was lying back in an armchair,holding 
              forth with much vehemence to Agatha, who was scorning a littlepainting 
              he had brought to show her. Miriam glanced at the two,and avoided 
              their levity. She went into the parlour to be alone.</p>
            <p>　　It was tea-time before she was able to speak to Paul, and thenher 
              manner was so distant he thought he had offended her.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam discontinued her practice of going each Thursday eveningto 
              the library in Bestwood. After calling for Paul regularlyduring 
              the whole spring, a number of trifling incidents and tinyinsults 
              from his family awakened her to their attitude towards her,and she 
              decided to go no more. So she announced to Paul one eveningshe would 
              not call at his house again for him on Thursday nights.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why?&quot; he asked, very short.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nothing. Only I'd rather not.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Very well.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But,&quot; she faltered, &quot;if you'd care to meet me, 
              we could stillgo together.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Meet you where?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Somewhere--where you like.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I shan't meet you anywhere. I don't see why you shouldn'tkeep 
              calling for me. But if you won't, I don't want to meet you.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　So the Thursday evenings which had been so precious to her,and 
              to him, were dropped. He worked instead. Mrs. Morel sniffedwith 
              satisfaction at this arrangement.</p>
            <p>　　He would not have it that they were lovers. The intimacybetween 
              them had been kept so abstract, such a matter of the soul,all thought 
              and weary struggle into consciousness, that he saw it onlyas a platonic 
              friendship. He stoutly denied there was anything elsebetween them. 
              Miriam was silent, or else she very quietly agreed. He was a fool 
              who did not know what was happening to himself. By tacit agreement 
              they ignored the remarks and insinuations oftheir acquaintances.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;We aren't lovers, we are friends,&quot; he said to her. 
              &quot;WE know it. Let them talk. What does it matter what they say.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Sometimes, as they were walking together, she slipped her armtimidly 
              into his. But he always resented it, and she knew it. It caused 
              a violent conflict in him. With Miriam he was alwayson the high 
              plane of abstraction, when his natural fire of love wastransmitted 
              into the fine stream of thought. She would have it so. If he were 
              jolly and, as she put it, flippant, she waited till he cameback 
              to her, till the change had taken place in him again, and hewas 
              wrestling with his own soul, frowning, passionate in his desirefor 
              understanding. And in this passion for understanding her soullay 
              close to his; she had him all to herself. But he must be madeabstract 
              first.</p>
            <p>　　Then, if she put her arm in his, it caused him almost torture. 
              His consciousness seemed to split. The place where she was touchinghim 
              ran hot with friction. He was one internecine battle, and hebecame 
              cruel to her because of it.</p>
            <p>　　One evening in midsummer Miriam called at the house,warm from 
              climbing. Paul was alone in the kitchen; his mothercould be heard 
              moving about upstairs.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Come and look at the sweet-peas,&quot; he said to the girl.</p>
            <p>　　They went into the garden. The sky behind the townlet and thechurch 
              was orange-red; the flower-garden was flooded with a strangewarm 
              light that lifted every leaf into significance. Paul passedalong 
              a fine row of sweet-peas, gathering a blossom here and there,all 
              cream and pale blue. Miriam followed, breathing the fragrance. To 
              her, flowers appealed with such strength she felt she mustmake them 
              part of herself. When she bent and breathed a flower,it was as if 
              she and the flower were loving each other. Paul hatedher for it. 
              There seemed a sort of exposure about the action,something too intimate.</p>
            <p>　　When he had got a fair bunch, they returned to the house. He 
              listened for a moment to his mother's quiet movement upstairs,then 
              he said:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Come here, and let me pin them in for you.&quot; He arranged 
              themtwo or three at a time in the bosom of her dress, stepping backnow 
              and then to see the effect. &quot;You know,&quot; he said, taking 
              the pinout of his mouth, &quot;a woman ought always to arrange her 
              flowersbefore her glass.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Miriam laughed. She thought flowers ought to be pinnedin one's 
              dress without any care. That Paul should take painsto fix her flowers 
              for her was his whim.</p>
            <p>　　He was rather offended at her laughter.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Some women do--those who look decent,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam laughed again, but mirthlessly, to hear him thus mixher 
              up with women in a general way. From most men she would haveignored 
              it. But from him it hurt her.</p>
            <p>　　He had nearly finished arranging the flowers when he heardhis 
              mother's footstep on the stairs. Hurriedly he pushedin the last 
              pin and turned away.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't let mater know,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam picked up her books and stood in the doorway lookingwith 
              chagrin at the beautiful sunset. She would call for Paulno more, 
              she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Good-evening, Mrs. Morel,&quot; she said, in a deferential 
              way. She sounded as if she felt she had no right to be there.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, is it you, Miriam?&quot; replied Mrs. Morel coolly.</p>
            <p>　　But Paul insisted on everybody's accepting his friendshipwith 
              the girl, and Mrs. Morel was too wise to have any open rupture.</p>
            <p>　　It was not till he was twenty years old that the family couldever 
              afford to go away for a holiday. Mrs. Morel had never been awayfor 
              a holiday, except to see her sister, since she had been married. 
              Now at last Paul had saved enough money, and they were all going. 
              There was to be a party: some of Annie's friends, one friend of 
              Paul's,a young man in the same office where William had previously 
              been,and Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　It was great excitement writing for rooms. Paul and hismother 
              debated it endlessly between them. They wanted a furnishedcottage 
              for two weeks. She thought one week would be enough,but he insisted 
              on two.</p>
            <p>　　At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as 
              theywished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation. 
              Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake. She would havea real 
              holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what itwould be 
              like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty. There was 
              wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam. She seemed to 
              brood with joy over it. But the Morel's house rangwith excitement.</p>
            <p>　　They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train. Paul 
              suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because itwas so 
              far for her to walk. She came down for supper. Everybody was so 
              excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth. But almost as 
              soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight. 
              He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe,and 
              so he must read it to Miriam. He would never have got so far inthe 
              direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family. 
              But now they condescended to listen. Miriam sat on the sofaabsorbed 
              in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him,when he was 
              present. Mrs. Morel sat jealously in her own chair. She was going 
              to hear also. And even Annie and the father attended,Morel with 
              his head cocked on one side, like somebody listeningto a sermon 
              and feeling conscious of the fact. Paul ducked his headover the 
              book. He had got now all the audience he cared for. And Mrs. Morel 
              and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listenbest and 
              win his favour. He was in very high feather.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But,&quot; interrupted Mrs. Morel, &quot;what IS the 'Bride 
              of Enderby'that the bells are supposed to ring?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warningagainst 
              water. I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood,&quot;he 
              replied. He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was,but 
              he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk. 
              They listened and believed him. He believed himself.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And the people knew what that tune meant?&quot; said his 
              mother.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes--just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers 
              o'the Forest'--and when they used to ring the bells backward for 
              alarm.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;How?&quot; said Annie. &quot;A bell sounds the same whether 
              it's rungbackwards or forwards.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But,&quot; he said, &quot;if you start with the deep bell 
              and ring upto the high one--der--der--der--der--der--der--der--der!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He ran up the scale. Everybody thought it clever. He thoughtso 
              too. Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Hm!&quot; said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished. 
              &quot;But Iwish everything that's written weren't so sad.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for,&quot;said 
              Morel.</p>
            <p>　　There was a pause. Annie got up to clear the table.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam rose to help with the pots.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Let ME help to wash up,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Certainly not,&quot; cried Annie. &quot;You sit down again. 
              There aren't many.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat downagain 
              to look at the book with Paul.</p>
            <p>　　He was master of the party; his father was no good. And greattortures 
              he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsbyinstead 
              of at Mablethorpe. And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage. His 
              bold little mother did that.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Here!&quot; she cried to a man. &quot;Here!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed laughter.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?&quot; said 
              Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Two shillings.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why, how far is it?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;A good way.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't believe it,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　But she scrambled in. There were eight crowded in one oldseaside 
              carriage.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You see,&quot; said Mrs. Morel, &quot;it's only threepence 
              each,and if it were a tramcar---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　They drove along. Each cottage they came to, Mrs. Morel cried:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Is it this? Now, this is it!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Everybody sat breathless. They drove past. There wasa universal 
              sigh.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm thankful it wasn't that brute,&quot; said Mrs. Morel. 
              &quot;I WAS frightened.&quot; They drove on and on.</p>
            <p>　　At last they descended at a house that stood alone overthe dyke 
              by the highroad. There was wild excitement because theyhad to cross 
              a little bridge to get into the front garden. But they loved the 
              house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadowon one side, and immense 
              expanse of land patched in white barley,yellow oats, red wheat, 
              and green root-crops, flat and stretchinglevel to the sky.</p>
            <p>　　Paul kept accounts. He and his mother ran the show. The total 
              expenses--lodging, food, everything--was sixteen shillingsa week 
              per person. He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings. Morel was 
              wandering abroad quite early.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You, Paul,&quot; his mother called from the bedroom, &quot;eat 
              a pieceof bread-and-butter.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;All right,&quot; he answered.</p>
            <p>　　And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state atthe 
              breakfast-table. The woman of the house was young. Her husbandwas 
              blind, and she did laundry work. So Mrs. Morel always washedthe 
              pots in the kitchen and made the beds.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But you said you'd have a real holiday,&quot; said Paul, 
              &quot;and nowyou work.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Work!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;What are you talking about!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He loved to go with her across the fields to the villageand the 
              sea. She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused herfor being 
              a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all theothers 
              went to the &quot;Coons&quot;. Coons were insufferably stupid to 
              Miriam,so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached 
              priggishlyto Annie about the fatuity of listening to them. Yet he, 
              too,knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously. 
              And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very 
              much. Yet to Annie he said:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it. Nobody 
              withmore gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen.&quot; 
              And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others: 
              &quot;I suppose they're at the 'Coons'.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs. She had a straightchin 
              that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn. 
              She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang,even 
              when it was:</p>
            <p>　　 &quot;Come down lover's lane For a walk with me, talk with me.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were atthe 
              &quot;Coons&quot;, she had him to herself. He talked to her endlesslyabout 
              his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of skyand land 
              in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will,just as 
              the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,meant 
              the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,on and on, 
              nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicularlines and 
              to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at heaven andtouched 
              the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine. Himself, he said,was 
              Norman, Miriam was Gothic. She bowed in consent even to that.</p>
            <p>　　One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shoreof sand 
              towards Theddlethorpe. The long breakers plunged and ranin a hiss 
              of foam along the coast. It was a warm evening. There was not a 
              figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand,no noise but the 
              sound of the sea. Paul loved to see it clangingat the land. He loved 
              to feel himself between the noise of itand the silence of the sandy 
              shore. Miriam was with him. Everything grew very intense. It was 
              quite dark when theyturned again. The way home was through a gap 
              in the sandhills,and then along a raised grass road between two 
              dykes. The countrywas black and still. From behind the sandhills 
              came the whisperof the sea. Paul and Miriam walked in silence. Suddenly 
              he started. The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame, and 
              he couldscarcely breathe. An enormous orange moon was staring at 
              themfrom the rim of the sandhills. He stood still, looking at it.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ah!&quot; cried Miriam, when she saw it.</p>
            <p>　　He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddymoon, 
              the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level. His heart 
              beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What is it?&quot; murmured Miriam, waiting for him.</p>
            <p>　　He turned and looked at her. She stood beside him, for everin 
              shadow. Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was watchinghim 
              unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid--deeplymoved 
              and religious. That was her best state. He was impotentagainst it. 
              His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest. But he could 
              not get across to her. There were flashes in his blood. But somehow 
              she ignored them. She was expecting some religiousstate in him. 
              Still yearning, she was half aware of his passion,and gazed at him, 
              troubled.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What is it?&quot; she murmured again.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's the moon,&quot; he answered, frowning.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; she assented. &quot;Isn't it wonderful?&quot; 
              She was curiousabout him. The crisis was past.</p>
            <p>　　He did not know himself what was the matter. He was naturallyso 
              young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know hewanted 
              to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there. He was afraid 
              of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wantsa woman had 
              in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrankin her convulsed, 
              coiled torture from the thought of sucha thing, he had winced to 
              the depths of his soul. And now this&quot;purity&quot; prevented 
              even their first love-kiss. It was as if she couldscarcely stand 
              the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,and then he was 
              too shrinking and sensitive to give it.</p>
            <p>　　As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the moonand 
              did not speak. She plodded beside him. He hated her, for sheseemed 
              in some way to make him despise himself. Looking ahead--he sawthe 
              one light in the darkness, the window of their lamp-lit cottage.</p>
            <p>　　He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, everybody else has been in long ago!&quot; said his 
              motheras they entered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What does that matter!&quot; he cried irritably. &quot;I 
              can go a walkif I like, can't I?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And I should have thought you could get in to supper withthe 
              rest,&quot; said Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I shall please myself,&quot; he retorted. &quot;It's not 
              LATE. I shall do as I like.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Very well,&quot; said his mother cuttingly, &quot;then 
              DO as you like.&quot; And she took no further notice of him that 
              evening. Which hepretended neither to notice nor to care about, 
              but sat reading. Miriam read also, obliterating herself. Mrs. Morel 
              hated herfor making her son like this. She watched Paul growing 
              irritable,priggish, and melancholic. For this she put the blame 
              on Miriam. Annie and all her friends joined against the girl. Miriam 
              had nofriend of her own, only Paul. But she did not suffer so much,because 
              she despised the triviality of these other people.</p>
            <p>　　And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his easeand naturalness. 
              And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation.</p>

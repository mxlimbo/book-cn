            <p>　　&quot;THE BOTTOMS&quot; succeeded to &quot;Hell Row&quot;. Hell 
              Row was a block of thatched,bulging cottages that stood by the brookside 
              on Greenhill Lane. There lived the colliers who worked in the little 
              gin-pits twofields away. The brook ran under the alder trees, scarcely 
              soiledby these small mines, whose coal was drawn to the surface 
              bydonkeys that plodded wearily in a circle round a gin. And allover 
              the countryside were these same pits, some of which had beenworked 
              in the time of Charles II, the few colliers and the donkeysburrowing 
              down like ants into the earth, making queer moundsand little black 
              places among the corn-fields and the meadows. And the cottages of 
              these coal-miners, in blocks and pairs hereand there, together with 
              odd farms and homes of the stockingers,straying over the parish, 
              formed the village of Bestwood.</p>
            <p>　　Then, some sixty years ago, a sudden change took place. The gin-pits 
              were elbowed aside by the large mines ofthe financiers. The coal 
              and iron field of Nottinghamshire andDerbyshire was discovered. 
              Carston, Waite and Co. appeared. Amid tremendous excitement, Lord 
              Palmerston formally openedthe company's first mine at Spinney Park, 
              on the edge of Sherwood Forest.</p>
            <p>　　About this time the notorious Hell Row, which through growingold 
              had acquired an evil reputation, was burned down, and much dirtwas 
              cleansed away.</p>
            <p>　　Carston, Waite &amp; Co. found they had struck on a good thing,so, 
              down the valleys of the brooks from Selby and Nuttall, new mineswere 
              sunk, until soon there were six pits working. From Nuttall,high 
              up on the sandstone among the woods, the railway ran, past theruined 
              priory of the Carthusians and past Robin Hood's Well, down toSpinney 
              Park, then on to Minton, a large mine among corn-fields;from Minton 
              across the farmlands of the valleyside toBunker's Hill, branching 
              off there, and runningnorth to Beggarlee and Selby, that looks over 
              at Crich and the hillsof Derbyshire: six mines like black studs 
              on the countryside,linked by a loop of fine chain, the railway.</p>
            <p>　　To accommodate the regiments of miners, Carston, Waite and Co. 
              built the Squares, great quadrangles of dwellings on the hillsideof 
              Bestwood, and then, in the brook valley, on the site of Hell Row,they 
              erected the Bottoms.</p>
            <p>　　The Bottoms consisted of six blocks of miners' dwellings,two 
              rows of three, like the dots on a blank-six domino, and twelvehouses 
              in a block. This double row of dwellings sat at the footof the rather 
              sharp slope from Bestwood, and looked out, from theattic windows 
              at least, on the slow climb of the valley towards Selby.</p>
            <p>　　The houses themselves were substantial and very decent. One could 
              walk all round, seeing little front gardens with auriculasand saxifrage 
              in the shadow of the bottom block, sweet-williams and pinksin the 
              sunny top block; seeing neat front windows, little porches,little 
              privet hedges, and dormer windows for the attics. But thatwas outside; 
              that was the view on to the uninhabited parlours of allthe colliers' 
              wives. The dwelling-room, the kitchen, was at the backof the house, 
              facing inward between the blocks, looking at a scrubbyback garden, 
              and then at the ash-pits. And between the rows,between the long 
              lines of ash-pits, went the alley, where the childrenplayed and 
              the women gossiped and the men smoked. So, the actualconditions 
              of living in the Bottoms, that was so well built andthat looked 
              so nice, were quite unsavoury because people must livein the kitchen, 
              and the kitchens opened on to that nasty alley of ash-pits.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel was not anxious to move into the Bottoms,which was 
              already twelve years old and on the downward path,when she descended 
              to it from Bestwood. But it was the best shecould do. Moreover, 
              she had an end house in one of the top blocks,and thus had only 
              one neighbour; on the other side an extra stripof garden. And, having 
              an end house, she enjoyed a kind of aristocracyamong the other women 
              of the &quot;between&quot; houses, because her rentwas five shillings 
              and sixpence instead of five shillings a week. But this superiority 
              in station was not much consolation to Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　She was thirty-one years old, and had been married eight years.A 
              rather small woman, of delicate mould but resolute bearing,she shrank 
              a little from the first contact with the Bottoms women. She came 
              down in the July, and in the September expected herthird baby.</p>
            <p>　　Her husband was a miner. They had only been in their new homethree 
              weeks when the wakes, or fair, began. Morel, she knew, was sureto 
              make a holiday of it. He went off early on the Monday morning,the 
              day of the fair. The two children were highly excited. William, 
              a boy of seven, fled off immediately after breakfast,to prowl round 
              the wakes ground, leaving Annie, who was only five,to whine all 
              morning to go also. Mrs. Morel did her work. She scarcely knew her 
              neighbours yet, and knew no one with whomto trust the little girl. 
              So she promised to take her to the wakesafter dinner.</p>
            <p>　　William appeared at half-past twelve. He was a very active lad,fair-haired, 
              freckled, with a touch of the Dane or Norwegianabout him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Can I have my dinner, mother?&quot; he cried, rushing in 
              with hiscap on. &quot;'Cause it begins at half-past one, the man 
              says so.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You can have your dinner as soon as it's done,&quot; replied 
              the mother.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Isn't it done?&quot; he cried, his blue eyes staring at 
              herin indignation. &quot;Then I'm goin' be-out it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You'll do nothing of the sort. It will be done in five 
              minutes. It is only half-past twelve.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;They'll be beginnin',&quot; the boy half cried, half shouted.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You won't die if they do,&quot; said the mother. &quot;Besides, 
              it'sonly half-past twelve, so you've a full hour.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The lad began hastily to lay the table, and directly the threesat 
              down. They were eating batter-pudding and jam, when the boyjumped 
              off his chair and stood perfectly stiff. Some distanceaway could 
              be heard the first small braying of a merry-go-round,and the tooting 
              of a horn. His face quivered as he looked at his mother.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I told you!&quot; he said, running to the dresser for his 
              cap.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Take your pudding in your hand--and it's only five past 
              one,so you were wrong--you haven't got your twopence,&quot; cried 
              the motherin a breath.</p>
            <p>　　The boy came back, bitterly disappointed, for his twopence,then 
              went off without a word.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I want to go, I want to go,&quot; said Annie, beginning 
              to cry.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, and you shall go, whining, wizzening little stick!&quot;said 
              the mother. And later in the afternoon she trudged up thehill under 
              the tall hedge with her child. The hay was gatheredfrom the fields, 
              and cattle were turned on to the eddish. It was warm, peaceful.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel did not like the wakes. There were two sets of horses,one 
              going by steam, one pulled round by a pony; three organswere grinding, 
              and there came odd cracks of pistol-shots, fearfulscreeching of 
              the cocoanut man's rattle, shouts of the Aunt Sally man,screeches 
              from the peep-show lady. The mother perceived her son gazingenraptured 
              outside the Lion Wallace booth, at the pictures of thisfamous lion 
              that had killed a negro and maimed for life two white men. She left 
              him alone, and went to get Annie a spin of toffee. Presently the 
              lad stood in front of her, wildly excited.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You never said you was coming--isn't the' a lot of things?-that 
              lion's killed three men-l've spent my tuppence-an' look here.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He pulled from his pocket two egg-cups, with pink moss-roseson 
              them.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I got these from that stall where y'ave ter get them marblesin 
              them holes. An' I got these two in two goes-'aepenny a go-they'vegot 
              moss-roses on, look here. I wanted these.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She knew he wanted them for her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;H'm!&quot; she said, pleased. &quot;They ARE pretty!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Shall you carry 'em, 'cause I'm frightened o' breakin' 
              'em?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He was tipful of excitement now she had come, led her aboutthe 
              ground, showed her everything. Then, at the peep-show, sheexplained 
              the pictures, in a sort of story, to which he listenedas if spellbound. 
              He would not leave her. All the time hestuck close to her, bristling 
              with a small boy's pride of her. For no other woman looked such 
              a lady as she did, in her little blackbonnet and her cloak. She 
              smiled when she saw women she knew. When she was tired she said 
              to her son:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, are you coming now, or later?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Are you goin' a'ready?&quot; he cried, his face full of 
              reproach.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Already? It is past four, I know.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What are you goin' a'ready for?&quot; he lamented.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You needn't come if you don't want,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　And she went slowly away with her little girl, whilst her sonstood 
              watching her, cut to the heart to let her go, and yet unableto leave 
              the wakes. As she crossed the open ground in front ofthe Moon and 
              Stars she heard men shouting, and smelled the beer,and hurried a 
              little, thinking her husband was probably in the bar.</p>
            <p>　　At about half-past six her son came home, tired now, rather pale,and 
              somewhat wretched. He was miserable, though he did not know it,because 
              he had let her go alone. Since she had gone, he had notenjoyed his 
              wakes.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Has my dad been?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; said the mother.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He's helping to wait at the Moon and Stars. I seed him 
              throughthat black tin stuff wi' holes in, on the window, wi' his 
              sleevesrolled up.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ha!&quot; exclaimed the mother shortly. &quot;He's got 
              no money. An' he'll be satisfied if he gets his 'lowance, whether 
              theygive him more or not.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　When the light was fading, and Mrs. Morel could see no more to 
              sew,she rose and went to the door. Everywhere was the sound of excitement,the 
              restlessness of the holiday, that at last infected her. She wentout 
              into the side garden. Women were coming home from the wakes,the 
              children hugging a white lamb with green legs, or a wooden horse. 
              Occasionally a man lurched past, almost as full as he could carry. 
              Sometimes a good husband came along with his family, peacefully. 
              But usually the women and children were alone. The stay-at-home 
              mothersstood gossiping at the corners of the alley, as the twilight 
              sank,folding their arms under their white aprons.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel was alone, but she was used to it. Her son and herlittle 
              girl slept upstairs; so, it seemed, her home was there behind her,fixed 
              and stable. But she felt wretched with the coming child. The world 
              seemed a dreary place, where nothing else would happenfor her--at 
              least until William grew up. But for herself,nothing but this dreary 
              endurance--till the children grew up. And the children! She could 
              not afford to have this third. She did not want it. The father was 
              serving beer in a public house,swilling himself drunk. She despised 
              him, and was tied to him. This coming child was too much for her. 
              If it were not for Williamand Annie, she was sick of it, the struggle 
              withpoverty and ugliness and meanness.</p>
            <p>　　She went into the front garden, feeling too heavy to takeherself 
              out, yet unable to stay indoors. The heat suffocated her. And looking 
              ahead, the prospect of her life made her feel as if shewere buried 
              alive.</p>
            <p>　　The front garden was a small square with a privet hedge. There 
              she stood, trying to soothe herself with the scent of flowersand 
              the fading, beautiful evening. Opposite her small gate was thestile 
              that led uphill, under the tall hedge between the burning glowof 
              the cut pastures. The sky overhead throbbed and pulsed with light. 
              The glow sank quickly off the field; the earth and the hedgessmoked 
              dusk. As it grew dark, a ruddy glare came out on the hilltop,and 
              out of the glare the diminished commotion of the fair.</p>
            <p>　　Sometimes, down the trough of darkness formed by the pathunder 
              the hedges, men came lurching home. One young man lapsedinto a run 
              down the steep bit that ended the hill, and went with acrash into 
              the stile. Mrs. Morel shuddered. He picked himself up,swearing viciously, 
              rather pathetically, as if he thought the stilehad wanted to hurt 
              him.</p>
            <p>　　She went indoors, wondering if things were never going to alter. 
              She was beginning by now to realise that they would not. She seemedso 
              far away from her girlhood, she wondered if it were the sameperson 
              walking heavily up the back garden at the Bottoms as had runso lightly 
              up the breakwater at Sheerness ten years before.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What have I to do with it?&quot; she said to herself. &quot;What 
              haveI to do with all this? Even the child I am going to have! It 
              doesn't seem as if I were taken into account.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Sometimes life takes hold of one, carries the body along,accomplishes 
              one's history, and yet is not real, but leaves oneselfas it were 
              slurred over.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I wait,&quot; Mrs. Morel said to herself--&quot;I wait, 
              and what I waitfor can never come.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Then she straightened the kitchen, lit the lamp, mended the fire,looked 
              out the washing for the next day, and put it to soak. After which 
              she sat down to her sewing. Through the long hours herneedle flashed 
              regularly through the stuff. Occasionally she sighed,moving to relieve 
              herself. And all the time she was thinkinghow to make the most of 
              what she had, for the children's sakes.</p>
            <p>　　At half-past eleven her husband came. His cheeks were veryred 
              and very shiny above his black moustache. His head nodded slightly.He 
              was pleased with himself.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh! Oh! waitin' for me, lass? I've bin 'elpin' Anthony, 
              an'what's think he's gen me? Nowt b'r a lousy hae'f-crown, an'that's 
              ivry penny---&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He thinks you've made the rest up in beer,&quot; she said 
              shortly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;An' I 'aven't--that I 'aven't. You b'lieve me, I've 'advery 
              little this day, I have an' all.&quot; His voice went tender. &quot;Here, 
              an' I browt thee a bit o' brandysnap, an' a cocoanut for th'children.&quot; 
              He laid the gingerbread and the cocoanut, a hairy object,on the 
              table. &quot;Nay, tha niver said thankyer for nowt i' thy life,did 
              ter?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　As a compromise, she picked up the cocoanut and shook it,to see 
              if it had any milk.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's a good 'un, you may back yer life o' that. I got it 
              fra'Bill Hodgkisson. 'Bill,' I says, 'tha non wants them three nuts,does 
              ter? Arena ter for gi'ein' me one for my bit of a lad an'wench?' 
              'I ham, Walter, my lad,' 'e says; 'ta'e which on 'emter's a mind.' 
              An' so I took one, an' thanked 'im. I didn'tlike ter shake it afore 
              'is eyes, but 'e says, 'Tha'd better ma'esure it's a good un, Walt.' 
              An' so, yer see, I knowed it was. He's a nice chap, is Bill Hodgkisson, 
              e's a nice chap!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;A man will part with anything so long as he's drunk,and 
              you're drunk along with him,&quot; said Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy, who's drunk, I sh'd like ter 
              know?&quot;said Morel. He was extraordinarily pleased with himself,because 
              of his day's helping to wait in the Moon and Stars. He chattered 
              on.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel, very tired, and sick of his babble, went to bedas 
              quickly as possible, while he raked the fire.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel came of a good old burgher family, famous independentswho 
              had fought with Colonel Hutchinson, and who remained stoutCongregationalists. 
              Her grandfather had gone bankrupt in the lace-marketat a time when 
              so many lace-manufacturers were ruined in Nottingham. Her father, 
              George Coppard, was an engineer--a large, handsome,haughty man, 
              proud of his fair skin and blue eyes, but more proudstill of his 
              integrity. Gertrude resembled her mother in her smallbuild. But 
              her temper, proud and unyielding, she had from the Coppards.</p>
            <p>　　George Coppard was bitterly galled by his own poverty. He became 
              foreman of the engineers in the dockyard at Sheerness. Mrs. Morel--Gertrude--was 
              the second daughter. She favoured her mother,loved her mother best 
              of all; but she had the Coppards' clear,defiant blue eyes and their 
              broad brow. She remembered to havehated her father's overbearing 
              manner towards her gentle, humorous,kindly-souled mother. She remembered 
              running over the breakwaterat Sheerness and finding the boat. She 
              remembered to have beenpetted and flattered by all the men when 
              she had gone to the dockyard,for she was a delicate, rather proud 
              child. She remembered the funnyold mistress, whose assistant she 
              had become, whom she had loved to helpin the private school. And 
              she still had the Bible that John Fieldhad given her. She used to 
              walk home from chapel with John Fieldwhen she was nineteen. He was 
              the son of a well-to-do tradesman,had been to college in London, 
              and was to devote himself to business.</p>
            <p>　　She could always recall in detail a September Sunday afternoon,when 
              they had sat under the vine at the back of her father's house. The 
              sun came through the chinks of the vine-leaves and madebeautiful 
              patterns, like a lace scarf, falling on her and on him. Some of 
              the leaves were clean yellow, like yellow flat flowers.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Now sit still,&quot; he had cried. &quot;Now your hair, 
              I don't knowwhat it IS like! It's as bright as copper and gold, 
              as red asburnt copper, and it has gold threads where the sun shines 
              on it. Fancy their saying it's brown. Your mother calls it mouse-colour.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She had met his brilliant eyes, but her clear face scarcelyshowed 
              the elation which rose within her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But you say you don't like business,&quot; she pursued.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't. I hate it!&quot; he cried hotly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And you would like to go into the ministry,&quot; she half 
              implored.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I should. I should love it, if I thought I could makea 
              first-rate preacher.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then why don't you--why DON'T you?&quot; Her voice rang 
              with defiance. &quot;If I were a man, nothing would stop me.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She held her head erect. He was rather timid before her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But my father's so stiff-necked. He means to put me intothe 
              business, and I know he'll do it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But if you're a MAN?&quot; she had cried.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Being a man isn't everything,&quot; he replied, frowning 
              withpuzzled helplessness.</p>
            <p>　　Now, as she moved about her work at the Bottoms, with someexperience 
              of what being a man meant, she knew that it was NOT everything.</p>
            <p>　　At twenty, owing to her health, she had left Sheerness. Her father 
              had retired home to Nottingham. John Field's fatherhad been ruined; 
              the son had gone as a teacher in Norwood. She didnot hear of him 
              until, two years later, she made determined inquiry. He had married 
              his landlady, a woman of forty, a widow with property.</p>
            <p>　　And still Mrs. Morel preserved John Field's Bible. She didnot 
              now believe him to be--- Well, she understood pretty well what hemight 
              or might not have been. So she preserved his Bible, and kepthis 
              memory intact in her heart, for her own sake. To her dying day,for 
              thirty-five years, she did not speak of him.</p>
            <p>　　When she was twenty-three years old, she met, at a Christmasparty, 
              a young man from the Erewash Valley. Morel was thentwenty-seven 
              years old. He was well set-up, erect, and very smart. He had wavy 
              black hair that shone again, and a vigorous blackbeard that had 
              never been shaved. His cheeks were ruddy,and his red, moist mouth 
              was noticeable because he laughed so oftenand so heartily. He had 
              that rare thing, a rich, ringing laugh. Gertrude Coppard had watched 
              him, fascinated. He was so full ofcolour and animation, his voice 
              ran so easily into comic grotesque,he was so ready and so pleasant 
              with everybody. Her own fatherhad a rich fund of humour, but it 
              was satiric. This man'swas different: soft, non-intellectual, warm, 
              a kind of gambolling.</p>
            <p>　　She herself was opposite. She had a curious, receptive mindwhich 
              found much pleasure and amusement in listening to other folk. She 
              was clever in leading folk to talk. She loved ideas, and wasconsidered 
              very intellectual. What she liked most of all was anargument on 
              religion or philosophy or politics with some educated man. This 
              she did not often enjoy. So she always had people tell herabout 
              themselves, finding her pleasure so.</p>
            <p>　　In her person she was rather small and delicate, with alarge 
              brow, and dropping bunches of brown silk curls. Her blue eyeswere 
              very straight, honest, and searching. She had the beautifulhands 
              of the Coppards. Her dress was always subdued. She woredark blue 
              silk, with a peculiar silver chain of silver scallops. This, and 
              a heavy brooch of twisted gold, was her only ornament. She was still 
              perfectly intact, deeply religious, and fullof beautiful candour.</p>
            <p>　　Walter Morel seemed melted away before her. She wasto the miner 
              that thing of mystery and fascination, a lady. When she spoke to 
              him, it was with a southern pronunciation and apurity of English 
              which thrilled him to hear. She watched him. He danced well, as 
              if it were natural and joyous in him to dance. His grandfather was 
              a French refugee who had married an Englishbarmaid--if it had been 
              a marriage. Gertrude Coppard watched theyoung miner as he danced, 
              a certain subtle exultation like glamour inhis movement, and his 
              face the flower of his body, ruddy, with tumbledblack hair, and 
              laughing alike whatever partner he bowed above. She thought him 
              rather wonderful, never having met anyone like him. Her father was 
              to her the type of all men. And George Coppard,proud in his bearing, 
              handsome, and rather bitter; who preferredtheology in reading, and 
              who drew near in sympathy only to one man,the Apostle Paul; who 
              was harsh in government, and in familiarity ironic;who ignored all 
              sensuous pleasure:--he was very different fromthe miner. Gertrude 
              herself was rather contemptuous of dancing;she had not the slightest 
              inclination towards that accomplishment,and had never learned even 
              a Roger de Coverley. She was puritan,like her father, high-minded, 
              and really stern. Therefore the dusky,golden softness of this man's 
              sensuous flame of life, that flowed offhis flesh like the flame 
              from a candle, not baffled and gripped intoincandescence by thought 
              and spirit as her life was, seemed to hersomething wonderful, beyond 
              her.</p>
            <p>　　He came and bowed above her. A warmth radiated through heras 
              if she had drunk wine.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Now do come and have this one wi' me,&quot; he said caressively. 
              &quot;It's easy, you know. I'm pining to see you dance.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She had told him before she could not dance. She glancedat his 
              humility and smiled. Her smile was very beautiful. It moved the 
              man so that he forgot everything.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, I won't dance,&quot; she said softly. Her words came 
              cleanand ringing.</p>
            <p>　　Not knowing what he was doing--he often did the right thingby 
              instinct--he sat beside her, inclining reverentially.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But you mustn't miss your dance,&quot; she reproved.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nay, I don't want to dance that--it's not one as I care 
              about.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yet you invited me to it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He laughed very heartily at this.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I never thought o' that. Tha'rt not long in taking the 
              curlout of me.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　It was her turn to laugh quickly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You don't look as if you'd come much uncurled,&quot; she 
              said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm like a pig's tail, I curl because I canna help it,&quot;he 
              laughed, rather boisterously.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And you are a miner!&quot; she exclaimed in surprise.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes. I went down when I was ten.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She looked at him in wondering dismay.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;When you were ten! And wasn't it very hard?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You soon get used to it. You live like th' mice, an' you 
              popout at night to see what's going on.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It makes me feel blind,&quot; she frowned.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Like a moudiwarp!&quot; he laughed. &quot;Yi, an' there's 
              some chapsas does go round like moudiwarps.&quot; He thrust his 
              face forwardin the blind, snout-like way of a mole, seeming to sniff 
              andpeer for direction. &quot;They dun though!&quot; he protested 
              naively. &quot;Tha niver seed such a way they get in. But tha mun 
              let me ta'ethee down some time, an' tha can see for thysen.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She looked at him, startled. This was a new tract of lifesuddenly 
              opened before her. She realised the life of the miners,hundreds 
              of them toiling below earth and coming up at evening. He seemed 
              to her noble. He risked his life daily, and with gaiety. She looked 
              at him, with a touch of appeal in her pure humility.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Shouldn't ter like it?&quot; he asked tenderly. &quot;'Appen 
              not,it 'ud dirty thee.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She had never been &quot;thee'd&quot; and &quot;thou'd&quot; 
              before.</p>
            <p>　　The next Christmas they were married, and for three monthsshe 
              was perfectly happy: for six months she was very happy.</p>
            <p>　　He had signed the pledge, and wore the blue ribbon of atee-totaller: 
              he was nothing if not showy. They lived, she thought,in his own 
              house. It was small, but convenient enough, and quitenicely furnished, 
              with solid, worthy stuff that suited her honest soul. The women, 
              her neighbours, were rather foreign to her, and Morel'smother and 
              sisters were apt to sneer at her ladylike ways.But she could perfectly 
              well live by herself, so long as shehad her husband close.</p>
            <p>　　Sometimes, when she herself wearied of love-talk, she triedto 
              open her heart seriously to him. She saw him listen deferentially,but 
              without understanding. This killed her efforts at a finer intimacy,and 
              she had flashes of fear. Sometimes he was restless of an evening: 
              it was not enough for him just to be near her, she realised. She 
              was glad when he set himself to little jobs.</p>
            <p>　　He was a remarkably handy man--could make or mend anything. So 
              she would say:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I do like that coal-rake of your mother's--it is small 
              and natty.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Does ter, my wench? Well, I made that, so I can make theeone! 
              &quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What! why, it's a steel one!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;An' what if it is! Tha s'lt ha'e one very similar, if notexactly 
              same.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She did not mind the mess, nor the hammering and noise. He was 
              busy and happy.</p>
            <p>　　But in the seventh month, when she was brushing his Sunday coat,she 
              felt papers in the breast pocket, and, seized with a sudden curiosity,took 
              them out to read. He very rarely wore the frock-coat he wasmarried 
              in: and it had not occurred to her before to feel curiousconcerning 
              the papers. They were the bills of the household furniture,still 
              unpaid.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Look here,&quot; she said at night, after he was washed 
              and hadhad his dinner. &quot;I found these in the pocket of your 
              wedding-coat.Haven't you settled the bills yet?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No. I haven't had a chance.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But you told me all was paid. I had better go into Nottinghamon 
              Saturday and settle them. I don't like sitting on another man'schairs 
              and eating from an unpaid table.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He did not answer.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I can have your bank-book, can't I?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Tha can ha'e it, for what good it'll be to thee.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I thought---&quot; she began. He had told her he had a 
              good bit ofmoney left over. But she realised it was no use asking 
              questions. She sat rigid with bitterness and indignation.</p>
            <p>　　The next day she went down to see his mother.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Didn't you buy the furniture for Walter?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, I did,&quot; tartly retorted the elder woman.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And how much did he give you to pay for it?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The elder woman was stung with fine indignation.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Eighty pound, if you're so keen on knowin',&quot; she replied.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Eighty pounds! But there are forty-two pounds still owing!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I can't help that.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;But where has it all gone?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You'll find all the papers, I think, if you look--beside 
              tenpound as he owed me, an' six pound as the wedding cost down here.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Six pounds!&quot; echoed Gertrude Morel. It seemed to hermonstrous 
              that, after her own father had paid so heavilyfor her wedding, six 
              pounds more should have been squanderedin eating and drinking at 
              Walter's parents' house, at his expense.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And how much has he sunk in his houses?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;His houses--which houses?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Gertrude Morel went white to the lips. He had told herthe house 
              he lived in, and the next one, was his own.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I thought the house we live in---&quot; she began.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;They're my houses, those two,&quot; said the mother-in-law. 
              &quot;Andnot clear either. It's as much as I can do to keep the 
              mortgageinterest paid.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Gertrude sat white and silent. She was her father now.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then we ought to be paying you rent,&quot; she said coldly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Walter is paying me rent,&quot; replied the mother.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And what rent?&quot; asked Gertrude.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Six and six a week,&quot; retorted the mother.</p>
            <p>　　It was more than the house was worth. Gertrude held herhead erect, 
              looked straight before her.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It is lucky to be you,&quot; said the elder woman, bitingly,&quot;to 
              have a husband as takes all the worry of the money, and leavesyou 
              a free hand.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　The young wife was silent.</p>

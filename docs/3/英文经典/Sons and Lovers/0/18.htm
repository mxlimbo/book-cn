            <p>　　The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers,silver 
              upon the blackness, as he spun past. Then there was the longclimb 
              home.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;See, mother!&quot; he said, as he threw her the berries 
              and leaveson to the table.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;H'm!&quot; she said, glancing at them, then away again. 
              She sat reading, alone, as she always did.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Aren't they pretty?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He knew she was cross with him. After a few minutes he said:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She did not answer.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You don't mind?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Still she did not answer.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Do you?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You know whether I mind or not.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't see why you should. I have plenty of meals there.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You do.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then why do you begrudge them tea?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I begrudge whom tea?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What are you so horrid for?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient. 
              She'll come.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He was very angry with his mother. He knew it was merelyMiriam 
              she objected to. He flung off his boots and went to bed.</p>
            <p>　　Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon. He was gladto 
              see them coming. They arrived home at about four o'clock.Everywhere 
              was clean and still for Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Morel satin her black 
              dress and black apron. She rose to meet the visitors. With Edgar 
              she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and rather grudging. Yet Paul 
              thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock.</p>
            <p>　　He helped his mother to get the tea ready. Miriam would havegladly 
              proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home. There 
              was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction. The chairs 
              were only wooden, and the sofa was old. But the hearthrugand cushions 
              were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;there was a simplicity 
              in everything, and plenty of books. He was never ashamed in the 
              least of his home, nor was Miriamof hers, because both were what 
              they should be, and warm. And then he was proud of the table; the 
              china was pretty,the cloth was fine. It did not matter that the 
              spoons were notsilver nor the knives ivory-handled; everything looked 
              nice. Mrs. Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were 
              growing up,so that nothing was out of place.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam talked books a little. That was her unfailing topic. But 
              Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.</p>
            <p>　　At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew. Morel 
              never went to chapel, preferring the public-house. Mrs. Morel,like 
              a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul at the other 
              end;and at first Miriam sat next to him. Then the chapel was like 
              home. It was a pretty place, with dark pews and slim, elegant pillars,and 
              flowers. And the same people had sat in the same places eversince 
              he was a boy. It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sitthere 
              for an hour and a half, next to Miriam, and near to his mother,uniting 
              his two loves under the spell of the place of worship. Then he felt 
              warm and happy and religious at once. And afterchapel he walked 
              home with Miriam, whilst Mrs. Morel spent the restof the evening 
              with her old friend, Mrs. Burns. He was keenlyalive on his walks 
              on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam. He never went past the pits 
              at night, by the lighted lamp-house,the tall black headstocks and 
              lines of trucks, past the fans spinningslowly like shadows, without 
              the feeling of Miriam returning to him,keen and almost unbearable.</p>
            <p>　　She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew. Her father tookone 
              for themselves once more. It was under the little gallery,opposite 
              the Morels'. When Paul and his mother came in the chapelthe Leivers's 
              pew was always empty. He was anxious for fear she wouldnot come: 
              it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays. Then, often 
              very late indeed, she came in, with her long stride,her head bowed, 
              her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet. Her face, as 
              she sat opposite, was always in shadow. But it gavehim a very keen 
              feeling, as if all his soul stirred within him,to see her there. 
              It was not the same glow, happiness, and pride,that he felt in having 
              his mother in charge: something morewonderful, less human, and tinged 
              to intensity by a pain,as if there were something he could not get 
              to.</p>
            <p>　　At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed. 
              He was twenty-one, and she was twenty. She was beginningto dread 
              the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much. All the way 
              he went cruelly smashing her beliefs. Edgar enjoyed it. He was by 
              nature critical and rather dispassionate. But Miriamsuffered exquisite 
              pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the manshe loved examined 
              her religion in which she lived and moved and hadher being. But 
              he did not spare her. He was cruel. And when theywent alone he was 
              even more fierce, as if he would kill her soul. He bled her beliefs 
              till she almost lost consciousness.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;She exults--she exults as she carries him off from me,&quot;Mrs. 
              Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone. &quot;She's notlike 
              an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him. She wants to 
              absorb him. She wants to draw him out and absorbhim till there is 
              nothing left of him, even for himself. He will never be a man on 
              his own feet--she will suck him up.&quot; So the mother sat, and 
              battled and brooded bitterly.</p>
            <p>　　And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wildwith 
              torture. He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,going 
              at a great rate. Then, brought up against a stile, he stood forsome 
              minutes, and did not move. There was a great hollow of darknessfronting 
              him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights,and in the 
              lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit. It was all weird 
              and dreadful. Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,and unable to 
              move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer? He knew she suffered 
              badly. But why should she? And why didhe hate Miriam, and feel so 
              cruel towards her, at the thoughtof his mother. If Miriam caused 
              his mother suffering, then hehated her--and he easily hated her. 
              Why did she make him feelas if he were uncertain of himself, insecure, 
              an indefinite thing,as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent 
              the night and thespace breaking into him? How he hated her! And 
              then, what a rushof tenderness and humility!</p>
            <p>　　Suddenly he plunged on again, running home. His mothersaw on 
              him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing. But he had to 
              make her talk to him. Then she was angry with himfor going so far 
              with Miriam.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why don't you like her, mother?&quot; he cried in despair.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't know, my boy,&quot; she replied piteously. &quot;I'm 
              sure I'vetried to like her. I've tried and tried, but I can't--I 
              can't!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.</p>
            <p>　　Spring was the worst time. He was changeable, and intenseand 
              cruel. So he decided to stay away from her. Then came thehours when 
              he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watchedhim growing 
              restless. He could not go on with his work. He coulddo nothing. 
              It was as if something were drawing his soul out towardsWilley Farm. 
              Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing. And his mother 
              knew he was gone. And as soon as he was on the wayhe sighed with 
              relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.</p>
            <p>　　One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with Miriamsitting 
              beside him. It was a glistening, white-and-blue day. Big clouds, 
              so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stolealong on the 
              water. The clear spaces in the sky were of clean,cold blue. Paul 
              lay on his back in the old grass, looking up. He could not bear 
              to look at Miriam. She seemed to want him,and he resisted. He resisted 
              all the time. He wanted now to giveher passion and tenderness, and 
              he could not. He felt that she wantedthe soul out of his body, and 
              not him. All his strength and energyshe drew into herself through 
              some channel which united them. She did not want to meet him, so 
              that there were two of them,man and woman together. She wanted to 
              draw all of him into her. It urged him to an intensity like madness, 
              which fascinated him,as drug-taking might.</p>
            <p>　　He was discussing Michael Angelo. It felt to her as if she werefingering 
              the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life,as she heard 
              him. It gave her deepest satisfaction. And in the endit frightened 
              her. There he lay in the white intensity of his search,and his voice 
              gradually filled her with fear, so level it was,almost inhuman, 
              as if in a trance.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't talk any more,&quot; she pleaded softly, laying her 
              handon his forehead.</p>
            <p>　　He lay quite still, almost unable to move. His body wassomewhere 
              discarded.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why not? Are you tired?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, and it wears you out.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He laughed shortly, realising.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yet you always make me like it,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I don't wish to,&quot; she said, very low.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear 
              it. But your unconscious self always asks it of me. And I suppose 
              Iwant it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He went on, in his dead fashion:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;If only you could want ME, and not want what I can reel 
              offfor you! &quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I!&quot; she cried bitterly--&quot;I! Why, when would you 
              let me take you?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then it's my fault,&quot; he said, and, gathering himself 
              together,he got up and began to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial. 
              In a vague way he hated her for it. And he knew he was as much toblame 
              himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.</p>
            <p>　　One evening about this time he had walked along the home roadwith 
              her. They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,unable to 
              part. As the stars came out the clouds closed. They hadglimpses 
              of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west. His jewels 
              glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling withdifficulty 
              through the spume of cloud.</p>
            <p>　　Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations. 
              They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours of feeling,until 
              they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars. This evening 
              Paul had been moody and perverse. Orion had seemed justan ordinary 
              constellation to him. He had fought against his glamourand fascination. 
              Miriam was watching her lover's mood carefully. But he said nothing 
              that gave him away, till the moment came to part,when he stood frowning 
              gloomily at the gathered clouds, behind whichthe great constellation 
              must be striding still.</p>
            <p>　　There was to be a little party at his house the next day,at which 
              she was to attend.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I shan't come and meet you,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, very well; it's not very nice out,&quot; she replied 
              slowly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's not that--only they don't like me to. They say I caremore 
              for you than for them. And you understand, don't you? You know it's 
              only friendship.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Miriam was astonished and hurt for him. It had cost him aneffort. 
              She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation. A fine 
              rain blew in her face as she walked along the road. She was hurt 
              deep down; and she despised him for being blownabout by any wind 
              of authority. And in her heart of hearts,unconsciously, she felt 
              that he was trying to get away from her. This she would never have 
              acknowledged. She pitied him.</p>
            <p>　　At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's warehouse. 
              Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and Paulremained 
              with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer. His wages wereto be raised to 
              thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.</p>
            <p>　　Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson. 
              Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she grieved atthe 
              thought of her education's coming to end; moreover, they bothloved 
              to be together, in spite of discords. So they read Balzac,and did 
              compositions, and felt highly cultured.</p>
            <p>　　Friday night was reckoning night for the miners. Morel &quot;reckoned&quot;--shared 
              up the money of the stall--either in the New Innat Bretty or in 
              his own house, according as his fellow-butties wished. Barker had 
              turned a non-drinker, so now the men reckoned at Morel's house.</p>
            <p>　　Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again. She was 
              still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married. Paul was studying 
              design.</p>
            <p>　　Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless theweek's 
              earnings were small. He bustled immediately after his dinner,prepared 
              to get washed. It was decorum for the women to absentthemselves 
              while the men reckoned. Women were not supposed to spyinto such 
              a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor were theyto know 
              the exact amount of the week's earnings. So, whilst herfather was 
              spluttering in the scullery, Annie went out to spendan hour with 
              a neighbour. Mrs. Morel attended to her baking.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Shut that doo-er!&quot; bawled Morel furiously.</p>
            <p>　　Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, I'll ma'e 
              thyjaw rattle,&quot; he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds. 
              Pauland the mother frowned to hear him.</p>
            <p>　　Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapywater 
              dripping from him, dithering with cold.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, my sirs!&quot; he said. &quot;Wheer's my towel?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise hewould 
              have bullied and blustered. He squatted on his heels beforethe hot 
              baking-fire to dry himself.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;F-ff-f!&quot; he went, pretending to shudder with cold.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!&quot; said Mrs. Morel. 
              &quot;It's NOT cold.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that 
              scullery,&quot;said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; &quot;nowt 
              b'r a ice-'ouse!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And I shouldn't make that fuss,&quot; replied his wife.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi'thy 
              nesh sides.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?&quot; asked 
              Paul, curious.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Eh, I dunno; that's what they say,&quot; replied his father. 
              &quot;But there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows 
              throughyour ribs like through a five-barred gate.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours,&quot;said 
              Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Me!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit. 
              My bones fair juts out on me.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I should like to know where,&quot; retorted his wife.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel laughed. He had still a wonderfully young body,muscular, 
              without any fat. His skin was smooth and clear. It might have been 
              the body of a man of twenty-eight, except thatthere were, perhaps, 
              too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where thecoal-dust remained 
              under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy. But he put his 
              hand on his side ruefully. It was his fixed belief that,because 
              be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat. Paul looked 
              at his father's thick, brownish hands all scarred,with broken nails, 
              rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and theincongruity struck 
              him. It seemed strange they were the same flesh.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I suppose,&quot; he said to his father, &quot;you had a 
              good figure once.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Eh!&quot; exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled 
              and timid,like a child.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;He had,&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Morel, &quot;if he didn't 
              hurtle himselfup as if he was trying to get in the smallest space 
              he could.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Me!&quot; exclaimed Morel--&quot;me a good figure! I wor 
              niver muchmore n'r a skeleton.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Man!&quot; cried his wife, &quot;don't be such a pulamiter!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;'Strewth!&quot; he said. &quot;Tha's niver knowed me but 
              what I lookedas if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She sat and laughed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You've had a constitution like iron,&quot; she said; &quot;and 
              nevera man had a better start, if it was body that counted. You 
              shouldhave seen him as a young man,&quot; she cried suddenly to 
              Paul,drawing herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.</p>
            <p>　　Morel watched her shyly. He saw again the passion shehad had 
              for him. It blazed upon her for a moment. He was shy,rather scared, 
              and humble. Yet again he felt his old glow. And then immediately 
              he felt the ruin he had made during these years. He wanted to bustle 
              about, to run away from it.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh,&quot; he asked her.</p>
            <p>　　His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped iton his shoulders. 
              He gave a jump.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!&quot; he cried. &quot;Cowd 
              as death!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You ought to have been a salamander,&quot; she laughed,washing 
              his back. It was very rarely she would do anythingso personal for 
              him. The children did those things.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;The next world won't be half hot enough for you,&quot; 
              she added.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No,&quot; he said; &quot;tha'lt see as it's draughty for 
              me.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　But she had finished. She wiped him in a desultory fashion,and 
              went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.When 
              he was dried he struggled into his shirt. Then, ruddy and shiny,with 
              hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over hispit-trousers, 
              he stood warming the garments he was going to put on. He turned 
              them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Goodness, man!&quot; cried Mrs. Morel, &quot;get dressed!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowdas 
              a tub o' water?&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black. 
              He did all this on the hearthrug, as he would have done if Annieand 
              her familiar friends had been present.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven. Then from the redearthenware 
              panchion of dough that stood in a corner she tookanother handful 
              of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and droppedit into a tin. 
              As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered. He was a quiet, 
              compact little man, who looked as if he would gothrough a stone 
              wall. His black hair was cropped short, his headwas bony. Like most 
              miners, he was pale, but healthy and taut.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Evenin', missis,&quot; he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he 
              seatedhimself with a sigh.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Good-evening,&quot; she replied cordially.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Tha's made thy heels crack,&quot; said Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I dunno as I have,&quot; said Barker.</p>
            <p>　　He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen,effacing himself 
              rather.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;How's missis?&quot; she asked of him.</p>
            <p>　　He had told her some time back:</p>
            <p>　　&quot;We're expectin' us third just now, you see.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well,&quot; he answered, rubbing his head, &quot;she keeps 
              prettymiddlin', I think.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Let's see--when?&quot; asked Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ah! And she's kept fairly?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, tidy.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;That's a blessing, for she's none too strong.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No. An' I've done another silly trick.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What's that?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm come be-out th' market-bag.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You can have mine.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I shan't. I take a string bag always.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She saw the determined little collier buying in the week'sgroceries 
              and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him. &quot;Barker's 
              little, but he's ten times the man you are,&quot; she saidto her 
              husband.</p>
            <p>　　Just then Wesson entered. He was thin, rather frail-looking,with 
              a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile,despite his 
              seven children. But his wife was a passionate woman.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I see you've kested me,&quot; he said, smiling rather vapidly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Barker.</p>
            <p>　　The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler. His 
              nose was pointed and red.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson,&quot; said Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's a bit nippy,&quot; he replied.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then come to the fire.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nay, I s'll do where I am.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Both colliers sat away back. They could not be induced to comeon 
              to the hearth. The hearth is sacred to the family.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Go thy ways i' th' armchair,&quot; cried Morel cheerily.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, come, of course,&quot; insisted Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　He rose and went awkwardly. He sat in Morel's armchair awkwardly. 
              It was too great a familiarity. But the fire made him blissfully 
              happy.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And how's that chest of yours?&quot; demanded Mrs. Morel.</p>
            <p>　　He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, it's very middlin',&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum,&quot; said Barker 
              shortly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;T-t-t-t!&quot; went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue. 
              &quot;Did youhave that flannel singlet made?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Not yet,&quot; he smiled.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then, why didn't you?&quot; she cried.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It'll come,&quot; he smiled.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ah, an' Doomsday!&quot; exclaimed Barker.</p>
            <p>　　Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson. But, then,they 
              were both as hard as nails, physically.</p>
            <p>　　When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Count it, boy,&quot; he asked humbly.</p>
            <p>　　Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the 
              bagupside down on the table. There was a five-pound bag of silver,sovereigns 
              and loose money. He counted quickly, referred to thechecks--the 
              written papers giving amount of coal--put the money in order. Then 
              Barker glanced at the checks.</p>
            <p>　　Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table. Morel, 
              as master of the house, sat in his armchair, with his backto the 
              hot fire. The two butties had cooler seats. None of themcounted 
              the money.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What did we say Simpson's was?&quot; asked Morel; and the 
              buttiescavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings. Then the 
              amountwas put aside.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;An' Bill Naylor's?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　This money also was taken from the pack.</p>
            <p>　　Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses,and 
              his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six each. 
              And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was stopped,Barker 
              and Wesson took four shillings each. Then it was plain sailing. 
              Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns;each 
              half a crown till there were no more half-crowns; each a shillingtill 
              there were no more shillings. If there was anything at the endthat 
              wouldn't split, Morel took it and stood drinks.</p>
            <p>　　Then the three men rose and went. Morel scuttled out of the housebefore 
              his wife came down. She heard the door close, and descended. She 
              looked hastily at the bread in the oven. Then, glancing onthe table, 
              she saw her money lying. Paul had been working allthe time. But 
              now he felt his mother counting the week's money,and her wrath rising,</p>
            <p>　　&quot;T-t-t-t-t!&quot; went her tongue.</p>
            <p>　　He frowned. He could not work when she was cross. She counted 
              again.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;A measly twenty-five shillings!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;How 
              muchwas the cheque?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ten pounds eleven,&quot; said Paul irritably. He dreaded 
              whatwas coming.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an'his club this 
              week! But I know him. He thinks becauseYOU'RE earning he needn't 
              keep the house any longer. No, all he has to do with his money is 
              to guttle it. But I'll show him!&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Oh, mother, don't!&quot; cried Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't what, I should like to know?&quot; she exclaimed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Don't carry on again. I can't work.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She went very quiet.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes, it's all very well,&quot; she said; &quot;but how 
              do you thinkI'm going to manage?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to putup 
              with.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It won't be long. You can have my money. Let him go to 
              hell.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly. 
              When she was fretted he could not bear it. But now he beganto insist 
              on her recognizing him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;The two loaves at the top,&quot; she said, &quot;will be 
              donein twenty minutes. Don't forget them.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;All right,&quot; he answered; and she went to market.</p>
            <p>　　He remained alone working. But his usual intense concentrationbecame 
              unsettled. He listened for the yard-gate. At a quarter-pastseven 
              came a low knock, and Miriam entered.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;All alone?&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,hanging 
              them up. It gave him a thrill. This might be their own house,his 
              and hers. Then she came back and peered over his work.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What is it?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Still design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.</p>
            <p>　　It irritated him that she peered so into everything thatwas his, 
              searching him out. He went into the parlour and returnedwith a bundle 
              of brownish linen. Carefully unfolding it,he spread it on the floor. 
              It proved to be a curtain or portiere,beautifully stencilled with 
              a design on roses.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Ah, how beautiful!&quot; she cried.</p>
            <p>　　The spread cloth, with its wonderful reddish roses and darkgreen 
              stems, all so simple, and somehow so wicked-looking, lay ather feet. 
              She went on her knees before it, her dark curls dropping. He saw 
              her crouched voluptuously before his work, and his heartbeat quickly. 
              Suddenly she looked up at him.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why does it seem cruel?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;What?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;There seems a feeling of cruelty about it,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;It's jolly good, whether or not,&quot; he replied, folding 
              uphis work with a lover's hands.</p>
            <p>　　She rose slowly, pondering.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;And what will you do with it?&quot; she asked.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Send it to Liberty's. I did it for my mother, but I thinkshe'd 
              rather have the money.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Yes,&quot; said Miriam. He had spoken with a touch of bitterness,and 
              Miriam sympathised. Money would have been nothing to HER.</p>
            <p>　　He took the cloth back into the parlour. When he returnedhe threw 
              to Miriam a smaller piece. It was a cushion-coverwith the same design.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I did that for you,&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>　　She fingered the work with trembling hands, and did not speak. 
              He became embarrassed.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;By Jove, the bread!&quot; he cried.</p>
            <p>　　He took the top loaves out, tapped them vigorously. They were 
              done. He put them on the hearth to cool. Then he went to the scullery,wetted 
              his hands, scooped the last white dough out of the punchion,and 
              dropped it in a baking-tin. Miriam was still bent over herpainted 
              cloth. He stood rubbing the bits of dough from his hands.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;You do like it?&quot; he asked.</p>
            <p>　　She looked up at him, with her dark eyes one flame of love. He 
              laughed uncomfortably. Then he began to talk about the design. There 
              was for him the most intense pleasure in talking about hiswork to 
              Miriam. All his passion, all his wild blood, went intothis intercourse 
              with her, when he talked and conceived his work. She brought forth 
              to him his imaginations. She did not understand,any more than a 
              woman understands when she conceives a child in her womb. But this 
              was life for her and for him.</p>
            <p>　　While they were talking, a young woman of about twenty-two,small 
              and pale, hollow-eyed, yet with a relentless look about her,entered 
              the room. She was a friend at the Morel's.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Take your things off,&quot; said Paul.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;No, I'm not stopping.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　She sat down in the armchair opposite Paul and Miriam,who were 
              on the sofa. Miriam moved a little farther from him. The room was 
              hot, with a scent of new bread. Brown, crisp loavesstood on the 
              hearth.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I shouldn't have expected to see you here to-night,Miriam 
              Leivers,&quot; said Beatrice wickedly.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why not?&quot; murmured Miriam huskily.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Why, let's look at your shoes.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　Miriam remained uncomfortably still.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;If tha doesna tha durs'na,&quot; laughed Beatrice.</p>
            <p>　　Miriam put her feet from under her dress. Her bootshad that queer, 
              irresolute, rather pathetic look about them,which showed how self-conscious 
              and self-mistrustful she was. And they were covered with mud.</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Glory! You're a positive muck-heap,&quot; exclaimed Beatrice. 
              &quot;Who cleans your boots?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;I clean them myself.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Then you wanted a job,&quot; said Beatrice. &quot;It would 
              ha'taken a lot of men to ha' brought me down here to-night. But 
              lovelaughs at sludge, doesn't it, 'Postle my duck?&quot;</p>

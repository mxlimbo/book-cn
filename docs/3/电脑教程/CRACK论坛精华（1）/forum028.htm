  Booby-Trapped Shareware <br>
  ===================================================================== <br>
  last update: 15 Mar 2000 <br>
  <br>
  If the possible threat of being hit by a virus and it's affects ranging from 
  <br>
  funny messages to total system meltdown isn't enough. <br>
  There is a new threat on the horizon, or maybe not so new. <br>
  <br>
  History has shown that various authors have booby-trapped their software, <br>
  sometimes to the point of corrupting data files, corrupting system files, <br>
  or deleting files and directories from your computer. <br>
  This is a worst case scenario and the resulting effects vary greatly. <br>
  <br>
  The following information is a list of software titles with the reported traps 
  <br>
  hidden within. This document is not intended to promote paranoia but to alert, 
  <br>
  educate and inform users about possible problems, and you might find some <br>
  handy tips and other bits if info along the way. <br>
  ==================================================================== <br>
  - (*) <br>
  <br>
  Indicates new or updated info. <br>
  <br>
  - AcdSystems <br>
  - (ACDSee, Pica View) <br>
  <br>
  As of ACDSee v3.0 &amp; PicaView v1.32 the registration system has changed. 
  <br>
  They now have separate demo and retail version. <br>
  You can no longer enter a serial into the trial versions, <br>
  they need to be patched. <br>
  You can however enter a serial in the new retail versions of the progs. <br>
  <br>
  After all the hype, ACDSee DOES NOT phone home. <br>
  It includes a new updates checking feature which obviously does require net 
  <br>
  access. Also the recent virus warning about ijl10.dll is false, due to a problem 
  <br>
  with The Cleaner. Grab the latest version to fix it. Launching an image file 
  <br>
  from agent results in a new acdsee window each time, it is a bug in acdsee. 
  <br>
  <br>
  - AddWeb <br>
  <br>
  Uses server authentication to confirm the users registration. <br>
  The second time you use it, you will get a lovely message about using illegal 
  <br>
  software and that your IP address was recorded. <br>
  <br>
  - Advanced Administrative Tools <br>
  <br>
  Uses server authentication to confirm the users registration. <br>
  <br>
  - Advanced Zip Password Recovery (AZPR) <br>
  <br>
  Will only accept a valid key, uses a blacklist for pirate keys, <br>
  if one is detected wastes CPU cycles without giving a solution. <br>
  <br>
  - Advanced Disk Catalog (ADC) <br>
  <br>
  Will only accept a valid key, uses a blacklist for pirate keys, <br>
  if one is detected slowly corrupts its databases. <br>
  Earlier versions had anti-SoftICE code in them, <br>
  though the author later removed this. <br>
  <br>
  The author of AZPR &amp; ADC uses very strong encryption to protect his code, 
  <br>
  it won't ever be properly cracked. Alot of releases of these are not 100% <br>
  however one group has released v1.30 with a working valid serial#. <br>
  <br>
  - AI Picture Utility <br>
  <br>
  From a recent Core release - blacklist for pirate serials, <br>
  various hidden checks in each version release. <br>
  <br>
  - AntiViral Toolkit Pro (AVP) <br>
  <br>
  Bogus CRACKER.* trojan messages about many files, reported to falsely detect 
  <br>
  cracks and keygens as virii and corrupts them, this may only happen if you try 
  <br>
  to 'clean' the infected files. <br>
  <br>
  - Archiver Shell <br>
  <br>
  v6.3, as reported in a recent CORE release, causes system problems if a <br>
  blacklisted name/serial is used. <br>
  <br>
  - Audio Grabber <br>
  <br>
  Phone's home with author's server, invalidates itself when you go online. <br>
  Might screw up your mouse buttons too. <br>
  This checking may only be connected to the CDDB feature. <br>
  Search your C Drive for a file 'SLICKS.CNT' and delete it. <br>
  Repeat if it invalidates itself again. <br>
  Try another prog from http://www.cddb.com to perform cddb queries. <br>
  Also try blocking the connection with a good firewall, Conseal or @guard. <br>
  <br>
  - (*) Aureate <br>
  <br>
  This is HOT news right now and it seems alot of ppl are freaking out over this. 
  <br>
  Frankly, CHILL!!!. This ain't the first and won't be the last contraversy of 
  this kind. <br>
  Take a deep breath and calm the hell down. <br>
  Do read the information you can find, and take it all with a grain of salt. 
  <br>
  I'm not defending anyone, things like this just get out of hand rather than 
  calm rational thought. <br>

  Here's what Aureate has said about it - <br>

  <br>
  There are now 2 utils out that will scan your drives for the suspect files. 
  <br>
  The one by Cokebottle (AntiSpy) removes some VALID system files - <br>
  advpack.dll (Advpack), amstream.dll (DirectShow), amcompat.tlb(Active Movie/MediaPlayer). 
  <br>
  I highly suggest you backup the suspect files first as some ppl have had probs 
  after their removal. <br>
  <br>
  - Bali Tools 2000 <br>
  <br>
  A Zor reader reports that this phones home. <br>
  <br>
  - Black Widow <br>
  <br>
  Was awhile ago now, afew got hit by 'something', denied by authors, <br>
  the particular version was pulled very quickly, has been reported <br>
  to communicate with the author's server, also claimed to look for <br>
  commonly pirated programs. <br>
  <br>
  - (*) BlackIce Defender <br>
  <br>
  If you are installing a new version over an older one and having trouble, <br>
  go into the NetworkICE folder and open the file license.txt. <br>
  Replace the serial in license.txt with a later one. <br>
  <br>
  (from FOSI) - using the update check seems to cause program to GPF, <br>
  making it unusable after this. <br>
  The authors are blacklisting alot of serials, so if you try to download and 
  <br>
  update from their webpage and it won't let you, that's why. <br>
  Recently a 'snitch' url was discovered, this is part of an upcoming feature 
  of <br>
  the prog and seems not to be to 'phone home'. <br>
  v1.9.6 seems to have cleared up all the problems and confusion. <br>
  <br>
  - BSI Wavestation <br>
  <br>
  Later versions after v2.71X, would do severe system damage if it detected use 
  of <br>
  that keymaker: <br>
  <br>
  1) Overwrites win.ini, system.ini, user.dat, and system.dat. <br>
  2) Overwrites user.da0 and system.da0 (registry backup files). <br>
  <br>
  This will render your system unbootable, and within seconds of doing this you 
  <br>
  will get a registry error message, prompting you to reboot. <br>
  At that point it is too late. <br>
  Incredibly, all those system files are backed up by the program (with different 
  <br>
  names, in the program directory) after it does this, so if you keep cool you 
  <br>
  can still restore your system. <br>
  <br>
  The ONLY version to consider safe is v2.71X, It has been disassembled and <br>
  verified that no trojan horse code exists in it. <br>
  <br>
  - Bulletproof FTP <br>
  <br>
  Uses server authentication to confirm the users registration, opens your browser 
  <br>
  to a 'gotcha' page if invalid, repeatedly new serials are released for new <br>
  versions, frankly don't bother, most if not all shared serials are cancelled 
  by <br>
  the author when they are eventually discovered. <br>
  The last version that seems very stable is v1.15. <br>
  <br>
  - CD Wizard <br>
  <br>
  If you put the serial in wrong it might pop a warnimg saying 'We have detected 
  a <br>
  virus attached to your copy of CD Wizzard' or similar. <br>
  <br>
  - (*) cdlabel <br>
  <br>
  v5.0, using an old/blacklisted serial results in popup warnings. <br>
  <br>
  - CdrWin <br>
  <br>
  Possibly the ONLY crack to trust is the one by 'GranddFather'. <br>
  The Radium 3.7c release is another verified good version. <br>
  At one point filled the hd with junk, another time deleted system files, <br>
  ongoing double checking of the serial and if it fails burns coasters. <br>
  There have been reports of it inserting garbage into the write stream as well. 
  <br>
  This means that only some files may have errors. <br>
  This would make it somewhat difficult to detect for the average user. <br>
  Doing a plain directory or filesize compare may not reveal any corrupt files. 
  <br>
  Use a crc validator or a binary file compare util on all images burned this. 
  <br>
  <br>
  - ClipMate <br>
  <br>
  Opens your browser to a 'gotcha' page using blacklisted name/serial <br>
  v4.11 using a blacklisted name/serial might also make it crash <br>
  Solution: Just delete the Registration Info from your Registry. <br>
  (HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Thornsoft\Clipmate5\Registration) <br>
  <br>
  - (*) CloneCD <br>
  <br>
  New serials get blacklisted very quickly, make sure you use the correct <br>
  serial with the version you have. It might appear to accept old serials but 
  <br>
  will burn dud cds. Have also seen reports of it threatening to format the hd. 
  <br>
  Goto HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\The Silicon Realms Toolworks\ <br>
  and delete the 'Armadillo' key for 10 more writes. <br>
  <br>
  AVP might report the installer is infected. This is a false positive but <br>
  treat all warnings with care. <br>
  Try unzipping the installer and scanning the files, should be clean. <br>
  <br>
  - Cool Edit 2000 <br>
  <br>
  Detects if you've had a previous cracked/pirated v1.2 on your system. <br>
  It might Delete itself on this detection. <br>
  Also seen mentioned that the CoolEdit MP3 Plugin does the same thing. <br>
  <br>
  - Copernic <br>
  <br>
  v4.0/4.1 - Using the built-in update feature results in the ad banner window 
  <br>
  returning. Try getting a newer version and do a clean install of it. <br>
  Make sure you use a newer serial too. <br>
  <br>
  To remove the grayed out box and remove Advertisments go to Registery Editor. 
  <br>
  (HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Copernic Techologies\Copernic4Plus\Preferences\) 
  <br>
  and remove the 'ShowAd' key. <br>
  OR try, inside the 'ShowAd' key replace 0Xffffffff to 0X00000000 <br>
  <br>
  - CPUidle <br>
  <br>
  A Zor reader mentioned that AtGuard reports that this tries to establish <br>
  an outgoing TCP/IP connection. To do what he doesn't say. <br>
  <br>
  - CuteFtp <br>
  <br>
  v3.xx, using cracks may make the program and your system become very unstable. 
  <br>
  As of v3.54 there are a few good cracks that contain a valid registry file. 
  <br>
  Apparently the program has multiple layers of key-checking and numerous <br>
  self-integrity checks. <br>
  See what the authors have to say. http://www.globalscape.com/support/cracks.html, 
  <br>
  http://www.globalscape.com/support/cracks2.html <br>
  <br>
  While the program may be reasonably protected by the registration system, <br>
  CuteFTP's data files are protected by an extremely weak 'encryption'. <br>
  The term 'encryption' is used very loosely in this regard as usernames and <br>
  passwords in the 'tree.dat' (v2.x) and 'smdata.dat' (v3.x) are easily recovered. 
  <br>
  There is one other username and password combination that is stored as plaintext 
  <br>
  in the registry and CuteFTP's ini file. <br>
  <br>
  - CSE HTML Validator <br>
  <br>
  Phones home only when using the built-in update check. <br>
  If you have used an invalid serial and try to update, <br>
  it will then always try to phone home. <br>
  Solution: Just delete the Registration Info from your Registry. <br>
  (HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CSE3310) <br>
  <br>
  - DiskState <br>
  <br>
  v2.02 maybe others, seems to be a dupe file checking util. <br>
  Saw a sketchy report that it fills the registry with CLSID's. <br>
  This appears to be part of it's normal opperation. <br>
  <br>
  - Download Accelerator <br>
  <br>
  Could be a bug (?) that causes it to crash continually after trying to reg it. 
  <br>
  To remove the ads find the 'Ads' folder and delete the image files, <br>
  if they come back, delete them again. <br>
  <br>
  - Extractor Marketing Software <br>
  - (Extractor Pro &amp; Web Weasel) <br>
  <br>
  Phones home every time the prog is started. <br>
  <br>
  - Feurio <br>
  <br>
  v1.30, Careful with using Feurio 1.30 with the 'ciccio' code, <br>
  Although it seems registered, it inserts a spoiler into a random track. <br>
  It goes : "beeeeeep... illegal copy ... beeeeeep". <br>
  <br>
  - FlashFXP <br>
  <br>
  Uses a blacklist for pirate serials, if you use a blacklisted serial <br>
  the app contacts the author's website and pops threatening messages, <br>
  it's not recommended using the update feature, tHE eGOISTE/Tmg has a <br>
  good crack for it and eGO has a program that reads the blacklist. <br>
  <br>
  - (*) Fluid Promotion <br>
  <br>
  v1.02, using a bad serial will seem to register it, but it'll stop working, 
  <br>
  will also pop 'gotcha' messages and report you to the author's site. <br>
  <br>
  - Firehand Ember <br>
  <br>
  Not sure of versions v5.93+ i think, pops a warning using a 'pirated' serial, 
  <br>
  damages system. <br>
  After v3.8.6(?) there are separate demo and retail versions. <br>
  <br>
  - Folder Guard <br>
  <br>
  Uses blacklist for pirate names. <br>
  <br>
  - Fruity Loops <br>
  <br>
  v2.01, to enter serial - ctrl+shift+F2, reported as having 4 stages to the <br>
  protection scheme, Basic, Full, TS404, a 'God' mode being the final, <br>
  this 'God' mode has been reported as bogus. <br>
  It appears that the download from the FruityLoops site is a CRIPPLED demo. <br>
  Depending on the TMG keygen you have it may not work. <br>
  TMG have also released a keygen for a FULL (non-crippled) FruityLoops. <br>
  <br>
  - Fruity Tracks <br>
  <br>
  v1.50, to enter serial - ctrl+alt+F9. <br>
  The crippled problem with FruityLoops may also apply to this one. <br>
  <br>
  - FTP Voyager <br>
  <br>
  Serial is date dependant. Stops downloading files a few bytes <br>
  before completion when using blacklisted name/serial. <br>
  <br>
  - GameSpy <br>
  <br>
  Only use cracks by REBELS. <br>
  Uses server authentication to confirm the users registration, <br>
  forget about using keygens or serial#s alone. <br>
  <br>
  - Genius <br>
  <br>
  v2.6 on detecting a blacklisted serial pops up a little "you're using pirated 
  <br>
  software, etc." window and disables various functions. <br>
  <br>
  - Getright <br>
  <br>
  Uses a blacklist for pirate serials. Might try to bring up a 'gotcha' page. 
  <br>
  If it starts playing up... <br>
  Goto HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{F853B2C7-386A-11D3-A860-006097897A00} <br>
  and delete 'ID' <br>
  Goto HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\HeadLight\GetRight\Config\ <br>
  and delete 'Window00' and 'RegistrationCode' <br>
  or delete the number itself. Then try using another serial#. <br>
  <br>
  - Gordon Production's software <br>
  - (ASCII-Help, Einstein, <br>
  - Home Project, KarCheck, <br>
  - PasteMaster) <br>
  <br>
  Einstein maybe others, phones home and reports the use of a crack, <br>
  expect an email from the author. Saw a report on Zor's news that the <br>
  author emailed a keygen user knowing it was used. <br>
  <br>
  - HistoryKill 99 <br>
  <br>
  Pops a warning about sending mail to the author when using a bad serial#, <br>
  have seen one report of it doing system damage. <br>
  <br>
  - HoneyQ <br>
  <br>
  v1.50, not all serials seem to enable the use of video, <br>
  if video gets disabled after registering then this is why. <br>
  <br>
  - HotDog <br>
  <br>
  Uses server authentication to confirm the users registration. <br>
  <br>
  - Htmasc32 <br>
  <br>
  v3.03.22 uses a blacklist for pirate serials, will randomly popup a bogus <br>
  program error on detecting a blacklisted serial. <br>
  <br>
  - HTML (Un)Compress <br>
  <br>
  Uses blacklist for pirate serials. <br>
  <br>
  - Intermute <br>
  <br>
  Uses server authentication to confirm the users registration. <br>
  This may have been removed since v1.40. <br>
  v1.50 has been reported as clean. <br>
  <br>
  - KeyText <br>
  <br>
  Most older serial/keygens (v1.1x) were not 100%, prog ended up still limited, 
  <br>
  more recent serial#s might be fine. <br>
  <br>
  - Kyodai Mahjongg <br>
  <br>
  Be careful using old keygens &amp; serials, has been reported to do nasty things. 
  <br>
  <br>
  - Lightspeed Products <br>
  - (Rocket, WebConvert Pro) <br>
  <br>
  Rocket maybe others phones home and reports the use of a crack, <br>
  expect an email from the author. <br>
  <br>
  - LinkBot <br>
  <br>
  v5.0, Phones home. <br>
  <br>
  - Liquid FX <br>
  <br>
  Takes your browser to a 'gotcha' page on detecting a blacklisted name/serial.

  Have seen very conflicting reports about the effectiveness of this, <br>
  also seen mention that although it claims to be, it is NOT a firewall. <br>
  Repeatedly updated by authors to overcome new cracks, <br>
  seemingly very little time spent updating functionality. <br>

  The history of the authors is a very interesting read. <br>
  Don't even bother testing this let alone buying it. <br>
  <br>
  - LviewPro <br>
  <br>
  v2.8, you can't enter a serial in the demo from the website, <br>
  a patch is required. <br>
  <br>
  - Magic Folders <br>
  <br>
  Deletes the illegal registration file and warns that if you use it again, <br>
  it will uninstall and you won't "ever" be able to install it again. <br>
  It also states something about being able to delete the whole hard drive instead 
  <br>
  of just one file. Last cracked version was a looooong time ago. <br>
  <br>
  - Multimedia Builder <br>
  <br>
  v4.5, try CORE's older keygen putting in an email address as the username to 
  <br>
  generate the key, eg. me@you.com. <br>
  <br>
  - Nero <br>
  <br>
  v4.?? accepts an invalid serial for a while, at a later time tells you that 
  the <br>
  serial number you are using has been pirated. <br>
  Doesn't cause any system damage, but it will ask you for a correct serial number 
  <br>
  everytime you load it up until you give it a valid one. <br>
  <br>
  - Net Detective 2000 <br>
  <br>
  Does nothing more than a few good search engines can do. <br>
  <br>
  - Netinfo <br>
  <br>
  Will contact it's home server upon startup or some network event even after 
  <br>
  being registered. <br>
  <br>
  - NewsRover <br>
  <br>
  Since v3.8(?) name/serial is at least triple check, when first entered, <br>
  when retrieving newsgroup headers, and uses server authentication. <br>
  If the second check fails it will delete the data files from it's directory. 
  <br>
  <br>
  - Norton Antivirus 2000 <br>
  <br>
  Has been reported that if you've used a cracked dll on the demo, <br>
  when you update the virus definitions you will get a message that <br>
  says you need to download a patch. <br>
  If you say yes and download the patch it will replace the "fixed" dll <br>
  and set the attribute to read only, making it difficult to "tamper with" again.

  <br>
  v6 update check triggers blacklisted serial nag. <br>
  v7.0 includes a prog called Comet Cursors which has recently been revealed to 
  <br>
  send out info on your browsing habits. <br>
  <br>
  - Restorator <br>
  <br>
  v2.50 bld 757, Aparently there is only ONE 100% cracks for this, <br>
  all others will trigger the prog to delete itself. <br>
  <br>
  - SmartDraw <br>
  <br>
  v4.22, to get another 30 days on the trial version..., might only work once 
  tho. <br>
  Goto 'help' menu, click 'about', the 'about' box pops up, hold down Ctrl+Shift 
  <br>
  and click the 'ok' button. <br>
  <br>
  - Starcraft's Battlenet <br>

  <br>
  - Time &amp; Chaos <br>
  <br>
  v5.xx maybe later, blacklist for pirate serials, on detecting pirate serial 
  <br>
  locks the data files, prog may not run again. <br>
  <br>
  - Timeworks DirectX Plugins <br>
  <br>
  Demos can detect if you've used a cracked version before, threatens to erase 
  <br>
  C: drive, seems to just be a scare tactic. <br>
  <br>
  - ToDo'95 <br>
  <br>
  v4.14 maybe others, If the program is used beyond the 30 day evaluation period, 
  <br>
  the author issues a "Doomsday warning". The message warns that the user must 
  <br>
  uninstall the program immediately or the program will delete the host computer 
  <br>
  Windows directory. The code for a DELTREE command on the host Windows <br>
  directory has been found within the executable. <br>
  <br>
  - Total Recorder <br>
  <br>
  v2.1 maybe others, v1.0 is ok, Seems to be a long standing often missed trick, 
  <br>
  after 64 seconds a spoiler signal is inserted into the output file. <br>
  <br>
  - Tracking the Eye <br>
  <br>
  Uses server authentication to confirm the users registration. <br>
  <br>
  - TranSoft <br>
  - (MailControl &amp; others) <br>
  <br>
  Contacts it's home server and checks your registration data against a few lists. 
  <br>
  (http://www.transsoft.com/codes/) One list is 'legal' usernames, <br>
  other is 'illegal'. <br>
  Names on the Illegal list include - William McCurdy, Nambulu, forcekill, <br>
  MONTILLO, Montillo, Norway, SiraX/[DNG], CORE/JES, Bracco, <br>
  Nambulu/Survivors, BABYNET, SiraX/CORE, QuQ [FACTOR], <br>

  - Tweaki for Power Users <br>
  <br>
  Serial is date dependant. Pops a warning message on bad serial. <br>
  If you get this try going to \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Tweaki\ <br>
  Find the 'RegName' key and change SPRITEX to SPRITEY. <br>
  Also reported to detect an old cracked version, <br>
  pop nasty messages and stop working. <br>
  Clean the old registry entries and also search for 'jermar','tweaki', and 'twk', 
  <br>
  new version will then install without probs. <br>
  <br>
  - (*) Virtual Drive <br>
  <br>
  v5.1 From Zor's Discussion board, a user used an old patch by Swat99 <br>
  and his boot drive was totally nuked. <br>
  <br>
  - WebForms <br>
  <br>
  In one version of it, the author had code to delete x:\windows\system\*.dll, 
  <br>
  and in another he deleted x:\command.com, then displayed a goofy message. <br>
  There is a modified keymaker that gets posted now and again. <br>
  It still works, last time it was checked. <br>
  Has been advised against using it on a version above 2.5d, however. <br>
  <br>
  - Wetsock 4 <br>
  <br>
  Will contact it's home server upon startup or some network event even after 
  <br>
  being registered. . <br>
  <br>
  - Where Is It? <br>
  <br>
  Locks catalogs if blacklisted name/serial is used, due to continual updating 
  (to <br>
  overcome the cracks) it's hard to find a correct version and matching keygen. 
  <br>
  Core's v2.11 (2.1.1.1003) release of the app &amp; keygen is known to be good. 
  <br>
  <br>
  When this happens in v2.12 it locks the catalog and overwrites the catalog name 
  <br>
  with 'warez user'. I have some info on fixing this. <br>
  It get's worse as of v2.14, it doesn't lock the catalog but overwrites all <br>
  titles, folders, and file names in the catalog with 'warez user'. <br>
  If you get stuck in the 'warez user' trap do NOT save the catalog, <br>
  if it happens during updating the original catalog will be ok. <br>
  Have used v2.14 for awhile and eventually got trapped., seemed to be after <br>
  running it while online but could not catch it in the act. <br>

<A NAME="51"><H1>Basic Event Handling, Mapping Modes, and a Scrolling View</H1></A><P>In <A HREF="ch03a.htm">Chapter 3</A>, you saw how the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) 
Library application framework called the view class's virtual <I>OnDraw</I> function. Take a look at the online help for the MFC library now. If you look at the documentation for the <I>CView</I> class and its base class, <I>CWnd</I>, you'll see several hundred member functions. Functions whose names begin with <I>On&#151;</I>such as<I> OnKeyDown</I> and <I>OnLButtonUp&#151;</I>are member functions that the application framework 
calls in response to various Windows &quot;events&quot; such as keystrokes and mouse clicks.
<P>Most of these application framework-called functions, such as <I>OnKeyDown</I>, aren't virtual functions and thus require more programming steps. This chapter explains how to use the Visual C++ ClassWizard to set up the <U>message</U> <U>map</U> structure necessary for connecting the application framework to your functions' code. You'll see the practical application of message map functions.
<P>The first two examples use an ordinary <I>CView</I> class. In EX04A, you'll learn about the interaction between user-driven events and the <I>OnDraw</I> function. In EX04B, you'll see the effects of different Windows mapping modes.
<P>More often than not, you'll want a <U>scrolling</U> view. The last example, EX04C, uses <I>CScrollView</I> in place of the <I>CView</I> base class. This allows the MFC library application framework to insert scroll bars and connect them to the view.

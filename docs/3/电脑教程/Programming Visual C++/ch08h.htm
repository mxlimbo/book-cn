<P>You've seen how to use the dialog editor to insert ActiveX controls at design time. If you need to create an ActiveX control at runtime without a resource template entry, here are the programming steps:
<OL>
<P><LI>Insert the component into your project. ClassWizard will create the files for a wrapper class.
<P><LI>Add an embedded ActiveX control wrapper class data member to your dialog class or other C++ window class. An embedded C++ object is then constructed and destroyed along with the window object.
<P><LI>Choose Resource Symbols from Visual C++'s View menu. Add an ID constant for the new control.
<P><LI>If the parent window is a dialog, use ClassWizard to map the dialog's
WM_INITDIALOG message, thus overriding <I>CDialog-::OnInitDialog</I>. For other windows, use ClassWizard to map the WM_CREATE message. The new function should call the embedded control class's <I>Create</I> member function. This call indirectly displays the new control in the dialog. The control will be properly destroyed when the parent window is destroyed.
<P><LI>In the parent window class, manually add the necessary event message handlers and prototypes for your new control. Don't forget to add the event sink map macros.
</OL>

ClassWizard doesn't help you with event sink maps when you add a dynamic ActiveX control to a project. Consider inserting the target control in a dialog in another temporary project. After you're finished mapping events, simply copy the event sink map code to the parent window class in your main project.

<P>Some ActiveX controls support picture properties, which can accommodate bitmaps, metafiles, and icons. If an ActiveX control has at least one picture property, ClassWizard generates a <I>CPicture</I> class in your project during the control's installation. You don't need to use this <I>CPicture</I> class, but you must use the MFC class <I>CPictureHolder</I>. To access the <I>CPictureHolder</I> class declaration and code, you need the following line in StdAfx.h:
<P><PRE>#include &lt;afxctl.h&gt;</PRE>
<P>Suppose you have an ActiveX control with a picture property named Picture. Here's how you set the Picture property to a bitmap in your program's resources:
<P><PRE>CPictureHolder pict;
pict.CreateFromBitmap(IDB_MYBITMAP); // from project's resources
m_control.SetPicture(pict.GetPictureDispatch());</PRE>
<P><DIV CLASS=note>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC="note.jpg" width=123 height=18 BORDER="0"><P>
If you include the AfxCtl.h file, you can't statically link your program with the MFC library. If you need a stand-alone program that supports picture properties, you'll have to borrow code from the <I>CPictureHolder</I> class, located in the \Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\mfc\src\ctlpict.cpp file.

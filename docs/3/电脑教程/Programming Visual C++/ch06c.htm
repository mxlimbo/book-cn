<A NAME="132"><H1>Resources and Controls</H1></A><P>So now you know a dialog is a window. What makes the dialog different from the <I>CView</I> windows you've seen already? For one thing, a dialog window is almost always tied to a Windows resource that identifies the dialog's elements and specifies their layout. Because you can use the dialog editor (one of the resource editors) to create and edit a dialog resource, you can quickly and efficiently produce dialogs in a visual manner.
<P>A dialog contains a number of elements called <U>controls</U>. Dialog controls include edit controls (aka text boxes), buttons, list boxes, combo boxes, static text (aka labels), tree views, progress indicators, sliders, and so forth. Windows manages these controls using special grouping and tabbing logic, and that relieves you of a major programming burden. The dialog controls can be referenced either by a <I>CWnd</I> pointer (because they are really windows) or by an index number (with an associated <I>#define</I> constant) assigned in the resource. A control sends a message to its parent dialog in response to a user action such as typing text or clicking a button.
<P>The Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library and ClassWizard work together to enhance the dialog logic that Windows provides. ClassWizard generates a class derived from <I>CDialog</I> and then lets you associate dialog class 
data members with dialog controls. You can specify editing parameters such as 
maximum text length and numeric high and low limits. ClassWizard generates 
statements that call the MFC data exchange and data validation functions to 
move information back and forth between the screen and the data members.

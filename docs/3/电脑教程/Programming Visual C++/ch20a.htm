<A NAME="421"><H1>Splitter Windows and Multiple Views</H1></A><P>Except for the EX18A example, each program you've seen so far in this book has had only one view attached to a document. If you've used a Microsoft Windows-based word processor, you know that it's convenient to have two windows open simultaneously on various parts of a document. Both windows might contain normal views, or one window might contain a page layout view and another might contain an outline view.
<P>With the application framework, you can use a <U>splitter</U> <U>window</U> or <U>multiple</U> <U>MDI</U> <U>child</U> <U>windows</U> to display multiple views. You'll learn about both presentation options here, and you'll see that it's easy to make multiple view <U>objects</U> of the same view class (the normal view) in both cases. It's slightly more difficult, however, to use two or more view <U>classes</U> in the same application (say, the outline view and the page layout view).
<P>This chapter emphasizes the selection and presentation of multiple views. The examples depend on a document with data initialized in the <I>OnNewDocument</I> function. Look back now to <A HREF="ch16a.htm">Chapter 16</A> for a review of 
document-view communication.

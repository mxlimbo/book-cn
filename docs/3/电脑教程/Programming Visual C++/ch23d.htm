<P>Now let's create an MDI application that doesn't use the document-view 
architecture.

<ol>
<P><B><LI>Run AppWizard to produce \vcpp32\ex23c\ex23c.</B> Select the Multiple Documents option in the AppWizard Step 1 dialog and uncheck the Document/View Architecture Support? option, as shown here.



<P><A HREF="javascript:fullSize('g23og03x.htm')"> <img src="g23og03.jpg" width=404 height=325 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>


<P><B><LI>Add code to paint in the dialog.</B> Add the following boldface code to the <I>CChildView::OnPaint</I> function in the ChildView.cpp source code file:

<P><pre>
void CChildView::OnPaint() 
{
    CPaintDC dc(this); // device context for painting

<B>    dc.TextOut(0, 0, &quot;Hello, world!&quot;);</B>

    // Do not call CWnd::OnPaint() for painting messages
}
</pre>

<B><P><LI>Compile and run.</B> You now have a complete MDI application without dependencies on the document-view architecture.

<P>As in EX23B, this example automatically creates a <I>CChildView</I> class. The main difference between EX23B and EX23C is the fact that in EX23C the <I>CChildView</I> class is created in the 
<I>CChildFrame::OnCreate</I> function instead of in the <I>CMainFrame </I>class.
</ol>


<P>In this chapter you've learned how to create three kinds of applications that do not depend on the document-view architecture. Examining how these applications are generated is also a great way to learn how MFC works. We recommend that you compare the generated results to similar applications with 
document-view architecture support to get a complete picture of how the document-view classes work with the rest of MFC.

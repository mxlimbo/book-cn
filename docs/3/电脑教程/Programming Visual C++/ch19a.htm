<P>If you're depending on the Win32 API alone, printing is one of the tougher programming jobs you'll have. If you don't believe me, just skim through the 60-page chapter &quot;Using the Printer&quot; in Charles Petzold's <I>Programming Windows 95 </I>(Microsoft Press, 1996). Other books about Microsoft Windows ignore the subject completely. The Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library version 6.0 application framework goes a long way toward making printing easy. As a bonus, it adds a print preview capability that behaves like the print preview functions in commercial Windows-based programs such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel.
<P>In this chapter, you'll learn how to use the MFC library Print and Print Preview features. In the process, you'll get a feeling for what's involved in 
Windows printing and how it's different from printing in MS-DOS. First you'll 
do some wysiwyg printing, in which the printer output matches the screen display. This option requires careful use of mapping modes. Later you'll print a paginated data processing-style report that doesn't reflect the screen display at all. In that example, you will use a template array to structure your document so that the program can print any specified range of pages on demand.

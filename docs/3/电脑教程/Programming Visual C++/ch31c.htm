<A NAME="766"><H1>Structured Query Language</H1></A><P>You could not have worked in the software field without at least hearing 
about Structured Query Language (SQL), a standard database access language 
with its own grammar. In the SQL world, a database is a collection of tables 
that consist of rows and columns. Many DBMS products support SQL, and 
many programmers know SQL. The SQL standard is continually evolving, and 
SQL grammar varies among products. SQL extensions, such as 
<U>blob</U> (binary large object) capability, allow storage of pictures, sound, and complex data structures.

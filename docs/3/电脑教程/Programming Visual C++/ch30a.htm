<A NAME="745"><H1>ATL and ActiveX Controls</H1></A><P>If you've finished reading about COM and ATL and still wonder how 
COM fits into your day-to-day programming activities, you're not alone. Figuring 
out how to use COM in real life isn't always obvious at first glance. After all, a 
whole lot of extra code must be typed in just to get a COM object up and 
running. However, there's a very real application of COM right under your nose
&#151;ActiveX Controls. ActiveX controls are small gadgets (usually 
UI-oriented) written around the Component Object Model.
<P>In <A HREF="ch29a.htm">Chapter 29</A>, you examined COM classes created by using ATL. In 
this chapter, you'll learn how to write a certain kind of COM 
class&#151;an ActiveX control. You had a chance to work with ActiveX Controls from the client 
side in <A HREF="ch08a.htm">Chapter 8</A>. Now it's time to write your own.
<P>There are several steps involved in creating an ActiveX control using 
ATL, including:
<UL>
<LI>Deciding what to draw
<P><LI>Developing incoming interfaces for the control
<P><LI>Developing outgoing interfaces (events) for the control
<P><LI>Implementing a persistence mechanism for the control
<P><LI>Providing a user interface for manipulating the control's properties
<P></UL>
<P>This chapter covers all these steps. Soon you'll be able to use ATL to 
create ActiveX controls that you (or other developers) can use within other 
programs.

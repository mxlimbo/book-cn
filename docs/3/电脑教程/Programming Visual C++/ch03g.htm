<A NAME="44"><H1>A Preview of the Resource Editors</H1></A><P>Now that you have a complete application program, it's a good time for a 
quick look at the resource editors. Although the application's resource script, 
ex03a.rc, is an ASCII file, modifying it with a text editor is not a good idea. That's 
the resource editors' job.
<A NAME="45"><H2>The Contents of ex03a.rc</H2></A><P>The resource file determines much of the EX03A application's &quot;look and 
feel.&quot; The file ex03a.rc contains (or points to) the Windows resources listed here.<P>

<TABLE WIDTH="95%" CELLPADDING="5">
<tr><td valign="top"><B>Resource</B></td><td valign="top"><B>Description</B></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Accelerator</td><td valign="top">Definitions for keys that simulate menu and toolbar 
selections.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Dialog</td><td valign="top">Layout and contents of dialog boxes. EX03A has only 
the About dialog box.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Icon</td><td valign="top">Icons (16-by-16-pixel and 32-by-32-pixel versions), such 
as the application icon you see in Microsoft Windows 
Explorer and in the application's About dialog box. 
EX03A uses the MFC logo for its application icon.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Menu</td><td valign="top">The application's top-level menu and associated 
pop-up menus.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">String table</td><td valign="top">Strings that are not part of the 
C++ source code.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Toolbar</td><td valign="top">The row of buttons immediately below the menu.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Version</td><td valign="top">Program description, version number, language, and so on.</td></tr>
</table>

<P>In addition to the resources listed above, ex03a.rc contains the statements
<P><pre>
#include  &quot;afxres.h&quot;
#include  &quot;afxres.rc&quot;
</pre>
<P>which bring in some MFC library resources common to all applications. 
These resources include strings, graphical buttons, and elements needed for 
printing and OLE.<P>
<DIV CLASS=note>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC="note.jpg" width=123 height=18 BORDER=0><P>
If you're using the shared DLL version of the MFC 
library, the common resources are stored inside the MFC DLL.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</DIV>
<P>The ex03a.rc file also contains the statement
<P><pre>
#include  &quot;resource.h&quot;
</pre>
<P>This statement brings in the application's three 
<I>#define</I> constants, which are 
<I>IDR</I>_<I>MAINFRAME</I> (identifying the menu, icon, string list, and 
accelerator table), <I>IDR_EX03ATYPE</I> (identifying the default document icon, which 
we won't use in this program), and 
<I>IDD</I>_<I>ABOUTBOX</I> (identifying the About dialog box). This same resource.h file is included indirectly by the 
application's source code files. If you use a resource editor to add more constants 
(symbols), the definitions ultimately show up in resource.h. Be careful if you edit this 
file in text mode because your changes might be removed the next time you use 
a resource editor.
<A NAME="46"><H2>Running the Dialog Resource Editor</H2></A><OL>
<B><LI>Open the project's RC file.</B> Click the ResourceView button in 
the Workspace window. If you expand each item, you will see the following 
in the resource editor window.<P>

<P><IMG SRC="G03OG09.GIF" width=340 height=414 BORDER=0><P>

<B><LI>Examine the application's resources.</B> Now take some time to explore the individual resources. When you select a resource by double-clicking on it, another window opens with tools appropriate for the selected resource. If you open a dialog resource, the control palette should appear. 
If it doesn't, right-click inside any toolbar, and then check Controls.<P>
<B><LI>Modify the IDD_ABOUTBOX dialog box.</B> Make some changes to the About Ex03a dialog box, shown here.<P>

<P><IMG SRC="G03OG10.GIF" width=395 height=182 BORDER=0>

<P><LI>You can change the size of the window by dragging the right and 
bottom borders, move the OK button, change the text, and so forth. Simply 
click on an element to select it, and then right-click to change its properties.<P>
<B><LI>Rebuild the project with the modified resource 
file.</B> In Visual C++, choose Build Ex03a.exe from the Build menu. Notice that no actual 
C++ recompilation is necessary. Visual C++ saves the edited resource file, 
and then the Resource Compiler (rc.exe) processes ex03a.rc to produce 
a compiled version, ex03a.res, which is fed to the linker. The linker 
runs quickly because it can link the project incrementally.
<B><LI>Test the new version of the application.</B> Run the EX03A program again, and then choose About from the application's Help menu to confirm that your dialog box was changed as expected.

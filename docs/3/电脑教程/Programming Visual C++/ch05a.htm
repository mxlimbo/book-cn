<P>You've already seen some elements of the Graphics Device Interface (GDI). Anytime your program draws to the display or the printer, it must use the GDI functions. The GDI provides functions for drawing points, lines, rectangles, polygons, ellipses, bitmaps, and text. You can draw circles and squares intuitively once you study the available functions, but text programming is more difficult.This chapter gives you the information you need to start using the GDI effectively in the Microsoft Visual C++ environment. You'll learn how to use fonts on both the display and the printer. You must wait until <A HREF="ch19a.htm">Chapter 19</A>, however, for details on how the framework controls the printer.

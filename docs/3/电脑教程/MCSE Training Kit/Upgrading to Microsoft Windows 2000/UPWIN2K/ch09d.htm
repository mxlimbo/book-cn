<A NAME="444"><H1>Lesson 3: Configuring Outbound Connections</H1></A>

<p>You can configure all outbound connections in Windows 2000 with the
Network Connection wizard. Much of the work of configuring protocols
and services is automated when you use this process. Understanding the
options found in the wizard will help you to configure connections
efficiently.</p>

<p>There are three basic types of outbound connections:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Dial-up connections</li></p>

<p><li>Connections to a VPN</li></p>

<p><li>Direct connections to another computer through a cable</li></p>
</ul>


<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Configure outbound connections in Windows 2000.</li></p>
</ul>


<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 25 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="445"><H2>Creating Dial-Up Connections</H2></A>

<p>Dial-up connections include outbound dial-up connection to either a
private network or to an ISP. To create and configure an outbound
dial-up connection, use the Network Connection wizard. To access the
Network Connection wizard, right-click My Network Places, click
Properties, and then double-click the Make New Connection icon. The
Welcome To The Network Connection Wizard page will appear. Click Next
to continue and the Network Connection Type page appears, as shown in Figure 9.4.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 9.4</b> <i>Select a type of connection on the Network Connection Type page.</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>On the Network Connection Type page, select Dial-Up To Private
Network to create a connection to a private network or Dial-Up To The
Internet to create a connection to an ISP.</p>

<A NAME="446"><H3>Dial-Up to Private Network</H3></A>

<p>If you select the Dial-Up To Private Network option and click Next,
you will be prompted to enter the phone number of the computer or
network to which you want to connect; this might be an ISP for an
Internet connection or the modems for your private network. Enter the
phone number, click Next, and you will be prompted to specify who can
use this connection. If you want this connection to be made available
to all users of this computer, select the For All Users option, and
then click Next. If you want to reserve the connection for yourself,
select the Only For Myself option. When you click Next, you will be
prompted for one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>If you selected For All Users, and you want to let other
computers gain access to resources through this dial-up connection,
select the Enable Internet Connection Sharing For This Connection check
box, and then click Next. Type a name for the connection, and then
click Finish.</li></p>

<p><li>If you selected Only For Myself, you will be prompted to
type a name for the connection, and then click Finish.</li></p>
</ul>


<A NAME="447"><H3>Dial-Up to the Internet</H3></A>

<p>If you select Dial-Up To The Internet and click Next, you will be
prompted to select one of the following three options in the Internet
Connection wizard:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>I Want To Sign Up For A New Internet Account. (My Telephone
Line Is Connected To My Modem.)</li></p>

<p><li>I Want To Transfer My Existing Internet Account To This
Computer. (My Telephone Line Is Connected To My Modem.)</li></p>

<p><li>I Want To Set Up My Internet Connection Manually, Or I Want
To Connect Through A Local Area Network (LAN).</li></p>
</ul>


<p>If you do not want to change your Internet settings, click
Cancel.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
ISDN and X.25 connections are considered VPNs
for the purposes of the Network Connection wizard.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="448"><H2>Creating Connections to a Virtual Private Network</H2></A>

<p>A VPN is a network that is created by using tunneling protocols such
as PPTP or L2TP to create secure connections across an untrusted
network. To create a new VPN connection you also use the Network
Connection wizard. To access the Network Connection wizard, right-click
My Network Places, click Properties, and then double-click the Make New
Connection icon. The Welcome To The Network Connection Wizard page will
appear. Click Next to continue and the Network Connection Type page
appears.</p>

<p>On the Network Connection Type page, click Connect To A Private
Network Through The Internet, click Next. You will be prompted to enter
the host name or IP address of the computer or network to which you are
connecting. Enter the name or address, and then click Next. If you want
this connection to be made available to all users of this computer,
select the For All Users option, and then click Next. If you want to
reserve the connection for yourself, select the Only For Myself option.
When you click Next, you will be prompted for one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>If you selected For All Users and you want to let other
computers gain access to resources through this dial-up connection,
select the Enable Internet Connection Sharing For This Connection check
box, and then click Next. Type a name for the connection, and then
click Finish.</li></p>

<p><li>If you selected Only For Myself, type a name for the
connection when prompted, and then click Finish.</li></p>
</ul>


<A NAME="449"><H2>Creating Direct Connections to Another Computer Through a Cable</H2></A>

<p>The Network Connection wizard can also be used to create a direct
(cable) connection to another computer. However, if you are a member of
a domain and want to host a direct connection, you must use RRAS.</p>

<p>To create a direct cable connection to another computer, on the
Network Connection Type page, click Connect Directly To Another
Computer, click Next, and then do one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>If your computer will be the host for the connection, click
Host and then click Next.</li></p>

<p><li>If your computer will be the guest for the connection, click
Guest (see Figure 9.5) and then click Next.</li></p>
</ul>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 9.5</b> <i>Connecting two computers using the Network Connection wizard</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>After specifying Host or Guest, you select the port that is
connected to the other computer and then click Next. If you want this
connection to be made available to all users of this computer, click
the For All Users option. If you want to reserve the connection for yourself, click the Only For Myself option.
When you click Next, you will be prompted for one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>If you selected For All Users, and you want to let other
computers gain access to resources through this dial-up connection,
select the Enable Shared Access For This Connection check box, and then
click Next. Type a name for the connection, and then click Finish.</li></p>

<p><li>If you selected Only For Myself, type a name for the
connection when prompted, and then click Finish.</li></p>

<A NAME="85"><H1>Lesson 2: Installing Windows 2000 from a CD-ROM</H1></A>

<p>This lesson looks at the four-stage process of installing Windows
2000 from a CD-ROM. These four stages are as follows: run the Setup
program, run the Setup wizard, install Windows networking, and complete
the Setup program. After you learn about these four stages, you will
install Windows 2000 on your computer.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>
<ul>
<p><li>Install Windows 2000 Server from a CD-ROM.</li></p>
</ul>
<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 90 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="86"><H2>The Windows 2000 Setup Program</H2></A>

<p>Installing Windows 2000 is a four-step process that combines the
Setup program, wizards, and informational screens to complete the
installation.</p>

<p>Installing Windows 2000 from a CD-ROM onto a clean hard disk
consists of these four stages:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Run the Setup program.</li></p>

<p>The Setup program prepares the hard disk for later stages of
installation and copies the necessary files to run the Setup
wizard.</p>

<p><li>Run the Setup wizard.</li></p>

<p>The Setup wizard requests setup information about the computer,
which includes names, passwords, licensing modes, and so on.</p>

<p><li>Install Windows 2000 networking.</li></p>

<p>After gathering information about the computer, the Setup wizard
prompts you for networking information and then installs the networking
components so that the computer can communicate with other computers on
the network.</p>

<p><li>Complete the Setup program.</li></p>

<p>To complete the installation, Setup copies files to the hard disk
and configures the computer. The system restarts after installation is
complete.</p>
</ol>

<p>Each of these four steps is covered in more detail in the following
sections.</p>

<A NAME="87"><H2>Running the Setup Program</H2></A>

<p>To start Setup, use the Setup boot disks. Insert the disk labeled
Setup Disk 1 into drive A, and then turn on, or restart, the computer.
If your computer supports booting from a CD-ROM drive, you can also
start the installation by using the Windows 2000 CD-ROM.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
For instructions on how to create the Windows
2000 Setup boot disks, see <a href="chaba.htm">Appendix B</a>, &quot;Creating Setup Disks.&quot;
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>The following steps describe running the Setup program on a clean
disk drive (see Figure 2.4):</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 2.4</b> <i>Steps in the Setup program</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<ol>
<p><li>After the computer starts, a minimal version of Windows 2000 is
copied into memory.</li></p>

<p><li>This version of Windows 2000 starts the text-mode portion of the
Setup program and prompts you to read and accept a licensing
agreement.</li></p>

<p><li>Setup prompts you to select the partition on which to install
Windows 2000. You can select an existing partition or create a new
partition by using unpartitioned space on the hard disk.</li></p>

<p><li>After you create the installation partition, Setup prompts you
to select a file system for the new partition. Then, Setup formats the
partition with the selected file system.</li></p>

<p><li>After formatting the Windows 2000 partition, Setup copies files
to the hard disk and saves configuration information.</li></p>

<p><li>Setup restarts the computer and then starts the Windows 2000
Server Setup wizard, the graphical-user-interface-(GUI)-mode portion of
Setup. As in Windows NT 4.0, by default the Windows 2000 operating system files
are installed in the C:\Winnt folder.</li></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="88"><H2>Running the Setup Wizard</H2></A>

<p>The GUI-based Windows 2000 Setup wizard leads you through the next
stage of the installation process. It gathers information about you,
your organization, and your computer.</p>

<p>After installing Windows 2000 security features and installing and
configuring devices, the Windows 2000 Setup wizard asks you to provide
the following information:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Regional settings.</b> Customize language, locale, and
keyboard settings. You can configure Windows 2000 to use multiple
languages and regional settings.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Name and organization.</b> Enter the name of the person
and the organization to which this copy of Windows 2000 is
licensed.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Licensing mode.</b> Select Per Server or Per Seat
licensing. If you select Per Server, you must enter the number of
Client Access Licenses that were purchased for this server. Each
connection requires a Client Access License.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Computer name.</b> Enter a computer name. The computer
name must be different from other computer, workgroup, or domain names
on the network. If your computer has the Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) networking protocol installed, then
the computer name can be up to 63 characters in length, but should only
contain the numbers 0 - 9, the letters A - Z and a - z, and hyphens. Using other characters may prevent users from locating the computer on the network. If your network is using the Microsoft DNS Server, you can use any characters except the
period. If other networking protocols are installed without TCP/IP,
then the computer name is limited to 15 characters. The Windows 2000
Setup wizard displays a default name, using the organization name that
you entered earlier in the setup process.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Password for Administrator account.</b> Specify a
password for the Administrator user account, which the Windows 2000
Setup wizard creates during installation. The password can be up to 14
characters in length and is case sensitive. Since the Administrator
account provides administrative privileges that are required to manage
the computer, make it a difficult password to guess. Microsoft
recommends mixing uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols
(for example Rp9*w7).</li></p>

<p><li><b>Windows 2000 optional components.</b> Add or remove
additional components during the installation of Windows 2000.</li></p>

<p>The following list describes the steps for installing Windows 2000
networking:</p>

<ol>
<p><li><b>Detect network adapter cards.</b> The Windows 2000 Setup
wizard detects and configures any network adapter cards that are
installed on the computer. After configuring network adapters, it
locates a server running the DHCP Service (DHCP server) on the
network.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Select networking components.</b> Choose to install
networking components with typical or customized settings. The typical
installation includes the following options:</li></p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Client for Microsoft Networks.</b> This component allows

<p><li><b>File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks.</b> This
component allows other computers to gain access to file and print
resources on your computer.</li></p>

<p><li><b>TCP/IP.</b> This protocol is the default networking
protocol that allows your computer to communicate over local area
networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs).</li></p>
</ul>

<p>You can install other clients, services, and network protocols (such
as NetBIOS Enhanced User Interface [NetBEUI], AppleTalk, and NWLink IPX/SPX/NetBIOS-compatible transport) now or anytime after you
install Windows 2000.</p>

<A NAME="92"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>Installing Windows 2000 Server is a four-stage process. The four
stages are as follows: run the Setup program, run the Setup wizard,
install Windows 2000 networking, and complete the Setup program.</p>

<p>To start Setup, insert Setup Disk 1 into drive A, or if your
computer supports booting from a CD-ROM, insert the Windows 2000 Server
CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive and turn on, or restart, the computer. A
minimal version of Windows 2000 is copied into memory and starts the Setup program. Setup
then starts the text-mode portion of Setup, prompts you to read and
accept a licensing agreement, to select the partition on which to
install Windows 2000, and to select a file system for the new
partition. Setup copies files to the hard disk, saves configuration
information, restarts the computer, and then starts the Windows 2000
Setup wizard, the GUI-mode portion of Setup.</p>

<p>After installing Windows 2000 security features and installing and
configuring devices, the Windows 2000 Setup wizard prompts you for information
about you, your organization, and your computer. The information requested
includes the following: language, locale, and keyboard settings, the
name of the person and the organization to which this copy of Windows
2000 is licensed, the licensing mode, the computer name, the password for the Administrator user account, and any Windows 2000 optional components you want to
install.</p>

<p>The third stage is the installation of Windows 2000 networking. The
Setup wizard detects and configures any network adapter cards that are
installed in the computer, and prompts you to choose to install networking
components with typical or customized settings. By default, the client
for Microsoft networks, the file and printer sharing for Microsoft
networks, and TCP/IP are installed. You can choose to install other
clients, services, and network protocols now or anytime after you
install Windows 2000. The Setup wizard also prompts you to decide
whether the computer will join a workgroup or domain, and then installs
and configures the Windows networking components that you selected.</p>

<p>During the last stage, completing the installation, Setup copies any
remaining files, such as accessories and bitmaps, applies the
configuration settings that you specified, saves your configuration
settings to the local hard disk, deletes any files that it installed
for use only during installation, and restarts the computer. This
finishes the installation of a stand-alone or member server from a
CD-ROM.</p>

<p>After you log on, Windows 2000 displays the Configure Your Server
window, which allows you to further configure your computer. This step
completes the installation of Windows 2000 from a CD-ROM as a
stand-alone or member server.</p>

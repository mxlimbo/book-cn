<p><A NAME="678"><b>Review Questions</b></A></p>

<ol>
<p><li>You have been asked to install a file and print server for your
department of 50 people. Which operating system would you choose from
the Windows 2000 platform?</li></p>


<p><b>Windows 2000 Server.</b></p>

<p><li>Your department has now grown to support over 500 people, all of
whom need access to your server's file services. They also require
24-hour access to these services. Which operating system from the
Windows 2000 platform would you now choose?</li></p>

<p><b>Windows 2000 Advanced Server.</b></p>

<p><li>Users in your organization are complaining that they cannot
locate the printers that they need to print to. Identify the component
in Windows 2000 that addresses this business problem, and explain how
it addresses the problem.</li></p>

<p><b>Active Directory directory services.
Integrating Active Directory directory services with Windows 2000 makes
all shared printers in your domain available as objects in Active
Directory directory services.</b></p>

<p><li>Your organization provides users with access to a large number
of programs for everyday use. The help desk is receiving many calls
from people who are having difficulty finding the applications that
they need because of a very large and confusing Start menu structure.
How does Windows 2000 solve this problem?</li></p>

<p><b>Personalized Menus can be activated to
keep track of the programs you use and to update the Programs menu so
that it presents only the programs that you use most often.
Applications that you use less frequently are hidden from normal view,
making the Start menu easier to use.</b></p>

<p><li>Identify three of the features that make Windows 2000
Professional the best desktop operating system for a business
environment.</li></p>

<p><b>Improvements to the user interface, a
graphical scheduling utility, improved hardware support, and support for ACPI.</b></p>

<p><li>List three of the features that help to simplify management of a
Windows 2000 network.</li></p>

<A NAME="681"><H3>Installing Windows 2000</H3></A>

<p><A NAME="680"><b>Review Questions</b></A></p>

<ol>
<p><li>Your company has decided to install Windows 2000 Professional on
all new computers that are purchased for desktop users. What should you
do before you purchase new computers to ensure that Windows 2000 can be
installed and run without difficulty?</li></p>


<p><b>Verify that the hardware components meet
the minimum requirements for Windows 2000. Also, verify that all of the
hardware components that are installed in the new computers are on the Windows 2000
HCL. If a component is not listed, contact the manufacturer to verify that a
Windows 2000 driver is available.</b></p>

<p><li>You are attempting to install Windows 2000 Professional from a
CD-ROM; however, you have discovered that your computer does not
support booting from the CD-ROM drive. How can you install Windows
2000?</li></p>

<p><b>Start the computer by using the Setup boot
disks. When prompted, insert the Windows 2000 Workstation CD-ROM, and
then continue Setup.</b></p>

<p><li>You are installing Windows 2000 Server on a computer that will
be a member server in an existing Windows 2000 domain. You want to add
the computer to the domain during installation. What information do you
need, and what computers must be available on the network, before you
run the Setup program?</li></p>


<p><b>You need the DNS domain name of the domain that you are joining. You must also make sure that a computer account for the member server exists in the domain or you must have the user name and password of a user account in the domain with the authority to create computer accounts in the domain. A server running the DNS Service and a domain controller in the domain you are joining must be available on the network.</b></p>

<p><li>You are using the CD-ROM to install Windows 2000 Server on a
computer that was previously running another operating system. How
should you configure the hard disk to simplify the installation
process?</li></p>

<p><b>Use a disk partitioning tool to remove any
existing partitions, and then create and format a new partition for the
Windows 2000 installation.</b></p>

<p><li>You are installing Windows 2000 over the network. Before you
install to a client computer, what must you do?</li></p>

<p><b>Locate the path to the shared installation
files on the distribution server. Create a 500 MB FAT partition on the
target computer (1 GB recommended). Create a client disk with a network
client so that you can connect from the computer, without an operating
system, to the distribution server.</b></p>
</ol>

<H2>Chapter 3</H2>
<A NAME="683"><H3>Configuring the DNS Service</H3></A>
<p><li><b>To test your DNS Server using Nslookup</b></li></p>
<ol>
<p><li value="2">At the command prompt, type <b>nslookup</b> and then press
Enter.</li></p>

<p>Record your results in the following table.</p>

<p><table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr>
<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Value</th>
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Default server</td>
<td valign="top"><b>Server1.domain.com.<br>  (Answers will vary if you did not use Server1 as your  computer name or domain1 as your DNS domain name.)</b></td>

</ol>

<p><A NAME="682"><b>Review Questions</b></a></p>

<ol>
<p><li>What is the function of each of the following DNS
components?</li></p>

<p>Domain name space</p>

<p><b>The domain name space provides the
hierarchical structure for the DNS distributed database.</b></p>

<p>Zones</p>

<p><b>Zones are used to divide the domain name
space into administrative units.</b></p>

<p>Name servers</p>

<p><b>Name servers store the zone information
and perform name resolution for their authoritative domain name
spaces.</b></p>

<p><li>Why would you want to have multiple name servers?</li></p>

<p><b>Installing multiple name servers provides
redundancy, reduces the load on the server that stores the primary zone
database file, and allows for faster access speed for remote
locations.</b></p>

<p><li>What is the difference between a forward lookup query and a
reverse lookup query?</li></p>

<p><b>A forward lookup query resolves a name to
an IP address. A reverse lookup query resolves an IP address to a
name.</b></p>

<p><li>When would you configure a server as a root server?</li></p>

<p><b>Configure a name server as a root server
only if you will not be connecting to the Internet or if you are using
a proxy server to gain access to the Internet.</b></p>

<p><li>Why do you create forward and reverse lookup zones?</li></p>

<p><b>A name server must have at least one
forward lookup zone. A forward lookup zone enables name resolution.</b></p>

<p><b>A reverse lookup zone is needed for
troubleshooting utilities, such as Nslookup, and to record names
instead of IP addresses in IIS logs.</b></p>

<p><li>What is the difference between Dynamic DNS and DNS?</li></p>

<p><b>Dynamic DNS allows automatic updates to
the primary server's zone file. In DNS, you must manually update
the file when new hosts or domains are added.</b></p>

<p><b>Dynamic DNS also allows a list of
authorized servers to initiate updates. This list can include secondary
name servers, domain controllers, and other servers that perform
network registration for clients, such as servers running WINS and the DHCP Service.</b></p>
</ol>

<H2>Chapter 4</H2>
<A NAME="685"><H3>Implementing Active Directory Directory Services</H3></A>

<p><li><b>To install Active Directory directory services on
a stand-alone server</b></li></p>
<ol>
<p><A NAME="707"></a><li value="10">Ensure that the Sysvol location is C:\Winnt\Sysvol.</li></p>

<p>What is the one Sysvol location requirement?</p>

<p><b>Sysvol must be located on a Windows 2000
partition that is formatted as Windows NT file system (NTFS).</b></p>

<p>What is the function of Sysvol?</p>

<p><b>Sysvol is a system volume hosted on all
Windows 2000 domain controllers. It stores scripts and part of the
Group Policy objects for both the current domain and the
enterprise.</b></p>
</ol>

<p><A NAME="708"></a><li><b>To use Active Directory Users and Computers</b></li></p>

<p>What selections are listed under domain?</p>

<p><b>Builtin, Computers, Domain Controllers,
Foreign-Security-Principals, LostAndFound, System, and Users.</b></p>
</ol>

<p><A NAME="684"><b>Review Questions</b></a></p>

<ol>
<p><li>List three of the items that you should check on a server before
running the Active Directory Installation wizard.</li></p>

<p><b>That you have a partition or volume
formatted with NTFS.</b></p>

<p><b>That you have adequate hard disk space to
store the directory.</b></p>

<p><b>That the system time and time zone settings
are accurate.</b></p>

<p><b>That you have a DNS server, if you are not
going to let Active Directory directory services configure a DNS server
while running the wizard.</b></p>

<p><li>You have installed Active Directory directory services on your
corporate network and have upgraded all domain controllers running
Windows NT 4.0 to Windows 2000. You now want to create security-type
universal groups. What should you do and what console should you use to
make the change?</li></p>

<p><b>Change from mixed mode to native mode. To
do this, you use the Active Directory Domains and Trusts snap-in, which you start from the
Administrative Tools menu.</b></p>

<p><li>You are the administrator of a network in a remote location, and
the network connection from the main office to that location has
failed. You find you are still able to create user accounts even though
the connection has failed, and users are noticing no difference in
logon speed. What would you need at the remote location for this to be
possible?</li></p>

<p><b>A domain controller and a global catalog
server. These two components can be on the same computer.</b></p>

<p><li>Your company has one remote office connected by a 64 Kbps WAN
link. Technical support is receiving calls from users in the remote
office who are complaining that it is sometimes taking over five
minutes to log on. You have configured a domain controller and a global
catalog server in the remote office. What is a potential source of the problem? Describe the
steps you would take to improve logon times.</li></p>


<p><b>It is likely that you haven't
configured sites for your network and that domain controllers that are
located across the slow WAN link are occasionally authenticating
users.</b></p>

<p><b>Create a site for your main office and a
site for your remote office. Create a subnet object for each network, and associate the subnet with
the appropriate site. Make sure that both sites are in the default site
link, DEFAULTIPSITELINK.</b></p>

<p><li>You have three locations (A, B, and C) that are connected to a
central site (D) by 128 Kbps WAN links, and another remote location (E)
connected to the central site by a 256 Kbps WAN link. You create a site
for each location. What site links should you create to enable
replication to take place, and given only the bandwidth information
about the links, what cost should be associated with each site
link?</li></p>


<p><b>Site Link AD: Cost 2</b></p>

<p><b>Site Link BD: Cost 2</b></p>

<p><b>Site Link CD: Cost 2</b></p>

<p><b>Site Link ED: Cost 1</b></p>

<p><b>The cost value is arbitrary. It is only
important that the cost of site links be in the same proportions as
above.</b></p>

<p><li>What determines whether users can locate an object using the
global catalog?</li></p>

<p><b>The global catalog contains the access
permissions for an object. If users do not have the Read permission for
an object, they cannot view or locate the object.</b></p>

<p><li>What happens to the permissions of an object when you move it
from one OU to another OU?</li></p>

<p><b>Permissions that are assigned directly to
the object remain the same. The object also inherits permissions from
the new OU. Any permissions that were inherited from the previous OU no
longer affect the object.</b></p>

<ol>
<p><li>What two new technologies in Windows 2000 provide the ability to
manage software?</li></p>

<p><b>The two new technologies are the Windows
Installer and Windows 2000 Software Installation And Maintenance.</b></p>

<p><li>You need to deploy two new applications to users in your
organization, Microsoft Excel 2000 and Microsoft Word 2000. All users
in your company use Word 2000 on a daily basis. All users in the
accounting department also use Excel 2000 on a daily basis. Some users
outside of the accounting department need occasional access to Excel
2000. If you have a single domain and each department has their own
organizational unit, how would you deploy these two applications?</li></p>

<p><b>Microsoft Word 2000 would be assigned in a
GPO at the domain level. Microsoft Excel 2000 would be assigned in a
GPO at the accounting department's organizational unit and would
also be published in a GPO at the domain level.</b></p>

<p><li>Under what circumstances would you choose to assign an
application to computers instead of users?</li></p>

<p><b>If the application were required for all
users, regardless of which computer they log on to, you would assign
the application to computers.</b></p>

<p><li>You have deployed an application to all users in your
organization and now need to upgrade the application to the latest
version. For compatibility reasons, you need to allow some users to
continue to use the old version. How would you accomplish this?</li></p>

<p><b>You would deploy the new version as an
optional upgrade. This will allow users to continue to use the previous version until they are
able to upgrade to the new version.</b></p>

<ol>
<p><li>You are the administrator for your organization's network.
Management would like to segregate documents so that marketing
documents are available to everybody on the network while research and
development documents are hidden in a shared folder. How can this be
accomplished?</li></p>

<p><b>This can be accomplished by publishing the
marketing documents and putting the research and development documents
in a hidden shared folder.</b></p>

<p><li>Users are distraught because information they need is scattered
throughout the network on various servers. This forces them to remember
the names of all of the servers and shared folders on the entire
network, which is difficult at best. As the administrator, what can you
do to alleviate this problem?</li></p>

<p><b>Install Dfs on one computer and create
child nodes out of all of the shared folders.</b></p>

<p><li>Your company utilizes a data center for centralized storage and
control of corporate documents. Each user is allocated a certain amount of
storage at the data center and the user's department is charged a monthly
fee for usage. In the past, the data center's strategy has been to
partition the drives on the servers to configure each user's
allocation. This creates problems when the allocations must be changed.
The data center is going to be upgrading all of its servers to Windows
2000. Which feature of Windows 2000 will make setting the allocations
easier?</li></p>

<p><b>Windows 2000 supports disk quotas, which
allow administrators to dynamically change the quotas.</b></p>

<p><li>Users complain that access times to the data center's
servers has increased over the past few months. What maintenance must
be done and when should this be done?</li></p>

<p><b>The disks need to be defragmented. This
should be done at night or during the weekend to minimize the impact on productivity.</b></p>

<p><A NAME="694"><b>Review Questions</b></A></p>

<ol>
<p><li>What are the advantages of using L2TP over using PPTP?</li></p>

<p><b>L2TP supports more types of internetworks,
it supports header compression, and it cooperates with IPSec for
encryption.</b></p>

<p><li>Describe the two new settings that must be configured using the
Network Connection wizard in regard to sharing the connection.</li></p>

<p><b>The settings are whether you want to allow
others who use the computer to use the connection (access to the
connection) and whether you want to allow other computers to access
resources through this port (sharing the connection once it is
established).</b></p>

<p><li>Why are remote access policies stored on the remote access
server and not in Active Directory directory services? Describe a scenario in
which this is beneficial.</li></p>


<p><b>By storing remote access policies on the
remote access server, policies can vary according to the capabilities of the server. For example,
servers having different sizes of modem pools can have different
profile settings for multilinking.</b></p>

<p><li>Which part of a remote access policy is overridden in a
mixed-mode domain? Why? Which parts are still effective?</li></p>

<p><b>The access permission setting on the
policy is overridden in a mixed-mode domain because the user dial-in
setting, Control Access Through Remote Access Policy, is not available.
Policy conditions and profiles are still effective.</b></p>

<p><li>A user in the Sales Group has their dial-in permission set to
Allow Access. The user attempts to connect during business hours using
an ISDN connection, an IP address of 123.45.1.2, and CHAP
authentication. Assuming the following policy is in effect on the
remote access server, will the user's connection attempt be
accepted?</li></p>

<p><b>The profile must still match the settings
of the connection attempt. For example, the profile may specify that
another authentication protocol be used instead of CHAP. If this is the
case, this attempt would be denied.</b></p>

</ol>

<p><A NAME="696"><b>Review Questions</b></a></p>

<ol>
<p><li>What statistical information can you display in the DHCP
console?</li></p>

<p><b>You can use the DHCP console to display
the total number of scopes and addresses on the server, the number of
available addresses versus the number of depleted addresses, and the
number of leases being processed per second.</b></p>

<p><li>You have installed the DHCP Service on a member server in a
domain and have configured a scope, but clients cannot lease an
address. You open the DHCP console and notice that the DHCP server icon
is marked with a red arrow. What does this mean?</li></p>

<p><b>The DHCP Service is not authorized to
operate in the domain. A member of the Enterprise Admins group must
authorize the DHCP server before the DHCP Service will start on the
member server.</b></p>

<p><li>How does a DHCP server determine authorization status within a
workgroup?</li></p>

<p><b>When a DHCP server that is a member of a
workgroup starts, it sends a broadcast message. If the DHCP server
receives a response from a DHCP server in a domain, the DHCP server
that sent the broadcast message assumes that it is unauthorized on the network. If the DHCP server receives a response only from workgroup DHCP servers, the DHCP server
that sent the broadcast message determines that it can operate
normally.</b></p>

<p><li>You have defined a scope for a subnet and want to add additional
IP addresses to the scope. What is the easiest way to complete this
task without having to delete the current scope and create a new
one?</li></p>

<p><b>Create a new scope with the additional
addresses, and then combine the two defined scopes into a
superscope.</b></p>

<p><li>What is the purpose of option classes and what types can you
create?</li></p>

<p><b>You can use DHCP option classes to manage
configuration details for DHCP clients within a scope. Windows 2000
supports two types of option classes: vendor-defined and user-defined
classes.</b></p>

<p><li>If a DHCP client is unable to obtain a lease from a DHCP server,
how can the client still gain limited network functionality?</li></p>

<p><b>The client can use Automatic Private IP
Addressing to generate a unique IP address in the range
169.254.<i>x</i>.<i>y</i>.</b></p>

<p><li>How does the Windows 2000 implementation of WINS provide greater
fault tolerance for the client?</li></p>

<p><b>You can configure a WINS client with as
many as 12 WINS servers. The additional WINS servers provide an extra
measure of fault tolerance in the event that the primary and secondary
WINS servers fail to respond.</b></p>

option is to create a partition. What is the problem and how would you
resolve it?</li></p>

<p><b>You can create striped volumes on dynamic
disks only. The option to create a partition rather than a volume indicates that the disk you are

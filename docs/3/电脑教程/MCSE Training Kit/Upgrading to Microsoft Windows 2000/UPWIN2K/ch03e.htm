<A NAME="137"><H1>Lesson 4: Configuring the DNS Service</H1></A>

<p>Once the DNS Service is installed, you can configure it by using the
DNS snap-in. When you start the DNS snap-in for the first time, a
wizard appears and guides you through the process of configuring the
following options:</p>

<ul>

<p><li>A root name server</li></p>

<p><li>A forward lookup zone</li></p>

<p><li>A reverse lookup zone</li></p>

</ul>

<p>You can also use the DNS snap-in to add additional entries, called
<i>resource records,</i> to the zone database file and to configure the
DNS Service for <i>Dynamic DNS (DDNS),</i> which enables automatic
updates to your zone files by other servers or services.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Configure the DNS Service.</li></p>

<p><li>Configure Dynamic DNS.</li></p>

<p><li>Configure the DHCP Service for DNS.</li></p>
</ul>


<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 45 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>


<A NAME="138"><H2>Configuring a DNS Name Server</H2></A>

<p>When you start the DNS snap-in for the first time, a wizard appears
and provides you the option of configuring the server as a root name
server. Root name servers store the location of name servers with
authority for all the top-level domains in the domain name space (for
example, the com domain). These top-level name servers can then provide
a list of name servers with authority for the second-level domains (for
example, the microsoft.com domain).</p>

<p>Configure a root name server for your intranet only when the
following conditions apply:</p>

<ul>

<p><li>You are not connecting to the Internet. Therefore, the root
level domain is for your intranet only.</li></p>

<p><li>You are using a proxy service to gain access to the
Internet. You are creating the root of your local DNS domain name
space, and the proxy service will do the translation and connection
necessary to access the Internet.</li></p>

</ul>


<A NAME="139"><H2>Creating Forward Lookup Zones</H2></A>

<p>A forward lookup zone enables forward lookup queries. On name
servers, you must configure at least one forward lookup zone for the
DNS Service to work.</p>

<p>To create a new forward look up zone, right-click the Forward Lookup
Zone folder, and a wizard guides you through the process. The wizard
presents the following configuration options: Zone Type, Zone Name, and Zone
Database File Name.</p>


<A NAME="140"><H3>Zone Type</H3></A>

<p>There are three types of zones that you can configure:</p>

<ul>

<p><li><b>Standard Primary.</b> A standard primary zone is the
master copy of a new zone and is stored in a standard text file. You
administer and maintain a primary zone on the computer at which you
create the zone.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Standard Secondary.</b> A standard secondary zone is a
replica of an existing zone. Secondary zones are read-only and are
stored in standard text files. A primary zone must be configured in
order to create a secondary zone. When creating a secondary zone, you
must specify the DNS server, called the master server, which will
transfer zone information to the name server containing the standard
secondary zone. You create a secondary zone to provide redundancy and
to reduce the load on the name server containing the primary zone
database file.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Active Directory Integrated.</b> An Active Directory
Integrated zone is the master copy of a new zone. The zone uses
directory services based on Active Directory technology to store and
replicate zone files.</li></p>

</ul>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
For more information on Active Directory
directory services, see <a href="ch04a.htm">Chapter 4</a>, &quot;Implementing Active Directory Directory Services.&quot;
</blockquote></div>
</p>


<A NAME="141"><H3>Zone Name</H3></A>

<p>Typically, a zone is named after the highest domain in the hierarchy
that the zone encompasses&#8212;that is, the root domain for the zone.
For example, for a zone that encompasses both microsoft.com and
sales.microsoft.com, the zone name would be microsoft.com.</p>


<A NAME="142"><H3>Zone Database File Name</H3></A>

<p>The zone database file name defaults to the zone name with a .DNS
extension; for example, if your zone name is microsoft.com, the default
zone database file name is microsoft.com.dns.</p>

<p>When migrating a zone from another server, you can import the
existing zone file. You must place the existing file in the <i>
systemroot</i>\System32\DNS folder on the target computer before
creating the new zone.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
Traditionally, zone database files are
maintained on servers that are running the DNS Server Service. In
Microsoft Windows 2000, the zone database can be stored in Active
Directory directory services. In this case, the zone is called an <i>
Active Directory-integrated zone</i>.
</blockquote></div>
</p>


<A NAME="143"><H2>Creating Reverse Lookup Zones</H2></A>

<p>A reverse lookup zone enables reverse lookup queries. Reverse lookup
zones are not required. However, a reverse lookup zone is required to
run troubleshooting tools, such as Nslookup, and to record a name
instead of an IP address in Internet Information Services (IIS) log
files.</p>

<p>To create a new reverse lookup zone, right-click the Reverse Lookup
Zone folder in the DNS snap-in, and a wizard guides you through the
process. The wizard presents the configuration options described in the
following sections.</p>


<A NAME="144"><H3>Zone Type</H3></A>

<p>For the zone type, select Standard Primary, Standard Secondary, or
Active Directory Integrated, as defined above.</p>


<A NAME="145"><H3>Network ID and Subnet Mask</H3></A>

<p>Enter your network ID and subnet mask; for example, an IP address of
169.254.16.200 and a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0 would result in a
network ID of 169.254. All reverse lookup queries within the 169.254.
network are resolved in this new zone.</p>


<A NAME="146"><H3>Zone File Name</H3></A>

<p>The network ID and subnet mask determine the default zone file name.
DNS reverses the IP octets and adds the in-addr.arpa suffix. For
example, the reverse lookup zone for the 169.254 network becomes
254.169.in-addr.arpa.dns.</p>

<p>When migrating a zone from another server, you can import the
existing zone file. You must place the existing file in the <i>
systemroot</i>\System32\DNS directory on the target computer before
creating the new zone.</p>


<A NAME="147"><H2>Adding Resource Records</H2></A>

<p>Once you create your zones, you can use the DNS snap-in to add
resource records. Resource records are entries in the zone database
file. To add a resource record, right-click the zone to which you want
to add the record, click New, and then select the type of record that
you want to add.</p>

<p>There are many different types of resource records. When a zone is
created, DNS automatically adds two resource records: the Start of
Authority (SOA) and the Name Server (NS) resource records.</p>

<p>Table 3.4 describes these records, along with the most commonly used
resource records.</p>

<p><b>Table 3.4</b> <i>Types of Resource Records</i></p>

<P>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Resource record </th>
<th>DNS Snap-in name  </th>

<tr>
<td valign="top">SOA  </td>
<td valign="top">Start of Authority  </td>
<td valign="top"> Identifies which name server is the authoritative source of information for data within this domain. The first record in the zone database file must be the Start of Authority record.  </td></tr>

<A NAME="148"><H2>Configuring Dynamic DNS</H2></A>

<p>The DNS Service includes a dynamic update capability called Dynamic
DNS (DDNS). With DNS, when there are changes to the domain for which a
name server has authority, you must manually update the zone database
file on the preferred name server. With DDNS, name servers and clients within a
network automatically update the zone database files.</p>

<A NAME="149"><H3>Dynamic Updates</H3></A>

<p>You can configure a list of authorized servers to initiate dynamic
updates. This list can include secondary name servers, domain
controllers, and other servers that perform network registration for
clients, such as servers running the DHCP Service or the Microsoft
Windows Internet Name Service (WINS).</p>

<A NAME="150"><H3>DDNS and DHCP</H3></A>

<p>DDNS interacts with the DHCP Service to maintain synchronized
name-to-IP-address mappings for network hosts. By default, the DHCP
Service allows clients to add their own A (Host) records to the zone, and the DHCP
Service adds the PTR (Pointer) record to the zone (see Figure 3.6) when the
client leases the IP address. The DHCP Service cleans up both the A
(Host) and PTR records in the zone when the lease expires.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
To send dynamic updates, use the DHCP snap-in to
configure the DHCP server to point to the appropriate DNS
servers.

<p>Use the DNS snap-in to configure a zone for DDNS as follows:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>From the DNS snap-in, right-click the forward or reverse lookup
zone that you want to configure, and then click Properties.</li></p>

<p><li>On the General tab, under Dynamic Update, click one of the
following options:</li></p>


<ul>
<p><li><b>None.</b> Do not allow dynamic updates for this
zone.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Allow Updates.</b> Allow all dynamic DNS update requests
for this zone.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Allow Secure Updates.</b> Allow only dynamic DNS updates
that use secure DNS for this zone.</li></p>
</ul>


<p>The Allow Secure Updates option only appears if the zone type is
Active Directory Integrated. If you click Allow Secure Updates, the

<A NAME="156"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>You can configure the DNS Service by using the DNS snap-in. When you
start the DNS snap-in for the first time, a wizard appears and guides
you through the process of configuring a root name server, a forward
lookup zone, and a reverse lookup zone. Root name servers store the
location of name servers with authority for all the top-level domains
in the domain name space, and the top-level name servers can provide a
list of name servers with authority for the second-level domains. In
the practice portion of this lesson, you configured your DNS Service by
creating a forward lookup zone and a reverse lookup zone.</p>

<p>You can also use the DNS snap-in to add additional entries, called
resource records, to the zone database file and to configure the DNS
Service for Dynamic DNS (DDNS), which enables automatic updates to your
zone files by other servers or services.</p>

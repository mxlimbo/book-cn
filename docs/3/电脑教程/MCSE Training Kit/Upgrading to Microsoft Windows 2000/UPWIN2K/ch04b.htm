<A NAME="168"><H1>Lesson 1: Introduction to Active Directory Directory Services</H1></A>

<p>Before you implement Active Directory directory services, it is
important to understand the overall purpose of a directory service and the role that
Active Directory directory services play in a Windows 2000 network. In
addition, you should know about the key features of Active Directory
directory services, which have been designed to provide flexibility and
ease of administration.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Explain the purpose and function of Active Directory
directory services.</li></p>
</ul>


<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 15 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="169"><H2>Directory Service</H2></A>

<p><i>Active Directory directory services</i> provide a set of
directory services that are included in Windows 2000 Server. A <i>directory service</i> is a network service that identifies all
resources on a network and makes them accessible to users and applications.</p>

<p>Active Directory directory services includes the <i>directory,</i>
which stores information about network resources, as well as all the
services that make the information available and useful. The resources
stored in the directory, such as user data, printers, servers,
databases, groups, computers, and security policies, are known as
objects.</p>

<A NAME="170"><H2>Simplified Administration</H2></A>

<p>Active Directory directory services organize resources
hierarchically in domains. A <i>domain</i> is a logical grouping of
servers and other network resources under a single domain name. The
domain is the basic unit of replication and security in a Windows
2000-based network. Each domain includes one or more domain
controller<i>s.</i> A <i>domain controller</i> is a computer running
Windows 2000 Server that stores a complete replica of the domain
directory.</p>

<p>To simplify administration, all domain controllers in the domain are
peers. You can make changes to any domain controllers, and the updates
are replicated to all other domain controllers in the domain. Active
Directory directory services further simplify administration by
providing a single point of administration for all objects on the
network. Since Active Directory directory services provide a single
point of logon for all network resources, an administrator can log on
to one computer and administer objects on any computer in the
network.</p>

<A NAME="171"><H2>Scalability</H2></A>

<p>In Active Directory directory services, the directory stores
information by organizing the directory into sections that permit
storage for a very large number of objects. As a result, the directory
can expand as an organization grows, allowing you to scale from a small
installation with a few hundred objects to a very large installation
with millions of objects.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
You can distribute directory information across
several computers in a network.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="172"><H2>Open Standards Support</H2></A>

<p>Active Directory directory services, like all directory services,
are primarily a namespace. A <i>namespace</i> is any bounded area in
which a name can be resolved. <i>Name resolution</i> is the process of
translating a name into some object or information that the name
represents.</p>

<p>Active Directory directory services integrate the Internet concept
of a namespace with Windows 2000 directory services. This allows you to
unify and manage the multiple namespaces that now exist in the
heterogeneous software and hardware environments of corporate networks.
Active Directory directory services use Domain Name System (DNS) for its name system and can exchange
information with any application or directory that uses Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP).</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
Active Directory directory services also share
information with other directory services that support LDAP version 2 and version 3, such as
Novell Directory Services (NDS).
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="173"><H3>Domain Name System</H3></A>

<p>The Active Directory namespace is based on the DNS naming scheme,
which allows for interoperability with Internet technologies. Following DNS
standards, the domain name of a child domain is the relative name of
that child domain appended with the name of the parent domain. The name of the child
object in an object hierarchy always contains the name of the parent domain.</p>

<p>Because Active Directory directory services use DNS as its domain
naming and location service, Windows 2000 domain names are also DNS
names. Windows 2000 Server uses Dynamic DNS (DDNS), which enables
clients with dynamically assigned addresses to register directly with a
server running the DNS Service and update the DNS table dynamically.
DDNS eliminates the need for other Internet naming services, such as
Windows Internet Name Service (WINS), in a homogeneous environment.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
For Active Directory directory services and
associated client software to function correctly, you must have
installed and configured the DNS Service.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="174"><H3>Support for LDAP and HTTP</H3></A>

<p>Active Directory directory services further embrace Internet
standards by directly supporting LDAP and HTTP. LDAP is an Internet standard for
accessing directory services, which was developed as a simpler
alternative to the Directory Access Protocol (DAP). For more
information about LDAP, use your Web browser to search on the Internet
for &quot;RFC 1777&quot; and retrieve the text of this Request for Comment. Active Directory directory services support both
LDAP version 2 and version 3. HTTP is the standard protocol for
displaying pages on the World Wide Web. You can display every object in
Active Directory directory services as an HTML page in a Web browser.
Thus, users receive the benefit of the familiar Web-browsing model when
querying and viewing objects in Active Directory directory
services.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
Active Directory directory services use LDAP to
exchange information between directories and applications.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="175"><H2>Support for Standard Name Formats</H2></A>

<p>Active Directory directory services support several common name
formats. Consequently, users and applications can access Active
Directory directory services by using the format with which they are
most familiar. Table 4.1 describes some standard name formats supported
by Active Directory directory services.</p>

<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr>

<td valign="top">RFC 822  </td>

<A NAME="176"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>The three server editions of Windows 2000 provide directory services
based on Active Directory technology. Active Directory directory
services provide a set of directory services that are included in
Windows 2000 Server. A directory service is a network service that
identifies all resources on a network and makes them accessible to
users and applications. Active Directory directory services include the
directory, which stores information about network resources, such as
user data, printers, servers, databases, groups, computers, and
security policies. The directory can scale from a small installation
with a few hundred objects to a very large installation with millions
of objects.</p>

<p>Active Directory directory services use DNS as the domain naming and
location service. Therefore, Windows 2000 domain names are also DNS
names. Windows 2000 Server uses Dynamic DNS (DDNS), so clients with
dynamically assigned addresses can register directly with a server
running the DNS Service and update the DNS table dynamically. Finally,
in a homogeneous environment DDNS eliminates the need for other
Internet naming services, such as WINS.</p>

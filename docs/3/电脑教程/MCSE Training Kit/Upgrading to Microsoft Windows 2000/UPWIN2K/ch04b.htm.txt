<A NAME="168"><H1>Lesson 1: Introduction to Active Directory Directory Services</H1></A>

<p>Before you implement Active Directory directory services, it is
important to understand the overall purpose of a directory service and the role that
Active Directory directory services play in a Windows 2000 network. In
addition, you should know about the key features of Active Directory
directory services, which have been designed to provide flexibility and
ease of administration.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Explain the purpose and function of Active Directory
directory services.</li></p>
</ul>


<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 15 minutes</b></p>

<A NAME="169"><H2>Directory Service</H2></A>

<p><i>Active Directory directory services</i> provide a set of
directory services that are included in Windows 2000 Server. A <i>directory service</i> is a network service that identifies all
resources on a network and makes them accessible to users and applications.</p>

<p>Active Directory directory services includes the <i>directory,</i>
which stores information about network resources, as well as all the
services that make the information available and useful. The resources
stored in the directory, such as user data, printers, servers,
databases, groups, computers, and security policies, are known as
objects.</p>

<A NAME="170"><H2>Simplified Administration</H2></A>

<p>Active Directory directory services organize resources
hierarchically in domains. A <i>domain</i> is a logical grouping of
servers and other network resources under a single domain name. The
domain is the basic unit of replication and security in a Windows
2000-based network. Each domain includes one or more domain
controller<i>s.</i> A <i>domain controller</i> is a computer running
Windows 2000 Server that stores a complete replica of the domain
directory.</p>

<p>To simplify administration, all domain controllers in the domain are
peers. You can make changes to any domain controllers, and the updates
are replicated to all other domain controllers in the domain. Active
Directory directory services further simplify administration by
providing a single point of administration for all objects on the
network. Since Active Directory directory services provide a single
point of logon for all network resources, an administrator can log on
to one computer and administer objects on any computer in the
network.</p>

<A NAME="171"><H2>Scalability</H2></A>

<p>In Active Directory directory services, the directory stores
information by organizing the directory into sections that permit
storage for a very large number of objects. As a result, the directory
can expand as an organization grows, allowing you to scale from a small
installation with a few hundred objects to a very large installation
with millions of objects.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
You can distribute directory information across
several computers in a network.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="172"><H2>Open Standards Support</H2></A>

<p>Active Directory directory services, like all directory services,
are primarily a namespace. A <i>namespace</i> is any bounded area in
which a name can be resolved. <i>Name resolution</i> is the process of
translating a name into some object or information that the name
represents.</p>

<p>Active Directory directory services integrate the Internet concept
of a namespace with Windows

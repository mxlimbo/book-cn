<A NAME="232"><H1>Lesson 1: Creating Organizational Units</H1></A>

<p><i>Organizational units</i> (OUs) are objects (containers) that can
contain other objects, such as user accounts, groups, computer accounts, and other
OUs. OUs cannot contain objects from other domains. OUs can be employed
to organize the objects in Active Directory directory services that
represent your network resources. Employing OUs to contain and organize
the objects in Active Directory directory services is similar to using
folders to contain and organize other folders and files.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Create organizational units.</li></p>

<p><li>Move Active Directory objects.</li></p>
</ul>


<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 15 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="233"><H2>Hierarchical Structure</H2></A>

<p>OUs can contain other OUs, so you can create a logical hierarchy
that represents your company's organizational structure or
administrative needs. If you create a hierarchical structure to
represent your company's organizational structure, you can base it
on your company's departmental or geographical boundaries. For example, if your company has divisions in Brussels, Hong Kong, and New
York, you could create a separate OU for each location.</p>

<p>Setting up an OU hierarchy allows you to delegate administrative
control over a number of user accounts, groups, or other resources. You
delegate administrative control by assigning specific permissions for
OUs, and the objects that they contain, to other individuals and groups. By setting up an OU for each
division in your company, you could then easily manage and delegate control of
each division.</p>

<p>You can also base your OU hierarchy on your company's network
administrative model. For example, at your company there might be one
administrator who is responsible for all user accounts and a different
administrator who is responsible for all printers. In this case, you
would create an OU for users and a different OU for printers.</p>

<A NAME="234"><H2>Permissions</H2></A>

<p>You must have Read, List Contents, and Create Organizational Unit
Objects permissions on the parent container (domain or OU) to create
OUs within that container. List Contents is not specifically required
to create an OU, but you cannot view the newly created OU without it.
By default, members of the Administrators group have the permissions to
create OUs anywhere. To create an OU, you would dothe following:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Open Active Directory Users And Computers from the
Administrative Tools menu.</li></p>

<p>The Active Directory Users And Computers window displays several
default containers directly beneath the domain. Users, Computers, and
Builtin are containers that are not OUs. Because you cannot create OUs
within these containers, or apply Group Policy to them, you should
create different OUs to contain your users and computers.</p>
</ol>
<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
You may need to expand your domain, by clicking
the plus sign to the left of the domain in the console pane, to see the
default containers.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<ol>
<p><li value="2">Right-click the container (domain or OU) in which you want to
create a new OU.</li></p>

<p><li>Point to New, and click Organizational Unit.</li></p>

<p><li>Type in the name of the OU, and click OK.</li></p>
</ol>

<p><img src="images/practic.JPG" width=68 height=54 border="0"></p>

<A NAME="235"><H2>Practice: Creating Organizational Units</H2></A>

<p>In this practice, you will create four OUs: Sales, Administration,
Production, and Servers. Later in this chapter you will create four
user accounts in the Sales OU, and then you will move two of these user
accounts into the Administration OU.</p>

<A NAME="236"><H3>Exercise 1: Creating an Organizational Unit</H3></A>

<p>In this exercise, you will create four organizational units.</p>


<p><li><b>To create an organizational unit</b></li></p>
<ol>
<p><li>Log on as Administrator.</li></p>

<p><li>Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools,
and click Active Directory Users And Computers.</li></p>

<p><li>In the console tree, right-click domain.com, point to New on the
shortcut menu, and then click Organizational Unit.</li></p>


<p>The New Object - Organizational Unit dialog box appears.</p>
</ol>
<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
When you create an OU, the only required
information is the name. The dialog box indicates the location where
the object will be created.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<ol>
<p><li value="4">In the Name box, type <b>Sales</b>, and then click OK.</li></p>

<p><li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 to create an Administration OU, a
Production OU, and a Servers OU.</li></p>

<p><li>Leave the Active Directory Users And Computers window open.</li></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="237"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>Organizational units (OUs) can be used to organize the objects in
Active Directory directory services that represent your network
resources. OUs contain objects, including other OUs, so you can create a logical hierarchy of
OUs to represent your company's organizational structure or
administrative needs. Setting up an OU hierarchy allows you to delegate
administrative control over user accounts, groups, or other resources,
by assigning specific permissions for OUs, and the objects that they
contain, to other individuals and groups.</p>

<p>You must have Read, List Contents, and Create Organizational Unit
Objects permissions on the parent container (domain or OU) to create
OUs within that container. List Contents is not specifically required
to create an OU, but you cannot view the newly created OU without it.
By default, members of the Administrators group have the permissions to
create OUs anywhere.</p>

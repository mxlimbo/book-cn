<A NAME="499"><H1>Lesson 2: New WINS Functionality</H1></A>

<p>Windows 2000 uses DNS as its primary method for
host-name-to-IP-address resolution, but it continues to support Windows
Internet Name Service (WINS) for the same purpose. The Windows 2000
implementation of WINS is an enhanced version of the service provided
in Windows NT. WINS registers NetBIOS names and resolves, or
translates, them to IP addresses. In Windows 2000, WINS includes a
variety of server enhancements, additional client functionality, and an
improved management tool. The result is an easier-to-manage and more
robust solution for mapping NetBIOS names to IP addresses in TCP/IP
networks.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>
<ul>
<p><li>Describe the new WINS server functionality.</li></p>
<p><li>Describe the new WINS client functionality.</li></p>
</ul>
<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 10 minutes</b></p>

<A NAME="500"><H2>WINS Server Functionality</H2></A>

<p>You use WINS in Windows 2000 to support clients and applications
that rely on NetBIOS names for communication. The Windows 2000
implementation of WINS provides a more powerful and easier-to-manage
service for resolving NetBIOS names to IP addresses. These enhancements
to WINS server functionality include persistent connections, manual
tombstoning, and improved management capabilities.</p>

<A NAME="501"><H3>Persistent Connections</H3></A>

<p>Typically WINS servers disconnect from their replication partners
each time replication is completed. When WINS servers are
interconnected through high-speed LAN links, it is usually preferable
to keep connections open rather than closing them after each
replication is completed. Windows 2000 enables you to configure a WINS
server to maintain a persistent connection with one or more replication
partners. This eliminates the overhead of opening and terminating
connections, and it increases the speed of replication.</p>

<A NAME="502"><H3>Manual Tombstoning</H3></A>

<p>In Windows 2000, you can mark a record for deletion and ensure that
the tombstone state of the record is replicated to all WINS servers.
Tombstoning marks the selected records as tombstoned&#8212;that is, they
are marked locally as extinct and immediately released from active use
by the local WINS server. This allows the tombstoned records to remain
present in the server database for purposes of subsequent replication
of these records to other servers. When the tombstoned records are
replicated, the tombstone status is updated and applied by other WINS
servers that store replicated copies of these records. Each replicating
WINS server then updates and tombstones these records.</p>

<p>When all WINS servers complete replication of these records and a
specified length of time&#8212;determined by the Verification
Interval&#8212;has elapsed, the records are automatically removed from
WINS. This prevents the propagation of a copy of an unmarked record to
overwrite a record that has been marked for deletion.</p>

<A NAME="503"><H3>Improved Management Capabilities</H3></A>

<p>The administrative tool for configuring WINS is integrated fully with Microsoft Management Console (MMC), providing a more user-friendly environment for configuring the service and for viewing and managing WINS information. In addition, managing the WINS database in Windows 2000 is easier than in earlier versions of Windows. In the Windows 2000 implementation of WINS, you can do the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Filter and search for specific records</li></p>

<p><li>Delete both dynamic and static records</li></p>

<p><li>Select multiple records and perform an action on them all at
one time</li></p>

<p><li>Check database consistency</li></p>

<p><li>Export WINS data to a comma-delimited text file</li></p>
</ul>


<A NAME="504"><H2>WINS Client Functionality</H2></A>

<p>In addition to improved WINS server functionality, Windows 2000 also
includes enhancements to WINS client functionality, including increased
fault tolerance and dynamic reregistration.</p>

<A NAME="505"><H3>Increased Fault Tolerance</H3></A>

<p>For a WINS client in a Windows 2000 network, you can specify as many
as 12 WINS servers for resolving NetBIOS names to IP addressees. The
additional WINS servers provide an extra measure of fault tolerance in
the event that the primary and secondary WINS servers fail to respond.
If one of the additional WINS servers provides name resolution for a
client, the client caches the name resolution to use the next time that
the primary and secondary WINS servers fail to resolve the name.</p>

<A NAME="506"><H3>Dynamic Reregistration</H3></A>

<p>In Windows 2000, client functionality is improved to allow a client
computer to reregister a NetBIOS name-to-IP-address mapping without the
need for the client computer to restart. This is useful for situations
in which an incorrect static entry exists or in which a WINS database
is restored with an old record, for example. The version ID is updated
on the server to cause the record to be replicated to the other WINS
servers.</p>

<A NAME="507"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>The Windows 2000 implementation of WINS is an enhanced version of
the service that was provided in Windows NT. The enhancements to WINS
server functionality include persistent connections, manual
tombstoning, and improved management capabilities.</p>

<p>You can configure a WINS server to maintain a persistent connection
with one or more replication partners. This eliminates the overhead of
opening and terminating connections, and it increases the speed of
replication.</p>

<p>Manual tombstoning allows you to mark a record for deletion and
ensure that the tombstone state of the record is replicated to all WINS
servers. Each replicating WINS server then updates and tombstones these
records. When all WINS servers complete replication of these records
and a specified length of time&#8212;determined by the Verification
Interval&#8212;has elapsed, the records are automatically removed from
WINS.</p>

<p>Management capabilities are improved in Windows 2000 because the
administrative tool for configuring WINS is fully integrated with
Microsoft Management Console (MMC). This provides a more user-friendly
environment for configuring the service and for viewing and managing
WINS information. In addition, managing the WINS database in Windows
2000 is easier than in earlier versions of Windows because you have the
ability to filter and search for specific records, delete both dynamic
and static records, select multiple records and perform an action on
them all at one time, check database consistency, and export WINS data
to a comma-delimited text file.</p>

<p>One Windows 2000 enhancement to WINS client functionality is
increased fault tolerance. Windows 2000 allows you to specify as many
as 12 WINS servers for resolving NetBIOS to IP addresses and dynamic
reregistration. The additional WINS servers provide an extra measure of
fault tolerance in the event that the primary and secondary WINS
servers fail to respond. A second enhancement to WINS client
functionality is dynamic reregistration. A client computer can
reregister a NetBIOS name-to-IP-address mapping without the need for
the client computer to restart.</p>

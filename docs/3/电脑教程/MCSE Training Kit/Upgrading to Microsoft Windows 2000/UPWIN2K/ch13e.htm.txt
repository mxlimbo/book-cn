<A NAME="643"><H1>Lesson 4: Upgrading Client Operating Systems</H1></A>

<p>You upgrade most Windows client operating systems directly to
Windows 2000 in order to take advantage of the new features offered in
Windows 2000 Professional operating system. However, before upgrading
client operating systems to Windows 2000, you must ensure that the
computer hardware meets the minimum Windows 2000 hardware requirements.
You must also check the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) or test the
computers for hardware compatibility using the Windows 2000
Compatibility tool. You want to ensure the hardware is compatible with
Windows 2000 so that there are no surprises when you start the upgrade
on a large number of client computers.</p>

<p>For client systems that use compatible hardware, you upgrade them
directly to Windows 2000. If there are Windows 95 and 98 client systems
using incompatible or insufficient hardware, you can still take
advantage of the Active Directory functionality on these systems by
using the Windows 2000 Directory Services Client.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Explain how to upgrade older Windows client operating
systems to Windows 2000.</li></p>
</ul>


<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 20 minutes</b></p>

<A NAME="644"><H2>Identifying Client Upgrade Paths</H2></A>

<p>You can upgrade most client computers running older versions of
Windows directly to Windows 2000. However, computers running Windows NT 3.1
or 3.5 require an additional step. Table 13.4 lists the Windows 2000
Professional upgrade paths for client operating systems.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
Windows 2000 Professional also upgrades all
released service packs for Windows NT Workstation 3.51 and
4.0.

<A NAME="645"><H2>Identifying the Minimum Hardware Requirements</H2></A>

<p>Before you upgrade a client computer to Windows 2000 Professional,
make sure that it meets the minimum hardware requirements. Table 13.5
describes these hardware requirements.</p>

<A NAME="646"><H2>Generating a Hardware Compatibility Report</H2></A>

<p>You generate a hardware and software compatibility report using the
Windows 2000 Compatibility tool. This tool runs automatically during
system upgrades, but it is recommended that you run this tool before
beginning the upgrade to identify any hardware and software problems.
This is especially true when upgrading many computers with similar hardware, so compatibility
problems can be fixed before the upgrade begins.</p>

<A NAME="647"><H3>Generating the Report</H3></A>

<p>To generate a compatibility report using the Windows 2000
Compatibility tool, select Run on the Start menu and type <b>Winnt32/checkupgradeonly</b>. 
By using the /checkupgradeonly switch, Winnt32
launches the first part of the Windows 2000 setup program. Instead of
running the entire setup process, it only checks for compatible
hardware and software. This generates a report that you can analyze to
determine what system components are Windows 2000-compatible.</p>

<A NAME="648"><H3>Reviewing the Report</H3></A>

<p>The report generated by running Winnt32 /checkupgradeonly is a text
document, named Winnt32.log. It is created in the installation
directory; you can view it in the tool or save it as a text file.</p>

<p>The report documents the system hardware and software that is
incompatible with Windows 2000. It also identifies whether you need to
obtain an upgrade pack for software installed on the system and any
additional changes or modifications you must make to the system to
maintain functionality in Windows 2000.</p>

<A NAME="649"><H2>Upgrading Compatible Windows 95 and Windows 98 Computers</H2></A>

<p>For client systems that test as compatible with Windows 2000, you
run the Windows 2000 setup program (winnt32.exe) to complete the upgrade
process.</p>

<p>To upgrade Windows 95 and Windows 98 computers, you would do the following:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Run the winnt32.exe command.</li></p>

<p><li>Accept the license agreement.</li></p>

<p><li>If the computer you are upgrading is already a member of a
domain, you must create a computer account in that domain. Windows 95
and 98 clients do not require a computer account, but Windows 2000
Professional clients do.</li></p>

<p><li>You are asked to provide upgrade packs for any applications that
might need them. Upgrade packs update software so it works with Windows
2000. Upgrade packs are available from the software vendor.</li></p>

<p><li>You are prompted to upgrade to NTFS. Select the upgrade if you
do not plan to set up the client computer to dual boot.</li></p>

<p><li>The Windows 2000 Compatibility tool runs, generating a report.
If the report shows the computer as Windows 2000-compatible, continue
with the upgrade. If the report shows the computer to be incompatible
with Windows 2000, terminate the upgrade process.</li></p>

<p><li>The upgrade finishes without further user intervention. After
the upgrade is complete, you must enter the password for the local
computer Administrator account.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>If your computer is Windows 2000-compatible, it is now upgraded and
is a member of your domain. If your computer is not Windows
2000-compatible, you must upgrade your hardware, if possible, or you can install the
Directory Service Client.</p>

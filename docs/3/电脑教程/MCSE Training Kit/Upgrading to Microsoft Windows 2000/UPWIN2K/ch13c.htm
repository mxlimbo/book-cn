<A NAME="615"><H1>Lesson 2: Establishing the Root Domain</H1></A>

<p>The root domain in Active Directory directory services is the top
branch of the enterprise namespace. Other domains in the tree are subdomains below
the root domain. All other domains refer to the root domain as the root
of the enterprise. If you fail to plan and establish the root domain
correctly, you can compromise your network structure from the
beginning. For example, if you use the incorrect root name, all child
domains will inherit this incorrect name as part of their name.</p>

<p>After you have planned your network upgrade, the first step in
upgrading your network to Windows 2000 is to establish the root domain.
There are two options for establishing the root domain:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Migrate an existing Windows NT 4.0 domain to a Windows 2000
root domain.</li></p>

<p><li>Create a new Windows 2000 root domain.</li></p>
</ul>


<p>The option you use depends on the domain model you use in your
existing Windows NT 4.0 network.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Determine whether to migrate an existing domain to a root
domain or to create a new root domain for a Windows 2000 network.</li></p>
</ul>


<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 10 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="616"><H2>Migrating an Existing Domain to a New Root Domain</H2></A>

<p>You upgrade an existing domain to serve as the new root domain when
your existing Windows NT 4.0 network uses one of these two domain
models:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Single domain model</li></p>

<p><li>Single master domain model</li></p>
</ul>


<p>In these two models, user accounts and global groups are created in
a single domain, called the master domain. In the single master domain model,
only computer accounts and resources are created in the resource domains.
The resource domains trust the master domain.</p>

<A NAME="617"><H3>Upgrading the Master Domain</H3></A>

<p>When you upgrade the master domain to Active Directory directory
services first, it forms the root of a new domain tree. In the single
master domain model, you then upgrade the resource domains to become
child domains of the root domain.</p>

<A NAME="618"><H3>Migrating Objects to Active Directory Directory Services</H3></A>

<p>The following objects migrate from Windows NT to Active Directory
directory services during an upgrade:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>User accounts migrate to the users container.</li></p>

<p><li>Computer accounts migrate to the computers container.</li></p>

<p><li>Global groups migrate to the users container.</li></p>

<p><li>Local groups migrate to the users container.</li></p>

<p><li>Built-in groups migrate to the built-in container.</li></p>

<p><li>Permissions for the NTFS file system files, printers, and
local groups.</li></p>
</ul>


<A NAME="619"><H3>Creating Organizational Units</H3></A>

<p>In Windows NT 4.0, administrators used domains to manage users and
delegate administrative control. In Windows 2000, administrators use
OUs to organize computers and users, delegate authority, and manage
group policy.</p>

<p>Your OU structure can model your organizational, geopolitical, or
administrative structure. Combine objects into a logical hierarchy of
OUs that represent either of the following for your company:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Organizational model.</b> This model is based on
departmental or geographical boundaries. For example, company A is
organized into departments and has a research department, a development
department, and a sales department. In this company, the administrators
use different computer settings and deploy different applications for
each department. You would create a Research OU, a Development OU, and
a Sales OU, and you would place users and computers into these OUs as
relevant. You would then use group policy to administer these settings
and distribute applications.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Administrative model.</b> This model is based on which
administrators are responsible for managing specific users and resources across the
network. For example, company B uses separate IS managers for each location
in the company. The IS managers in each location manage the users and
computers in that location. You would create organizational units for
each location and move the users and computers into these OUs. You
would then delegate administrative control of those OUs to the appropriate IS
managers.</li></p>
</ul>


<p>To improve management and administration of users and computers in
your company, examine your organizational structure, and then create
OUs in the upgraded master domain to meet your business
requirements.</p>

<A NAME="620"><H2>Creating a New Root Domain</H2></A>

<p>You create a new root domain for your Windows 2000 network when your
existing Windows NT 4.0 network uses one of the following two domain
models:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Multiple master domain model</li></p>

<p><li>Complete trust model</li></p>
</ul>


<p>With these models, more than one domain contains user accounts and
global groups. Therefore, you must establish a new root domain, and
then upgrade the master domains to be children of this new root
domain.</p>

<p>You can also upgrade these domain models to a forest with multiple
disjointed namespaces. However, this would only be a viable option in
an organization with many separate companies that had little need for
intercommunication.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
You must have two or more domain controllers in
the root domain of your organization. If you only have one domain
controller in the root domain of your organization and that domain controller fails after you migrate
other child domains, you cannot run the Active Directory Installation
wizard again to create a new domain controller for the root domain. In
case of a failure such as this, you would have to restore the domain
controller from backup or re-create your entire Active Directory
structure.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="621"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>The root domain in Active Directory directory services is the top
branch of the enterprise namespace. All other domains in the tree are
subdomains below the root domain and refer to the root domain as the
root of the enterprise. If you fail to plan and establish the root
domain correctly, you can compromise your network structure from the
beginning.</p>

<p>After you have planned your network upgrade, the first step in
upgrading your network to Windows 2000 is to establish the root domain.
You can migrate an existing Windows NT 4.0 domain to a Windows 2000
root domain, or you can create a new Windows 2000 root domain. You
upgrade an existing domain to serve as the new root domain when your
existing Windows NT 4.0 network uses the single domain model or the
single master domain model.</p>

<p>You create a new root domain for your Windows 2000 network when
your existing Windows NT 4.0 network uses either the multiple master domain
model or the complete trust model. With these models, more than one
domain contains user accounts and global groups. Therefore, you must
establish a new root domain, and then upgrade the master domains to be children of this
new root domain.</p>

<A NAME="395"><H1>Lesson 3: Using NTFS Special Access Permissions</H1></A>

<p>The standard NTFS permissions generally provide all of the access
control that you need to secure your resources. However, there are
instances where the standard NTFS permissions do not provide the
specific level of access that you want to assign to users. To create
the specific level of access, you can assign NTFS special access
permissions. When you assign special access permissions to folders, you
can choose where to apply the permissions down the tree to subfolders
and files.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Explain how to use NTFS special permissions.</li></p>

<p><li>Assign the Take Ownership permission and take ownership of a
folder or file.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 25 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="396"><H2>Understanding NTFS Special Access Permissions</H2></A>

<p>Special access permissions provide you with a finer degree of
control for assigning access to resources. The special access
permissions, when combined, constitute the standard NTFS permissions.
For example, the standard Read permission includes the Read Data, Read
Attributes, Read Permissions, and Read Extended Attributes special
access permissions.</p>

<p>Two of the special access permissions are especially useful for
managing access to files and folders: Change Permissions and Take
Ownership.</p>

<A NAME="397"><H3>Change Permission</H3></A>

<p>You can give other administrators and users the ability to change
permissions for a file or folder without giving them the Full Control
permission over the file or folder. In this way, the other
administrator or user cannot delete or write to the file or folder but
can assign permissions to the file or folder.</p>

<p>To give administrators the ability to change permissions, assign
Change Permissions to the Administrators group for the file or
folder.</p>

<A NAME="398"><H3>Take Ownership</H3></A>

<p>You can transfer ownership of files and folders from one user
account or group to another user account or group. You can give someone
the ability to take ownership and, as an administrator, you can take
ownership of a file or folder.</p>

<p>The current owner or any user with the Full Control permission can
assign the Full Control standard permission or the Take Ownership
special access permission to another user account or group, allowing
the user or a member of the group to take ownership.</p>

<p>Members of the Administrators group have the Take Ownership special
access permission. This gives administrators the ability to take
ownership of a file or folder, regardless of the other permissions that
are assigned to the file or folder. If an administrator takes
ownership, the Administrators group becomes the owner and any member of
the Administrators group can change the permissions for the file or
folder and assign the Take Ownership permission to another user account
or group.</p>

<p>You cannot <i>assign</i> anyone ownership of a file or folder. The
owner of a file, an administrator, or anyone with the Full Control
permission, can assign Take Ownership permission to a user account or
group, allowing the user or group member to take ownership. However, to
become the owner of a file or folder, a user or group member with the
Take Ownership permission must explicitly take ownership of the file or
folder.</p>

<p>To take ownership of a file or folder, open the Properties dialog
box for the file or folder in Windows Explorer, and select the Security
tab. On the Security tab, click the Advanced button. The Access Control
Settings dialog box appears. In the Access Control Settings dialog box,
on the Owner tab, in the Change Owner To list, select your name. Select
the Replace Owner On Subcontainers And Objects check box to take ownership of all subfolders and files that are contained within the folder.</p>

<A NAME="399"><H2>Setting Special NTFS Permissions</H2></A>

<p>If an employee leaves the company, an administrator can take
ownership of the employee's files and assign the Take Ownership
permission to another employee, and then that employee can take
ownership of the previous employee's files. To set the Change
Permissions or Take Ownership permissions, in the Properties dialog box
for a file or folder, on the Security tab, click the Advanced button.
In the Access Control Settings dialog box for a file or folder, on the
Permissions tab, select the user account or group for which you want to
apply NTFS special access permissions (see Figure 8.4).</p>

<A NAME="400"><H2>Understanding NTFS Permissions Inheritance</H2></A>

<p>By default, permissions that you assign to the parent folder are
inherited by and propagated to the subfolders and files that are
contained in the parent folder. However, you can prevent permissions
inheritance.</p>

<A NAME="401"><H3>Allowing Permissions Inheritance</H3></A>

<p>Files and subfolders inherit permissions from their parent folder.
Whatever permissions you assign to the parent folder also apply to
subfolders and files that are contained in the parent folder. When you
assign NTFS permissions to give access to a folder, you assign
permissions for the folder and for any existing files and subfolders,
as well as for any new files and subfolders that are created in the
folder.</p>

<A NAME="402"><H3>Preventing Permissions Inheritance</H3></A>

<p>You can prevent permissions that are assigned to a parent folder
from being inherited by subfolders and files that are contained in the folder. The
folder at which you prevent permissions inheritance becomes the new
parent folder, and permissions that are assigned to this folder will be
inherited by the subfolders and files that are contained in it.</p>

<A NAME="403"><H2>Practice: Taking Ownership of a File</H2></A>

<p>In this practice, you will observe the effects of taking ownership
of a file. To do this, you will determine permissions for a file,
assign the Take Ownership permission to a user account, and then take
ownership as that user.</p>

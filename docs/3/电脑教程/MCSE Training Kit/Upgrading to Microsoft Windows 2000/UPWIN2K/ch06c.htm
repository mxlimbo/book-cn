<A NAME="304"><H1>Lesson 2: Applying Group Policy</H1></A>

<p>The first step in applying group policy is creating GPOs. Once you
create or link a GPO, you should verify that the appropriate
permissions are set. To successfully apply group policy you also must
understand how GPOs are applied as well as the order of inheritance for GPOs, and be able to modify how
they are applied and inherited.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Apply group policy by creating a GPO, managing the access
permissions of GPOs, and managing the inheritance of GPOs through the
structure of Active Directory directory services.</li></p>
</ul>


<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 20 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="305"><H2>Creating a GPO</H2></A>

<p>The steps for creating a GPO or linking an existing GPO to an Active
Directory container are shown in Figure 6.1; these steps are explained
below.</p>

<p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 6.1</b> <i>Creating a GPO</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<ol>
<p><li>Open the Active Directory Users and Computers tool.</li></p>

<p><li>Right-click the Active Directory container (domain or OU) for
which you want to create a GPO, and then click Properties.</li></p>

<p><li>On the Group Policy tab, choose New to create a new GPO, or
choose Add to link an existing GPO.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>The GPO that you create or link is displayed in the list of GPOs
that are linked to the Active Directory container.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
To create a GPO that is linked to a site, open
the Active Directory Sites And Services snap-in and follow the previous procedure. By default, the
site GPO is stored in the domain to which the creator of the GPO
belongs. You can set another domain for the storage location when you
create the site GPO. To change the storage location, click the Add
button on the Group Policy tab, click the All tab in the Add A Group
Policy Object Link dialog box, change the domain in the Look In box, and then create the GPO. You must be a
member of the Enterprise Admins group to create a site GPO.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="306"><H2>Managing GPO Permissions</H2></A>

<p>After you create or link a GPO, you should verify that the
appropriate permissions are set. The group policy settings in a GPO
affect only users or computers that have the Apply Group Policy and
Read permissions for that GPO. The default permissions are shown in Table 6.1.</p>

<p><b>Table 6.1</b> <i>Default Permissions for a GPO</i></p>
<P>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Group or account  </th>
<th>Default permissions  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Authenticated Users  </td>
<td valign="top">Read<br>  Apply Group Policy  </td></tr>

<A NAME="307"><H3>Modifying Permissions</H3></A>

<p>To modify permissions for a GPO, you would do the following:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Open the Properties dialog box for the Active Directory
container that is associated with the GPO.</li></p>

<p><li>On the Group Policy tab, select a GPO link and click
Properties.</li></p>

<p><li>On the Security tab of the GPO's Properties dialog box, add
or remove the Apply Group Policy permission for the desired objects by
selecting or clearing the Allow check box (see Figure 6.2).</li></p>
</ol>

<!--caption--><b>Figure 6.2</b> <i>Modifying permissions for a GPO</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
When you set permissions on a GPO, select or
clear the check boxes in the Allow column, rather than using the Deny
column. Denying a permission always takes precedence over allowing a
permission, and you might have inconsistent results if you use the Deny
column.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="308"><H3>Filtering the Scope of a GPO</H3></A>

<p>You can filter the scope of a GPO by creating security groups and
then assigning the Apply Group Policy and Read permissions to selected
groups or removing the permissions from selected groups.</p>

<A NAME="309"><H3>Delegating Control with Permissions</H3></A>

<p>Members of the Domain Admins group can use permissions to identify
which groups of administrators can modify policies in GPOs. To do this,
the network administrator creates groups of administrators (for
example, the Marketing Administrators group) and then assigns Read and Write permissions to
selected GPOs for these groups. This allows the member of the Domain
Admins group to delegate control of the GPO. Administrators with Read
and Write permissions to a GPO can control all aspects of the GPO.</p>

<A NAME="310"><H2>Managing Group Policy Inheritance</H2></A>

<p>In addition to controlling the Read and Apply Group Policy
permissions of a GPO, you can manage group policy by modifying
inheritance options, disabling all or part of a GPO, and deleting a
GPO.</p>

<A NAME="311"><H3>Modifying Inheritance Options</H3></A>

<p>You can modify the inheritance of a GPO by setting No Override, by
changing the processing order of multiple GPOs, and by blocking Policy
Inheritance.</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>No Override.</b> Use this option to prevent child
containers from overriding a GPO that is set in a higher level GPO.
This option is useful for enforcing group policy that represents
companywide rules. The No Override option is set on a per-GPO basis.
You may set this option on one or more GPOs as required. When more than one GPO is set as No Override, the GPO
that is highest in the Active Directory hierarchy with a No Override
option always takes precedence over the Block Policy Inheritance
option. To set this option, on the Group Policy tab, click Options, and
then select the No Override check box.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Changing the processing order of multiple GPOs.</b> The
Group Policy tab lists the GPOs that are linked to the site, domain, or
OU, and these GPOs are processed in order from bottom to top as listed
on this tab. If incompatible group policy settings exist in different
GPOs in the same site, domain, or OU, the group policy setting that is
contained in the GPO that is higher in the list overrides the group
policy settings that are contained in any other GPO. To change the
order, select a GPO in the list and then use the Up button or the Down
button to move the GPO within the list.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Block Policy Inheritance.</b> Use this option to allow a
child container to block policy inheritance from parent containers.
This option is useful when an OU requires unique group policy settings.
The Block Policy Inheritance option applies to all GPOs from parent
containers. In the case of a conflict, the No Override option always
takes precedence over the Block Policy Inheritance option. To set this
option, on the Group Policy tab, select the Block Policy Inheritance
check box.</li></p>
</ul>


<A NAME="312"><H3>Disabling GPOs</H3></A>

<p>You can disable the user settings of a GPO, the computer settings of
a GPO, or the entire GPO.</p>

<p>When you create a GPO that only contains group policy settings for
users, you should disable the computer settings to speed up the
processing of the GPO. Conversely, when you create a GPO that only
contains group policy settings for computers, you should disable the
user settings. To disable the user or computer settings of a GPO, on
the Group Policy tab, click Properties; click the General tab; and then
click the Disable User Configuration Settings check box or the Disable Computer Configuration Settings check box (see Figure 6.3).</p>

<p>
<img src="images/F06UP03.JPG" width=404 height=448 border="0">
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 6.3</b> <i>Disabling user or computer configuration settings</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>You can disable an entire GPO, which prevents it from being applied
to the selected container. Disabling the GPO only affects its application to
that container and any containers that inherit it. The GPO can still be
linked to other containers and continues to apply to any containers to which it is
linked, unless it is disabled in those containers as well. To disable the GPO, on the
Group Policy tab, click Options and then click Disabled (see Figure
6.4).</p>

<A NAME="313"><H3>Deleting GPOs</H3></A>

<p>You can use Delete on the Group Policy tab to delete a GPO from a
container. If the GPO is also associated with another Active Directory container,
Delete removes the link from the selected container. If the GPO is only
associated with the selected container, Delete permanently deletes the
GPO.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
Before you delete a GPO, you can verify which
containers a GPO is linked to on the Links tab of the Properties dialog
box for that GPO.

<A NAME="314"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>The first step in applying group policy is creating GPOs. Use Active
Directory Users And Computers to create a GPO, or to create a GPO that
is linked to a site, use Active Directory Sites And Services. After you
create or link a GPO, you should verify that the appropriate
permissions are set. The group policy settings in a GPO affect only
users or computers that have the Apply Group Policy and Read
permissions for that GPO. In addition to controlling the Read and Apply
Group Policy permissions of a GPO, you can manage group policy by
modifying inheritance options, disabling all or part of a GPO, and
deleting a GPO.</p>

<A NAME="512"><H1>Lesson 1: Introduction to Disk Management</H1></A>

<p>If you have free space on your hard disk, you need to partition and
format it so that you can store data on that part of the disk. In
addition, if you have more than one hard disk, each disk will also have
to be partitioned and formatted so that you can store data on it.
Windows 2000 supports two types of disk storage: basic storage and
dynamic storage. A physical disk must be either basic or dynamic; you
cannot use both storage types on one disk. You can, however, use both
types of disk storage in a multidisk system.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>
<ul>
<p><li>Describe disk management concepts.</li></p>
</ul>
<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 25 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="513"><H2>Understanding Basic Storage</H2></A>

<p>Before Windows 2000, the only type of disk storage available was the
industry standard that is referred to in Windows 2000 as <i>basic
storage</i>. It dictates the division of a hard disk into partitions. A
<i>partition</i> is a portion of the disk that functions as a
physically separate unit of storage. Windows 2000 recognizes primary
and extended partitions. A disk that is initialized for basic storage
is called a <i>basic disk</i>. A basic disk can contain primary partitions and
extended partitions with logical drives. For Windows 2000, basic
storage is the default, so all disks are basic disks until you convert
them to dynamic storage. Basic storage in Windows 2000 provides compatibility with disk partitions and sets created with Microsoft Windows NT 4.0.</p>

<A NAME="514"><H2>Partitioning Basic Disks</H2></A>

<p>In Windows 2000, you can create, delete, and format partitions
without having to restart your computer to make the changes effective.
When you create partitions, you should leave a minimum of 1 megabyte
(MB) of unallocated space on the disk in case you decide later to
convert the basic disk to a dynamic disk. The conversion process
creates a 1 MB region at the end of the dynamic disk in which it stores
a database that tracks the configuration of all dynamic disks in the
computer.</p>

<p>You can divide a basic disk into <i>primary</i> and <i>extended</i>
partitions. This allows you to separate different types of information,
such as user data on one partition and applications on another. A basic
disk can contain up to four primary partitions, or up to three primary
partitions and one extended partition, for a maximum of four
partitions, and only one partition can be an extended partition (see
Figure 11.1.)</p>

<!--caption--><b>Figure 11.1</b> <i>Partition types</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<A NAME="515"><H3>Primary Partitions</H3></A>

<p>Windows 2000 can use one of the primary partitions to start the
computer. The computer looks for the boot files to start the operating
system on the primary partition that has been designated as the <i>
active</i> partition. Only a primary partition can be marked as the
active partition and only one partition on a single hard disk can be
active at a time. To dual boot Windows 2000 with Microsoft Windows 95
or MSDOS, the active partition must be formatted as file allocation
table (FAT) because Windows 95 cannot read a partition formatted as
FAT32 or NT file system (NTFS).</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
Microsoft Windows 98 and Microsoft Windows 95
Operating System Release 2 (OSR2), an enhanced version of Windows 95, can read
partitions formatted with FAT32. To dual boot with Windows 98 or
Windows 95 OSR2, the active partition must be formatted as FAT or
FAT32.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="516"><H3>Extended Partitions</H3></A>

<p>There can be only one extended partition on a hard disk, so it is
important to include all remaining free space in the extended partition. Unlike
primary partitions, you do not format extended partitions or assign
drive letters to them. You divide extended partitions into segments.
Each segment is a <i>logical drive</i>. You assign a drive letter to
each logical drive and format it with a file system.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
The Windows 2000 <i>system partition</i> is the
active partition that contains the hardware-specific files required to
load the operating system. The Windows 2000 <i>boot partition</i> is
the primary partition or logical drive where the operating system files
are installed. The boot partition and the system partition can be the
same partition. However, the system partition <i>must</i> be on the
active partition, typically drive C, while the system partition can be
on another primary partition, or on an extended partition.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="517"><H2>Introducing Dynamic Storage</H2></A>

<p>A disk that you convert from basic storage to dynamic storage is a
<i>dynamic disk</i>. Only Windows 2000 supports dynamic disks. Dynamic
disks contain dynamic volumes, which can consist of a portion, or
portions, of one or more physical disks. A dynamic disk can contain
simple volumes, spanned volumes, mirrored volumes, striped volumes, and
redundant array of independent disks-5 (RAID-5) volumes. These volume types will be discussed shortly.</p>

<p>Dynamic storage has several advantages:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Volumes can be extended to include noncontiguous space on
the available disks.</li></p>

<p><li>There is no limit on the number of volumes you can create
per disk.</li></p>

<p><li>Disk configuration information is stored on the disk, rather
than in the registry or in other places where it might not be
accurately updated. The disk configuration information is also
replicated to all other dynamic disks so that one disk failure will not
obstruct access to data on other disks.</li></p>
</ul>


<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
Removable storage devices contain primary
partitions only. You cannot create extended partitions, logical drives, or dynamic volumes on
removable storage devices. You cannot mark a primary partition on a removable
storage device as active.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="518"><H2>Choosing a Volume Type on Dynamic Disks</H2></A>

<p>You can convert basic disks to dynamic storage and then create
Windows 2000 volumes. Consider which volume type best suits your needs
for efficient use of disk space, performance, and fault tolerance. <i>
Fault tolerance</i> is the ability of a computer or operating system to
respond to a catastrophic event without loss of data. In Windows 2000, mirrored volumes and RAID-5 volumes are fault
tolerant.</p>

<A NAME="519"><H3>Simple Volume</H3></A>

<p>A <i>simple volume</i> contains disk space from a single disk and
provides no fault tolerance. A simple volume can be mirrored to provide
fault tolerance.</p>

<A NAME="520"><H3>Spanned Volume</H3></A>

<p>A <i>spanned volume</i> includes disk space from two or more disks
(up to 32 disks)<i>.</i> Windows 2000 writes data to a spanned volume
on the first disk, completely filling the space, and continues in this
manner through each disk that you include in the spanned volume. A
spanned volume provides no fault tolerance. If any disk in a spanned
volume fails, the data in the entire volume is lost. Spanned volumes in
Windows 2000 are similar to volume sets in Windows NT 4.0.</p>

<A NAME="521"><H3>Mirrored Volume</H3></A>

<p>A <i>mirrored volume</i> consists of two identical copies of a
simple volume, each on a separate hard disk. Mirrored volumes provide
fault tolerance in the event of hard disk failure. Mirrored volumes in
Windows 2000 are similar to mirror sets in Windows NT 4.0.</p>

<A NAME="522"><H3>Striped Volume</H3></A>

<p>A <i>striped volume</i> combines areas of free space from multiple
hard disks, up to 32, into one logical volume. In a striped volume,
Windows 2000 optimizes performance by adding data to all disks at the
same rate. If a disk in a striped volume fails, the data in the entire
volume is lost. Striped volumes in Windows 2000 are similar to stripe
sets in Windows NT 4.0.</p>

<A NAME="523"><H3>RAID-5 Volume</H3></A>

<p>A <i>RAID-5</i> volume is a fault-tolerant striped volume. Windows
2000 adds a parity-information stripe to each disk partition in the volume.
Windows 2000 uses the parity-information stripe to reconstruct data
when a physical disk fails. A minimum of three hard disks is required
in a RAID-5 volume. RAID-5 volumes are similar to stripe sets with
parity in Windows NT 4.0.</p>

<p>Creating multiple partitions or volumes on a single hard disk allows
you to efficiently organize data for tasks such as backing up. For
example, partition one-third of a hard disk for the operating system,
one-third for applications, and one-third for data. Then, when you back
up your data, you can back up the entire partition instead of just a
specific folder.</p>

<A NAME="524"><H2>Choosing a File System</H2></A>

<p>Windows 2000 supports the NTFS, FAT, and FAT32 file systems. Use
NTFS when you require a partition to have file and folder-level
security, disk compression, disk quotas, or encryption. Windows 2000
and Windows NT are the only operating systems that can access data on a
local hard disk that is formatted with NTFS. If you plan to promote a
server to a domain controller, format the installation (boot) partition
with NTFS.</p>

<p>FAT and FAT32 allow access by, and compatibility with, other
operating systems. To dual boot Windows 2000 and another operating
system, format the system partition with either FAT or FAT32. FAT and
FAT32 do not offer many of the features that are supported by NTFS, for
example file-level security. Therefore, in most situations, you should
format the hard disk with NTFS. The only reason to use FAT or FAT32 is
for dual booting.</p>

<A NAME="525"><H2>Introducing the Disk Management Tool</H2></A>

<p>You can access the Disk Management tool in the Computer Management
console. You use the Disk Management tool to configure and manage
your storage space and perform all your disk management tasks. Because
the Disk Management tool is an MMC snap-in, it uses the interface, menu
structure, and shortcut menus you are familiar with from other MMC
snap-ins (see Figure 11.2).</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 11.2</b> <i>The Disk Management tool</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>You can also create a separate console for the Disk Management tool.
When you create a separate console and add the Disk Management snap-in,
you have the option of focusing the tool on the local computer or on
another computer for remote administration of that computer. As a member of the
Administrators or Server Operators group, you can manage disks on a
computer running Windows 2000 that is a member of the domain or a
trusted domain from any other computer running Windows 2000 in the
network.</p>

<p>Disk Management displays the storage system of the computer in
either a graphical view or in a list. Important operating information
about the disks, partitions, and volumes in your computer is contained
in the Properties dialog boxes.</p>

<A NAME="526"><H3>Disk Properties</H3></A>

<p>To view disk properties in Disk Management, select a disk,
right-click it, and then click Properties. Table 11.1 describes the

<A NAME="528"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>Windows 2000 supports basic storage and dynamic storage. A disk
initialized for basic storage is called a basic disk and can contain
primary partitions, extended partitions, and logical drives. All
versions of Microsoft Windows, MS-DOS, and Windows 2000 support basic
storage. For Windows 2000, basic storage is the default, so all disks are basic disks unless you convert them to
dynamic storage.</p>

<p>Dynamic storage creates a single partition that includes the entire
disk. You divide dynamic disks into volumes, which can consist of a portion, or
portions, of one or more physical disks. A dynamic disk can contain
simple volumes, spanned volumes, mirrored volumes, striped volumes, and
RAID-5 volumes. Dynamic storage has several advantages over basic storage: volumes can
be extended to include noncontiguous space on the available disks; there
is no limit on the number of volumes you can create per disk; and disk
configuration information is stored on the disk and replicated to all
other dynamic disks, so that one disk failure will not obstruct access
to data on the other disks.</p>

<p>After you create partitions on a basic disk or create volumes on a
dynamic disk, you must format the partition or volume with a specific
file system. Windows 2000 supports NTFS, FAT, or FAT32. The file system
that you choose affects disk operations. This includes how you control
user access to data, how data is stored, hard disk capacity, and which
operating systems can gain access to the data on the hard disk. Use the
Disk Management tool to configure and manage your network storage
space.</p>

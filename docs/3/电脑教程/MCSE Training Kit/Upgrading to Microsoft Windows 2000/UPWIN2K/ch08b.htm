<p>Microsoft Windows 2000 allows file resources to be shared from the
computer or published to directory services based on Active Directory
technology. Publishing to Active Directory directory services makes
resources easier to find because all the published shares can be
centrally accessed. This lesson introduces the Computer Management
administrative tool and Active Directory tools necessary to publish
file resources in Windows 2000.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Publish shared folders in Active Directory directory
services.</li></p>

<p><li>Differentiate between published folders and shared
folders.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 40 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="378"><H2>Computer Management</H2></A>

<p>The Computer Management tool is an administrator's primary
computer configuration tool. It uses two panes&#151;the console tree
(left pane) for navigating and tool selection and the details pane
(right pane) for displaying the selection's data or attributes. All
of the Computer Management features can be used from a remote computer,
so an administrator can troubleshoot and configure a computer from any
other computer on the same network. Computer Management provides access to the primary Windows 2000 administrative tools for viewing events, creating shares, and managing devices (see Figure 8.1).</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 8.1</b> <i>The Computer Management tool</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>There are three nodes in the console tree. In tree structures, a <i>
node</i> is a location on the tree that has links to one or more items
below it. Each of the three nodes in the console tree provides access
to a set of management tools.</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>System Tools.</b> This node contains administrative tools
including Event Viewer, Shared Folders, and Device Manager.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Storage.</b> This node contains the tools that relate to
disks, including Disk Management and Logical Drives.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Services And Applications.</b> This node is dynamically
populated depending on the computer that the tools are focused on.
Examples of tools in the Services And Applications node include
Services, Internet Information Services, and Indexing Service.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="379"><H2>Shared Folders</H2></A>

<p>On computers running Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000, you share
folders to provide network users with access to file resources. When a folder
is shared, users can connect to the folder over the network and gain
access to the files that it contains, provided that they have the
appropriate permissions.</p>

<p>You can use Windows Explorer or Computer Management to share a
folder. Sharing a folder using Windows Explorer is the same in Windows
2000 as in Windows NT 4.0. To use Computer Management to share a
folder, right-click the My Computer icon on the desktop, and then click Manage. In the
Computer Management console tree, expand System Tools and click Shared
Folders. Under Shared Folders, click Shares and all of the folders that
are shared from the local computer appear in the details pane. You add
a new shared folder by right-clicking the details pane and clicking New File Share. You can share an
existing folder, or you can create and share a new folder. To complete
the process of sharing a folder, follow the instructions in the wizard
that appears. The new shared folder will then appear in the details
pane of Computer Management.</p>

<A NAME="380"><H2>Published Folders</H2></A>

<p>Network administrators face many challenges in managing large,
complex networks. One challenge is providing information about network
resources to authorized users on a network, while at the same time
keeping this information secure from unauthorized access. Another
challenge is making it easy to find information on the network.</p>

<p>Active Directory directory services is designed to meet these
challenges by storing information about network objects, offering rapid
information retrieval, and providing security mechanisms that control
access. Resources that you can make available (publish) in Active
Directory directory services include objects, such as users, computers,
printers, files, folders, and network services. Publishing information
about shared resources, such as folders, files, and printers, makes it
easy for users to find these resources on the network.</p>

<p>In Windows 2000, you can publish information about printers and
shared folders in Active Directory directory services by using the
Active Directory Users and Computers tool. To make a file resource
accessible, you first share the resource and then publish the resource
in the Active Directory database.</p>

<p>For example, to publish a folder, from the Administrative Tools
menu, start the Active Directory Users and Computers tool. In the
console tree, right-click the domain in which you want to publish the
shared folders, point to New, and then click Shared Folder. You will be
prompted for the Shared Folder Name and Network Path (see Figure 8.2).
Enter the requested information and click OK. The shared folder name
appears in the domain.</p>

<A NAME="381"><H2>Practice: Sharing and Publishing Folders</H2></A>

<p>In this practice, you will share a folder using Windows Explorer.
Then you will share and publish a folder using Computer Management. Finally,
you will observe the difference between a published folder and a shared
folder.</p>

<A NAME="382"><H3>Exercise 1: Sharing Folders</H3></A>

<p>In this exercise, you will use first Windows Explorer and then the
Computer Management tool to share a folder on a Windowsç‡¦T file system

<A NAME="249"><H1>Lesson 3: Managing Groups</H1></A>

<p>Active Directory directory services provide support for different
types of groups, as well as offering options for the scope of a
group&#8212;that is, whether or not the group spans multiple domains or
is limited to a single domain.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>

<p><li>Delete groups.</li></p>

</ul>


<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 50 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="250"><H2>Understanding Group Types</H2></A>

<p>Active Directory directory services allow for flexibility by
providing two distinct types of groups: security groups and
distribution groups.</p>

<A NAME="251"><H3>Security Groups</H3></A>

<p>Windows 2000 uses only security groups, which you use to assign or
deny rights and permissions to groups of users and computers so that
they can gain access to resources. Programs that are designed to search Active Directory
directory services can also use security groups for nonsecurity-related purposes,
such as sending email messages to a number of users at the same time. A
security group also has all the capabilities of a distribution group.
Since Windows 2000 uses only security groups, this chapter will focus
on security groups.</p>

<A NAME="252"><H3>Distribution Groups</H3></A>

<p>Applications, such as Microsoft Exchange, use distribution groups as
lists for nonsecurity-related functions. Distribution groups cannot be
used for security purposes; you cannot use distribution groups to
assign permissions. Use distribution groups when the only function of
the group is nonsecurity related, such as sending e-mail messages to a
group of users at the same time.</p>

<p>If you have no plans to use a particular group for security
purposes, you should create a distribution group rather than a security
group. During the logon process, Windows 2000 creates an access token
that contains the list of security groups to which the user belongs.
Using distribution groups rather than security groups improves logon performance by reducing the size of the access
token.</p>

<A NAME="253"><H2>Understanding Group Scope</H2></A>

<p>Security and distribution groups have a scope attribute. The scope
of a group determines who can be a member of the group and where you can use that
group in the network. There are three group scopes that are available:
universal, global, and domain local.</p>

<A NAME="254"><H3>Universal Groups</H3></A>

<p>Universal groups can contain user accounts, global groups, and other
universal groups from any Windows 2000 domain in the forest. The domain
must be operating in native mode to create security groups with
universal scope.</p>

<p>You can grant permissions to universal groups for all domains in the
forest, regardless of the location of the universal group.</p>

<A NAME="255"><H3>Global Groups</H3></A>

<p>Global groups, in a native mode domain, can contain user accounts
and global groups from the domain in which the group exists. In a mixed
mode domain, they can contain only user accounts from the domain in which the group
exists.</p>

<p>You can grant permissions to global groups for all domains in the
forest, regardless of the location of the global group. The membership
of a global group is limited to its domain, but the group can be assigned permissions
throughout the forest.</p>

<A NAME="256"><H3>Domain Local Groups</H3></A>

<p>Domain local groups, in a native mode domain, can contain user
accounts, global groups, and universal groups from any domain in the
forest, as well as domain local groups from the same domain. In a mixed
mode domain, they can contain user accounts and global groups from any
domain.</p>

<p>You can grant permissions to domain local groups only for objects
within the domain in which the domain local group exists. The membership of a
domain local group can be forestwide, but the group can only be
assigned permissions within its own domain.</p>

<A NAME="257"><H3>Group Scope and Performance</H3></A>

<p>A list of universal group memberships is maintained in the global
catalog. Global and domain local groups are listed in the global
catalog, but their membership is not. Each change to the membership of
a universal group is replicated to all global catalog servers. By
minimizing the use of universal groups, you will help reduce the size of the global catalog and thereby reduce the amount of
traffic on your network caused by replication of the global
catalog.</p>

<p>Consider limiting membership in universal groups to other groups, as
opposed to user accounts. This allows you to adjust the user accounts
that are members of the universal group by adjusting the membership of
the groups that are members of the universal group. Since this does not
directly affect the membership of the universal group, no replication
traffic is generated.</p>

<p>Limiting the use of universal groups can also help you to reduce the
size of access tokens when resources are in different domains. If you use
global and domain local groups, the access tokens contain the global and domain
local groups that are applicable to the domain in which the resource
exists. If you use universal groups, the access token contains a list
of all of the universal groups the user belongs to, even if those
universal groups are not used in that domain.</p>

<p>Limit the use of universal groups to groups that are widely used in
your enterprise and are relatively static as far as membership
changes.</p>

<A NAME="258"><H2>Creating Groups</H2></A>

<p>Creating groups eases administrative overhead by combining accounts
that require similar access to network resources into a single object to
which you can assign rights and permissions.</p>

<A NAME="259"><H3>Planning Groups</H3></A>

<p>The recommended strategy for using both global and domain local
groups is to put user accounts (A) into global groups (G) and then to
put global groups into domain local groups (DL) and assign resource
permissions (P) to the domain local groups. This strategy (AGDLP) provides for the most flexibility
and reduces the complexity of assigning access permissions to network
resources.</p>

<p>For example, suppose your network has several global groups that all
require the same access permissions to network resources in a
particular domain. If you put all of these global groups into a single
domain local group, you can then assign the appropriate permissions for
each resource to that single domain local group, and the user accounts
in the global groups would have the appropriate permissions. If the
permission requirements for the resources ever change, you can simply adjust the domain local group's membership. If, on the other
hand, you assigned permissions directly to the global groups, you would
need to manually adjust the individual permissions on all of the
network resources.</p>

<A NAME="260"><H3>Creating a Group in Active Directory Directory Services</H3></A>

<p>To create a group, open the Active Directory Users and Computers
tool, right-click the appropriate container or OU, point to New, and
then click Group. Figure 5.4 shows the New Object - Group dialog box, and Table 5.3
describes the options that you must provide in the New Object - Group
dialog box.</p>

<p><table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr>
<th>Option</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Group Name</td>
<td valign="top">The name of the new group. The name must be unique within

Universal.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Group Type</td>
<td valign="top">The type of group. Choose Security or Distribution.</td>
</tr></table></p>


<p>After you create a group, you add members. Members of groups can
include user accounts, other groups, and computers.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
Add a computer to a group to give access to a
shared resource on that computer (for example, the remote backup
utility).
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="261"><H3>Adding Members to a Group</H3></A>

<p>To add members to a group, use the Active Directory Users and
Computers tool. In the Active Directory Users And Computers window,
right-click the group to which you want to add a member, click
Properties, and then click the Members tab. On the Members tab, click
Add.</p>

<p>In the Look In list, select a domain from which to display user
accounts and groups, or select Entire Directory to view user accounts
and groups from anywhere in Active Directory directory services. From
this list, select the user account or group that you want to add, and then click Add. If you are
adding more than one user account or group, you can continue to select
the account or group and click Add. Once you have finished adding user
accounts or groups to selected groups, click OK.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
You can also add a user account or group to a
group by using the Member Of tab in the Properties dialog box for that
user account or group. Use this method to quickly add the same user or
group to multiple groups.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="262"><H2>Modifying Groups</H2></A>

<p>In addition to changing the membership of a group and the
permissions granted to that group, you can modify a group by changing
the type and scope. You can also delete groups when they are no longer
needed.</p>

<A NAME="263"><H3>Changing Group Type</H3></A>

<p>You can change a group's type from security to distribution or
from distribution to security at any time when the domain is in native
mode. You cannot change a group's type when the domain is in mixed
mode. You change the type of the group on the General tab of the
Properties dialog box for the group.</p>

<A NAME="264"><H3>Changing Group Scope</H3></A>

<p>As your network changes, you might need to change a group's
scope. For example, you might want to change an existing domain local group to a
universal group when you need to assign permissions to allow users to
gain access to resources in other domains. You change the scope of a group on the
General tab of the Properties dialog box for the group.</p>

<p>Here are some important points to remember about changing group
scope:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>You can only change the scope of a group when the domain is
in native mode; you cannot change group scope in mixed mode.</li></p>

<p><li>You can change a global group to a universal group, but only
if the global group that you are converting is not a member of another
global group.</li></p>

<p><li>You can change a domain local group to a universal group,
but only if the domain local group that you are converting does not contain another
domain local group.</li></p>

<p><li>You cannot change a universal group to any other group scope
because all other groups have more restrictive membership and scope
than universal groups.</li></p>
</ul>


<A NAME="265"><H2>Deleting a Group</H2></A>

<p>When you delete a group, you delete only the group and remove the
permissions and rights that are associated with it. Deleting a group
does not delete the user accounts that are members of the group.</p>

<p>Each group that you create has a unique, nonreusable identifier,
called the security identifier (SID). Windows 2000 uses the SID to
identify the group and the permissions that are assigned to it. When
you delete a group, Windows 2000 does not use the SID for that group again, even if you create a new
group with the same name. Therefore, you cannot restore access to
resources by recreating the group.</p>

<p>To delete a group, open the Active Directory Users and Computers
tool, right-click the group, and then click Delete.</p>

<p>The New Object - Group dialog box appears.</p>

<p><li>Type <b>Managers</b> in the Group Name box.</li></p>

<p><li>Verify that the Group Scope option is set to Global, and that
the Group Type option is set to Security, and then click OK.</li></p>

<p>Windows 2000 creates the group and displays it in the details
pane.</p>
</ol>

<p><li><b>To add members to a global group</b></li></p>
<ol>
<p><li>Double-click Managers.</li></p>

<p>The Managers Properties dialog box displays the properties of the

</ol>

<A NAME="268"><H3>Exercise 2: Creating a Domain Local Group and Adding Members</H3></A>

<p>In this exercise, you will create a domain local group and add
members. You will use the group to assign permissions to gain access to an inventory
database. Because you use the group to assign permissions, you will
make it a domain local group. You will then add members to the group.</p>


<p><li><b>To create a domain local group in a domain</b></li></p>
<ol>
<p><li>Right-click Administration, point to New, and then click
Group.</li></p>

<p>The New Object - Group dialog box appears.</p>

<p><li>Type <b>Inventory</b> in the Group Name box.</li></p>

<p><li>For the Group Scope option, click Domain Local, and for the
Group Type option, confirm that Security is selected.</li></p>

<p><li>Click OK.</li></p>

<p>Windows 2000 creates the domain local group and displays it in the
details pane.</p>

<p>Leave the Active Directory Users And Computers window open.</p>
</ol>

<p><li><b>To add members to a domain local group</b></li></p>
<ol>
<p><li>Right-click Inventory, and click Properties.</li></p>

<p>The Select Users, Contacts, Computers, Or Groups dialog box displays
user accounts and groups from all domains and shows the location of
each user account or group as <i>domain/</i>Users. In your case there
is only one domain.</p>

<p><li>Click the Name column heading.</li></p>

<p>The Select Users, Contacts, Computers, or Groups dialog box displays
all entries in the list alphabetically by name.</p>

<p><li>Click Managers.</li></p>

<A NAME="271"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>Active Directory directory services provide two types of groups:
security groups and distribution groups. You use security groups to
assign or deny rights and permissions to groups of users and computers so that they can gain
access to resources. A security group has all the capabilities of a distribution
group. Applications, such as Microsoft Exchange, use distribution groups as
lists for nonsecurity-related functions. You use distribution groups
when the only function of the group is nonsecurity related, such as
sending e-mail messages to a group of users at the same time.</p>

<p>Security and distribution groups have a scope attribute. The scope
of a group determines who can be a member of the group and where you can use that
group in the network. There are three group scopes that are available:
universal, global, and domain local.</p>

<p>After you plan your groups, you use the Active Directory Users And
Computers tool to create a group, add members to a group, change the
type or scope of a group, or delete a group. In Active Directory
directory services, you can also easily move objects within your domain structure and locate resources
throughout the network, regardless of the physical location of the
object.</p>

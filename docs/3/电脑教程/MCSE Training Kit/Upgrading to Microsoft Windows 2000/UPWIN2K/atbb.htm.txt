<A NAME="8"><H1>Chapter and Appendix Overview</H1></A>

<p>This self-paced training course combines discussions, notes,
hands-on practices, and review questions to teach you how to install,
configure, administer, and support Windows 2000. The course is designed
to be completed from beginning to end. If you choose not to complete
the book from beginning to end, see the &quot;Before You Begin&quot; section in each chapter. Hands-on
practices that require preliminary work from preceding chapters refer to the appropriate
chapters.</p>

<p>The book is divided into the following chapters:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>The &quot;About This Book&quot; section you are now reading
contains a self-paced training overview and introduces the components
of this training. Read this section thoroughly to get the greatest
educational value from this self-paced training and to plan which
lessons you will complete.</li></p>

<p><li><a href="ch01a.htm">Chapter 1</a>, &quot;The Microsoft Windows 2000 Platform,&quot;
describes the Microsoft Windows 2000 family of products, which includes Window 2000
Professional, Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Advanced Server, and
Windows 2000 Datacenter Server. This chapter presents the features and
benefits of using Windows 2000.</li></p>

<p><li><a href="ch02a.htm">Chapter 2</a>, &quot;Installing Windows 2000,&quot; reviews the
Windows 2000 installation process and provides a hands-on practice in
which you install Windows 2000 Server. It also presents information on
automating installations, performing over the network installations,
and troubleshooting common problems that may occur during the
installation process.</li></p>

<p><li><a href="ch03a.htm">Chapter 3</a>, &quot;Configuring the DNS Service,&quot;
introduces DNS and name resolution. DNS is a distributed database that
is used in TCP/IP networks to translate computer names to IP addresses.
It also presents the skills and knowledge necessary to install and
configure the DNS Service, to configure DNS clients, and to
troubleshoot the DNS Service. It provides a hands-on practice in which
you configure TCP/IP as part of the preinstallation configuration
required to install the DNS Service, and then you install and configure
the DNS Service.</li></p>

<p><li><a href="ch04a.htm">Chapter 4</a>, &quot;Implementing Active Directory Directory Services,&quot; introduces Windows 2000 Active Directory directory
services. Active Directory directory services use DNS as the domain
naming and location service so Windows 2000 domain names are also DNS
names. In fact, the core unit of logical structure in the Active
Directory structure is the domain. This chapter presents the skills and
knowledge necessary to plan, install, and configure your network's
Active Directory structure. It provides a practice in which you promote
your stand-alone server to a domain controller by installing Active
Directory directory services on it. In this practice you also change
the mode of your domain from the default of mixed mode to native mode.</li></p>

<p><li><a href="ch05a.htm">Chapter 5</a>, &quot;Administering Active Directory Directory Services,&quot; explains how to use the Active Directory Users and
Computers administrative tool to create and manage user and computer
accounts. User accounts still provide users with the ability to log on
to a domain to gain access to network resources or to log on at a
computer to gain access to resources on that computer, but the tool for
creating them is new. This chapter also explains how groups have
changed since Windows NT 4.0. There are two types of groups: security
groups and distribution groups. These types of groups have a scope
attribute that determines who can be a member of the group and where
you can use that group in the network. This chapter explains how to
create and manage groups and how to control access to Active Directory objects. This chapter provides four
practices in which you create Organizational Units; create and move
user accounts; modify user account properties; create and add members
to a global group, a domain local group, and a universal group; and
delegate control.</li></p>

<p><li><a href="ch06a.htm">Chapter 6</a>, &quot;Managing Desktop Environments with Group Policy,&quot; introduces you to group policies, which are another
method for defining a user's desktop environment, and which are
typically set for the entire domain or network to enforce corporate
policies. This chapter teaches you what group policies are and how to
apply and configure group policies. This chapter also provides a
practice in which you create a GPO at the domain level, create a group,
and grant the group the right to log on to the domain controller.</li></p>

<p><li><a href="ch07a.htm">Chapter 7</a>, &quot;Managing Software by Using Group Policy,&quot; introduces Windows Installer and the Software
Installation and Maintenance Technology. Both of these features help
reduce the time required to deploy and manage software. This chapter
provides the skills and knowledge necessary for you to publish software
rather than install it. This chapter also explains how to deploy both
mandatory and optional upgrades.</li></p>

<p><li><a href="ch08a.htm">Chapter 8</a>, &quot;Managing File Resources,&quot; explains how
the methods of providing access to file and print resources in
Windows

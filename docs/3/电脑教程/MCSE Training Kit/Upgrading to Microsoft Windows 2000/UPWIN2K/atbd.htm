Questions in the exams reflect how Microsoft products are used in
actual organizations, giving them &quot;real-world&quot; relevance.</p>

<p>Microsoft Certified Product Specialists are required to pass one
operating system exam. Candidates may pass additional Microsoft
certification exams to further qualify their skills with Microsoft
BackOffice products, development tools, or desktop applications.</p>

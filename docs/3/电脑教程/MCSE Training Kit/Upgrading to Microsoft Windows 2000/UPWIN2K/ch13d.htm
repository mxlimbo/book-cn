<A NAME="622"><H1>Lesson 3: Upgrading Domain Controllers and Member Servers</H1></A>

<p>In Windows NT 4.0, the PDC and the BDCs authenticate domain logons
and maintain the directory database for the domain. You upgrade domain
controllers and member servers running previous versions of Windows NT
to either Windows 2000 Server or Windows 2000 Advanced Server. Once you
upgrade all of your domain controllers to Windows 2000, you can take full
advantage of the enhanced administrative features offered in Windows
2000 by switching the domain from mixed mode to native mode. This
allows the domain to fully use the new features of Active Directory
directory services.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Explain how to upgrade domain controllers to Windows
2000.</li></p>

<p><li>Explain how to upgrade and promote member servers to Windows
2000.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="623"><H2>Identifying Server Upgrade Paths</H2></A>

<p>You upgrade domain controllers and member servers running previous
versions of Windows NT to either Windows 2000 Server or Windows 2000
Advanced Server. Table 13.1 lists the upgrade paths for server
operating systems.</p>

<p><b>Table 13.1</b> <i>Windows 2000 Upgrade Paths for Member Servers</i></p>

<P>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Upgrade from  </th>
<th>Upgrade to  </th></tr>
<tr>

<td valign="top">Windows NT Server, version 3.51 or 4.0 first, then upgrade to Windows 2000 Server or Windows 2000 Advanced Server.  </td></tr>
</table></p>

<A NAME="624"><H3>Upgrading Domain Controllers</H3></A>

<p>In Windows 2000 networks, all domain controllers running Windows
2000 have equal status in the domain. When you upgrade Windows NT 4.0
or 3.51 PDCs and BDCs to Windows 2000, there is no longer a distinction
between PDCs and BDCs. Instead, they become peer domain
controllers.</p>

<A NAME="625"><H3>Upgrading Member Servers</H3></A>

<p>You also upgrade member servers running Windows NT Server 3.51 and
4.0 to Windows 2000. This allows them to take advantage of Active Directory
directory services. You can promote these member servers to domain
controllers as necessary.</p>

<A NAME="626"><H2>Preparing to Upgrade</H2></A>

<p>Before you start the upgrade process, there are a couple of things
you need to do to prepare to upgrade your domain controllers and member
servers. First of all, make sure that all your computers meet the
minimum hardware requirements for Windows 2000 Server and Advanced
Server. Then prepare a rollback strategy in case there are any upgrade
problems. Finally prepare the domain controllers and member servers for
the upgrade.</p>

<A NAME="627"><H3>Identifying the Minimum Hardware Requirements</H3></A>

<p>Before you upgrade a domain controller or a member server to
Windows 2000, make sure that the computers on the network meet the
minimum hardware requirements. Table 13.2 describes the hardware requirements.</p>

<p><b>Table 13.2</b> <i>Windows 2000 Server Minimum Hardware Requirements</i></p>

</table></p>

<A NAME="628"><H3>Creating a Rollback Strategy</H3></A>

<p>To create a rollback strategy, preserve one BDC with the current
directory database. To do this, synchronize a BDC with the PDC, and
then take the fully synchronized BDC offline. Keep this BDC available until you are certain
the upgrade is successful. If problems occur during the upgrade, you can
reinstate the offline BDC, promote it to a PDC, and recover your system
state.</p>

<A NAME="629"><H3>Preparing the Domain Controllers and Member Servers</H3></A>

<p>There are some steps you should do to prepare your domain
controllers and member servers to be upgraded. Before you start the
Windows 2000 Setup wizard, you should do the following:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Remove any virus scanners, third-party network service, or
client software. Read the Release Notes file (Relnotes on the Windows
2000 CD-ROM) for information about any known problems with specific
applications.</li></p>

<p><li>Disconnect the serial cable that connects an uninterruptible
power supply (UPS) device. During setup, Windows 2000 attempts to
detect devices connected to serial ports, which can cause problems with
UPS equipment.</li></p>

<p><li>If your system contains Industry Standard Architecture (ISA)
devices that are non-Plug and Play, set your system basic input/output system
(BIOS) to reserve all interrupt requests (IRQs) currently in use by
non-Plug and Play ISA devices. Failure to do so might result in the error
message INACCESSABLE_BOOT_DEVICE. In some cases, the non-Plug and Play ISA devices might not function.</li></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="630"><H2>Upgrading a Primary Domain Controller</H2></A>

<p>You upgrade the PDC to Windows 2000 first, and then use the Active
Directory Installation wizard to configure the new domain.</p>

<A NAME="631"><H3>Upgrading the Domain Controller</H3></A>

<p>To complete the domain controller upgrade process, you would do the
following:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>If you are upgrading from a CD-ROM, insert the Windows 2000
CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive. The Windows 2000 Setup wizard starts
automatically.</li></p>

<p>If you are upgrading from the network, run Winnt32.exe, which is
located in the shared folder that contains the Windows 2000
installation files.</p>


<p><li>The setup program upgrades the operating system.</li></p>

<p><li>The computer reboots and automatically logs on as
Administrator.</li></p>

<p><li>The Active Directory Installation wizard automatically
runs.</li></p>

<p><li>Configure the new domain using the guidelines explained
below.</li></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="632"><H3>Configuring the Domain</H3></A>

<p>When the setup program finishes, the computer restarts and Windows
2000 automatically logs on as Administrator. The Active Directory
Installation wizard (Dcpromo.exe) starts and helps you to configure the
new domain environment and to migrate user, group, and computer
accounts to Active Directory directory services.</p>

<p>To use the Active Directory Installation wizard to configure the new
domain environment, follow the on-screen instructions. When prompted, select
the appropriate configuration options.</p>

<p>Table 13.3 describes the configuration options in the Active
Directory Installation wizard when configuring a domain
environment:</p>

<p>In this practice, you upgrade a computer running Windows NT 4.0
server that is configured as a Primary Domain Controller (PDC) to
Windows 2000 Server using a CD-ROM. You install Active Directory directory services, create
a new Windows 2000 domain, and install DNS on this computer. You will

<A NAME="634"><H2>Upgrading Backup Domain Controllers</H2></A>

<p>After you upgrade the PDC for the domain to Windows 2000, you
upgrade the BDCs to Windows 2000. You use the same process to upgrade
BDCs as you do to upgrade PDCs. Start the Windows 2000 Setup wizard to
begin the installation process. Follow the onscreen instructions to
complete the upgrade.</p>

<p>After the operating system upgrade is complete, the Active Directory
Installation wizard runs to allow you to configure the domain. To
complete the upgrade, select the Additional Domain Controller In Existing Domain option in
the Active Directory Installation wizard. This adds the upgraded
computer to the existing domain as a domain controller.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
The Windows 2000 Setup wizard will not let you
upgrade a BDC until after the PDC has been upgraded. The Setup wizard checks the operating
system version of the PDC before starting the upgrade to verify the PDC
upgrade has already occurred.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>When you upgrade a BDC, you must ensure that the system clock on the
BDC is synchronized with the system clock on the domain controllers in
your network. The Active Directory Installation wizard prompts you for
an administrative username and password that is used to add the
additional domain controller to the domain. If the difference in the system clocks is too great, the
user account you specify will not be accepted, and you will be unable
to join the domain.</p>

<A NAME="635"><H2>Switching from Mixed to Native Mode</H2></A>

<p>After you upgrade all domain controllers on your network, you switch
the domain from mixed mode to native mode. This allows the network to take
full advantage of Windows 2000 functionality.</p>

<A NAME="636"><H3>Understanding Mixed Mode</H3></A>

<p>When you first create a domain, the domain runs in mixed mode. A
mixed mode domain enables Windows 2000 domain controllers to interact with other
domain controllers that are running versions of Windows NT Server. Domain
controllers running versions of Windows NT are referred to as downlevel domain
controllers.</p>

<p>In mixed mode</p>

<ul>
<p><li>The domain still uses the upgraded PDC as the domain master
for replication with BDCs running Windows NT Server 3.51 or 4.0.</li></p>

<p><li>Computers upgraded from Windows NT Workstation 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0 continue to use Windows NT 4.0 system
policy.</li></p>

<p><li>Group functionality new to Windows 2000 Server, such as the
ability to nest groups, is not available.</li></p>
</ul>


<A NAME="637"><H3>Understanding Native Mode</H3></A>

<p>After you upgrade all the domain controllers, and if you do not plan
to add any additional downlevel domain controllers to the domain, you
can switch the domain to native mode. A native mode domain contains only Windows 2000
Server domain controllers.</p>

<p>In native mode</p>

<ul>
<p><li>The PDC is no longer the domain master for replication.
Instead, all domain controllers replicate with each other as
peers.</li></p>

<p><li>Windows NT Server 3.51 or 4.0 domain controllers cannot
function in a native Windows 2000 domain.</li></p>

<p><li>Computers upgraded from Windows NT Workstation 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0 use Windows 2000 group policy instead of Windows
NT 4.0 system policy.</li></p>

<p><li>Group functionality new to Windows 2000 becomes
available.</li></p>
</ul>


<A NAME="638"><H3>Switching the Domain to Native Mode</H3></A>

<p>To switch domain controllers from mixed to native mode, you would do
the following:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools,
and then click Active Directory Domains And Trusts.</li></p>

<p><li>Expand your domain and then open the properties for <i>
your_domain.</i></li></p>

<p><li>On the General page, click Change Mode.</li></p>


<p>The Active Directory Service displays a warning stating that once
you change the domain mode to native mode, you cannot change back to
mixed mode.</p>


<p><li>Click Yes, and then click OK to close the properties page for
<i>your_domain</i>.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
After switching to native mode, Windows 2000
might prompt you to restart all domain controllers in your domain. If
you get this message, you do not need to restart any domain
controllers. This is a limitation in pre-release versions of Windows
2000.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="639"><H2>Upgrading and Promoting Member Servers</H2></A>

<p>You can upgrade your member servers to Windows 2000 before, during,
or after the domain upgrade process. In addition, you can promote
member servers to domain controllers after the operating system upgrade, as
necessary.</p>

<A NAME="640"><H3>Upgrading a Member Server to Windows 2000</H3></A>

<p>To upgrade the member server to Windows 2000, insert the CD-ROM
and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the upgrade. After the
upgrade, the member server will still be a member of its domain or workgroup.
During an upgrade, local user and group accounts are stored in the
registry of the member server and do not get moved to Active Directory
directory services.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
When you upgrade a member server that is running
the DHCP Service, be sure to authorize the DHCP Service in Active
Directory directory services, or the service will not start. Servers
running the DHCP Service are not automatically authorized when upgraded
to Windows 2000.

<A NAME="641"><H3>Promoting a Member Server to a Domain Controller</H3></A>

<p>To promote a member server to a domain controller, run Dcpromo.exe
after upgrading to Windows 2000.</p>

<p>When you promote the domain controller, local user and group
accounts on the member server are moved to Active Directory directory
services. This maintains the permissions previously assigned to
resources on that server.</p>

<A NAME="642"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>You upgrade domain controllers and member servers running previous
versions of Windows NT to either Windows 2000 Server or Windows 2000
Advanced Server. All domain controllers running Windows 2000 have equal
status in the domain. When you upgrade Windows NT 4.0 or 3.51 PDCs and
BDCs to Windows 2000, there is no longer a distinction between PDCs and
BDCs. Instead, they become peer domain controllers.</p>

<p>You also upgrade member servers running Windows NT Server 3.51 and
4.0 to Windows 2000. This allows them to take advantage of Active
Directory directory services. You can promote these member servers to domain
controllers as necessary.</p>

<p>Before you start the upgrade process, make sure that all your
computers meet the minimum hardware requirements for Windows 2000 Server and Advanced
Server. You should also prepare a rollback strategy in case there are
any upgrade problems and prepare the domain controllers and member
servers for the upgrade.</p>

<p>After you upgrade all domain controllers on your network, you switch
the domain from mixed mode to native mode. This allows the network to take
full advantage of Windows 2000 functionality. When you first create a
domain, the domain runs in mixed mode. A mixed mode domain enables
Windows 2000 domain controllers to interact with other domain controllers that are
running versions of Windows NT Server.</p>

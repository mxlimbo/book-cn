<A NAME="62"><H1>Lesson 1: Preparing to Install</H1></A>

<p>When you install Windows 2000, the Windows 2000 Setup program asks
you to provide information about how you want to install and configure
the operating system. Good preparation helps you avoid problems during
and after the installation.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>
<ul>
<p><li>Prepare to install the beta version of Microsoft Windows
2000 by completing preinstallation tasks such as identifying the
hardware requirements and the required installation information.</li></p>
</ul>
<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 30 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="63"><H2>Preinstallation Tasks</H2></A>

<p>Before you start the installation, complete the following
preinstallation tasks:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Identify the hardware requirements to install Windows 2000,
and make sure that your hardware meets these requirements.</li></p>

<p><li>Determine whether your hardware is on the Hardware
Compatibility List (HCL).</li></p>

<p><li>Determine how you want to partition the hard disk on which
you are going to install Windows 2000.</li></p>

<p><li>Choose a file system for the installation partition.</li></p>

<p><li>Choose a licensing mode for a server that will be running
Windows 2000.</li></p>

<p><li>Identify whether your computer will join a domain or a
workgroup.</li></p>

<p><li>Complete a checklist of preinstallation tasks to help ensure
a successful installation.</li></p>

<p><li>Run the Windows 2000 Upgrade Compatibility Verification
tool.</li></p>
</ul>


<A NAME="64"><H2>Hardware Requirements</H2></A>

<p>You must know the minimum hardware requirements for installing and
operating Windows 2000 Professional, Windows 2000 Server, and Windows
2000 Advanced Server to determine if your hardware meets these
requirements (see Figure 2.1 and Table 2.1). Make sure that your hardware meets or
exceeds these requirements.</p>

<A NAME="65"><H2>Hardware Compatibility List</H2></A>

<p>Before you install Windows 2000, verify that your hardware is on the
Windows 2000 Hardware Compatibility List (HCL). Microsoft provides
tested drivers for only those devices that are included on this list.
Using hardware that is not listed on the HCL could cause problems
during and after installation.</p>

<p>For a copy of the HCL, see the Hcl.txt file in the Support folder on
the Windows 2000 CD-ROM.</p>

<p>You will also find the most recent versions of the HCL for released
operating systems on the Internet at the Microsoft Web site
(<a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_window2">http://www.microsoft.com</a>).</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
Microsoft supports only those devices that are
listed on the HCL. If you have hardware that is not on this list,
contact the hardware manufacturer to determine if there is a
manufacturer-supported Windows 2000 driver for the
component.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>Microsoft provides the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) for Windows
2000 products because Windows 2000 requires greater control of the
hardware, compared to other operating systems such as MS-DOS and
Windows, for security, stability, and efficiency reasons. This in turn
implies a deeper knowledge and utilization on the part of the operating system of the computer hardware. Small incompatibilities and differences from industry
standards of that hardware can have an adverse effect on the stability
of the Windows 2000 operating system.</p>

<A NAME="66"><H2>Disk Partitions</H2></A>

<p>The Windows 2000 Setup program examines the hard disk to determine
its existing configuration. Setup then allows you to install Windows
2000 on an existing partition or create a new partition on which to
install Windows 2000.</p>

<A NAME="67"><H3>New Partition or Existing Partition</H3></A>

<p>Depending on the state of the hard disk, you can choose one of the
following options during the installation:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>If the hard disk is unpartitioned, you must create and size
the Windows 2000 partition.</li></p>

<p><li>If the hard disk has partitions and has enough unpartitioned
disk space, you can create the Windows 2000 partition by using the
unpartitioned space.</li></p>

<p><li>If the hard disk has an existing partition that is large
enough, you can install Windows 2000 on that partition. Installing on
an existing partition will overwrite any existing data.</li></p>

<p><li>If the hard disk has an existing partition, you can delete
it to create more unpartitioned disk space to use to create the Windows
2000 partition.</li></p>
</ul>


<A NAME="68"><H3>Remaining Free Hard Disk Space</H3></A>

<p>Although you can use Setup to create other partitions, you should
create and size only the partition on which you will install Windows
2000. After you install Windows 2000, use the Computer Management
administrative tool to partition any remaining unpartitioned space on
the hard disk.</p>

<A NAME="69"><H3>Size of the Installation Partition</H3></A>

<p>Microsoft recommends that you install Windows 2000 on a 1 GB or
larger partition. Although Windows 2000 requires a minimum of about 685
MB of disk space for installation, using a larger installation
partition provides flexibility in the future. Then, if required, you
can install updates to Windows 2000, operating system tools, or other
files that are required by Windows 2000.</p>

<p>When you determine the disk space required for installing Windows
2000 on a computer, you must decide whether you are doing a clean
installation or an upgrade, and whether you will be installing from
CD-ROM or over the network. You must also know the cluster size being
used.</p>

<p>If you are doing an upgrade and installing from CD-ROM, Setup
creates the temporary folder $Win_nt$.~bt. If you are doing an upgrade
and installing over the network, Setup creates the temporary folders
$Win_nt$.~bt and $Win_nt$.~ls. The $Win_nt$.~ls folder contains the
actual Windows 2000 files to be installed. There must be enough
available space to allow for these folders.</p>

<p>To determine the space requirements for these folders, open the
Txtsetup.sif file located in the I386 folder of your source files. The
last section in this file is [DiskSpaceRequirements] and contains the
values used by Setup. Notice that the sizes of these folders vary
depending on the cluster size. The cluster sizes listed in the
Txtsetup.sif file are 512, 1K, 2K, 4K, 8K, 16K, 32K, 64K, 128K, and
256K. Once you select the appropriate cluster size, the first number
listed represents the space required for the $Win_nt$.~ls folder, and
the second number listed represents the space required for the
$Win_nt$.~bt folder.</p>

<A NAME="70"><H3>Upgrade Installation from CD-ROM</H3></A>

<p>If you are doing an upgrade and installing from CD-ROM, Winnt32
checks the space for the $Win_nt$.~bt folder on the system partition.
It then checks to find the location of the %windir% and the operating
system of the installation in use. Winnt32 checks the partition
containing the %windir% directory to see if there is enough space for
the computed sum of the $Win_nt$.~bt folder size and upgrade growth
size. Setup subtracts the cache size (temporary Internet files, etc.)
to be deleted from the required disk space. If there is enough room,
Setup proceeds. Otherwise, it generates a warning.</p>

<A NAME="71"><H3>Upgrade Installation over the Network</H3></A>

<p>If you are doing an upgrade and installing over the network, Winnt32
checks the space for the $Win_nt$.~bt folder on the system partition.
It then checks to find the location of the %windir% and the operating
system of the installation in use. After determining the operating
system, Winnt32 checks the partition containing the %windir% to see if
there is enough space for the $Win_nt$.~bt folder size and upgrade
growth size.</p>

<p>Winnt32 then checks any drive on the system for the space required
for the compressed $Win_nt$.~ls folder. If the $Win_nt$.~ls folder is
in the same partition where the operating system is to be installed,
the files to be moved during Text Mode are accounted for in the disk
space calculation.</p>

<A NAME="72"><H2>File Systems</H2></A>

<p>After you create the installation partition, Setup prompts you to
select the file system with which to format the partition. As with Windows NT 4.0,
Windows

<A NAME="238"><H1>Lesson 2: Creating User and Computer Accounts</H1></A>

<p>You use objects, user accounts, and computer accounts to represent
users and computers so that you can control network access and manage
the use of network resources. To add a user or a computer account to an
OU, you must have the permission to add new objects to the OU. By
default, members of the Administrators group have permission to add
objects anywhere in the domain.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Create domain user accounts.</li></p>

<p><li>Describe how to create computer accounts.</li></p>
</ul>


<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 30 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="239"><H2>Creating User Accounts</H2></A>

<p>User accounts are employed to authenticate the user, as well as to
assign permissions to gain access to network resources. You can use the
Active Directory Users and Computers administrative tool on any available domain
controller to create a new user account. After you create the account,
it is replicated to all other domain controllers in the domain.</p>

<p>When you create the user account, you must first select the
container in which to create it. You can create user accounts at the
domain level, but doing so limits your delegation options and increases
the complexity of managing your network. To create a domain user
account, you would do the following:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Open the Active Directory Users and Computers administrative
tool.</li></p>

<p><li>Right-click the OU in which you want to create the user account,
point to New, and then click User. Figure 5.1 shows the New Object -
User dialog box. The fields in Figure 5.1 are explained in Table
5.1.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>Table 5.1 describes the domain user account options that you can
configure.</p>

<p>Each user account that you create is associated with a set of
default attributes. You can use the attributes that you define for a
domain user account to search for users in Active Directory directory
services. For this reason, you should provide detailed attribute
definitions for each domain user account that you create.</p>

<p>After you create a domain user account, you can configure personal
and account attributes, logon options, and dial-in settings.</p>

<p>The tabs in the Properties dialog box for a user contain information
about each user account. When the Advanced Features for the Active
Directory Users and Computers snap-in are active, the tabs are General,
Address, Account, Profile, Telephones, Organization, Published
Certificates, Member Of, Dial-In, Object, Security, Environment,
Sessions, Remote Control, and Terminal Services Profile.</p>

<p>Right-click the user account, and then click Properties to open the
Properties dialog box for a user account.</p>

To create a local user account on a computer,
open Computer Management and select the Local Users And Groups tool in
the System Tools group.

<A NAME="240"><H2>Moving Objects</H2></A>

<p>In Active Directory directory services, you can easily move objects
between OUs within your domain structure. Active Directory directory
services simplify your job as an administrator by allowing you to move
objects whenever organizational or administrative functions change. For
example, when an employee moves from one department to another, it is a
lot easier to move the user account than to have to delete the user
account, recreate a new user account, and make sure that all rights and
permissions are correctly reestablished.</p>

<p>When you move objects between OUs</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Permissions that are assigned directly to objects remain the
same.</li></p>

<p><li>The objects inherit permissions from the new OU. Any
permissions inherited from the previous OU will no longer affect the
objects.</li></p>

<p><li>You can move multiple objects at the same time.</li></p>
</ul>


<p>Similar to moving users, you use the Active Directory Users and
Computers tool to move an object. In the Active Directory Users And
Computers window, right-click the object you want to move, and then
click Move. In the Move dialog box, click on the container that you
want the object moved to, and then click OK.</p>

<A NAME="241"><H2>Locating Objects</H2></A>

<p>In Active Directory directory services, you can also easily locate
resources throughout the network, regardless of the physical location
of the object. Use the Active Directory Users and Computers tool to
locate groups in Active Directory directory services. Click Find on the
Action menu in the Active Directory Users And Computers window to open
the Find dialog box. The Find dialog box, shown in Figure 5.3, allows
you to search Active Directory directory services to locate different types of objects. The search criteria that are
available vary (as does the dialog box's title bar) depending on the type of
object you selected in the Find list.</p>

<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F05UP03x.htm')"> <img src="images/F05UP03.JPG" width=404 height=229 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 5.3</b> <i>The Find dialog box</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>After a search successfully completes, the search results are
displayed. You can then perform administrative functions on the objects
that are listed. The functions that are available depend on the type of
object you located. For example, if you searched for computer accounts,
you can delete the computer account, disable or reset the computer
account, move the computer account to another OU, or adjust the
computer account's attributes.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
Users can use Search, available on the Start
menu, to find objects in Active Directory directory services. The
Search commands in Windows燛xplorer and My Network Places can also be
used to locate objects in Active Directory directory
services.

<A NAME="242"><H2>Practice: Creating and Managing Domain User Accounts</H2></A>

<p>In this practice, you will create user accounts based on information
given in Exercise 1. After creating the user accounts you will modify the user
account properties, specifically the logon hours properties, for one of
the user accounts. You will test the user account you modified to
verify that the logon restrictions you set up are working, and finally,
you will move two of the user accounts from the OU in which they were
created to another OU.</p>

<A NAME="243"><H3>Exercise 1: Creating User Accounts</H3></A>

<p>In this exercise, you will create four user accounts.</p>


<p><li><b>To create a domain user account</b></li></p>
<ol>
<p><li>In the console tree, right-click Production, point to New, and
then click User.</li></p>


<p>Notice that the New Object - User dialog box shows that the new
user account is being created in the location domain.com/Production.</p>


<p><li>Create the user account by typing <b>User</b> in the First Name
box, <b>One</b> in the Last Name box, and <b>User1</b> in the User
Logon Name box.</li></p>

<A NAME="247"><H2>Creating Computer Accounts</H2></A>

<p>Computer accounts are similar to user accounts in that they can be
used to authenticate and audit the computer, as well as being used to assign
permissions to gain access to network resources.</p>

<p>Since all domain controllers in a Windows 2000 domain are peers, you
can use the Active Directory Users and Computers tool on any available
domain controller to create a new computer account. After you create
the account, Active Directory directory services replicate it to all
other domain controllers in the domain.</p>

<p>When you create the computer account, select the container in which
to create it. You can create computer accounts at the domain level, but
doing so limits your delegation options and increases the complexity of
managing your network. To create a computer account, you also use the Active Directory Users
and Computers tool. Right-click on the container in which you want to
create the computer account, point to New, and then click Computer.
Type in the name of the computer.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
The computer name must be unique within the
enterprise.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>For added security, you might want to change the selection in the
User Or Group box. You can enter any user or group to join a computer
to a domain. During the process of joining the computer to the domain,
a dialog box appears that prompts you for an account that has the right
to join the computer to the domain. The person who joins the computer
to the domain must enter a user name and password that matches the
value you designate in this box. As with user accounts, each computer
account that you create is associated with a set of default attributes.
You can use the attributes that you define for a computer account to
search for a computer in the Active Directory directory services. For
this reason, you should provide detailed attribute definitions for each
computer account that you create.</p>

<A NAME="248"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>You use objects, user accounts, and computer accounts to represent
users and computers so that you can control network access and manage
the use of network resources. To add a user or a computer account to an
OU, you must have the permission to add new objects to the OU. By

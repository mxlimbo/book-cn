<A NAME="197"><H1>Lesson 4: Introduction to Planning</H1></A>

<p>When you decide to establish a Windows 2000 network environment, you
must consider how to implement a DNS namespace and Active Directory
directory services. First, examine the business structure and operation
of your organization.</p>

<p>In many organizations, the IS department defines and implements the
network structure down to the smallest detail. Other organizations,
especially large enterprises, take a decentralized approach to managing
business relationships and networks. These organizations might have
multiple business units, each with different requirements for managing
their network resources.</p>

<p>When planning the implementation of a namespace and Active Directory
directory services for your organization, consider the following
issues: physical office locations, future growth and reorganization,
and access to network resources. This lesson introduces some of the
general considerations in planning for your Active Directory directory
services implementation.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Explain considerations for planning an Active Directory
directory services implementation.</li></p>
</ul>


<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 10 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="198"><H2>Planning a Namespace</H2></A>

<p>If your network already has a presence on the Internet, you must
decide whether to extend the external namespace for internal use or to
create a new namespace.</p>

<A NAME="199"><H3>Extending an Existing Namespace</H3></A>

<p>You can extend an existing namespace to include it in Windows 2000
Server domains. You should consider using the same namespace for internal and
external resources when you want to do the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Have consistent tree names for internal and external
resources</li></p>

<p><li>Use the same logon and user names for internal and external
resources</li></p>

<p><li>Reserve no more than one DNS namespace</li></p>
</ul>


<p>When you use the same namespace, you must create two separate DNS
zones for your organization. One zone provides name resolution for
internal resources, and the other provides name resolution for external
resources, such as Web servers, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers,
mail servers, and so on.</p>

<A NAME="200"><H3>Creating a New Internal Namespace</H3></A>

<p>You also can have different namespaces for internal and external
resources. In this configuration, all internal corporate servers use
one namespace, while external resources, such as Internet and FTP
servers, use a different namespace. This configuration requires you to
reserve two namespaces with an Internet DNS registration authority.
Consider using different namespaces for internal and external resources
when you want to have the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>A clear distinction between internal and external
resources</li></p>

<p><li>Separate internal and external resource management</li></p>

<p><li>Simple client browser and proxy client configuration</li></p>
</ul>


<A NAME="201"><H2>Planning a Site</H2></A>

<p>You maintain a domain structure and a site structure separately in
Active Directory directory services. A single domain can include
multiple sites, and a single site can include multiple domains, or
parts of multiple domains.</p>

<p>As you plan sites, consider the availability of bandwidth for the
replication traffic that occurs within a domain. For example, assume that you have
offices in Phoenix, Arizona, and Flagstaff, Arizona, and assume that both
offices are in the same site. In this case, the domain controllers in
each office would be replicating frequently. However, by establishing
each office as a separate site, you can specify a replication schedule to take advantage of hours when
there is less demand on network resources, when more connections are
available, or even when dial-up connections are less expensive.</p>

<p>Use the following guidelines as you plan how to combine subnets into
sites:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Combine only those subnets that share fast, inexpensive, and
reliable network connections of at least 512 Kbps.</li></p>

<p><li>Configure sites so that replication within the site occurs
at times or intervals that do not interfere with network
performance.</li></p>
</ul>


<A NAME="202"><H2>Planning Organizational Units</H2></A>

<p>In a single domain, you can organize user accounts and resources by
using a hierarchy of OUs to reflect the structure of your company. Just
as your organization can have multiple levels of management, you can
establish multiple levels of management within a domain based on
OUs.</p>

<p>Consider creating an OU if you want to do the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Reflect your company's structure and organization within
a domain (see Figure 4.11). Without OUs, all user accounts are maintained and
displayed in a single list, regardless of a user's department, location,
or role.</li></p>

<p><li>Delegate administrative control over network resources while
maintaining the ability to manage them. You can grant administrative
permissions to user accounts or groups at the OU level.</li></p>

<p><li>Accommodate potential changes in your company's
organizational structure. You can move user accounts between OUs
easily, while moving user accounts between domains generally requires
more time and effort.</li></p>

<p><li>Group objects to allow administrators to locate similar
network resources more easily to perform administrative tasks. For
example, you could group all user accounts for temporary employees in
an OU.</li></p>

<p><li>Restrict visibility of network resources in Active Directory
directory services. Users can view only the objects to which they have
access.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="203"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>Planning for implementing Active Directory directory services can be
extremely complex. For example, when you plan the implementation of a
namespace and Active Directory directory services for your
organization, you must consider the following issues: physical office
locations, future growth and reorganization, and access to network resources. If your network already has a presence
on the Internet, you must decide whether to extend the external
namespace for internal use or to create a new namespace.</p>

<p>When you plan your sites, you must consider the availability of
bandwidth for the replication traffic within a domain. You might also
want to determine how to take advantage of hours when there is less demand on network resources, when
more connections are available, or even when dial-up connections are less
expensive.</p>

<p>You also have to plan your OU structure. Your OU structure could
reflect your company's structure and organization within a domain,
allow you to delegate administrative control over network resources while maintaining the
ability to manage them, or restrict visibility of network resources in
Active Directory directory services.</p>

<A NAME="315"><H1>Lesson 3: Configuring Group Policy</H1></A>

<p>You configure the group policy settings within a GPO by using the
Group Policy tool and its extensions in MMC. The extensions in Group
Policy display the configurable settings for administrative templates,
scripts, security, and folder redirection, in addition to software
installation and Remote Installation Services (RIS).</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
For information on the use of group policies for
software installation, see <a href="ch07a.htm">Chapter 7</a>, &quot;Managing Software by Using Group Policy.&quot; For information on RIS, see <a href="ch14a.htm">Chapter 14</a>,
&quot;Deploying Windows 2000.&quot;
</blockquote></div>

<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Apply group policy by creating a GPO, managing the access
permissions of GPOs, and managing the inheritance of GPOs through the
structure of Active Directory directory services.</li></p>

<A NAME="316"><H2>Group Policy Console</H2></A>

<p>You use Group Policy in MMC to specify group policy settings for a
GPO. The group policy settings are separated under Computer
Configuration and User Configuration.</p>

<p>You can open Group Policy in two ways:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>On the Group Policy tab in the Properties dialog box for a
site, domain, or OU, select the GPO that you want to view in Group
Policy, and then click Edit.</li></p>

<p><li>Add the Group Policy tool and any desired extensions to an
MMC console and select the GPO you want to configure.</li></p>
</ul>


<p>When you open Group Policy by clicking the Edit button, the Group
Policy console opens. Figure 6.5 shows a Group Policy window with the Group
Policy extensions expanded. When you manually add the Group Policy tool
to an MMC console, you can select which extensions to include in the console
that you create.</p>

<!--caption--><b>Figure 6.5</b> <i>Group Policy nodes and extensions</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<A NAME="317"><H3>Computer Configuration</H3></A>

<p>Group policy settings that customize the desktop environment or
enforce security policies on computers on the network are contained
under the Computer Configuration node in the Group Policy window.
Computer configuration policies apply when the operating system
initializes.</p>

<p>Computer configuration settings include all computer-related
policies that specify operating system behavior, desktop settings,
application settings, security settings, assigned applications options, and computer startup
and shutdown scripts.</p>

<A NAME="318"><H3>User Configuration</H3></A>

<p>Group policy settings that customize the user's desktop
environment or enforce lockdown policies on users on the network are
contained under the User Configuration node in the Group Policy
window.</p>

<p>User configuration settings include all user-related policies that
specify operating system behavior, desktop settings, application
settings, security settings, assigned and published applications
options, user logon and logoff scripts, and folder redirection options.
User-related policies apply when users log on to the computer.</p>

<A NAME="319"><H3>Settings Folders</H3></A>

<p>The group policy settings in Computer Configuration and User
Configuration are categorized into the following folders:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Software Settings</li></p>

<p><li>Windows Settings</li></p>

<p><li>Administrative Templates</li></p>
</ul>


<p>The subfolders and individual policies within each folder differ
according to the item that you select. For example, Folder Redirection
settings are displayed in the Windows Settings folder under User
Configuration but not under Computer Configuration because folder
redirection applies only to users.</p>

<A NAME="320"><H2>Administrative Template Settings</H2></A>

<p>The Administrative Templates extension includes all registry-based
group policy information. Group policy settings that are specific to a
user are written to the registry under HKEY_CURRENT_USER, and
computer-specific settings are written under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.</p>

<p>In previous versions of Windows, group policy settings remained in
the registry until they were removed, either through an additional
group policy setting or by directly editing the registry. Windows 2000,
however, automatically removes group policy settings from the registry
when the GPO that implemented the group policy no longer applies. To
modify group policy settings in the Administrative Templates folder,
you would do the following:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Open the GPO in Group Policy, expand Computer Configuration or
User Configuration, and then expand the Administrative Templates
folder.</li></p>

<p><li>Expand the item that represents the particular policy that you
want to modify.</li></p>


<p>For example, if you wanted to modify the desktop settings for a
user, you would expand User Configuration\Administrative
Templates\Desktop.</p>


<p><li>Once you have expanded the policy you want to modify, in the
details pane, double-click the policy or right-click the policy, and
then click Properties.</li></p>


<p>You configure the group policy settings in the Administrative
Templates folder by selecting the appropriate option:</p>
<ul>
<p><li> If the Enabled option button on the Policy tab is selected,
the setting is implemented. If this option was selected the last time
that the user logged on, no changes are made (see Figure 6.6).</li></p>

<p><li> If the Disabled option button on the Policy tab is selected,
the setting is not implemented. If the group policy settings were
previously implemented, they are removed from the registry (see Figure
6.6).</li></p>

<p><li> If the Not Configured option button on the Policy tab is
selected, Windows 2000 ignores the group policy setting and makes no
changes to the computer (see Figure 6.6).</li></p>
</ul>
</ol>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 6.6</b> <i>Modifying Administrative Template settings</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>You can move the Properties dialog box to one side so that you can
see the group policy settings that are available and then use the Next
Policy button and the Previous Policy button to move through the available group policies. In
addition, the Properties dialog box has an Explain tab that provides
detailed information regarding the purpose and use of individual group
policy settings.</p>

<A NAME="321"><H2>Script Settings</H2></A>

<p>In previous versions of Windows NT, scripts were limited to logon
scripts. In Windows 2000, the Group Policy tool allows you to assign
scripts to both users and computers. For users, you can assign scripts
that execute during the logon process, in addition to scripts that
execute during the logoff process. For computers, you can assign
scripts that execute during the startup process, in addition to scripts
that execute during the shutdown process.</p>

<A NAME="322"><H3>Windows 2000 Script Execution</H3></A>

<p>Windows 2000 executes scripts according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>When you assign multiple logon/logoff or startup/shutdown
scripts to a user or computer, the scripts are executed from top to
bottom as listed in the corresponding Properties dialog box.</li></p>

<p><li>When a computer shuts down, Windows 2000 first processes
logoff scripts and then processes shutdown scripts.</li></p>

<p><li>By default, the timeout value for processing scripts is two
minutes. If a script requires more than two minutes to process, you must adjust the time-out value by modifying the wait time in the following location:
Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\System\Logon\.</li></p>
</ul>


<A NAME="323"><H3>Group Policy Settings for Scripts</H3></A>

<p>The Scripts extension allows you to configure startup and shutdown
scripts for a computer and logon and logoff scripts for a user. To set
group policy settings for scripts, you would do the following:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Open the appropriate GPO in Group Policy.</li></p>

<p><li>Under either Computer Configuration (for startup and shutdown
scripts) or User Configuration (for logon and logoff scripts), expand
the Windows Settings folder.</li></p>

<p><li>Click Scripts.</li></p>

<p><li>Right-click the appropriate script type (startup, shutdown,
logon, or logoff) in the details pane, and then click Properties.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Properties dialog box, click Add, click Browse, select
the script that you copied in the previous step, and then click
Open.</li></p>

<p><li>Add any necessary script parameters, and then click OK. Then
close the Properties dialog box.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
Windows 2000 still enables you to assign scripts
to users in the Properties dialog box for user objects; however, using
the Group Policy tool is the preferred method of assigning
scripts.

user accounts and global groups from the same domain. Global groups can
be members of universal and domain local groups in any domain. <i>Universal groups</i> can contain
user accounts, universal groups, and global groups from any domain.
Universal groups are only available in native mode. By default Windows

<A NAME="330"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>You configure the group policy settings within a GPO by using the
Group Policy snap-in and its extensions in MMC. The extensions in Group
Policy display the configurable settings for administrative templates,
scripts, security, and folder redirection, in addition to software
installation and Remote Installation Services (RIS).</p>

<p>Group policy settings that customize the desktop environment or
enforce security policies on computers on the network are contained
under Computer Configuration in Group Policy. Computer configuration
policies apply when the operating system initializes. Computer
configuration settings include all computer-related policies that
specify operating system behavior, desktop settings, application
settings, security settings, assigned applications options, and
computer startup and shutdown scripts.</p>

<p>Group policy settings that customize the user's desktop
environment or enforce lockdown policies on users on the network are
contained under User Configuration in Group Policy. User configuration
settings include all user-related policies that specify operating
system behavior, desktop settings, application settings, security settings, assigned and published applications options, user
logon and logoff scripts, and folder redirection options. User-related
policies apply when users log on to the computer.</p>

<p>The way that you implement group policy depends on the structure of
your organization and network. However there are some general
guidelines you should follow. Limit the use of the Block Policy
Inheritance and No Override options. Also limit the use of GPOs linked
across domains, and limit the number of GPOs that affect any given user
or computer. Computer startup and user logon time are affected by the number of GPOs that must be processed. Make use of
security groups to filter the effect of group policies because this
will reduce the number of GPOs to be processed. Also disable the unused
portion of a GPO. This will speed up the processing of GPOs.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 Advanced Server includes all of the same features as
Windows 2000 Server and additional features that provide a highly
scalable, interoperable, available, and manageable operating system.
Windows 2000 Datacenter Server builds upon Windows 2000 Advanced
Server.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Identify features and enhancements in Windows 2000 Advanced
Server.</li></p>

<p><li>Identify key benefits of Windows 2000 Datacenter
Server.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 5 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="55"><H2>Windows 2000 Advanced Server</H2></A>

<p>In addition to providing the features in Windows 2000 Server,
Windows 2000 Advanced Server includes:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Enterprise Memory Architecture.</b> Allows applications
that perform transaction processing or decision support on large data
sets to keep more data in memory for greatly improved performance.
Windows 2000 Advanced Server supports physical memories greater than 4
GB on Alpha-based and Intel Pentium II Xeon systems. Depending on the
specific platform, physical memory sizes as large as 64 GB can be
supported.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Increased SMP scalability.</b> Supports up to four
processors processors on a clean install and up to eight processors on
an upgrade.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Windows Clustering.</b> Allows you to connect multiple
servers to form a cluster of servers that work together as a single
system. Windows Clustering provides the following benefits:</li></p>

<p><li><b>High-availability.</b> Provides high availability for
mission-critical applications, including the ability to automatically
detect the failure of an application and quickly restart it on a
different server. In addition, when one server in the cluster fails,
another server in the cluster can be used to restore service to
users.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Network load balancing.</b> Provides high availability
and scalability for network-based services, such as TCP/IP and Web services.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Component load balancing clusters.</b> Allow you to
create a cluster that does class load balancing across COM+ application
server computers creating application clusters that allow organizations to scale applications
by simply plugging in additional nodes.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="56"><H2>Windows 2000 Datacenter Server</H2></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Datacenter Server builds upon the features in Windows
2000 Advanced Server, making it the most powerful and functional server
operating system ever offered by Microsoft.</p>

<p>Key benefits of Windows 2000 Datacenter Server include the
following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Support for up to 16 processors or up to 32 processors
through Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)</li></p>

<p><li>Support for up to 64 GB of memory on Intel-based systems and
up to 32 GB on Alpha-based systems</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Like Windows 2000 Advanced Server, Windows 2000 Datacenter Server
provides both clustering and load balancing services as standard
features. Windows 2000 Datacenter Server is optimized for the
following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Large data warehouses</li></p>

<p><li>Econometric analysis</li></p>

<p><li>Large-scale simulations in science and engineering</li></p>

<p><li>Online transaction processing</li></p>

<p><li>Server consolidation projects</li></p>

<p><li>Large-scale ISPs and Web-site hosting</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="57"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Advanced Server includes all of the same features as
Windows 2000 Server and additional features that provide a highly
scalable, interoperable, available, and manageable operating system.
One of these additional features is Enterprise Memory Architecture, which allows applications that
perform transaction processing or decision support on large data sets
to keep more data in memory for greatly improved performance. Windows
2000 Advanced Server supports physical memories greater than 4 GB on
Alpha-based and Intel Pentium II Xeon systems. Depending on the
specific platform, physical memory sizes as large as 64 GB can be
supported.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 Advanced Server also supports increased SMP scalability
with support for up to four processors and Windows Clustering, which
allows you to connect multiple servers to form a cluster of servers
that work together as a single system. Two key benefits of Windows 2000
Datacenter Server are support for up to 16 processors, with support for
up to 32 processors through OEMs, and support for up to 64 GB of
memory. Like Windows 2000 Advanced Server, Windows 2000 Datacenter Server provides both clustering and load balancing services as standard features.</p>

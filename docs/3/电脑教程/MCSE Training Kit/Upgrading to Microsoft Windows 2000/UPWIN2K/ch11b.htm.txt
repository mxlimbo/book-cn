<p>If you have free space on your hard disk, you need to partition and
format it so that you can store data on that part of the disk. In
addition, if you have more than one hard disk, each disk will also have
to be partitioned and formatted so that you can store data on it.
Windows 2000 supports two types of disk storage: basic storage and
dynamic storage. A physical disk must be either basic or dynamic; you
cannot use both storage types on one disk. You can, however, use both
types of disk storage in a multidisk system.</p>

<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>
<ul>
<p><li>Describe disk management concepts.</li></p>

<A NAME="513"><H2>Understanding Basic Storage</H2></A>

<p>Before Windows 2000, the only type of disk storage available was the
industry standard that is referred to in Windows 2000 as <i>basic
storage</i>. It dictates the division of a hard disk into partitions. A
<i>partition</i> is a portion of the disk that functions as a
physically separate unit of storage. Windows 2000 recognizes primary
and extended partitions. A disk that is initialized for basic storage
is called a <i>basic disk</i>. A basic disk can contain primary partitions and
extended partitions with logical drives. For Windows 2000, basic
storage is the default, so all disks are basic disks until you convert
them to dynamic storage. Basic storage in Windows 2000 provides compatibility with disk partitions and sets created with Microsoft Windows NT 4.0.</p>

<A NAME="514"><H2>Partitioning Basic Disks</H2></A>

<p>In Windows 2000, you can create, delete, and format partitions
without having to restart your computer to make the changes effective.
When you create partitions, you should leave a minimum of 1 megabyte
(MB) of unallocated space on the disk in case you decide later to
convert the basic disk to a dynamic disk. The conversion process
creates a 1 MB region at the end of the dynamic disk in which it stores
a database that tracks the configuration of all dynamic disks in the
computer.</p>

<p>You can divide a basic disk into <i>primary</i> and <i>extended</i>
partitions. This allows you to separate different types of information,
such as user data on one partition and applications on another. A basic
disk can contain up to four primary partitions, or up to three primary
partitions and one extended partition, for a maximum of four
partitions, and only one partition can be an extended partition (see
Figure 11.1.)</p>

<A NAME="515"><H3>Primary Partitions</H3></A>

<p>Windows 2000 can use one of the primary partitions to start the
computer. The computer looks for the boot files to start the operating
system on the primary partition that has been designated as the <i>
active</i> partition. Only a primary partition can be marked as the
active partition and only one partition on a single hard disk can be
active at a time. To dual boot Windows 2000 with Microsoft Windows 95
or MSDOS, the active partition must be formatted as file allocation
table (FAT) because Windows 95 cannot read a partition formatted as
FAT32 or NT file system (NTFS).</p>

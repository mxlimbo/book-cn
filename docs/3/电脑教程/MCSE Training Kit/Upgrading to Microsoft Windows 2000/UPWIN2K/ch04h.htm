<p>Here are some questions to help you determine if you have learned
enough to move on to the <a href="ch05a.htm">next chapter</a>. If you have difficulty answering
these questions, please go back and review the material in this chapter
before beginning the next chapter. The answers to these questions are
located in <a href="chaaa.htm">Appendix A</a>, &quot;Questions and Answers.&quot;</p>

<ol>
<p><li>List three of the items that you should check on a server before
running the Active Directory Installation wizard.   </li></p>

<p><li>You have installed Active Directory directory services on your
corporate network and have upgraded all domain controllers running
Windows NT 4.0 to Windows 2000. You now want to create security-type
universal groups. What should you do and what console should you use to
make the change?   </li></p>

<p><li>You are the administrator of a network in a remote location, and
the network connection from the main office to that location has
failed. You find you are still able to create user accounts even though
the connection has failed, and users are noticing no difference in
logon speed. What would you need at the remote location for this to be
possible?   </li></p>

<p><li>Your company has one remote office connected by a 64 Kbps WAN
link. Technical support is receiving calls from users in the remote
office who are complaining that it is sometimes taking over five
minutes to log on. You have configured a domain controller and a global
catalog server in the remote office. What is a potential source of the problem? Describe the
steps you would take to improve logon times.   </li></p>

<p><li>You have three locations (A, B, and C) that are connected to a
central site (D) by 128 Kbps WAN links, and another remote location (E)
connected to the central site by a 256 Kbps WAN link. You create a site
for each location. What site links should you create to enable
replication to take place, and given only the bandwidth information
about the links, what cost should be associated with each site
link?</li></p>

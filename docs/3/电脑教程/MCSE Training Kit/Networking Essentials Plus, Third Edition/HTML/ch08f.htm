<A NAME="480"><h1>Chapter Summary</h1></A>
<p>The following points summarize the key concepts of this chapter:</p>

<A NAME="481"><h3>Choosing a Network Design</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li>The first step in network design is to decide whether the network will be peer-to-peer or server-based.</li></p>

<p><li>Take a detailed inventory of all the available networking hardware, software, and
telecommunications equipment on hand before recommending any equipment purchases for a new
LAN.</li></p>

<p><li>Create a map of the facility layout and the network (logical and physical) as爐he beginning of your network-documentation package.</li></p>

<p><li>Installing network media is difficult, and complex configurations require
a爌rofessional installer. Basic installations can be accomplished without professional
assistance.</li></p>

<p><li>By knowing the specifics of each piece of hardware that will be on the network, you can map a network design and foresee potential problems.</li></p>

<p><li>Addressing potential problems before implementing the network can save time and expense.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="482"><h3>Establishing a Client/Server Environment</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li>The client/server model has several advantages over a centralized network; in爐his model, tasks are divided between client and server, resulting in a more efficient network.</li></p>

<p><li>Client/server networks can be arranged in two ways: the data can be on a single server or distributed across many servers.</li></p>

<p><li>Client/server networks commonly use structured query language (SQL) for database management.</li></p>

<p><li>In a client/server network, the client, or front end, is responsible for presenting
data in a useful form and for writing reports; the server, or back end, is responsible for
storing and managing the data.</li></p>

<p><li>Client/server networks can be arranged in two ways: data can be stored on a single server or distributed across several servers.</li></p>
</ul>


<A NAME="483"><h3>Working with Device Drivers and Network Interface Cards (NICS)</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li>Computer operating systems use software drivers to control devices.</li></p>

<p><li>Network interface card (NIC) drivers reside in the Media Access Control sublayer of the data-link layer of the OSI reference model.</li></p>

<p><li>Methods for installing drivers vary with the operating system used.</li></p>

<p><li>Manufacturers release updated drivers for their devices. These drivers can
be燿ownloaded from the Internet or a bulletin board and installed to provide improved
performance.</li></p>

<p><li>Old and unused drivers should be removed to prevent conflicts.</li></p>

<p><li>When choosing a NIC, be sure to weigh factors such as the type of bus, the speed of the card, and the media connection before making your decision.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="484"><h3>Ensuring Hardware Compatibility</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li>Hardware compatibility is important because each piece of hardware on the network must be able to communicate with other hardware on the network.</li></p>

<p><li>Decisions made before installation will either limit or open up future expansion and performance of a network.</li></p>

<p><li>To minimize hardware conflicts, read the documentation that comes with the hardware product.</li></p>

<p><li>Minimum hardware requirements represent values that are sufficient only to allow the system to start.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="26"><h1>The Network+ Certification Program</h1></A>
<p><i>Network+</i> is a testing program sponsored by the Computing Technology Industry
Association (CompTIA) that certifies the knowledge of networking technicians who have
accumulated 18 to 24 months of experience in the IT industry. This test is administered by
Sylvan Prometric and was launched April 30, 1999.</p>

<p>Development of <i>Network+</i> certification began in 1995, when a group of
technology-industry companies came together to create the IT Skills Project. This committee was
formed to direct CompTIA in identifying, classifying, and publishing skills standards for
networking professionals employed in three types of organizations: information technology
companies, channel partners, and business/ government firms. Acting on the committee's
recommendations, CompTIA defined these job skills through an industry-wide survey. Results and
analyses of this survey were used as a foundation for the <i>Network+</i> certification
program.</p>

<p>Earning the <i>Network+</i> certification means that the successful candidate possesses the
knowledge needed to configure and install the TCP/IP client. This exam covers a wide range of
vendor and product-neutral networking technologies.</p>

<A NAME="27"><h2><i>Network</i>+ Exam Objectives</h2></A>
<p>The <i>Network+</i> exam objectives are organized into two distinct groups: &quot;Knowledge
of Networking Technology&quot; and &quot;Knowledge of Networking Practices.&quot; The following
table lists objective domains within each of these groups. (This table is included to clarify
the test objectives and should not be construed as a comprehensive listing of the content of
the exam.)</p>

<A NAME="28"><h2>Registering for the <i>Network+</i> Exam</h2></A>
<p>Anyone who wishes to do so can take the <i>Network+</i> test; there are no specific
requirements or prerequisites, except payment of the fee. However, exam content is targeted to
computer technicians with 18 to 24 months of experience in the IT industry. A typical candidate
would have CompTIA <i>A+</i> certification or equivalent knowledge, but <i>A+</i> certification
is not required. The <i>Network+</i> exam consists of 65 questions that must be answered within
a maximum allowable time of 90 minutes.</p>

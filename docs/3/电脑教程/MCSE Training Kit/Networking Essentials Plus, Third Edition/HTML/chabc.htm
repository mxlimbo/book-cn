<h1>Standards Organizations</h1>
<A NAME="838"></A>

<p>There is no single source for all networking standards. Usually, a standards organization
coordinates the specifications for various pieces of equipment or爏ets the parameters for
features or functions. However, sometimes a need for a new standard will set events in motion
and eventually result in a standard through consensus or through the action of the market
place.</p>

<p>Most local and international network standards have originated with a limited number of
organizations. Each of these organizations defines standards for a different area of network
activity. The organizations are:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>American National Standards Institute (ANSI).</li></p>
<p><li>Comit&eacute; Consultatif lnternationale de T&eacute;l&eacute;graphie et T&eacute;l&eacute;phonie (CCITT).</li></p>
<p><li>Electronics Industries Association (EIA).</li></p>
<p><li>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).</li></p>
<p><li>International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</li></p>
<p><li>Object Management Group (OMG).</li></p>
<p><li>Open Software Foundation (OSF).</li></p>
<p><li>SQL Access Group (SAG).</li></p>
</ul>

<p>It is important to be aware of these organizations because their acronyms have become a
common feature of the general networking vocabulary.</p>

<A NAME="839"><h2>American National Standards Institute (ANSI)</h2></A>
<p>ANSI is an organization of U.S. industry and business groups dedicated to the
development of trade and communication standards. ANSI defines and publishes standards for:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Codes.</li></p>
<p><li>Alphabets.</li></p>
<p><li>Signaling schemes.</li></p>
<p><li>Communications protocols.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>ANSI also represents the United States in the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and
the International Telecommunications Union (ITU).</p>

<h3>ANSI in Microcomputers</h3>

<p>In the microcomputer field, ANSI is commonly encountered in the areas of programming
languages and the SCSI interface. Programming languages, such as燙, conform to ANSI
recommendations to eliminate problems in transporting a爌rogram from one type of computer
system or environment to another.</p>

<A NAME="841"><h2>Electronics Industries Association (EIA)</h2></A>
<p>The EIA is an organization founded in 1924 by U.S. manufacturers of electronic parts and
equipment. It develops industry standards for the interface between data processing and
communications equipment and has published many standards associated with telecommunications and
computer communication. The EIA works closely with other associations such as ANSI and ITU
(CCITT).</p>

<h3>CCITT Equivalents</h3>

<p>BIA standards often have CCITT equivalents. RS-232, for example, is also the CCITT V.24
standard.</p>

<A NAME="842"><h2>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)</h2></A>
<p>The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is a U.S.-based
society that publishes a variety of standards including those for data communications.</p>

<h3>The 802 Committees</h3>

<p>A subgroup of the IEEE, the 802 committees began developing network specifications in 1980
to ensure low-cost interfaces. These specifications are passed on to the ANSI for approval and
standardization within the United States. They are also forwarded to the ISO.</p>

<p>Shortly after the 802 project began, the IEEE realized that a single network standard would
be inadequate because it would not be able to account for the diverse hardware and emerging
architectures. To adequately cover the wide range of subjects, the society established 
committees that were to be responsible for defining standards in different networking
areas.</p>

<h3>The 802 Committees</h3>

<p>The 802 committees are:</p>

<p><table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr>

<A NAME="843"><h2>International Organization for Standardization (ISO)</h2></A>
<p>The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is a Paris-based organization
of member countries, each of which is represented by its leading standard-setting organization.
For example, ANSI represents the United States, and the British Standards Institution (BSI)
represents the United Kingdom. Other爋rganizations represented at the ISO include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Governmental bodies such as the U.S. State Department.</li></p>
<p><li>Businesses.</li></p>
<p><li>Educational institutes.</li></p>
<p><li>Research organizations.</li></p>
<p><li>CCITT.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>The ISO works to establish international standardization of all services and manufactured
products.</p>

<h3>ISO Computer Communication Goals</h3>

<p>In the area of computing, the ISO's goal is to establish global standards for
communications and information exchange. The standards will promote open networking
environments that let multivendor computer systems communicate with one another using protocols
that have been accepted internationally by the ISO membership.</p>

<h3>The ISO Model</h3>

<p>The ISO's major achievement in the area of networking and communications has been to
define a set of standards, known as the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) reference model which defines
standards for the interaction of computers connected by communications networks.</p>

<A NAME="844"><h2>Object Management Group (OMG)</h2></A>
<p>The OMG consists of almost 300 organizations involved in developing a suite of爈anguages,
interfaces, and protocol standards that vendors can use to create applications that will
operate in multivendor environments.</p>

<p>The OMG certifies products designed to meet the standards and specifications agreed upon by
the OMG members.</p>

<p>In working toward its goals, the OMG developed the Object Management Architecture (OMA), a
model for object-oriented applications and environments.</p>

<p>The OMG architecture has been adopted by the Open Software Foundation (OSF), which is
developing portable software environments called the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE)
and the Distributed Management Environment (DME).</p>

<p>The OMG standards are similar to elements in Microsoft object linking and embedding (OLE).</p>

<A NAME="845"><h2>Open Software Foundation (OSF)</h2></A>
<p>The OSF, part of the Open Group, creates computing environments by acquiring and combining
technologies from other vendors and distributing the results to interested parties.</p>

<p>These vendor-neutral environments, referred to as the Open System Software Environment, can
be used to create a collection of open systems technologies in which users can incorporate
software and hardware from several sources.</p>

<p>The following components comprise the OSF software environment:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Distributed Computing Environment (DCE)</li></p>

<p>This platform simplifies the development of products in a mixed environment.</p>

<p><li>Distributed Management Environment (DME)</li></p>
<p>The DME makes tools available for managing systems in distributed and multivendor environments.</p>
<p><li>The Open Software Foundation/1 (OSF/1)</li></p>
<p>This is a UNIX operating system, based on the Mach kernel, that supports symmetric multiprocessing, enhanced security features, and dynamic configuration.</p>
<p><li>OSF/Motif</li></p>
<p>This is a graphical user interface that creates a common environment with links to IBM's Common User Access (CUA).</p>
<p><li>OSF Architecture-Neutral Distribution Format (ANDF)</li></p>
<p>Developers can use this environment to create a single version of an application that can be used on different hardware architectures.</p>
</ul>

<A NAME="846"><h2>SQL Access Group (SAG)</h2></A>
<p>A part of the ANSI standards, SAG is a consortium of 39 companies that was founded in 1989
by Hewlett-Packard, Digital, Oracle Corporation, and Sun Microsystems. Its charter is to work
with the ISO to create standards covering the interoperability of front- and back-end
systems.</p>

<p>SAG's purpose is to promote interoperability among structured query language (SQL)
standards so that several SQL-based relational databases and tools can work together in a
multivendor database environment. This will make it possible for different database
applications running on different platforms to share and exchange data.</p>

<h3>SAG Technical Specifications</h3>

<p>SAG has developed three technical specifications:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Structured query language</li></p>
<p>This is a specification that follows international specifications in implementing the SQL language.</p>
<p><li>SQL Remote Database Access</li></p>
<p>This specification defines communication between a remote database server and an SQL-based client.</p>
<p><li>SQL Access Call-Level Interface (CLI)</li></p>
<p>This group of APIs provides interfacing with SQL-based products.</p>
</ul>

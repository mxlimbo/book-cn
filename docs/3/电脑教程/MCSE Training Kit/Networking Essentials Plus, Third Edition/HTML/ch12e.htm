<A NAME="671"><h1>Chapter Summary</h1></A>
<p>The following points summarize the key concepts of this chapter:</p>

<A NAME="672"><h3>Documenting a Running Network</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li> By creating a good inventory and a baseline of performance values, you can establish
a benchmark against which to compare network performance in the future and identify any needed
modifications.</li></p>

<p><li>A network monitor is used to capture and filter data packets and analyze network activity.</li></p>

<p><li> A protocol analyzer is a tool that is used to track network statistics.</li></p>

<p><li>Identifying network bottlenecks will help to determine what network components need to be upgraded.</li></p>

<p><li> Ping and tracert utilities are used to confirm network connections.</li></p>

<p><li> Performance monitors are tools that can be used to track server performance.</li></p>

<p><li>Network operating system manufacturers have created system-management software to aid with monitoring and managing the total system.</li></p>

<p><li>After establishing a baseline, the administrator needs to maintain a history of爐he network by documenting any subsequent changes and their impact on the system.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="673"><h3>Upgrading a Network</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li>If a network server's CPU is busy over 80 percent of the time, the CPU or the amount of memory in the server might need to be upgraded.</li></p>

<p><li> Performance-monitoring tools can check individual disks for excessive activity. When
a disk has a slow response due to excess activity, disk access can be balanced by moving data
to another disk.</li></p>

<p><li>If a network has been designed as a bus topology and its users are experiencing frequent network crashes, it might be necessary to upgrade to a star or ring topology.</li></p>

<p><li>The three elements of a server that need to be considered for upgrading are memory (RAM), disk space, and processing power.</li></p>

<p><li>The benefits of upgrading a server are faster processing, the ability to handle more users, and the ability to run more sophisticated software.</li></p>

<p><li>Upgrading a NIC can increase the speed at which a server or workstation can access a network, thus improving performance.</li></p>

<p><li>Upgrading the network media can be expensive, but can improve the speed and performance of an older network.</li></p>

<p><li>To install a new NIC card, you need to follow the same procedures as installing any other expansion card.</li></p>

<p><li> Installing new media for a network can require the expertise of a professional
installer. This is especially true if you need to upgrade to fiber optics or wireless
systems.</li></p>

<p><li>Upgrading routers, brouters, repeaters, and bridges requires a trained technician.</li></p>

<p><li> When an upgrade is complete, it is necessary to confirm the changes.</li></p>

<p><li>The best way to confirm a working NIC is to use the ping utility to ping the爃ost or another workstation.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="674"><h3>Moving a Network</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li> Planning is the key to successfully moving a network.</li></p>

<p><li> For a long or complicated move, it can be best to use professional movers.</li></p>

<p><li>When a network will be down for several days, it is important to communicate to the users the plans for the move and what they can expect.</li></p>

<p><li>If the network cannot afford any down time, the new network will have to be fully operational before the old network is turned off.</li></p>

<p><li>All hardware and software must be verified before the network is turned over to the users.</li></p>
</ul>

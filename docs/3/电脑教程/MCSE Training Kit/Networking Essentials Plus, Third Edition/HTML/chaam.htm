<h2>Lesson 1: Understanding the Problem</h2>

<a name="ans54"><h3>Exercise  13.1: Troubleshooting Problem</h3></a>

<p>Given the following scenario, describe how you would research, identify,
prioritize, and resolve this network problem:</p>

<p>The network has been running well at the site of a small manufacturer. However, a user in
the quality control division now calls to report that she is unable to get the daily status
reports printed by the printer in the department. Meanwhile, the shipping department reports
that a rerouted print job did not print in the quality control department. What is your
strategy for solving this network problem?</p>

<p><b>The problem involves users in two different departments. They do
not report any other problems with their system. Therefore, the problem probably lies with the
printer. The priority of this problem is low to moderate.</b></p>

<p><b>Inspect the printer. Make sure that the power is attached and the
network cable is attached to the printer. It is not uncommon for unusual signals on the network
to cause a printer to stop printing. Before taking any disruptive steps, turn the printer off
and then turn it on again. If this does not work, ask the users to reroute their print jobs to
another printer, if possible, or make it possible for them to do so. Check the print queue
for the presence of unprinted documents; corrupt print files can become stalled in the queue
and prevent further printing. Conduct a self-test of the printer. Send a sample test page to
the printer from a different computer than those experiencing the printing problem. Check the
print queue for a reference to the sample page. After the cause has been determined, resolve
the problem. If your research does not produce a cause, ask for assistance or consult the
documentation that came with the device.</b></p>

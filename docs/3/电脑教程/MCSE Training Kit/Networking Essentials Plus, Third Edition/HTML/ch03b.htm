major access methods: carrier-sense multiple-access methods, token passing, and demand
priority.</p>

<A NAME="153"><h2>The Function of Access Methods</h2></A>
<p>The set of rules that defines how a computer puts data onto the network cable and takes data
from the cable is called an <i>access method</i>. Once data is moving on the network, access
methods help to regulate the flow of network traffic.</p>

<A NAME="154"><h3>Traffic Control on the Cable</h3></A>
<p>To understand traffic on a computer network, it helps to use an analogy. A network is in
some ways like a railroad track, along which several trains run. The track is interspersed with
occasional railway stations. When a train is on the track, all other trains must abide by a
procedure that governs how and when they enter the flow of traffic. Without such a procedure,
entering trains would collide with the one already on the track.</p>

<p>There are important differences between a railroad system and a computer network, however.
On a network, all traffic appears to move simultaneously, without interruption. Actually, this
appearance of simultaneity is an illusion; in reality, the computers take turns accessing the
network for brief periods of time. The more significant difference arises from the higher speed
at which network traffic moves.</p>

<p>Multiple computers must share access to the cable that connects them. However, if two
computers were to put data onto the cable at the same time, the data packets from one computer
would collide with the packets from the other computer, and both sets of data packets would be
destroyed. Figure 3.1 shows what happens when two computers try to access the network at the
same time.</p>

</p>


<p>If data is to be sent over the network from one user to another, or accessed from a server,
there must be some way for the data to access the cable without running into other data. And
the receiving computer must have reasonable assurance that the data has not been destroyed in a
data collision during transmission.</p>

<p>Access methods need to be consistent in the way they handle data. If different computers
were to use different access methods, the network would fail because some methods would
dominate the cable.</p>

<p>Access methods prevent computers from gaining simultaneous access to the cable. By making
sure that only one computer at a time can put data on the network cable, access methods ensure
that the sending and receiving of network data is an orderly process.</p>

<A NAME="155"><h2>Major Access Methods</h2></A>
<p>The three methods designed to prevent simultaneous use of the network media include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Carrier-sense multiple access methods (with collision detection or with collision avoidance).</li></p>

<p><li> Token-passing methods that allow only a single opportunity to send data.</li></p>

<p><li> Demand-priority methods.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="156"><h3>Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) Access Method</h3></A>
<p>Using the method known as <i>carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection</i> <i>
(CSMA/CD),</i> each computer on the network, including clients and servers, checks the cable
for network traffic. Figure 3.2 illustrates when a computer can and cannot transmit data.</p>


<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F03xx02x.htm')"> <img src="images/F03xx02.JPG" width=404 height=494 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 3.2</b> <i>Computers can transmit data only if the cable is free</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>Only when a computer &quot;senses&quot; that the cable is free and that there is no traffic
on the cable can it send data. Once the computer has transmitted data on the cable, no other
computer can transmit data until the original data has reached its destination and the cable is
free again. Remember, if two or more computers happen to send data at exactly the same time,
there will be a data collision. When that happens, the two computers involved stop transmitting
for a random period of time and then attempt to retransmit. Each computer determines its own
waiting period; this reduces the chance that the computers will once again transmit
simultaneously.</p>

<p>With these points in mind, the name of the access method&#8212;carrier-sense multiple access
with collision detection (CSMA/CD)&#8212;makes sense. Computers listen to or &quot;sense&quot;
the cable (carrier-sense). Commonly, many computers on the network attempt to transmit data
(multiple access); each one first listens to detect any possible collisions. If a computer
detects a possible collision, it waits for a random period of time before retransmitting
(collision detection).</p>

<p>The collision-detection capability is the parameter that imposes a distance limitation on
CSMA/CD. Due to attenuation&#8212;the weakening of a transmitted signal as it travels farther
from its source, discussed in <A HREF="ch02a.htm">Chapter 2</A>, &quot;Basic Network Media&quot;&#8212;the collision detection
mechanism is not effective beyond 2500 meters (1.5 miles). Segments cannot sense signals beyond
that distance and, therefore, might not be aware that a computer at the far end of a large
network is transmitting. If more than one computer transmits data on the network at the same
time, a data collision will take place that will corrupt the data.</p>

CD accompanying this book to view a demonstration of the CSMA/CD access method.</p>

<p><b>Contention Method</b></p>

<p>CSMA/CD is known as a <i>contention</i> method because computers on the network contend, or
compete, for an opportunity to send data.</p>

<p>This might seem like a cumbersome way to put data on the cable, but current implementations
of CSMA/CD are so fast that users are not even aware they are using a contention access
method.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/multime.JPG" width=68 height=51 border="0">
</p>

<p>Run the <b>c03dem06</b> video located in the <b>Demos</b> folder on the CD accompanying this
book to view a demonstration of why CSMA/CD is considered a contention method.</p>

<p><b>CSMA/CD Considerations</b></p>

<p>The more computers there are on the network, the more network traffic there will be. With
more traffic, collision avoidance and collisions tend to increase, which slows the network
down, so CSMA/CD can be a slow-access method.</p>

<p>After each collision, both computers will have to try to retransmit their data. If the
network is very busy, there is a chance that the attempts by both computers will result in
collisions with packets from other computers on the network. If this happens, four computers
(the two original computers and the two computers whose transmitted packets collided with the
original computer's retransmitted packets) will have to attempt to retransmit. These
proliferating retransmissions can slow the network to a near standstill.</p>

<p>The occurrence of this problem depends on the number of users attempting to use the network
and which applications they are using. Database applications tend to put more traffic on the
network than word-processing applications do.</p>

<p>Depending on the hardware components, the cabling, and the networking software, using a
CSMA/CD network with many users running several database applications can be very frustrating
because of heavy network traffic.</p>

<A NAME="157"><h3>Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) Access Method</h3></A>
<p><i>Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)</i> is the least popular
of the three major access methods. In CSMA/CA, each computer signals its intent to transmit
before it actually transmits data. In this way, computers sense when a collision might occur;
this allows them to avoid transmission collisions. Unfortunately, broadcasting the intent to
transmit data increases the amount of traffic on the cable and slows down network
performance.</p>

<p>Run the <b>c03dem07</b> video located in the <b>Demos</b> folder on the CD accompanying this
book to view a demonstration of the CSMA/CA access method.</p>

<A NAME="158"><h3>Token-Passing Access Method</h3></A>
<p>In the access method known as <i>token passing</i>, a special type of packet, called
a token, circulates around a cable ring from computer to computer. When any computer on the
ring needs to send data across the network, it must wait for a free token. When a free token is
detected, the computer will take control of it if the computer has data to send.</p>

<p>The computer can now transmit data. Data is transmitted in frames, and additional
information, such as addressing, is attached to the frame in the form of headers and trailers,
discussed later in this chapter.</p>

<p>In Figure 3.3, the server is shown transmitting data. It takes control of the free token on
the ring and sends data to the computer with the address 400080865402.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 3.3</b> <i>Token-passing access method</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>While the token is in use by one computer, other computers cannot transmit data. Because
only one computer at a time can use the token, no contention and no collision take place, and
no time is spent waiting for computers to resend tokens due to network traffic on the
cable.</p>

demonstrations of the token-passing access method.</p>

<A NAME="159"><h3>Demand Priority Access Method</h3></A>
<p><i>Demand priority</i> is a relatively new access method designed for the 100-Mbps Ethernet
standard known as 100VG-AnyLAN. It has been sanctioned and standardized by the Institute of
Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) in its 802.12 specification, which is discussed
later in this chapter.</p>

<p>This access method is based on the fact that repeaters and end nodes are the two components
that make up all 100VG-AnyLAN networks. Figure 3.4 shows a demand-priority network. The
repeaters manage network access by doing round-robin searches for requests to send from all
nodes on the network. The repeater, or hub, is responsible for noting all addresses, links, and
end nodes and verifying that they are all functioning. According to the 100VG-AnyLAN
definition, an end node can be a computer, bridge, router, or switch.</p>

CD accompanying this book to view a demonstration of the demand-priority access method.</p>

<p><b>Demand-Priority Contention</b> </p>

<p>As in CSMA/CD, two computers using the demand-priority access method can cause contention by
transmitting at exactly the same time. However, with demand priority, it is possible to
implement a scheme in which certain types of data will be given priority if there is
contention. If the hub or repeater receives two requests at the same time, the highest priority
request is serviced first. If the two requests are of the same priority, both requests are
serviced by alternating between the two.</p>

<p>In a demand-priority network, computers can receive and transmit at the same time because of
the cabling scheme defined for this access method. In this method, four pairs of wires are
used, which enables quartet signaling, transmitting 25 MHz signals on each of the pairs of wire
in the cable.</p>

<p><b>Demand-Priority Considerations</b> </p>

<p>In a demand-priority network, there is communication only between the sending computer, the
hub, and the destination computer. This is more efficient than CSMA/CD, which broadcasts
transmissions to the entire network. In demand priority, each hub knows only about the end
nodes and repeaters directly connected to it, whereas in a CSMA/CD environment, each hub knows
the address of every node in the network.</p>

<p><b>Demand priority offers several advantages over CSMA/CD including:</b> </p>

<ul>
<p><li> The use of four pairs of wires.</li></p>

<p>By using four pairs of wires, computers can transmit and receive at the same time.</p>

<p><li> Transmissions through the hub.</li></p>

<p>Transmissions are not broadcast to all the other computers on the network. The computers do
not contend on their own for access to the cable, but operate under the centralized control of
the hub.</p>
</ul>

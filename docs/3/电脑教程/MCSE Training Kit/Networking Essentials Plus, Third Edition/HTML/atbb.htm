<A NAME="2"><h1>Intended Audience</h1></A>
<p>This book was developed for information system (IS) professionals who need to design, plan,
implement, and support computer networks or who plan to take the related Microsoft Certified
Professional exam 70-058, <i>Networking Essentials,</i> or the CompTIA <i>Network+</i> exam.
The book is intended to reach a broad audience, encompassing readers who are relatively new to
networking as well as more experienced computer professionals. For tips on how to customize the
course to meet your needs, see the section &quot;<A HREF="atbf.htm#9">Finding the Best Starting Point for You</A>&quot;
later in this chapter.</p>

<A NAME="3"><h2>Prerequisites</h2></A>
<p>Readers need not have completed any computer courses prior to working through this
self-paced training kit. Anyone who wishes to do so is eligible to take the <i>Networking
Essentials</i> and <i>Network+</i> exams. The <i>Network+</i> exam is targeted to computer
service technicians with at least 18 to 24 months on-the-job experience, although no specific
requirements are set out.</p>

<p>The &quot;<A HREF="atbg.htm#13">Getting Started</A>&quot; section later in this chapter describes the hardware and
software you will need in order to complete the exercises and view the demonstration files that
are a part of this course. Read through that section carefully before you start the
lessons.</p>

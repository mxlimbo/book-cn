<A NAME="377"><h1>Lesson 1: Connectivity Devices</h1></A>
<p>This lesson is devoted to the hardware that is used to expand networks. We begin with the
most basic communication device: the modem. Modems have become so common that they are standard
equipment on most computers sold today. Indeed, anyone who has ever used the Internet or a fax
machine has used a modem. In addition to modems, several devices are used to connect small LANs
into larger wide area networks (WANs). Each of these devices has its own function along with
some limitations. They can be used simply to extend the length of network media or to provide
access to a worldwide network over the Internet. Devices used to expand LANs include repeaters,
bridges, routers, brouters, and gateways.</p>

<A NAME="378"><h2>Modem Technology</h2></A>
<p>A modem is a device that makes it possible for computers to communicate over a telephone
line.</p>

<p>When computers are too far apart to be joined by a standard computer cable, a <i>modem</i>
can enable communication between them. Remember from <A HREF="ch02a.htm#92">Chapter 2</A>, &quot;Basic Network Media,&quot; that network cables are limited in length. In a network environment, modems serve
as a means of communication between networks and as a way to connect to the world beyond the
local network.</p>

a telephone line.</p>

<A NAME="379"><h3>Basic Modem Functions</h3></A>
<p>Computers cannot simply be connected to each other over a telephone line, because computers
communicate by sending digital electronic pulses (electronic signals), and a telephone line can
send only analog waves (sound). Figure 7.1 shows the difference between digital computer
communication and analog telephone communication.</p>

<!--caption--><b>Figure 7.1</b> <i>Digital signals versus analog waves</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>A digital signal has a binary form. The signal can have a value of either 0 or 1. An analog
signal can be pictured as a smooth curve that can represent an infinite range of values.</p>

functions.</p>

<p>As shown in Figure 7.2, the modem at the sending end converts the computer's digital
signals into analog waves and transmits the analog waves onto the telephone line. A modem at
the receiving end converts the incoming analog signals back into digital signals for the
receiving computer.</p>

<p>In other words, a sending modem <i>MO</i>dulates digital signals into analog signals, and a
receiving modem <i>DEM</i>odulates analog signals back into digital signals.</p>

<p>Modems are known as data communications equipment (DCE) and share the following
characteristics:</p>

<p><li> A serial (RS-232) communications interface</li></p>

<p><li> An RJ-11 telephone-line interface (a four-wire telephone plug)</li></p>

<p>An external modem, as shown in Figure 7.4, is a small box that is connected to the computer
by a serial (RS-232) cable running from the computer's serial port to the modem's
computer cable connection. The modem uses a cable with an 
RJ-11C connector to connect to the wall.</p>

<A NAME="381"><h3>Modem Standards</h3></A>
<p>Standards are necessary so that modems from one manufacturer can communicate with modems
from another manufacturer. This section explains some of the common industry standards for
modems.</p>

<p><b>Hayes-Compatible</b></p>

<p>In the early 1980s, a company called Hayes Microcomputer Products developed a modem called
the Hayes Smartmodem. The Smartmodem became the standard against which other modems were
measured, and generated the phrase &quot;Hayes-compatible,&quot; just as IBM's personal
computer generated the term &quot;IBM-compatible.&quot; Because most vendors conformed to the
Hayes standards, nearly all LAN modems could communicate with each other.</p>

<p>The early Hayes-compatible modems sent and received data at 300 bits per second (bps). Modem
manufacturers currently offer modems with speeds of 56,600 bps or more.</p>

<p><b>International Standards</b></p>

<p>Since the late 1980s, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) has developed
standards for modems. These specifications, known as the V series, include a number that
indicates the standard. As a reference point, the V.22bis modem at 2400 bps would take 18
seconds to send a 1000-word letter. The V.34 modem at 9600 bps would take only four seconds to
send the same letter, and the V.42bis compression standard in a 14,400 bps modem can send the
same letter in only three seconds.</p>

<p>The chart in Table 7.1 presents the compression standards and their parameters since 1984.
The compression standard and the bps are not necessarily related. The standard could be used
with any speed of modem.</p>

<A NAME="382"><h3>Modem Performance</h3></A>
<p>Initially, a modem's speed was measured in either bps or something called the &quot;baud rate,&quot; and most people mistakenly assumed the two were identical.</p>

<p>&quot;Baud&quot; refers to the speed at which the sound wave that carries a bit of data
over爐he telephone lines oscillates. The term derives from the name of French telegrapher and
engineer Jean-Maurice-Emile Baudot. In the early 1980s, the baud rate did equal the
transmission speed of modems. At that time, 300 baud equaled 300 bits per second.</p>

<p>Eventually, communications engineers learned to compress and encode data so that each
modulation of sound could carry more than one bit of data. This development means that the rate
of bps can be greater than the baud rate. For example, a modem that modulates at 28,800 baud
can actually send at 115,200 bps. Therefore, the current parameter to look for in modem speed
is bps.</p>

<p>Several of the newer modems feature industry standards, such as V.42bis/MNP5 data
compression, and have transmission speeds of 57,600 bps; and some modems go up to 76,800
bps.</p>

<A NAME="383"><h3>Types of Modems</h3></A>
<p>There are different types of modems because different types of communication environments
require different methods of sending data. These environments can be divided roughly into two
areas related to the timing of communications:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Asynchronous</li></p>

<p><li> Synchronous</li></p>
</ul>

<p>The type of modem a network uses depends on whether the environment is asynchronous or
synchronous.</p>

<p><b>Asynchronous Communication (Async)</b></p>

<p><i>Asynchronous communication</i>, known as &quot;async,&quot; is possibly the most
widespread form of connectivity in the world. This is because async was developed in爋rder to
make use of common telephone lines.</p>

<p>Figure 7.5 shows an asynchronous environment, in which data is transmitted in a serial
stream.</p>


<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F07xx05x.htm')"> <img src="images/F07xx05.JPG" width=404 height=74 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 7.5</b> <i>Asynchronous serial data stream</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>Each character&#8212;letter, number, or symbol&#8212;is turned into a string of bits. Each of
these strings is separated from the other strings by a start-of-character bit and a stop bit.
Both the sending and receiving devices must agree on the start and stop bit sequence. The
receiving computer uses the start and stop bit markers to schedule its timing functions so it
is ready to receive the next byte of data.</p>

<p>Communication is not synchronized. There is no clocking device or method to coordinate
transmission between the sender and the receiver. The sending computer just sends data, and the
receiving computer just receives data. The receiving computer then checks to make sure that the
received data matches what was sent. Between 20 and 27 percent of the data traffic in async
communication consists of燿ata traffic control and coordination. The actual amount depends on
the type of the transmission&#8212;for example, whether parity (a form of error checking,
discussed in the section that follows) is being used.</p>

<p>Asynchronous transmission over telephone lines can happen at up to 28,800 bps. However, the
latest data compression methods can boost the 28,800 bps rate to 115,200 bps over directly
connected systems.</p>

<p>Run the <b>c07dem08</b> and <b>c07dem09</b> videos located in the <b>Demos</b> folder on the
CD燼ccompanying this book for an overview of asynchronous communication.</p>

<p><b>Error Control</b> Because of the potential for error, async can include a special bit,
called a <i>parity bit</i>, which is used in an error-checking and correction scheme called <i>
parity checking</i>. In parity checking, the number of bits sent must match exactly the number
of bits received.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/multime.JPG" width=68 height=51 border="0">
</p>

<p>Run the <b>c07dem10</b> video located in the <b>Demos</b> folder on the CD accompanying this
book to view a presentation of parity bits in asynchronous communication.</p>

<p>The original V.32 modem standard did not provide error control. To help avoid generating
errors during data transmission, a company called Microcom developed its own standard for
asynchronous data-error control, the Microcom Networking Protocol (MNP). The method worked so
well that other companies adopted not only the initial version of the protocol but later
versions, called classes, as well. Currently, several modem manufacturers incorporate MNP
Classes 2, 3, and 4 standards.</p>

<p>In 1989, the Comit&eacute; Consultatif Internationale de T&eacute;l&eacute;graphie et
T&eacute;l&eacute;phonie (CCITT) published an asynchronous error-control scheme called V.42.
This hardware-implemented standard featured two error-control protocols. The primary
error-control scheme is link access procedure for modems (LAPM), but the scheme also uses MNP
Class 4. The LAPM protocol is used in communications between two modems that are
V.42-compliant. If only one, but not both, of the modems is MNP 4compliant, the correct
protocol to use would be MNP 4.</p>

<p><b>Improving Transmission Performance</b> Communication performance depends on two
elements:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Signaling or channel speed describes how fast the bits are encoded onto the communications channel.</li></p>

<p><li> Throughput measures the amount of useful information going across the channel.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>
<img src="images/multime.JPG" width=68 height=51 border="0">
</p>

<p>Run the <b>c07dem11</b> video located in the <b>Demos</b> folder on the CD accompanying this
book to view a presentation of channel speed and throughput.</p>

<p>By removing redundant elements or empty sections, compression improves the time required to
send data. Microcom's MNP Class 5 Data Compression Protocol is an example of one current
data compression standard. You can improve performance, often doubling the throughput, by using
data compression. When both ends of a communication link use the MNP Class 5 protocol, data
transmission time can be cut in half.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/multime.JPG" width=68 height=51 border="0">
</p>

<p>Run the <b>c07dem12</b> video located in the <b>Demos</b> folder on the CD accompanying this
book to view a presentation of data compression.</p>

<p>The V.42bis standard, because it describes how to implement impressive data compression in
hardware, makes even greater performance possible. For example, a 56.6Kbps modem using V.90 can
achieve a throughput of 100Kbps.</p>


<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
Although compressing data can improve performance, it is not an exact
science. Many factors affect the actual compression ratio of a document or file. A爐ext file,
for example, can be compressed more effectively than a complex graphic file. It is even
possible to have a compressed file that is actually larger than the original. Remember,
compression numbers cited by vendors are usually based on a best-case scenario.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p><b>Coordinating the Standards</b> Asynchronous, or serial, modems are less expensive than
synchronous modems because the asynchronous modem does not need the circuitry and the
components to handle the timing involved in synchronous transmission that synchronous modems
require.</p>

<p><b>Synchronous Communication</b></p>

<p><i>Synchronous communication</i> relies on a timing scheme coordinated between two devices
to separate groups of bits and transmit them in blocks known as &quot;frames.&quot; Special
characters are used to begin the synchronization and check its accuracy periodically.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/multime.JPG" width=68 height=51 border="0">
</p>

<p>Run the <b>c07dem13</b> and <b>c07dem14</b> videos located in the <b>Demos</b> folder on the
CD accompanying this book for an overview of synchronous communication.</p>

<p>Because the bits are sent and received in a timed, controlled (synchronized) process, start
and stop bits are not required. Transmission stops at the end of one frame and starts again
with a new one. This start-and-stop approach is much more efficient than asynchronous
transmission, especially when large packets of data are being transferred. When small packets
are sent, this increase in efficiency is less noticeable. Figure 7.6 shows a comparison of
asynchronous and synchronous data streams.</p>

<p>Synchronous protocols perform a number of jobs that asynchronous protocols do爊ot.
Principally, they:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Format data into blocks.</li></p>

<p><li> Add control information.</li></p>

<p><li> Check the information to provide error control.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>The primary protocols in synchronous communication are:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC).</li></p>

<p><li> High-level Data Link Control (HDLC)</li></p>

<p><li> Binary Synchronous Communications Protocol (bisync)</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Synchronous communication is used in almost all digital and network communications. For
example, if you were using digital lines to connect remote computers, you would use synchronous
modems rather than asynchronous modems to connect the computer to the digital line. Generally,
their higher cost and complexity have kept synchronous modems out of the home market.</p>

<p><b>Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL)</b></p>

<p>The latest modem technology to become available is asymmetric digital subscriber line
(ADSL). This technology converts existing twisted-pair telephone lines into access paths for
multimedia and high-speed data communications. These new connections can transmit more than 8
Mbps to the subscriber and up to 1 Mbps from the subscriber.</p>

<p>ADSL is not without drawbacks. The technology requires special hardware, including an ADSL
modem on each end of the connection. It also requires broadband cabling, which is currently
only available in a few locations, and there is a limit to the connection length.</p>

<p>ADSL is recognized as a physical layer transmission protocol for unshielded twisted-pair
media.</p>

<A NAME="384"><h2>Expanding a Network Using Components</h2></A>
<p>As companies grow, so do their networks. LANs tend to outgrow their original designs. You
know your LAN is too small when:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> The cable begins to get crowded with network traffic.</li></p>

<p><li> Print jobs include longer wait times.</li></p>

<p><li>Traffic-generating applications, such as databases, experience increased response times.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>The time usually comes when administrators need to expand the size or improve the
performance of their networks. But networks cannot be made larger merely by adding new
computers and more cable. Each topology or architecture has limits. There are, however,
components that can be installed to increase the size of the network within its existing
environment. These components can:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Segment existing LANs so that each segment becomes its own LAN.</li></p>

<p><li> Join two separate LANs.</li></p>

<p><li>Connect to other LANs and computing environments to join them into a larger comprehensive WAN.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>The components that enable engineers to accomplish these goals are:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Hubs.</li></p>

<p><li> Repeaters.</li></p>

<p><li> Bridges.</li></p>

<p><li> Routers.</li></p>

<p><li> Brouters.</li></p>

<p><li> Gateways.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="385"><h3>Hubs</h3></A>
<p><A HREF="ch02a.htm#92">Chapter 2</A>, &quot;Basic Network Media,&quot; discusses how a hub is used as the central
hardware component in a star topology. <A HREF="ch03a.htm#149">Chapter 3</A>, &quot;Understanding NetworkArchitecture,&quot; discusses how a hub works with a token-ring topology. Hubs can also be used
to expand the size of a LAN. Although using hubs won't convert a LAN into a WAN, connecting
or adding hubs to a LAN can effectively increase the number of workstations. This method of
growing a LAN is popular, but does come with many design limitations. Figure 7.7 shows how
several 10BaseT hubs can be connected to expand a network.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
It is important to be careful when connecting hubs. Crossover cables are
wired differently than standard patch cables, and one will not work correctly in place of the
other. Check with the manufacturers to determine whether you need a standard patch cable or a
crossover cable.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="386"><h3>Repeaters</h3></A>
<p>As signals travel along a cable, they degrade and become distorted in a process called
&quot;attenuation.&quot; (Attenuation is discussed in<A HREF="ch02a.htm#92"> Chapter 2</A>, &quot;Basic NetworkMedia.&quot;) If a cable is long enough, attenuation will finally make a signal unrecognizable.
Installing a repeater enables signals to travel farther.</p>

<p><b>How Repeaters Work</b></p>

<p>A repeater works at the physical layer of the OSI Reference Model to regenerate the
network's signals and resend them out on other segments. Figure 7.9 shows how repeaters
regenerate weak signals.</p>


<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F07xx09x.htm')"> <img src="images/F07xx09.JPG" width=404 height=171 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 7.9</b> <i>Repeaters regenerate weakened signals</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>The repeater takes a weak signal from one segment, regenerates it, and passes it to the next
segment. To pass data through the repeater from one segment to the next, the packets and the
Logical Link Control (LLC) protocols must be identical on each segment. A repeater will not
enable communication, for example, between an 802.3 LAN (Ethernet) and an 802.5 LAN (Token
Ring).</p>

<p>Repeaters do not translate or filter signals. For a repeater to work, both segments that the
repeater joins must use the same access method. The two most common access methods are
carrier-sense multiple-access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) and token passing (discussed
in <A HREF="ch03a.htm#149">Chapter 3</A>, &quot;Understanding Network Architecture&quot;). A repeater cannot connect a
segment using CSMA/CD to a segment using the token-passing access method. That is, a repeater
cannot translate an Ethernet packet into a Token Ring packet.</p>

<p>As shown in Figure 7.10, repeaters can move packets from one kind of physical media to
another. They can take an Ethernet packet coming from a thinnet coaxial-cable segment and pass
it on to a fiber-optic segment, provided the repeater is capable of accepting the physical

</p>


<p>Some multiport repeaters act as multiport hubs and connect different types of media. The
same segment limits discussed in <a href="ch03a.htm">Chapter 3</a> apply to networks that use hubs, but the limits now
refer to each segment extending from a hub rather than to the entire network.</p>

<p><b>Repeater Considerations</b></p>

<p>Repeaters afford the least expensive way to expand a network. When the need arises to extend
the physical network beyond its distance or node limitations, consider using a repeater to link
segments if neither segment is generating much traffic or limiting costs is a major
consideration.</p>

<p><b>No Isolation or Filtering</b> Repeaters send every bit of data from one cable segment to
another, even if the data consists of malformed packets or packets not destined for use on the
network. This means that a problem with one segment can disrupt every other segment. Repeaters
do not act as filters to restrict the flow of problem traffic.</p>

<p>Repeaters will also pass a broadcast storm along from one segment to the next, back and
forth along the network. A broadcast storm occurs when so many broadcast messages are on the
network that the number is approaching the network bandwidth limit. If a device is responding
to a packet that is continuously circulating on the network, or a packet is continuously
attempting to contact a system that never replies, network performance will be degraded.</p>

<p><b>Implementing a repeater</b> This section summarizes what you need to consider when
deciding whether to implement repeaters in your network.</p>

<p>Use a repeater to:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Connect two segments of similar or dissimilar media.</li></p>

<p><li> Regenerate the signal to increase the distance transmitted.</li></p>

<p><li> Pass all traffic in both directions.</li></p>

<p><li> Connect two segments in the most cost-effective manner.</li></p>
</ul>




<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
 Repeaters improve performance by dividing the network into segments,
thus reducing the number of computers per segment. When using repeaters to expand a network,
don't forget about the 5-4-3 rule (introduced in <A HREF="ch03a.htm#149">Chapter 3</A>, &quot;Understanding Network Architecture&quot;).

</p>

<p>Do not use a repeater when:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> There is heavy network traffic.</li></p>

<A NAME="387"><h3>Bridges</h3></A>
<p>Like a repeater, a bridge can join segments or workgroup LANs. Figure 7.11 shows a bridge
connecting two network segments. However, a bridge can also divide a network to isolate traffic
or problems. For example, if the volume of traffic from one or two computers or a single
department is flooding the network with data and slowing down the entire operation, a bridge
could isolate those computers or that department.</p>

<p>Bridges can be used to:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Expand the length of a segment.</li></p>

<p><li> Provide for an increased number of computers on the network.</li></p>

<p><li>Reduce traffic bottlenecks resulting from an excessive number of attached computers.</li></p>

<p><li>Split an overloaded network into two separate networks, reducing the amount of traffic on each segment and making each network more efficient.</li></p>

<p><li> Link unlike physical media such as twisted-pair and coaxial Ethernet.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>How Bridges Work</b></p>

<p>Because bridges work at the data-link layer of the OSI reference model, all information contained in
the higher levels of the OSI reference model is unavailable to them. Rather than distinguish between one
protocol and another, bridges simply pass all protocols along the network. All protocols pass
across bridges, so it is up to the individual computers to determine which protocols they can
recognize.</p>

<p>As discussed in <A HREF="ch05a.htm#285">Chapter 5</A>, &quot;Introducing Network Standards,&quot; the data-link layer
has two sublayers: the Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer and the Media Access Control (MAC)
sublayer. Bridges work at the MAC sublayer and are sometimes referred to as MAC-layer
bridges.</p>

<p>A MAC-layer bridge:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Listens to all traffic.</li></p>

<p><li> Checks the source and destination addresses of each packet.</li></p>

<p><li> Builds a routing table, as information becomes available.</li></p>

<p><li> Forwards packets in the following manner:</li></p>

<ul>

<p><li> If the destination is not listed in the routing table, the bridge forwards the
packets to all segments.</li></p>

<p><li> If the destination is listed in the routing table, the bridge forwards the packets to
that segment (unless it is the same segment as the source).</li></p>
</ul></ul>

<p>A bridge works on the principle that each network node has its own address. A燽ridge
forwards packets based on the address of the destination node.</p>

<p>Bridges actually have some degree of intelligence in that they learn where to forward data.
As traffic passes through the bridge, information about the computer addresses is stored in the
bridge's RAM. The bridge uses this RAM to build a routing table based on source
addresses.</p>

<p>Initially, the bridge's routing table is empty. As nodes transmit packets, the source
address is copied to the routing table. With this address information (See Figure 7.12), the
bridge learns which computers are on which segment of the network.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 7.12</b> <i>The routing table keeps track of addresses</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p><b>Creating the Routing Table</b> Bridges build their routing tables based on the addresses
of computers that have transmitted data on the network. Specifically, bridges use source
addresses&#8212;the address of the device that initiates the transmission&#8212;to create a
routing table.</p>

<p>When the bridge receives a packet, the source address is compared to the routing table. If
the source address is not there, it is added to the table. The bridge then compares the
destination address with the routing-table database.</p>

<ul>
<p><li> If the destination address is in the routing table and is on the same segment as爐he
source address, the packet is discarded. This filtering helps to reduce network traffic and
isolate segments of the network.</li></p>

<p><li> If the destination address is in the routing table and not in the same segment as
the source address, the bridge forwards the packet out of the appropriate port to reach the
destination address.</li></p>

<p><li>If the destination address is not in the routing table, the bridge forwards the packet to all its ports except the one on which it originated.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>In summary, if a bridge knows the location of the destination node, it forwards the packet
to it. If it does not know the destination, it forwards the packet to all segments.</p>

<p><b>Segmenting Network Traffic</b> A bridge can segment traffic because of its routing table.
As shown in Figure 7.13, a computer on segment 1 (the source), sends data to another computer
(the destination) also located in segment 1. If the destination address is in the routing
table, the bridge can determine that the destination computer is also on segment 1. Because the
source and destination computers are燽oth on segment 1, the packet does not get forwarded
across the bridge to segment 2.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 7.13</b> <i>The routing table allows bridges to segment networks</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>Therefore, bridges can use routing tables to reduce the traffic on the network by
controlling which packets get forwarded to other segments. This controlling (or爎estricting) of
the flow of network traffic is known as &quot;segmenting network traffic.&quot;</p>

<p>A large network is not limited to one bridge. Multiple bridges can be used to combine
several small networks into one large network.</p>

<p><b>Remote Bridges</b></p>

<p>Because bridges can be such powerful tools in expanding and segmenting networks, they are
often used in large networks that have widely dispersed segments joined by telephone lines.</p>

<p>Only one bridge is necessary to link two cable segments. However, where two separate LANs
are located at a great distance from each other (See Figure 7.14), they can be joined into a
single network. Implementing two remote bridges connected with synchronous modems to a
dedicated, data-grade telephone line can do this.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 7.14</b> <i>Remote bridges can be used to connect remote segments</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>Because remote LAN segments can be joined over telephone lines, it is possible for multiple
LANs to be joined by more than one path. In this situation, it is possible that data might get
into a continuous loop. To handle this possibility, the

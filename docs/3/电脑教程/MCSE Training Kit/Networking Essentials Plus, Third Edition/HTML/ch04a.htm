<p><A HREF="ch03a.htm#149">Chapter 3</A>, &quot;Understanding Network Architecture,&quot; introduced us to network
architectures and access methods, and described how networks send data. In this chapter, we
learn about network operating systems. Although our primary focus is on Novell and Microsoft
network operating systems, we also take a look at AppleTalk, UNIX and  Banyan Vines, and
briefly survey peer-to-peer local area networks (LANs), including systems running Microsoft
Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95 and 98, and IBM's OS/2.</p>

<A NAME="228"><h2>Before You Begin</h2></A>
<p>This chapter builds on earlier lessons; a review of <a href="ch03a.htm">Chapter 3</a> is especially recommended.
However, some concepts presented here are more advanced than those in earlier chapters. You
might find it helpful to progress more slowly through this chapter than earlier chapters. A
good computer dictionary can also be a useful tool.</p>

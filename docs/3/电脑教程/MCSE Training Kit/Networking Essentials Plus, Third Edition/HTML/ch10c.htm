<A NAME="552"><h2>Computers and the Environment</h2></A>
<p>Most kinds of electronic equipment, such as computers, are rugged and reliable, operating
for years with little maintenance. Computers have even been to the moon and back. However,
negative environmental impacts on electronic equipment, while not always dramatic, do exist. A
slow and steady deterioration process can lead to爄ntermittent but ever-more-frequent problems
until a catastrophic system failure occurs. By recognizing these problems before they occur and
taking appropriate steps, you can prevent or minimize such failures.</p>

<p>Like humans, computers and electronic equipment are affected by environmental conditions.
Although more tolerant and less likely to complain, computers and network equipment require
specific environments in order to function properly. Most computers are installed in
environmentally controlled areas; but even with such controls in place, computers are not
immune from the effects of their surroundings. When assessing how environmental conditions will
affect a computer network, your first step is to consider the climatic conditions of the
region. As shown in Figure 10.5, a network installation in an Arctic or Antarctic location will
be subjected to very different conditions than a network located in a tropical jungle.</p>

</p>


<p>A network installed in an arctic climate will undergo extreme changes in temperature,
whereas a network installed in a tropical environment will experience high humidity. Different
climatic circumstances require that different steps be taken to ensure that the environment
does not negatively affect the network.</p>

<p>Environmental conditions for computers are assumed to be the same as prevailing office
conditions. For a single personal computer or workstation, this assumption is usually accurate.
However, an individual workstation comprises only part of the network. Remember that network
wiring, discussed in <A HREF="ch02a.htm#92">Chapter 2</A>, &quot;Basic Network Media,&quot; runs through walls and in
ceilings, basements, and sometimes outside. Many environmental factors can affect these
components and ultimately lead to a爊etwork deterioration or breakdown.</p>

<p>When planning or maintaining a network, it is important to think in terms of the global
(entire) network, visible or out of sight, and not just the local components that you see every
day, as illustrated in Figure 10.6.</p>

<p>Environmentally triggered disasters are usually the result of a long period of slow
deterioration, rather than a sudden catastrophe. As an example, consider an iron nail. Left
outside and exposed to the elements, it will gradually rust, becoming useless for its original
purpose and, eventually, disintegrate. Similarly, networks implemented in poor environments
might work well for years; however, eventually intermittent problems will start to occur and
the number and frequency of the problems increase until eventually the network goes down.</p>

<A NAME="553"><h2>Creating the Right Environment</h2></A>
<p>In most large organizations, management or the personnel department is responsible for
providing a safe and comfortable environment for employees. Governmental organizations regulate
the human work environment. There are no such regulations or guidance for networks. It is the
responsibility of the network administrator to create policies governing safe practices around
network equipment and to implement and manage an appropriate working environment for the
network.</p>

<p>A healthy environment for network equipment is much like a healthy human environment;
electronic equipment is designed to operate within the same range of temperature and humidity
that feels comfortable to human beings.</p>

<A NAME="554"><h3>Temperature</h3></A>
<p>The basic environmental parameter that we control is temperature. Homes, offices, and work
places usually have some means of controlling the temperature. Because electronic equipment
generates heat during normal operation, it usually has a cooling fan designed to maintain the
temperature within the specified limits. If,爃owever, the room temperature in which the
equipment is located is too high, the cooling fan and ventilation slots will be unable to
maintain the correct operating temperature and components will begin to overheat and fail.
Alternatively, if爐he temperature outdoors is too cold, the components may not function at all.
Figure 10.7 shows the back and side of a computer with its cooling fan and ventilation
slots.</p>

<!--caption--><b>Figure 10.7</b> <i>Keeping the computer cool</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>An environment in which the temperature is constantly cycling between hot and cold presents
the worst scenario for electronic equipment. These extreme changes cause metal components to
expand and contract, which eventually can lead to equipment failure.</p>

<A NAME="555"><h3>Humidity</h3></A>
<p>Factors related to humidity (moisture in the air) can have two negative effects on
electronic equipment. High humidity promotes corrosion. Usually occuring first on爀lectrical
contacts, corroded contacts on cable connections and expansion cards will cause intermittent
failures. Corrosion can also increase the resistance of electrical components, leading to a
temperature increase that can be followed by component failure or fire.</p>

<p>In heated buildings, low humidity is common. Static electrical discharge is more common in
low-humidity environments and can damage electronic components.</p>

<p>Because we have less control over humidity, network administrators need to be aware of the
consequences of very high or low humidity and implement appropriate safeguards where such
conditions exist. Most equipment will function adequately between 50 and 70 percent relative
humidity.</p>

<p>When implementing a large network that includes a dedicated server room, you爏hould consider
controlling temperature and humidity in that room.</p>

<A NAME="556"><h3>Dust and Smoke</h3></A>
<p>Computers and electronic equipment do not function well with dust or smoke. Dust is
electrostatically attracted to electronic equipment. An accumulation of dust causes two
negative effects: dust acts as an insulator that affects the cooling of components, causing
them to overheat, and dust can hold electrical charges, making them conductive. Excessive dust
on electronic equipment can cause electrical shorts and catastrophic equipment failure.</p>

<p>Smoke causes a kind of contamination that is similar to the effects of dust. It coats the
surfaces of electronic components, acting as both insulator and conductor. Smoke residue also
enhances the accumulation of dust.</p>

<A NAME="557"><h3>Human Factors</h3></A>
<p>In designing a network, we can control many environmental factors, such as temperature,
humidity, and ventilation. Although it is theoretically possible to create a perfect physical
environment for computers, the arrival of human beings on the scene will bring changes that are
bound to have an impact on the network. Picture a new, environmentally correct,
equipment-friendly office with an up-to-date computer, printer, and desk. Into this pristine
space, employees bring plants, pictures, radios, coffee cups, books, papers, and space heaters
for cold days. Soon the office is filled up with employees, furniture, storage units, and
office supplies. More changes occur; the tops of computers and monitors serve as end tables,
and empty boxes are stored under desks next to computers. Because few employees have any
awareness of the ventilation requirements for computer equipment, they impede the natural flow
of air in and around the equipment. Once this happens, maintaining the proper temperature is
impossible and failures begin.</p>

<p>The spilling of liquid refreshment takes a toll on keyboards and computers. When it gets
cold outside, space heaters are used in under-heated offices and are usually placed under the
desk, often in close proximity to computers. This can present two problems: the computer
becomes overheated, and the space heaters can overload power outlets, tripping circuit breakers
or even causing fires.</p>

<A NAME="558"><h3>Hidden Factors</h3></A>
<p>As stated earlier, much of a network is out of sight and, therefore, often out of mind.
Because we don't see these hidden elements on a daily basis, we assume that all is well
until something goes wrong.</p>

<p>Wiring is one network component that can cause problems, especially wires lying on the
floor. Wires that run through an attic can easily be damaged by accident during repairs to
other objects in the attic.</p>

<p>Run the <b>c10dem02</b> video located in the <b>Demos</b> folder on the CD accompanying this
book to view a presentation of how environmental factors affect computers, servers, and
networks.</p>

<p>Bugs and rodents of all kinds are another hidden factor; these unwanted guests are likely to
dine on the network materials or use them for construction purposes of their own.</p>

<A NAME="559"><h3>Industrial Factors</h3></A>
<p>Computers are not limited to the office setting; they are vital to the manufacturing sector
as well. At first, computers were used to manage the flow of work through manufacturing
operations. In modern plants, computers also run the equipment. By integrating network
technology into this environment, the entire manufacturing process can be monitored and
controlled from a central location. The equipment can even telephone maintenance personnel at
home when there is燼 problem.</p>

<p>These improvements in manufacturing have led to an increase in productivity, while
presenting unique issues for the network administrator. The operation of network equipment in a
production environment presents many challenges. Issues that need to be addressed when networks
are implemented in a manufacturing setting include the presence of:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Noise.</li></p>

<p><li> Electromagnetic interference (EMI).</li></p>

<p><li> Vibration.</li></p>

<p><li> Corrosive and explosive environments.</li></p>

<p><li> Untrained and unskilled workers.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Manufacturing environments often have little or no control over temperature and爃umidity,
and the atmosphere can be contaminated with corrosive chemicals. A corrosive atmosphere with
high humidity can destroy computer and network equipment within months and even, in some cases,
days. Manufacturing environments that utilize heavy equipment with large electrical motors can
wreak havoc on the stability of computer-operated systems and networks. To minimize problems
that stem from operating a computer network in an industrial environment:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Install the networking equipment in separate enclosures with outside ventilation.</li></p>

<p><li>Use fiber-optic cabling. This will reduce electrical interference and corrosion problems with the cable.</li></p>

<p><li> Make sure that all equipment is properly grounded.</li></p>

<p><li>Provide proper training to all employees that need to use the equipment. This爓ill help ensure the integrity of the system.</li></p>
</ul>

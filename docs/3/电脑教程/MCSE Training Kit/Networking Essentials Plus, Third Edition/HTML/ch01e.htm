<A NAME="87"><h1>Chapter Summary</h1></A>
<p>The following points summarize the key concepts in this chapter:</p>

<A NAME="88"><h3>What Is a Network?</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li> The primary reasons for networking are to share information, to share hardware and software (reducing cost), and to centralize administration and support.</li></p>

<p><li> A local area network (LAN) is the smallest form of a network and is the building block for larger networks.</li></p>

<p><li> A wide area network (WAN) is a collection of LANs and has no geographical limitation.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="89"><h3>Network Configuration</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li> Networks are classified into two principal groups based on how they share information: peer-to-peer networks and server-based networks.</li></p>

<p><li> In a peer-to-peer network, all computers are equal. They can either share their resources or use resources on other computers.</li></p>

<li> In a server-based network, one or more computers act as servers and provide the
resources to the network. The other computers are the clients and use the resources provided by
the server.</li>

<p><li> Features of the two major network types are summarized as follows:</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="90"><h3>Network Topology</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li> The physical layout of computers on a network is called a topology. Topologies can
be physical (actual wiring) or logical (the way they work). There are four primary topologies:
star, bus, ring, and mesh.</li></p>

<p><li>In a bus topology, the computers are connected in a linear fashion on a single cable. Bus topologies require a terminator on each end of the cable.</li></p>

<p><li> In a star topology, the computers are connected to a centralized hub.</li></p>

<p><li>In a mesh topology, all computers in the network are connected to one another with separate cables.</li></p>

<p><li> In a token-ring topology, the computers are connected physically in a star shape,
but logically in a ring or circle. The data is passed from one computer to another around the
circle.</li></p>

<p><li>Hubs are used to centralize the data traffic and localize failures. If one cable breaks, it will not shut down the entire network.</li></p>

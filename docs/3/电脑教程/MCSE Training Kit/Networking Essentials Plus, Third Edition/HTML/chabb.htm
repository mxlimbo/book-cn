<h1>The Origin of Standards</h1>
<A NAME="835"></A>
<p>Standards have grown primarily from two sources:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Popular acceptance (customer driven)</li></p>
<p><li>Organizational recommendations</li></p>
</ul>



<p>Customer-driven standards emerge from popular acceptance. The best example of this is the
term &quot;PC-compatible,&quot; which means that a product will work with an IBM Personal
Computer or clone. However, as the networking business grew through the mid- and late-l980s, it
became apparent that customer-driven popularity was not adequate for creating and imposing
standards.</p>

<A NAME="836"><h2>The Influence of the Business Community</h2></A>
<p>In the early years of networking, several large companies, including IBM, Honeywell, and
Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), used their own proprietary standards for how computers
could be connected.</p>

<p>These standards described how to move data from one computer to another, but the standards
applied only if all the computers were made by the same company. Getting equipment from one
vendor to communicate with equipment from another vendor was problematic.</p>

<p>For example, networks adhering to IBM's complex networking architecture, called Systems
Network Architecture (SNA), could not directly communicate with networks using DEC's
Digital Network Architecture (DNA).</p>

<p>As networking technology matured, businesses began to trust crucial data to networking. But
in the mid-1980s, the same communication problems existed between network vendors that had
existed earlier among mainframe vendors. The increasing need for businesses to interact and
share data was inescapable.</p>

<p>Computer manufacturers saw this as a business opportunity. They realized that networking
technology which enabled communication by conforming to standards would be far more profitable
in the long run than equipment that would work only in a single-vendor environment. As a
result, standards gradually became a part of the computer and network environment.</p>

<A NAME="837"><h2>The Influence of the Technical Community</h2></A>
<p>Today, certain domestic and international organizations, rather than customers, create and
define nearly all networking technical standards.</p>

<p>Some of these organizations have existed for many years, and some, such as the SQL Access
Group, have evolved more recently as new applications have appeared. These, in turn, created new
networking environments that required new guidelines.</p>

<p>Although there are probably dozens of organizations currently advocating standards of every
description, only a few have gained the recognition required to enlist the support of major
computing vendors. These associations and organizations have become the foundation upon which
network acceptance is based. Therefore, network engineers need to be familiar with the names of
the organizations and the networking areas they influence.</p>

<A NAME="419"><h3>Connectivity Devices</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li> Modems make it possible to communicate over telephone lines.</li></p>

<p><li> There are two types of modems: synchronous and asynchronous.</li></p>

<p><li>It is important to choose the right cable when connecting hubs; crossover cables will not work in place of standard patch cables.</li></p>

<p><li>Asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) is a technology for increasing the爏peed of transmission on telephone lines.</li></p>

<p><li>Repeaters are used to connect two segments of similar or dissimilar media and to regenerate a signal to increase the distance transmitted.</li></p>

<p><li>Repeaters should not be used where network traffic is heavy, segments are using different access methods, or filtering is needed.</li></p>

<p><li> Bridges have all the features of repeaters.</li></p>

<p><li> Bridges are used to connect two segments to expand the length or number of爊odes on
the network, to reduce traffic by segmenting the network, or to connect dissimilar
networks.</li></p>

<p><li>Routers are used to connect two networks, limit unnecessary traffic, and to separate administrative networks.</li></p>

<p><li>Brouters combine the features of bridges and routers; a brouter can act as a router for one protocol and as a bridge for all the others.</li></p>

<p><li> Gateways perform protocol and data conversion.</li></p>

<p><li>Gateways are limited in several ways: they are task-specific, expensive, and can be slow.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="420"><h3>Connection Services</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li>Two types of telephone lines are available for modem communications: public telephone lines (dial-up lines) and leased lines (dedicated lines).</li></p>

<p><li>Most long-distance carriers use switched circuits to provide what appear to be dedicated lines, also called virtual private networks (VPNs).</li></p>

<p><li> To make a Remote Access Service (RAS) connection, the server on the network must be
configured with RAS, and the computer connecting to the network must be configured as a client
or with dial-up networking (DUN).</li></p>

<p><li>RAS connections can use any one of three protocols: Serial Line Interface Protocol (SLIP), Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), or Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP).</li></p>

<p><li>RAS provides four levels of security: auditing, callback, security host, and PPTP filters.</li></p>

<p><li>The Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) allows a remote client to make a secure connection to a network over the Internet.</li></p>

<p><li>Organizations that need a more secure and faster connection than can be provided by an analog line can convert to DDS (digital data service).</li></p>

<p><li> T1 service is the most widely used kind of digital line.</li></p>

<p><li>Packet-switching networks offer a fast and efficient way to transit data over wide areas.</li></p>

<p><li> Frame relay is an advanced fast-packet variable-length, digital, packet-switching technology.</li></p>

<p><li> Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is an advanced implementation of packet switching
that provides high-speed transmission rates to send fixed-size packets over broadband and
baseband LANs and WANs.</li></p>

<p><li>Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is an inter-LAN digital connectivity specification that accommodates voice, data, and imaging.</li></p>

<p><li>Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is a specification that describes a high-speed token-passing network that uses fiber-optic media.</li></p>

<p><li>Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) is an emerging technology based on爁iber optics.</li></p>

<p><li> Switched Multimegabit Data Service (SMDS) is a connectionless switching service
provided by local exchange carrier services that offers high bandwidth at reduced network
costs.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="421"><h3>Remote Access Computing</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li> Remote Access Service (RAS) is used to provide remote access to a network.</li></p>

<p><li> A RAS connection requires that the server on the network be configured with RAS
service and the computer connecting to the network be configured as a client or dial-up
networking (DUN) computer.</li></p>

<p><li>RAS connections can use any one of three protocols: Serial Line Interface Protocol (SLIP), Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), or Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP).</li></p>

<p><li>RAS provides four levels of security: auditing, callback, security host, and PPTP filters.</li></p>

<p><li>Use RAS if the bandwidth is less than 128 Kps, you do not require a full-time connection, or you need to keep the system cost down.</li></p>

<p><li> Don't use RAS if you need a higher bandwidth than provided by a
synchronous-modem, you need a dedicated full-time connection, or if leased lines are already
available.</li></p>
</ul>

<ol>
<p><li>What kind of network should they install?</li></p>

<p>Server-based ____</p>

<p>Peer-to-peer ____</p>
</ol>

<p><div class="tip"><blockquote>
<b>TIP</b><hr>This case study can be solved with several different combinations of components
and cable.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<ol>
<p><b>A server-based network is suggested because the number of workstations (34), when combined,
exceeds the recommended limit of 10 for a peer-to-peer network. Also, because this company uses
a variety of computers (PCs and Macintoshes), it will be easier to implement the server-based
network. By getting all the computers standardized and networked, this company is moving toward
a more centralized administration. Installing the server-based network now will put them well
on their way to a more centralized system and open to future expansion. A peer-to-peer network
at this time would limit future expansion. Because the company needs a server-based operating
system that serves both Macintoshes and personal computers, you could choose Microsoft Windows
NT Server, although there are several other server-based operating systems, such as Netware,
that could complete the same functions.</b></p>

<p><li value="2"><a name="000"></a>What type of network should the company implement within the offices?</li></p>

<p>Fiber-optic Ethernet ____</p>

<p>Fiber-optic Token Ring ____</p>

<p>Fiber-optic ArcNet ____</p>

<p>Ethernet 10BaseT ____</p>

<p>Ethernet 10Base2 ____</p>

<p>Token Ring ____</p>

<p>LocalTalk ____</p>

<p>ArcNet ____</p>

<p><b>Within the offices, Ethernet 10BaseT is the suggested solution because it is supported on
all platforms and is easy to troubleshoot and install. Token Ring and ArcNet solutions would
also work, but LocalTalk would not meet the requirements because:</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>It is slow.</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>It is difficult to find LocalTalk cards for personal computers.</b></li></p>
</ul>

<p><li>What type of network should the company install between the two buildings?</li></p>

<p>Fiber-optic Ethernet ____</p>

<p>Fiber-optic Token Ring ____</p>

<p>Fiber-optic ArcNet ____</p>

<p>Ethernet 10BaseT ____</p>

<p>Ethernet 10Base2 ____</p>

<p>Token Ring ____</p>

<p>LocalTalk ____</p>

<p>ArcNet ____</p>

<p><b>A fiber-optic Ethernet solution called 10BaseF is suggested between the two buildings, for
two reasons:</b></p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Only fiber-optic cable can offer the distance capabilities necessary to燾over 600
meters (2000 feet).</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>A repeater can be used to connect the fiber-optic cable from one building to the
10BaseT cable in the other.</b></li></p>
</ul>
</ol>

<a name="ans12"><h3>Exercise  3.2: Troubleshooting Problem</h3></a>

<ol>
<p><li>List at least two things that could cause those nodes to fail to function.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
This list contains the most common errors that could be causing the problem, but
these are not the only correct possibilities.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<ol>
<p><b>The cables to the computers that are having problems might not be of the correct category.
Category 5 wire, which can handle the 100 Mbps network, is fairly new and might have been too
expensive when the older cable runs were installed.</b></p>

<p><b>The cables to the computers that are having problems might be of the correct category, but
might not have been installed to Category 5 specifications. The cable might work fine for
10BaseT, but fail for 100BaseX.</b></p>

<p><b>The patch cables used to connect each of the problem computers to the wall jack might not
be Category 5 patch cables and might work for 10BaseT, but not for 100BaseX.</b></p>

<p><b>Rough handling during the installation of the new computers might have damaged the existing
network cabling.</b></p>

<p><li value="2"><a name="000"></a>What could you do to resolve each of the possible causes you listed above?</li></p>

<p><b>Upgrade to Category 5, and test the cable runs with appropriate test equipment (test
equipment is discussed in <A HREF="ch08a.htm#423">Chapter 8</A>, &quot;Designing and Installing a Network&quot;) to
determine if it will support 100-Mbps networking. Replace all cables that will not support your
new network.</b></p>

<p><b>Test the patch cables with appropriate test equipment to determine if the cable will
support 100-Mbps networking. Replace all cables that will not support your new network.</b></p>

<p><b>Visually inspect all the cables for damage and replace any that have obvious problems; then
test the rest to determine if there are any hidden problems. And of course, replace all cables
that will not support your new爊etwork.</b></p>

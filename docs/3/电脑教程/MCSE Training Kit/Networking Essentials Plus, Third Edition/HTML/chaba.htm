<h1>The Role of Standards in Networking</h1>
<A NAME="834"></A>
<p>Most networks are a combination of hardware and software from a variety of vendors. This
ability to combine the products manufactured by different vendors is made possible by the
existence of industry standards.</p>

<p>Standards are guidelines that vendors adhere to voluntarily in order to make their products
compatible with products from other vendors. In general those standards address:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Size.</li></p>
<p><li>Shape.</li></p>
<p><li>Material.</li></p>
<p><li>Function.</li></p>
<p><li>Speed.</li></p>
<p><li>Distance.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>More specifically, the standards define physical and operational characteristics of:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Personal computing equipment.</li></p>
<p><li>Networking and communication equipment.</li></p>
<p><li>Operating systems.</li></p>
<p><li>Software.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>For example, standards make it possible to buy a network interface card manufactured by one
vendor for a computer manufactured by another vendor with reasonable assurance that the card
will:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Fit into the computer.</li></p>
<p><li>Work with the network cabling.</li></p>
<p><li>Translate signals from the computer and send them out onto the network.</li></p>
<p><li>Receive data from the network and deliver it to the computer.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>When a vendor subscribes to a set of standards, it means that the vendor is agreeing to make
equipment that conforms to the specifications of the standard.</p>

<p>Standards have, in fact, been responsible for the success and growth of both the computer
and networking products industries.</p>

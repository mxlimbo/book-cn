<A NAME="375"><h2>About This Chapter</h2></A>
<p>The explosive expansion of the Internet and the geographical diversification of corporations
have generated a need for large, worldwide networks. While previous chapters discussed
networking basics, with a focus on smaller networks, this chapter explores the devices and
technologies available to expand networks beyond the scope of simple local area networks
(LANs). The discussion begins with modems, moves on to repeaters, bridges, routers, brouters,
and gateways, and concludes with a look at remote access computing. You will learn how a
network can be expanded across the street or around the world.</p>

<A NAME="376"><h2>Before You Begin</h2></A>
<p>This chapter is an expansion of <A HREF="ch02a.htm#92">Chapter 2</A>, &quot;Basic Network Media.&quot; You should
review the sections on topology and network cabling before starting this chapter. Many of the
terms discussed in <a href="ch02a.htm">Chapter 2</a> are used or expanded in this chapter. Also, references are made to
Ethernet and Token Ring architectures. You can review these topics in <A HREF="ch03a.htm#149">Chapter 3</A>,
&quot;Understanding Network Architecture.&quot;</p>

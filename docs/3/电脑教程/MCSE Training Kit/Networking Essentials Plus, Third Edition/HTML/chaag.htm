<h2>Lesson 1: Connectivity Devices</h2>

<a name="ans30"><h3>Exercise  7.1: Troubleshooting Problem</h3></a>

<p>What can you do to start the troubleshooting process?</p>

<p><b>The first step is to carry out a simple test on your hardware.
Much complex equipment is microprocessor-driven hardware with built-in software. Simply by
following the shut-down and restart procedure for these devices (sometimes this is a simple
on-off switch) you can restart the equipment and restore it to proper functioning again.</b></p>

<p><b>If shutting down and restarting the entire system does not get the
system running, call the service provider and ask it to test the T1 line and verify that it is
correctly configured.</b></p>

<p><b>If neither of those two options solve the problem, you will need
to contact your vendor and ask for help in troubleshooting the WAN equipment you have. Very few
experienced systems engineers have the expertise needed to successfully troubleshoot this kind
of scenario.</b></p>

<h2>Lesson 2: Connection Services</h2>

<a name="ans31"><h3>Exercise  7.2: Case Study Problem</h3></a>

<ol>
<p><li>Identify at least two network items in each branch-office network site that
need upgrading.</li></p>

<p><b>Each site could upgrade to include the following:</b></p>

<b>New cabling: from 10 Mbps Ethernet to 100Mbp Category 5.</b><br>

<b>New cards: from 10 Mbps Ethernet to 100Base.</b><br>

<b>New architecture: from linear bus to star bus (100BaseT) with hubs.</b>

<p><li>The separate branch offices need to maintain voice and data communications with each
other. Which type of WAN connection (link) might you use to connect the three sites to each
other?</li></p>

<p><b>Use a T1 link, because it can carry voice and data simultaneously. (T1 is available through
a carrier such as AT&amp;T, MCI, Sprint, and others.) Note that E1 is a rough equivalent of T1
and is used outside the U.S.</b></p>

<p><li>Which type of device could be used to collect the multiple signals from voice and data
and put them on the same WAN link?</li></p>

<p><b>A multiplexer mixes both types of signals and places them on the same WAN link.</b></p>

<p><li>Which type of connectivity device should be used to connect the LAN to the multiple
paths in the WAN illustrated in the diagram above?</li></p>

<p><b>A router is the ideal device to connect the LAN to the multiple WAN paths. Routers can use
multiple paths and can use best-path algorithms to determine the best path for each
transmission.</b></p>

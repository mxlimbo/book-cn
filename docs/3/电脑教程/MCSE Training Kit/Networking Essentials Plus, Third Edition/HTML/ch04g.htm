<A NAME="278"><h1>Chapter Summary</h1></A>
<p>The following points summarize the key concepts of this chapter.</p>

<A NAME="279"><h3>Introduction to Network Operating Systems</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li>Without a network operating system (NOS) of some kind, individual computers cannot share resources, and other users cannot make use of those resources.</li></p>

<p><li>An NOS can be part of a computer operating system or a separate application that runs on top of the computer operating system.</li></p>

<p><li>Windows NT is an example of an operating system that incorporates both computer and network operating systems in one system.</li></p>

<p><li> By multitasking, computers can perform more than one task at a time.</li></p>

<p><li> Multitasking can be either preemptive or nonpreemptive.</li></p>

<p><li>Server software is the means by which an NOS provides services to other computers on a network.</li></p>

<p><li> A redirector is used to forward client requests to the network.</li></p>

<p><li>Using redirectors, users can access peripheral devices as if the devices were attached directly to the client computer.</li></p>

<p><li> The first step in choosing a network operating system is to decide which network
architecture&#8212;client/server or peer-to-peer&#8212;best meets your needs; this can often be
accomplished by determining what level of security your network requires.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="280"><h3>Novell Operating Systems</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li>NetWare client software is designed to be installed over a client computer's operating system.</li></p>

<p><li> The NetWare NOS is designed to work in multivendor network environments.</li></p>

<p><li>NetWare Directory Services (NDS) provide a database that maintains information about every resource on the network.</li></p>

<p><li>NDS provides security, routing, messaging, management, Web publishing, file and print services, and name services.</li></p>

<p><li>A NetWare network requires both NetWare Server software for the server and NetWare Client software for each workstation.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="281"><h3>Microsoft Network Operating Systems</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li> Windows NT is Microsoft's network operating system.</li></p>

<p><li>Windows NT incorporates both the computer and the network operating system into one.</li></p>

<p><li> Windows NT Server is the server module of the network.</li></p>

<p><li> Windows NT Workstation is the client module of the network.</li></p>

<p><li> Windows NT networks are designed to take advantage of the domain model in which all
computers share a common security database. This information is stored on a server that is
designated as the domain controller. Windows Server and Workstation will operate as part of a
peer-to-peer network (share model), but you will not be able to take advantage of the
additional security features provided in the domain model.</li></p>

<p><li>Windows NT provides several utilities to provide interoperability between NetWare and Windows NT.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="282"><h3>Other Network Operating Systems</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li>Apple IP allows non-Apple users to access Apple resources such as database files.</li></p>

<p><li>A UNIX computer can be used as a file server by installing file-server software.</li></p>

<p><li>Banyan Vines is a network operating system based on the Xerox proprietary protocol.</li></p>

<p><li> Banyan Vines is a server/client-based network operating system.</li></p>

<p><li>Peer-to-peer LAN networking is popular for small offices in which maintaining network security is not an issue.</li></p>

<p><li>Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95 and 98, and OS/2 Warp NOSs have built-in peer-to-peer LAN software.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="283"><h3>Network Operating Systems in a Multivendor Environment</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li>Interoperability in multivendor environments can be achieved from either the client or server computer.</li></p>

<p><li>Redirectors are used to intercept requests for services and forward them across the network to the appropriate network services.</li></p>

<p><li> A client or a server can have multiple redirectors.</li></p>

<p><li>The three primary manufacturers of products for multivendor environments are Novell, Microsoft, and Apple.</li></p>

<p><li>Apple computers connect to personal computer networks by means of network servers.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="691"><h1>Lesson 2: Troubleshooting Tools</h1></A>
<p>Troubleshooting network problems is often accomplished with the help of hardware and
software. To troubleshoot effectively, you need to know how these tools can be used to solve
network problems.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to:</b> </p>

<ul>
<p><li>Name the principal hardware tools used to troubleshoot network problems and identify which hardware tool to use on a particular part of the network.</li></p>

<p><li> Identify software-based monitoring tools.</li></p>

<p><li> Identify the components that each monitor tool checks.</li></p>

<p><li> Describe the methods for monitoring a network.</li></p>

<p><li> Describe the tools used for troubleshooting a network problem.</li></p>

<A NAME="692"><h2>Hardware Tools</h2></A>
<p>Hardware tools were once very expensive and difficult devices to use. They are now less
expensive and easier to operate. They are helpful to identify performance trends and problems.
This section describes the most common of these tools.</p>

<A NAME="693"><h3>Digital Voltmeters</h3></A>
<p>The digital voltmeter (volt-ohm meter) is the primary all-purpose electronic measuring tool.
It is considered standard equipment for any computer or electronic technician and can reveal
far more than just the amount of voltage passing through resistance. Voltmeters can determine
if:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> The cable is continuous (has no breaks).</li></p>

<p><li> The cable can carry network traffic.</li></p>

<p><li> Two parts of the same cable are exposed and touching (thereby causing shorts).</li></p>

<p><li>An exposed part of the cable is touching another conductor, such as a metalÁàèurface.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>One of the network administrator's most important functions is to confirm source voltage
for the network equipment. Most electronic equipment operates on 120 volts AC. But not all
outlets will meet these requirements. In older installations, especially in large industrial
areas, the system load can drop voltages to as low as

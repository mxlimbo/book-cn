<A NAME="531"><h1>Lesson 1: Making Networks Secure</h1></A>
<p>Planning for security is an important element in designing a network. It is far easier to
implement a secure network from a plan than it is to recover from data loss. This lesson
presents an overview of network security. We examine two primary models for ensuring data
security and take a look at how to secure the physical components of a network.</p>

</p>

<A NAME="532"><h2>Planning for Network Security</h2></A>
<p>In a networking environment there must be assurance that sensitive data will remain private.
Not only is it important to secure sensitive information, it is equally important to protect
network operations from deliberate or unintentional damage.</p>

<p>Maintaining network security requires a balance between facilitating easy access to data by
authorized users and restricting access to data by unauthorized users. It's the job of the
network administrator to create this balance.</p>

<p>Even in networks that handle sensitive and valuable business data, security is爏ometimes an
afterthought. Four major threats to the security of data on a network are:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Unauthorized access.</li></p>

<p><li> Electronic tampering.</li></p>

<p><li> Theft.</li></p>

<p><li> Intentional or unintentional damage.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Despite the seriousness of these threats, data security is not always implemented or
supported properly. The administrator's task is to ensure that the network remains reliable
and secure, free from those threats.</p>

<A NAME="533"><h3>Level of Security</h3></A>
<p>The extent and level of the network security system required depends on the type of
environment in which the network is running. A network that stores data for a major bank, for
example, requires more extensive security than a LAN that links the computers in a small
community volunteer organization.</p>

<A NAME="534"><h3>Setting Policies</h3></A>
<p>Making a network secure requires establishing a set of rules, regulations, and policies so
that nothing is left to chance. The first step toward ensuring data security is to implement
policies that set the tone and help to guide the administrator and users through changes, both
expected and unplanned, in their network's development.</p>

<p><b>Prevention</b></p>

<p>The best way to design data security policies is to take a proactive, preventive approach.
When unauthorized access is prevented, the data remains secure. A prevention-based system
requires that the administrator understand the tools and methods available with which to keep
data safe.</p>

<p><b>Authentication</b></p>

<p>To access a network, a user must enter a valid user name and password. Because passwords are
linked to user accounts, a password authentication system is the first line of defense against
unauthorized users.</p>

<p>It is important not to let overreliance on this authentication process fool you into a false
sense of security. For example, in a peer-to-peer network, almost anyone can log on with a
unique name and password. This alone can provide a user with complete access to the network, so
that anything that is shared becomes available to that user. Authentication works only in a
server-based network in which the user name and password must be authenticated from the
security database.</p>

<A NAME="535"><h3>Training</h3></A>
<p>Unintentional errors can lead to security failures. A well-trained network user is爈ess
likely than an inexperienced novice to accidentally cause an error and ruin a resource by
permanently corrupting or deleting data. Figure 10.1 illustrates such a爌roblem.</p>


<p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 10.1</b> <i>Training helps reduce costly user errors</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>The administrator should ensure that everyone who uses the network is familiar with its
operating and security procedures. To accomplish this, the administrator can develop a short,
clear guide to what users need to know, and require that new users attend appropriate training
classes.</p>

<A NAME="536"><h3>Securing Equipment</h3></A>
<p>The first step in keeping data safe is to provide for the physical security of the network
hardware. (Establishing and maintaining an optimal environment for the爌hysical network is
discussed in detail in Lesson 2.) The extent of security required depends on:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> The size of the company.</li></p>

<p><li> The sensitivity of the data.</li></p>

<p><li> The available resources.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>In a peer-to-peer network, there is sometimes no organized hardware-security policy, and
users are responsible for the security of their own computers and data. In a server-based
network, security is the responsibility of the network administrator.</p>

<p><b>Securing the Servers</b></p>

<p>In a larger, centralized system, in which much individual user and organization data is
sensitive, it is important to secure the servers from accidental or deliberate tampering.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon for some individuals to want to demonstrate their technical abilities
when the servers have problems. They may or may not know what they are doing. It is best to
tactfully prevent these people from &quot;fixing&quot; the server. The simplest solution is to
lock the servers in a dedicated computer room with limited access; depending on the size of the
company, this might not be workable. Locking the servers in an office or even a large storage
closet is often practicable and goes some way toward securing the servers.</p>

<p><b>Securing the Cables</b></p>

<p>Copper media, such as coaxial cable, much like a radio emits electronic signals that mimic
the information it carries. Information carried in these signals can be monitored with
electronic listening equipment. Copper cable can also be tapped into so that information can be
stolen directly from the original cable.</p>

<p>Cable runs that handle sensitive data should be accessible only to authorized people. Proper
planning can make cable runs inaccessible to unauthorized people. For example, cable can be run
inside the building structure, through ceilings, walls, and floors.</p>

<A NAME="537"><h2>Security Models</h2></A>
<p>After implementing security for the network's physical components, the administrator
needs to ensure that the network resources will be safe from both unauthorized access and
accidental or deliberate damage. Policies for assigning permissions and rights to network
resources are at the heart of securing the network.</p>

<p>Two security models have evolved for keeping data and hardware resources safe:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Password-protected shares</li></p>

<p><li> Access permissions</li></p>
</ul>

<p>These models are also called &quot;share-level security&quot; (for password-protected
shares) and &quot;user-level security&quot; (for access permissions).</p>

<A NAME="538"><h3>Password-Protected Shares</h3></A>
<p>Implementing password-protected shares requires assigning a password to each shared
resource. Access to the shared resource is granted when a user enters the correct password.</p>

<p>In many systems, resources can be shared with different types of permissions. To illustrate,
we use Windows 95 and 98 as examples. For these operating systems, as described in <A HREF="ch09a.htm">Chapter 9</A>,
&quot;Establishing Network Shares and Accounts,&quot; directories can be shared as Read Only,
Full, or Depends On Password.</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Read Only</b> If a share is set up as Read Only, users who know the password have
Read access to the files in that directory. They can view the documents, copy them to their
machines, and print them, but they cannot change the original documents.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Full</b> With Full access, users who know the password have complete access to the
files in that directory. In other words, they can view, modify, add, and delete the shared
directory's files.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Depends On Password</b> Depends On Password involves setting up a share that uses
two levels of passwords: Read access and Full access. Users who know the Read access password
have Read access, and users who know the Full access password have Full access.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>The password-protected share system is a simple security method that allows anyone who knows
the password to obtain access to that particular resource.</p>

<A NAME="539"><h3>Access Permissions</h3></A>
<p>Access-permission security involves assigning certain rights on a user-by-user basis. A user
types a password when logging on to the network. The server validates this user name and
password combination and uses it to grant or deny access to shared resources by checking access
to the resource against a user- 
access database on the server.</p>

<p>Access-permission security provides a higher level of control over access rights. It is much
easier for one person to give another person a printer password, as in爏hare-level security. It
is less likely for that person to give away a personal password.</p>

<p>Because user-level security is more extensive and can determine various levels of爏ecurity,
it is usually the preferred model in larger organizations.</p>

<p><b>Resource Security</b></p>

<p>After the user has been authenticated and allowed on the network, the security system gives
the user access to the appropriate resources.</p>

<p>Users have passwords, but resources have permissions. In a sense, a security fence guards
each resource. The fence has several gates through which users can pass to access the resource.
Certain gates allow users to do more to the resource than other gates. Certain gates, in other
words, allow the user more privileges with the resource.</p>

<p>The administrator determines which users should be allowed through which gates. One gate
grants the user full access to or full control of a resource. Another gate grants the user
read-only access.</p>

<p>As shown in Figure 10.2, each shared resource or file is stored with a list of users or
groups and their associated permissions (gates).</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
Different network operating systems (NOSs) give different names to these
permissions. The following table shows some of the typical permissions that can be set on
Windows NT Server directories.

<p><b>Group Permissions</b></p>

<p>The administrator's job includes assigning each user the appropriate permissions to each
resource. The most efficient way to accomplish this is through groups, especially in a large
organization with many users and resources. As shown in Figure 10.3, Windows NT Server allows
users to select the file or folder for which they want to set group permissions.</p>


<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F10XX03x.htm')"> <img src="images/F10XX03.JPG" width=404 height=439 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 10.3</b> <i>Windows NT Explorer is used to set permissions</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>Permissions for groups work in the same way as they work for individuals. The administrator
reviews which permissions are required by each account and assigns the accounts to the proper
groups. This is the preferred method of assigning permissions, rather than assigning each
account's permissions individually.</p>

<p>Assigning users to appropriate groups is more convenient than having to assign separate
permissions to every user individually. For example, giving the group <i>Everyone</i> full
control of the public directory might not be the best choice.  Full access would allow anyone to delete or modify the contents of the files in
the public directory.</p>

<p>In Figure 10.4, the group <i>Everyone</i> has been granted Read access to the directory
public. This allows members of the group <i>Everyone</i> to read, but not delete or modify, the
files in the public directory.</p>

<p>The administrator could create a group called <i>Reviewers</i>, grant complete access
permissions to the student files to that group, and assign staff to the <i>Reviewers</i> group.
Another group, called <i>Faculty</i>, would have only Read permissions in the student files.
Faculty members assigned to the <i>Faculty</i> group would be able to read the student files,
but not change them.</p>

<A NAME="540"><h2>Security Enhancements</h2></A>
<p>The network administrator can increase the level of security on a network in several ways.
This section explores some of the options.</p>

<A NAME="541"><h3>Firewalls</h3></A>
<p>A <i>firewall</i> is a security system, usually a combination of hardware and software, that
is intended to protect an organization's network against external threats coming from
another network, including the Internet.</p>

<p>Firewalls prevent an organization's networked computers from communicating directly with
computers that are external to the network, and vice versa. Instead, all incoming and outgoing
communication is routed through a proxy server outside the organization's network.
Firewalls also audit network activity, recording the volume of traffic and providing
information about unauthorized attempts to gain access.</p>

<p>A proxy server is a firewall component that manages Internet traffic to and from a local
area network (LAN). The proxy server decides whether it is safe to let a particular message or
file pass through to the organization's network. It provides access control to the network,
filtering and discarding requests that the owner does not consider appropriate, including
requests for unauthorized access to proprietary data.</p>

<A NAME="542"><h3>Auditing</h3></A>
<p>Reviewing records of events in the security log of a server is called <i>auditing</i>. This
process tracks network activities by user accounts. Auditing should be a routine element of
network security. Audit records list the users that have accessed&#8212;or attempted to
access&#8212;specific resources. Auditing helps administrators identify unauthorized activity.
It can also provide usage information for departments that charge a fee for making certain
network resources available and need some way to determine the cost of those resources.</p>

<p>Auditing can track functions such as:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Logon attempts.</li></p>

<p><li> Connection and disconnection from designated resources.</li></p>

<p><li> Connection termination.</li></p>

<p><li> Disabling of accounts.</li></p>

<p><li> Opening and closing of files.</li></p>

<p><li> Changes made to files.</li></p>

<p><li> Creation or deletion of directories.</li></p>

<p><li> Directory modification.</li></p>

<p><li> Server events and modifications.</li></p>

<p><li> Password changes.</li></p>

<p><li> Logon parameter changes.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Audit records can indicate how the network is being used. The administrator can use the
audit records to produce reports that show activities and their date and time ranges. For
example, repeated failed logon attempts or efforts to log on at odd hours can indicate that an
unauthorized user is attempting to gain access to the network.</p>

<A NAME="543"><h3>Diskless Computers</h3></A>
<p>Diskless computers, as the name implies, have no floppy-disk drives or hard disks. They can
do everything a computer with disk drives can do except store data on a local floppy disk or
hard disk. Diskless computers are an ideal choice for maintaining security because users cannot
download data and take it away.</p>

<p>Diskless computers do not require boot disks. They communicate with the server and log on by
means of a special ROM boot chip installed on the computer's network interface card (NIC).
When the diskless computer is turned on, the ROM燽oot chip signals the server that it is ready
to start. The server responds by downloading boot software into the diskless computer's RAM
and automatically presents the user with a logon screen as part of the boot process. After the
user logs on, the computer is connected to the network.</p>

<p>Although a diskless computer can provide a high level of security, it has shortcomings.
Without a local disk available on which to store applications and data, all computer activity
must be conducted over the network. Network traffic will爄ncrease accordingly, and the network
will have to be capable of handling increased demands.</p>

<A NAME="544"><h3>Data Encryption</h3></A>
<p>A data-encryption utility scrambles data before it goes onto the network. This makes the
data unreadable even by someone who taps the cable and attempts to read the data as it passes
over the network. When the data arrives at the proper computer, the code for deciphering
encrypted data decodes the bits, translating them into understandable information. Advanced
data-encryption schemes automate both encryption and decryption. The best encryption systems
are hardware-based and can be expensive.</p>

<p>The traditional standard for encryption is the Data Encryption Standard (DES). Developed by
IBM and adopted in 1975 as a specification for encryption by the爂overnment of the United
States, this system describes how data should be encrypted and provides the specifications for
the key to decryption. The U.S. Government continues to use DES. Both the sender and the
receiver need to have燼ccess to the decryption key. However, the only way to get the key from
one爈ocation to another is to physically or electronically transmit it, which makes DES
vulnerable to unauthorized interception.</p>

<p>Today, the U. S. Government is also using a newer standard, called the Commercial COMSEC
Endorsement Program (CCEP), which may eventually replace DES. The National Security Agency
(NSA) introduced CCEP and allows vendors with the proper security clearance to join CCEP.
Approved vendors are authorized to incorporate classified algorithms into communications
systems.</p>

<A NAME="545"><h2>Computer Viruses</h2></A>
<p>Computer viruses are becoming an all-too-familiar fact of life. It is not uncommon to see a
report on a local news channel describing the latest virus and warning about its destructive
impact. Computer viruses are bits of computer programming, or code, that hide in computer
programs or on the boot sector of storage devices, such as hard-disk drives and floppy-disk
drives. The primary purpose of a virus is to reproduce itself as often as possible and thereby
disrupt the operation of the infected computer or the program. Once activated, a virus can be a
simple annoyance or completely catastrophic in its effect. Viruses are written by people with
an intent to do harm.</p>

<p>Viruses are classified into two categories, based on how they propagate themselves. The
first type, called a &quot;boot-sector virus,&quot; resides in the first sector of a
floppy-disk or hard-disk drive. When the computer is booted, the virus executes. This is a
common method of transmitting viruses from one floppy disk to another. Each time a new disk is
inserted and accessed, the virus replicates itself onto the new drive. The second type of virus
is known as a &quot;file infector.&quot; Such a virus attaches itself to a file or program and
activates any time the file is used. Many subcategories of file infectors exist.</p>

<p>The following list describes a few of the more common file infectors:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Companion Virus</b> A companion virus is so named because it uses the name of a
real program&#8212;its companion. A companion virus activates by using a different file
extension from its companion. For example, suppose we decide to start a program called
&quot;wordprocessor.exe.&quot; When the command is given to execute the application, a virus
named &quot;wordprocessor.com&quot; will execute in its place. It is able to do so because a
.com file takes priority over an .exe file.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Macro Virus</b> A macro virus is difficult to detect and is becoming more common.
It is so named because it is written as a macro for a specific application. Popular
applications, such as Microsoft Word, are targets for these viruses. When the user opens a file
that contains the virus, the virus attaches itself to the application and then infects any
other files accessed by that application.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Polymorphic Virus</b> A polymorphic virus is so named because it changes its
appearance every time it is replicated. This renders it more difficult to detect because no two
are exactly the same.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Stealth Virus</b> A stealth virus is so named because it attempts to hide from
detection. When an antivirus program attempts to find it, the stealth virus tries爐o intercept
the probe and return false information indicating that it does not exist.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="546"><h3>Virus Propagation</h3></A>
<p>Just as computer viruses do not create themselves, neither do they spread through the air
unaided. Some kind of exchange between the two computers must take place before transmission
can occur. In the early days of computing and viruses, the principal source of infection was
through the exchange of data on floppy disks. One infected computer in an organization could
easily infect all the computers in爐he organization, merely by a single user passing around a
copy of the latest screensaver program.</p>

<p>The proliferation of LANs and the growth of the Internet have opened many new pathways to
rapidly spreading viruses. Now, virtually any computer in the world can be connected to any
other computer in the world. As a consequence, the creation of viruses is also on the rise. In
fact, some virus creators provide easy-to-use software containing directions for how to create
a virus.</p>

<p>A recently emerging method of spreading a virus is through e-mail services. After an e-mail
message containing the virus is opened, it attaches itself to the computer and can even send
itself to names in the computer's e-mail address book. Usually, the virus is located in an
inviting attachment to an e-mail message.</p>

<p>Convincing unsuspecting victims to activate a virus is a goal for virus writers. This is
often accomplished by packaging the virus in an enticing cover. Such a virus is known as a
&quot;Trojan horse.&quot; To attract users, it is presented in the guise of爏omething familiar,
safe, or intriguing.</p>

<p>Remember that any means by which computers exchange information provides a potential path
for a virus. Methods in common use include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> CD-ROMs.</li></p>

<p><li> Cabling directly connecting two computers.</li></p>

<p><li> Floppy-disk drives.</li></p>

<p><li> Hard-disk drives.</li></p>

<p><li> Internet connections.</li></p>

<p><li> LAN connections.</li></p>

<p><li> Modem connections.</li></p>

<p><li> Portable or removable drives.</li></p>

<p><li> Tape.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="547"><h3>Consequences of a Virus</h3></A>
<p>A virus can cause many kinds of harm to a computer; the creativity of its creator is the
only limitation. The following list describes common symptoms of computer virus infection:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> The computer won't boot.</li></p>

<p><li> The data is scrambled or corrupted.</li></p>

<p><li> The computer operates erratically.</li></p>

<p><li> A partition is lost.</li></p>

<p><li> The hard drive is reformatted.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>The most common symptom of virus infection in a network is one or more misbehaving
workstations. A peer-to-peer network is the most vulnerable. As described in <A HREF="ch01a.htm#30">Chapter 1</A>,
&quot;Introduction to Networking,&quot; in a peer-to-peer network all things are shared
equally; therefore, any infected computer has direct access to any computer or resource that is
shared to the network. Server-based networks have some built-in protection because permission
is required to obtain access to some portions of the server and, therefore, the network. In
these networks, it is more likely that workstations will be infected than a server, although
servers are not immune. The server, as the conduit from one computer to another, participates
in爐he transmission of the virus, even though it might not be affected.</p>

<A NAME="548"><h3>Virus Prevention</h3></A>
<p>Disastrous viruses are becoming more commonplace and should be taken into account when
network security procedures are developed. An effective antivirus strategy is an essential part
of a network plan. Good antivirus software is essential. Although no virus protection software
can prevent all viruses, it can do some of the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Warn of a potential virus</li></p>

<p><li> Keep a virus from activating</li></p>

<p><li> Remove a virus</li></p>

<p><li> Repair some of the damage that a virus has caused</li></p>

<p><li> Keep a virus in check after it activates</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Preventing unauthorized access to the network is one of the best ways to avoid a virus. For
example, the best way to prevent a virus from infecting a floppy disk is to use write
protection. If you cannot write to the floppy disk, you cannot infect it. Because prevention is
the key, the network administrator needs to make sure that all standard preventive measures are
in place.</p>

<p>These include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Passwords to reduce the chance of unauthorized access.</li></p>

<p><li> Well-planned access and privilege assignments for all users.</li></p>

<p><li>User profiles to structure the user's network environment, including network connections and program items that appear when the user logs on.</li></p>

<p><li> A policy that sets out which software can be loaded.</li></p>

<p><li>A policy that specifies rules for implementing virus protection on client workstations and network servers.</li></p>

<p><li>Ensuring that all users are well-trained and informed about computer viruses and how to prevent their activation.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><li> Network planning must include plans for security.</li></p>

<p><li>The level of security needed depends on the size of the organization and the sensitivity of the data.</li></p>

<p><li>The two security models that keep data and hardware resources safe are password-protected shares and access permissions.</li></p>

<p><li>Merely requiring users to log on does not, in itself, ensure the security of the爊etwork.</li></p>

<p><li>The best way to assign permissions is through setting up groups. Administrators can then assign permissions to the group rather than to individuals.</li></p>

<p><li>Ways to enhance security include use of auditing, diskless computers, data encryption, and virus protection.</li></p>

<p><li>Building in virus prevention and recovery policies should be part of a network strategy.</li></p>
</ul>

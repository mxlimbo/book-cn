<A NAME="168"><h1>Lesson 3: Ethernet</h1></A>
<p>This lesson introduces the Ethernet network architecture. Over the years, Ethernet has
become the most popular media access method to the desktop computer and is used in both small
and large network environments. Ethernet is a爊onproprietary industry standard that has found
wide acceptance by network hardware manufacturers. Problems related to using Ethernet hardware
products from different hardware manufacturers in a single network are nearly nonexistent. This
lesson presents an overview of the major Ethernet components, features, and functions.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to:</b> </p>

<ul>
<p><li> Identify the standard Ethernet components.</li></p>

<p><li> Describe the features of each IEEE Ethernet standard topology.</li></p>

<p><li> Identify the cabling for a given IEEE Ethernet standard topology.</li></p>

<p><li> Determine which Ethernet topology would be appropriate for a given site.</li></p>

<A NAME="169"><h2>The Origin of Ethernet</h2></A>
<p>In the late 1960s, the University of Hawaii developed a WAN called ALOHA. (A燱AN extends LAN
technology across a larger geographical area. For more information on WANs, see <A HREF="ch01a.htm#30">Chapter 1</A>,
&quot;Introduction to Networking.&quot;) The university occupied a wide area and sought to
connect computers that were spread throughout the campus. One of the key features of the
university's network was its use of CSMA/CD as the access method.</p>

<p>This early network was the foundation for today's <i>Ethernet</i> architecture. In 1972,
Robert Metcalfe and David Boggs invented a cabling and signaling scheme at the燲erox Palo Alto
Research Center (PARC) and in 1975 introduced the first Ethernet product. The original version
of Ethernet was designed as a system of 2.94 megabits per second (Mbps) to connect over 100
computers on a 1-kilometer (.62 miles) cable.</p>

<p>Xerox Ethernet was so successful that Xerox, Intel Corporation, and Digital Equipment
Corporation drew up a standard for a 10-Mbps Ethernet. Today, the

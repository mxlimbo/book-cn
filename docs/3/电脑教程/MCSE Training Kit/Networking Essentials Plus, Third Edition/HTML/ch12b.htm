<A NAME="625"><h1>Lesson 1: Documenting a Running Network</h1></A>
<p>The principal challenge in implementing a change on any network is to define the existing network and any limitations imposed by its hardware and software configurations. Comprehensive
documentation is the key to conducting an effective and economical upgrade for any network.
This lesson focuses on how to lay a foundation for making later network changes by documenting
the network and looks at some useful tools that can help facilitate the process.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to:</b> </p>

<ul>
<p><li>Document network components in order to establish a baseline for network performance.</li></p>

<p><li> Identify tools that can help to document a network.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 40 minutes</b> </p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="626"><h2>Documentation</h2></A>
<p>Preparing and maintaining network records are essential tasks that will pay off when you
need to implement changes to a network. Up-to-date documentation provides information about how
the network should look and perform, as well as爓here to seek help if there are problems.
Documentation developed for maintenance, upgrading, and troubleshooting should contain:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>A map of the entire network, including the locations of all hardware and details of the cabling.</li></p>

<p><li>Server information, including the data on each server and the schedule and locations of backups.</li></p>

<p><li> Software information, such as licensing and support details.</li></p>

<p><li>Essential names and telephone numbers for vendors, suppliers, contractors, and other helpful contacts.</li></p>

<p><li> Copies of all service agreements.</li></p>

<p><li>A record of all problems, their symptoms and solutions, including dates, contacts, procedures, and results.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Documentation should be thorough, well-organized, and stored where it is readily available.
While this might seem obvious, it is easy for documentation to燽e lost or the individual
responsible for maintaining these records to leave the爋rganization without training a
successor.</p>

<A NAME="627"><h2>Establishing a Baseline</h2></A>
<p>As soon as the network is operational, it is time to establish a <i>baseline,</i> which is
simply a documentation of the network's normal operating values. The baseline needs to be
updated whenever users, hardware, or software are added to or subtracted from the system.</p>

<p>Creating a good inventory and establishing baseline performance values form the燽asis upon
which you can identify future needs for network modification.</p>

<p>The list that follows includes the steps you need to take to document the network:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Record the model, serial number, and location of the servers, workstations, and routers. Record the warranty information for each device.</li></p>

<p><li>Make a note of where all warranty information is stored. This will be helpful when a product needs servicing or replacement.</li></p>

<p><li> Make a copy of important computer files such as AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS. Make a
complete set of system backup tapes. Copies of important tapes should be kept offsite in a safe
deposit box or commercial offsite data storage facility. (See <a href="ch10a.htm#528">Chapter 10</a>, &quot;Ensuring Network Security,&quot; for a discussion of network backup systems.)</li></p>

<p><li> Create a map of your network, noting the approximate distance between the
workstations and the server. Make a note of areas where a cable goes through a wall or is
placed in the plenum area between the ceiling and the floor above. This will be helpful to
network and building architects in planning for future network modifications. Your
documentation of cable runs can facilitate building inspections and help to demonstrate
compliance with regulations such as fire codes that prescribe rules for cables placed in the
plenum area of a building, as depicted in Figure 12.1. (Fire codes are discussed in Chapter 2, <a href="ch02b.htm#95">Lesson 1: Network Cabling</a>.)</li></p>
</ul>

</p>


<p>Understanding how a healthy network functions is as important as knowing how to solve
problems after the network has failed. Monitoring and documenting the network when it is
performing well provide baseline measurements against which unusual performance can be
compared.</p>

<p>The baseline must be established over time before anything goes wrong. After a baseline
exists, all network behaviors can be compared to it as part of the ongoing monitoring
process.</p>

<p>The baseline is especially helpful in establishing and identifying:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Daily network-utilization patterns.</li></p>

<p><li> Bottlenecks.</li></p>

<p><li> Heavy-usage patterns.</li></p>

<p><li> Different protocol traffic patterns.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="628"><h2>Documenting Network Performance</h2></A>
<p>After the hardware has been documented and your network is in operation, it is almost time
to record the network performance baseline. However, it is best to wait to do this until you
have verified that all network connections are correct, all爃ardware is operational, and any
necessary system fine-tuning has been accomplished. When the network's performance has been
determined to be acceptable, it is time to record the baseline.</p>

<p>The concept of network performance is a broad one that encompasses the entire network,
including:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Servers.</li></p>

<p><li> Network interface cards (NICs).</li></p>

<p><li> Cable connections to the NICs.</li></p>

<p><li> Hubs.</li></p>

<p><li> Cable runs.</li></p>

<p><li> Routers.</li></p>

<p><li> RJ-45 wall plates.</li></p>

<p><li> Workstation NICs.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>A selection of tools is available to help administrators document network performance,
including network monitors, protocol analyzers, and other utilities.</p>

<A NAME="629"><h3>Network Monitors</h3></A>
<p>A network monitor is a useful tool that captures and filters data packets and analyzes
network activity. It is easy to document the network performance indicators with a network
monitor, but it takes extra practice to quickly analyze the network performance statistics.
Some network operating systems include network monitoring software among their resources, and a
number of other software manufacturers also offer network monitors.</p>

<A NAME="630"><h3>Protocol Analyzers</h3></A>
<p>A protocol analyzer is a tool that keeps track of network statistics. It can capture bad
frames and isolate their source. (Data frames are packets of information transmitted as a unit
on a network. They are defined by the network's data-link layer and exist only on the wire
between network nodes.) A protocol analyzer can be helpful for a company that has a large
network with a highly trained staff.</p>

<p>Various protocol analyzers exist. Protocol analyzers can be inexpensive software programs
that run on existing networked computers. More advanced and more expensive protocol analyzers
are special-purpose portable computers that can be connected to any physical portion of the
network to better isolate data-transmission problems.</p>

<A NAME="631"><h3>Packet Internet Groper (Ping)</h3></A>
<p>To test if your network connection is complete from the server to the workstation, you can
use a simple utility, the Packet Internet Groper, better known as &quot;ping.&quot; The ping
utility works by sending a message to a remote computer. If the remote computer receives the
message, it responds with a reply message. The reply consists of the remote workstation's
IP address, the number of bytes in the message, how long it took to reply&#8212;given in
milliseconds (ms)&#8212;and the length of time-to-live (TTL) in seconds. If you receive back the
message &quot;Request timed out,&quot; this means that the remote workstation did not respond
before the TTL time expired. This might be the result of heavy network traffic or it might
indicate a physical disconnection in the path to the remote workstation.</p>

<p>The following is an example of the ping utility:</p>


<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr><td>
<pre>
C:\&gt;Ping 125.55.222.1

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 12.2</b> <i>Ping utility</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<A NAME="632"><h3>Tracert</h3></A>
<p>Another utility that documents network performance is called &quot;tracert.&quot; The UNIX
equivalent is called &quot;traceroute.&quot; While the ping utility merely lets us know that
the connection from A to B is complete, tracert informs us of the route and number of hops the
packet of data took to arrive at its destination.</p>

<p>Here is a simplified example of a tracert response:</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr><td>

book to view a presentation of the ping and tracert utilities.</p>

<H2>Other Software Tools</H2>
<P>Other software tools that document network performance include a variety of utilities that work with the TCP/IP protocol.</P>

<p><b>Ipconfig</b><br>
This diagnostic command displays all current TCP/IP network-configuration values. This command is useful on systems running DHCP, allowing users to determine which TCP/IP configuration values have been configured by DHCP.</p>

<p><b>Winipcfg</b><br>
A Windows 95 and 98 troubleshooting utility that enables users to access information about TCP/IP and network interface card settings. Winipcfg displays the physical address, IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway settings of the primary TCP/IP NIC (or settings of multiple NICs if more than one is installed).</p>

<p><b>Netstat</b><br>
This command is available only if the TCP/IP protocol has been installed. Netstat displays all connections and listening ports, Ethernet statistics, addresses and port numbers, protocol connections and statistics, and the contents of the routing table.</p>

<p><b>Nbtstat</b><br>
Nbtstat is available only if the TCP/IP protocol has been installed. It displays protocol statistics and current TCP/IP connections using NetBIOS over TCP/IP. This utility can list:

<ul>
<p><li>A remote computer's name table.
<p><li>The remote computer's name table using its IP address.
<p><li>The contents of the NetBIOS name cache, giving the IP address of each name.
<p><li>Local NetBIOS names. 
<p><li>Name resolution statistics for Windows networking name resolution.
</ul>
<p>Nbtstat can also:
<ul>
<p><li>Display both client and server sessions, listing the remote computers by IP address only.
<p><li>Display both client and server sessions. It attempts to convert the remote computer IP address to a name using the HOSTS file.
</ul>


<A NAME="633"><h2>Bottlenecks</h2></A>
<p>Most network activities involve the coordinated actions of several devices. Each device
takes a certain amount of time to perform its part of the transaction. Poor performance results
when one of these devices uses noticeably more CPU time than the others. The problem device is
referred to as a <i>bottleneck</i>. Performance monitoring can help identify and eliminate
bottlenecks.</p>

<p>Finding bottlenecks is usually an indication that upgrading a portion of the network is
necessary. To resolve bottleneck problems, an administrator must be able to identify the
devices that are taking more time than they should to perform their tasks. Administrators can
use performance monitors, included with the major network operating systems, to identify
bottlenecks.</p>

<p>These devices tend to become bottlenecks:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> CPUs</li></p>

<p><li> Memory</li></p>

<p><li> Network cards</li></p>

<p><li> Disk controllers</li></p>

<p><li> Network media</li></p>
</ul>

<p>A device becomes a bottleneck for one of the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> It is not being used efficiently.</li></p>

<p><li> It is using other resources or CPU time more than it should.</li></p>

<p><li> It is too slow.</li></p>

<p><li> It does not have the capacity to handle the load placed on it.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Proper monitoring will uncover these situations and provide information to help identify the
problem component or components.</p>

<A NAME="634"><h2>Documenting Server Performance</h2></A>
<p>Server performance is usually affected by an increase in the number of users who are on the
system. Comparing current server performance statistics with your initial baseline information
can help you confirm a suspicion that the server is not running as well as it once did.
However, your first hint that the server is not performing well is just as likely to come from
the end users. Their daily use and爁amiliarity with system response is a good indicator of
server performance. (<A HREF="ch13a.htm#676">Chapter 13</A>, &quot;Troubleshooting a Network,&quot; discusses how to
interview users when troubleshooting network problems.)</p>

<p>Performance monitors&#8212;software that is included on most operating systems&#8212;track
server performance on a network and can monitor several system functions, displaying the
results in tabular or graphical format. Certain indicators can help locate and isolate problems
with server performance, including:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Demand for server resources.</li></p>

<p><li> Areas of data congestion.</li></p>

<p><li> The activity of an individual process.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>A performance monitor can observe the performance of a remote system and alert the system
administrator to server conditions that need attention. It can also transfer data from the
performance monitor to other performance tools.</p>

<A NAME="635"><h2>Total System Management</h2></A>
<p>As networks have grown in size and complexity, keeping track of an entire system has become
more challenging. Because of this, vendors have developed utilities that do for system
management what performance monitors have done for system monitoring. These system-wide
management applications provide centralized management for distributed systems programs.</p>

<p>System-management software provides centralized administration of computers in a WAN. This
service includes:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Collecting hardware and software inventory information.</li></p>

<p><li> Distributing and installing software.</li></p>

<p><li> Sharing network applications.</li></p>

<p><li> Troubleshooting hardware and software problems.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>The system management software complements other system management utilities found in the
network operating system. The examples that follow use Microsoft's Systems Management
Server to illustrate these utilities.</p>

<p><b>Inventory Management</b> This software collects and maintains an inventory of hardware and
software for each computer and stores the inventory in a database. Typical inventory items
include the type of CPU, amount of RAM, hard-disk size, operating system, and application
software for each component installed.</p>

<p><b>Software Distribution</b> After a computer's inventory has become part of the
database, a software distribution utility can install and configure new software or爑pgrade
previously installed software directly on a client. This distribution mechanism can also be
used to run commands, such as virus scans, on clients. Figure 12.3 shows Microsoft NT
Server's Systems Management Server distributing software.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 12.3</b> <i>Systems Management Server distributes software</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p><b>Shared Application Management</b> Shared applications can also be distributed to a server
for clients to access. When a user logs on to the network, the management software builds a
program folder on each client. See Figure 12.4 for an example. These program folders in turn
contain more folders that include the program icons representing the shared applications
available to the user. To start the shared application, the user selects an icon from the
program folder displayed on the local workstation. (The application is actually stored on the
server's hard disk.)</p>

</p>


<p><b>Remote Control and Network Monitor</b> Systems Management Server, shown in Figure 12.5,
provides Help Desk and diagnostic utilities that allow you to control and monitor remote
clients directly. The diagnostic utilities let you view the client's current configuration.
The Help Desk utilities provide direct access to燼 remote client.</p>

<A NAME="636"><h2>Maintaining a Network History</h2></A>
<p>Documenting a network's history is as important as monitoring its real-time performance.
A network's written record can:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Indicate significant performance or equipment issues that real-time monitoring might miss.</li></p>

<p><li> Provide a background against which current information can be compared.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>If there is more than one administrator, it is important that they all record in only one
shared logbook. This log can become an invaluable guide to future administrators who might need
to trace a performance problem or resolve network issues related to system growth as well as
equipment, maintenance, and system configuration changes.</p>

<p>This document should record:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Purchase and installation dates and descriptions.</li></p>

<p><li>Complete descriptive information about key individuals, such as contractors responsible for installation.</li></p>

<p><li> Vendor, model, and warranty information, including serial numbers.</li></p>

<p><li> The installation process and its results.</li></p>

<p><li> The initial and subsequent network configurations.</li></p>

<p><li> Network usage policies and procedures.</li></p>

<p><li> Network resources and drive assignments.</li></p>

<p><li>Copies of crucial network configuration files, such as CONFIG.SYS and .BAT files.</li></p>

<p><li> Any unusual application program configurations.</li></p>

<p><li> Any particular computer, board, or peripheral settings.</li></p>

<p><li> Any problems and their solutions.</li></p>

<p><li> Hardware or software changes.</li></p>

<p><li> Any activities that affect the topology or architecture.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>It is important that all network historical documentation be easy to access and easy to
read. Graphics or even hand-drawn sketches can be very helpful.</p>

<p>A network's history can be either logged online or in a notebook. Keeping the log in a
computer file can cause difficulties, however, especially if the file is stored on a hard disk
and the computer or disk crashes. Should such an event occur, this is exactly the type of
behavior the log should record.</p>

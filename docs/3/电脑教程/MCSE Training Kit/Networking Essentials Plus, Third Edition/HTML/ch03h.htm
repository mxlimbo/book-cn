<p><li> Access methods prevent _______________________ access to the cable.</li></p>

<p><li>With CSMA/CD, if there is data on the cable, no other computer may _________________ until the data has reached its destination and the cable is燾lear again.</li></p>

<p><li>CSMA/CD is known as a _____________________ access method because computers on the network compete for an opportunity to send data.</li></p>

<p><li>With more traffic on a CSMA/CD network, _______________ tend to increase, slowing the network down.</li></p>

<p><li>With the token-passing access method, only one computer at a time can use the token; therefore, there are no ___________________ or _____________________.</li></p>

<p><li>With the demand-priority access method, the __________________ manage network access by doing round-robin searches for requests to send from all nodes.</li></p>

<p><li>In the demand-priority access method, transmissions are not __________________ to all other computers on the network.</li></p>

<p><li>A token is a special type of __________________ that circulates around a cable ring.</li></p>

<li> With data masses divided into ______________, individual transmissions occur more
frequently so that every computer on the network has more opportunities to transmit and receive
data.</li>

<p><li>Packets may contain session-control codes, such as error correction, that indicate the need for a _________________________.</li></p>

<p><li>A packet's components are grouped into three sections: _____________, data, and trailer.</li></p>

<p><li> In a packet, the header usually contains an error-checking component called a CRC. True False</li></p>

<p><li>The structure of the packets is defined by the communication method, known as a protocol, used by the two computers. True False</li></p>

<p><li>Every network interface card sees all packets sent on its segment, but it interrupts the computer only if the packet's address matches its individual address. True False</li></p>

<p><li> The trailer of a packet contains the destination address. True False</li></p>

<p><li> Typically, Ethernet is a baseband architecture that uses a ________ topology.</li></p>

<p><li>Ethernet relies on the __________________ access method to regulate traffic on the main cable segment.</li></p>

<p><li> The maximum length of a 10BaseT segment is ________ meters.</li></p>

<p><li>The 10BaseT topology is an Ethernet network that uses ______________________________ cable to connect stations.</li></p>

<p><li>Typically, the hub of a 10BaseT network serves as a _____________________ _____________________.</li></p>

<p><li>A thinnet network can combine as many as __________ cable segments connected by four repeaters, but only three segments can have stations attached.</li></p>

<li> Because single-segment 10Base2 Ethernet limits would be too confining for a large
business, _________________ can be used to join Ethernet segments and extend the network to a
total length of 925 meters (about 3035 feet).</li>

<p><li> A 10Base5 topology is also referred to as ___________________.</li></p>

<p><li> Fast Ethernet is another name for the ________________ topology.</li></p>

<p><li> Ethernet can use several communication _______________ including TCP/IP.</li></p>

<p><li> The 100BaseTX topology runs on UTP Category _____ data-grade cable.</li></p>

<p><li>A 100BaseVG network is built on a __________ topology with all computers attached to a hub.</li></p>

<p><li> A Token Ring network is an implementation of IEEE standard _____________.</li></p>

<p><li>In the IBM implementation of Token Ring, a star-wired ring, the actual physical ring of cable is in the ________.</li></p>

<p><li>In a Token Ring frame the Access Control field indicates whether the frame is燼 _______________ frame or a _____________ frame.</li></p>

<p><li>When a frame reaches the destination computer, that computer copies the frame into its _____________ _____________.</li></p>

<p><li>Token passing is ___________________ , meaning that a computer cannot force its way onto the network as it can in a CSMA/CD environment.</li></p>

<p><li>When a frame returns to its sending computer, that computer ____________ the frame and puts a new token back on the ring.</li></p>

<p><li>Cables attach the individual clients and servers to the MSAU that works like other ______________ hubs.</li></p>

<p><li>When an IBM Token Ring network is full, adding another __________ can enlarge the network.</li></p>

<p><li>MSAUs were designed to sense when a _______________ _______________ _________ fails and to disconnect from it.</li></p>

<p><li> Each single Token Ring can accommodate ________ computers using STP cable.</li></p>

<p><li> Most Token Ring networks use IBM Cabling System Type ____ UTP cabling.</li></p>

<p><li> LocalTalk uses __________________ as an access method in a bus or tree topology.</li></p>

<p><li>When a device attached to an AppleTalk network comes online, the device broadcasts an ________________ to determine if any other device is using it.</li></p>

<p><li> A single LocalTalk network supports a maximum of ______ devices.</li></p>

<p><li>Single LocalTalk networks can be joined together into one larger network through the use of _____________.</li></p>

<p><li> ArcNet uses a token-passing access method in a ________-_______ topology.</li></p>

<li> An ArcNet token moves from one computer to the next according to the order in which it
is connected to the __________________, regardless of how they are placed on the network
environment.</li>

<p><li> Each computer in an ArcNet network is connected by cable to a ________.</li></p>

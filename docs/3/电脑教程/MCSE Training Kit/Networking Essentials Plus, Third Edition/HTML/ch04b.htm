<A NAME="229"><h1>Lesson 1: Introduction to Network Operating Systems</h1></A>
<p>Just as a computer cannot operate without a computer operating system, a network of
computers cannot operate without a network operating system. Without a network operating system
of some kind, individual computers cannot share resources, and other users cannot make use of
those resources.</p>

<p>This lesson provides a general introduction to network operating systems (sometimes referred
to as NOSs). It describes the basic features and functions of an NOS and contrasts these with
the capabilities of a stand-alone operating system.</p>

<A NAME="230"><h2>Overview</h2></A>
<p>Depending on a network operating system's manufacturer, a desktop computer's
networking software can be either added to the computer's own operating system or
integrated with it.</p>

<p>Novell's NetWare is the most familiar and popular example of an NOS in which the client
computer's networking software is added on to its existing computer operating system. The
desktop computer needs both operating systems in order to handle stand-alone and networking
functions together.</p>

<p>Network operating system software is integrated into a number of popular operating systems
including Windows 2000 Server/Windows 2000 Professional, Windows NT Server/Windows NT
Workstation, Windows 98, Windows 95, and AppleTalk.</p>

<p>Each configuration&#8212;separate computer and network operating systems or an operating
system combining the functions of both&#8212;has benefits and drawbacks. It is your job as a
networking technician to determine which configuration best suits the needs of your
network.</p>

<A NAME="231"><h3>Coordinating Hardware and Software</h3></A>
<p>A computer's operating system coordinates the interaction between the computer and the
programs&#8212;or applications&#8212;it is running. It controls the allocation and use of
hardware resources such as:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Memory.</li></p>

<p><li> CPU time.</li></p>

<p><li> Disk space.</li></p>

<p><li> Peripheral devices.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>In a networking environment, servers provide resources to the network clients, and client
network software makes these resources available to the client computer. The network and the
client operating systems are coordinated so that all portions of the network function
properly.</p>

<A NAME="232"><h3>Multitasking</h3></A>
<p>A <i>multitasking</i> operating system, as the name suggests, provides the means for a
computer to process more than one task at a time. A true multitasking operating system can run
as many tasks as there are processors. If there are more tasks than processors, the computer
must arrange for the available processors to devote a certain amount of time to each task,
alternating between tasks until all are completed. With this system, the computer appears to be
working on several tasks at once.</p>

<p>There are two primary forms of multitasking:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Preemptive</b> In preemptive multitasking, the operating system can take control of the processor without the task's cooperation.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Nonpreemptive (cooperative)</b> In nonpreemptive multitasking, the task itself
decides when to give up the processor. Programs written for nonpreemptive multitasking systems
must include provisions for yielding control of the processor. No other program can run until
the nonpreemptive program has given up control of the processor.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Because the interaction between the stand-alone operating system and the NOS is ongoing, a
preemptive multitasking system offers certain advantages. For example, when the situation
requires it, the preemptive system can shift CPU activity from a local task to a network
task.</p>

<A NAME="233"><h2>Software Components</h2></A>
<p>For computer operating systems that do not include networking functions, network client
software must be installed on top of the existing operating system. Other operating systems,
such as Windows NT, integrate the network and the computer operating systems. While these
integrated systems have some advantages, they do not preclude using other NOSs. When setting up
multivendor network environments, it is important to consider the issue of <i>
interoperability.</i> (Elements or components of computer operating systems are said to
&quot;interoperate&quot; when they can function in different computer environments.) A NetWare
server, for instance, can interoperate with other servers such as Windows NT, and users of
Apple computers can interoperate with (that is, access resources on) both NetWare and Windows
NT servers.</p>

<p>A network operating system such as the one shown in Figure 4.1:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Ties together all computers and peripherals.</li></p>

<p><li> Coordinates the functions of all computers and peripherals.</li></p>

<p><li> Provides security by controlling access to data and peripherals.</li></p>
</ul>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 4.1</b> <i>A network server ties the network together</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>Two major components of network software are:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Network software that is installed on clients.</li></p>

<p><li> Network software that is installed on servers.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="234"><h3>Client Software</h3></A>
<p>In a stand-alone system, when the user types a command that requests the computer to perform
a task, the request goes over the computer's local bus to the computer's CPU (see
Figure 4.2). For example, if you want to see a directory listing on one of the local hard
disks, the CPU interprets and executes the request and then displays the results in a directory
listing in the window.</p>


<p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 4.2</b> <i>Directory listing request on a local hard disk</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>In a network environment, however, when a user initiates a request to use a resource that
exists on a server in another part of the network, the request has to be forwarded, or
redirected, away from the local bus, out onto the network, and from there to the server with
the requested resource. This forwarding is performed by the redirector.</p>

<p><b>The Redirector</b></p>

<p>A <i>redirector</i> processes forwarding requests. Depending on the networking software,
this redirector is sometimes referred to as the &quot;shell&quot; or the &quot;requester.&quot;
The redirector is a small section of code in the NOS that:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Intercepts requests in the computer.</li></p>

<p><li>Determines if the requests should continue in the local computer's bus or be redirected over the network to another server.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Redirector activity originates in a client computer when the user issues a request for a
network resource or service. Figure 4.3 shows how a redirector forwards requests to the
network. The user's computer is referred to as a client because it is making a request of a
server. The request is intercepted by the redirector and forwarded out onto the network.</p>

<p>The server processes the connection requested by client redirectors and gives them access to
the resources they request. In other words, the server services&#8212;or fulfills&#8212;the request made by the client.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 4.3</b> <i>The redirector forwards requests for remote resources onto the network</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p><b>Designators</b></p>

<p>If you need to access a shared directory, and you have permission to access it, your
operating system will usually provide several choices for how to access the directory. For
example, with Windows NT you could use Windows Explorer to connect to the network drive using
the Network Neighborhood icon. You can also map to the drive. (Drive mapping is the assignment
of a letter or name to a disk drive so that the operating system or network server can identify
and locate it.) To map to the drive, right-click the directory icon from the Network
Neighborhood; a dialog box will prompt you to assign an available letter of the alphabet as a
drive designator, such as G:. Thereafter, you can refer to the shared directory on the remote
computer as G:, and the redirector will locate it. The redirector also keeps track of which
drive designators are associated with which network resources.</p>

<p><b>Peripherals</b></p>

<p>Redirectors can send requests to peripherals as well as to shared directories. Figure 4.4
depicts the redirector on a local computer sending a request to a print server. The request is
redirected away from the originating computer and sent over the network to the target. In this
case, the target is the print server for the requested printer.</p>

<p>With the redirector, LPT1 or COM1 can refer to network printers instead of local printers.
The redirector will intercept any print job going to LPT1 and forward it out of the local
machine to the specified network printer.</p>


<p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 4.4</b> <i>Request to print redirected out LPT1 to a printer on the network</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>Using the redirector, users don't need to be concerned with the actual location of data
or peripherals, or with the complexities of making a connection. To access data on a network
computer, for example, a user need only type the drive designator assigned to the location of
the resource, and the redirector determines the actual routing.</p>

<A NAME="235"><h3>Server Software</h3></A>
<p>With server software, users at other machines, the client computers, can share
the server's data and peripherals including printers, plotters, and directories.</p>

<p>In Figure 4.5, a user is requesting a directory listing on a shared remote hard disk. The
request is forwarded by the redirector on to the network, where it is passed to the file and
print server containing the shared directory. The request is granted, and the directory listing
is provided.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 4.5</b> <i>Directory-listing request on a remote hard drive</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p><b>Resource Sharing</b></p>

<p>Sharing is the term used to describe resources made publicly available for access by anyone
on the network. Most NOSs not only allow sharing, but also determine the degree of sharing.
Options for sharing include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Allowing different users different levels of access to the resources.</li></p>

<p><li>Coordinating access to resources to make sure that two users do not use the same resource at the same time.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>For example, an office manager wants everyone on the network to be familiar with a certain
document (file), so she shares the document. However, she controls access to the document by
sharing it in such a way that:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Some users will be able only to read it.</li></p>

<p><li> Some users will be able to read it and make changes in it.</li></p>
</ul>



<p><b>Managing Users</b></p>

<p>Network operating systems also allow a network administrator to determine which people, or
groups of people, will be able to access network resources. A network administrator can use the
NOS to:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Create user privileges, tracked by the network operating system, that indicate who gets to use the network.</li></p>

<p><li> Grant or deny user privileges on the network.</li></p>

<p><li> Remove users from the list of users that the network operating system tracks.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>To simplify the task of managing users in a large network, NOSs allow for the creation of
user groups. By classifying individuals into groups, the administrator can assign privileges to
the group. All group members have the same privileges, which have been assigned to the group as
a whole. When a new user joins the network, the administrator can assign the new user to the
appropriate group, with its accompanying rights and privileges.</p>

<p><b>Managing the Network</b></p>

<p>Some advanced NOSs include management tools to help administrators keep track of network
behavior. If a problem develops on the network, management tools can detect signs of trouble
and present these in a chart, or other, format. With these tools, the network manager can take
corrective action before the problem halts the network.</p>

<A NAME="236"><h2>Choosing a Network Operating System</h2></A>
<p>In Chapter 1, <a href="ch01d.htm#81">Exercise 1.3</a>, we looked at a network planning problem. We saw that network
planning decisions must take into account the services and resources expected or required of
the network. Those resources, and how they are shared and accessed, are determined by the
network operating system.</p>

<p>In planning a network, the choice among network operating systems can be narrowed
significantly if you first determine which network architecture&#8212;client/server or
peer-to-peer&#8212;best meets your needs. This choice can often be made by deciding which kinds
of security are called for. Server-based networking allows you to include security capabilities
well beyond those available to a peer-to-peer network. If security is not an issue, a
peer-to-peer networking environment might be appropriate.</p>

<p>After your network security needs have been identified, your next step is to determine the
kinds of interoperability necessary for the network as a whole. Each NOS addresses
interoperability in different ways, so you should keep your own interoperability needs in mind
when evaluating each NOS. If your network choice is peer-to-peer, your options for security and
interoperability will be diminished because of the limitations inherent in that architecture.
If your network choice is server-based, further assessment is needed to determine whether
interoperability will be dealt with as a service on the network server or as a client
application on each networked computer. Server-based interoperability is easier to manage
because, like other services, it is centrally located; client-based interoperability requires
installation and configuration at each computer, making interoperability much more difficult to
manage.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon to find both methods&#8212;a network service on the server and network
client applications at each computer&#8212;in a single network. For example, a NetWare server is
often implemented with a service for Apple computers, whereas Microsoft Windows network
interoperability is achieved with a network client application at each personal computer.</p>

<p>When choosing a network operating system, first determine the networking services that will
be required. Standard services include security, file sharing, printing and messaging;
additional services include interoperability support for connections to other operating
systems. For any given NOS, determine which interoperability services or networking clients are
best implemented to suit your needs.</p>

<p>The major server-based network operating systems are Microsoft Windows NT 4 and Windows 2000
Server, and Novell NetWare 3.<i>x</i>, 4.<i>x</i> and 5.<i>x</i>. The principal peer-to-peer
network operating systems are AppleTalk, Windows 95 and 98, and UNIX (including Linux and
Solaris). The lessons that follow examine the major network operating systems to learn how each
of them defines the networking environment.</p>

<A NAME="529"><h2>About This Chapter</h2></A>
<p>Up to this point, our emphasis has been on sharing as the principal reason for creating a
network. However, security&#8212;protecting the networked computers and the data they store and
share&#8212;is also an important factor in networking. The larger the enterprise, the greater
the need for security. In this chapter, we revisit some of the ways to enable sharing on a
network that were covered in <A HREF="ch09a.htm#486">Chapter 9</A>, &quot;Establishing Network Shares and Accounts.&quot;
Here, however, our focus shifts away from sharing procedures; instead we look at sharing from
the perspective of how to establish and maintain network and data security.</p>

<p>Security is more than preventing unauthorized access to computers and their data; it
includes maintaining the proper physical environment to permit the network to function
effectively. We take a look at preventive maintenance and how to take steps to prevent data
loss and minimize network failures, whether from human or other causes, such as natural
disasters.</p>

<A NAME="530"><h2>Before You Begin</h2></A>
<p>Because this chapter is a continuation of the lessons presented in <a href="ch09a.htm">Chapter 9</a>, you should be
familiar with the concepts and procedures introduced in that chapter.</p>

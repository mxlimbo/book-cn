<p><li>An external modem is a small box that is connected to the computer by a ______________ cable running from the computer's port to the modem's computer-cable connection.</li></p>

<p><li> The modem at the _______________ end converts digital signals into analog signals.</li></p>

<p><li>Baud rate refers to the speed of oscillation of the _____________ _____________ on which a bit of data is carried.</li></p>

<p><li> The bps can be greater than the __________ rate.</li></p>

<p><li> Asynchronous transmission occurs over __________________ __________.</li></p>

<p><li>The Microcom Network Protocol (MNP) is a standard for asynchronous __________ - _____________ control.</li></p>

<p><li>In asynchronous communication, it is possible to double throughput by using ____________________ without having to pay for a faster channel speed.</li></p>

<p><li>Synchronous communication relies on a _____________ scheme coordinated between two devices.</li></p>

<p><li>More advanced, complex repeaters can act as multiport _________ to connect different types of media.</li></p>

<p><li>Repeaters do not have a __________________ function and so will pass along all data from one segment to the next.</li></p>

<p><li> A repeater takes a weak signal and ______________________ it.</li></p>

<p><li> A repeater functions at the ________________ layer of the OSI reference model.</li></p>

<p><li> If the volume of traffic from one or two computers or a single department is爁looding
the network with data and slowing down the entire operation, a燺_______________ could isolate
those computers or that department.</li></p>

<p><li>The bridge builds a routing table based on the ________________ addresses of computers that have sent traffic through the bridge.</li></p>

<p><li>Bridges work at the OSI __________ - _________ layer and, specifically, the _____________ ______________ ________________ sublayer.</li></p>

<p><li>Bridges are often used in large networks that have widely dispersed segments joined by __________________ ___________.</li></p>

<p><li> Under spanning tree algorithm (STA), software can sense the existence of more than one
_____________, determine which would be the most efficient, and then configure the bridge to
use that one.</li></p>

<p><li>Bridges connect two segments and regenerate the signal at the ______________ level.</li></p>

<p><li> Routers work at the _________________ layer of the OSI reference model.</li></p>

<p><li> Because they must perform complex functions on each packet, routers are _________________ than most bridges.</li></p>

<p><li> Routers do not look at the destination node address; they look only at the _________________ address.</li></p>

<p><li>Unlike bridges, routers can accommodate multiple active ____________ between LAN segments and choose among them.</li></p>

<p><li> The two major types of routers are ____________ and __________________.</li></p>

<p><li> A brouter will ______________ nonroutable protocols.</li></p>

<p><li> Most often, gateways are dedicated ________________ on a network.</li></p>

<p><li>The gateway takes the data from one environment, strips it, and repackages it in the __________________ ___________ from the destination system.</li></p>

<p><li>Gateways are ___________ specific, which means that they are dedicated to a particular type of transfer.</li></p>

<p><li>With the exception of ADSL, public telephone lines require users to _______________ make a connection for each communication session.</li></p>

<p><li> The three factors an administrator must take into account when considering how best to
implement communication between two modems are __________________, _______________, and
__________.</li></p>

<p><li>Leased lines provide ___________________ connections that do not use a series of switches to complete the connection.</li></p>

<p><li>A good remote-access option that offers stable lines for companies that are constantly communicating between networks is to use ______________ lines.</li></p>

<p><li> The ____________ - _____ - _____________ _____________________ <u>_</u>__________________ allows a remote client to establish a secure connection to the corporate LAN
over the Internet and RAS.</li></p>

<p><li>Because the PSTN was designed primarily for voice, _________ - _____ lines do not have the consistent quality required for secure data communications.</li></p>

<p><li>A dedicated line is _______________ and more _______________ than a dial-up connection.</li></p>

<p><li> One advantage that dedicated lines offer over dial-up lines is that the service company
implements ____________ _______________________ to improve communication, thereby ensuring line
quality.</li></p>

<p><li>Digital lines provide ______________ - ___ - _____________ synchronous communication.</li></p>

<p><li> Because DDS uses ________________ communication, it does not require modems.</li></p>

<p><li>T1 uses a technology called ____________________ in which several signals from different sources are collected into a component and fed into one cable for transmission.</li></p>

<p><li>T1 can accommodate 24 ____________________ data transmissions over each two-wire pair.</li></p>

<p><li>Subscribers who do not need or cannot afford the bandwidth of an entire T1 line can subscribe to one or more T1 _________________.</li></p>

<p><li>With packet switching, the data is broken down into packets, and each packet is tagged with a _____________________ _________________ and other information.</li></p>

<p><li>At the destination, the packets are _____________________ into the original message.</li></p>

<p><li>Two packets from the original data package can arrive out of sequence because they followed different ____________ to reach the same destination.</li></p>

<p><li>Virtual circuits are composed of a series of ________________ connections between the sending computer and the receiving computer.</li></p>

<p><li> Because of its extensive ____________ _______________, X.25 can appear to be slow.</li></p>

<p><li> X.25 was originally developed for the __________________ environment.</li></p>

<p><li>Frame-relay data travels from a network over a ________________ _________________ line to a data switch and into the frame-relay network.</li></p>

<p><li>Frame-relay networks can also provide subscribers with __________________ as needed, which lets the customer make nearly any type of transmission.</li></p>

<p><li>Frame-relay networks are faster at performing basic ________________ - __________________ operations than are X.25 networks.</li></p>

<p><li>ATM is an advanced implementation of ______________ ______________ that provides high-speed data transmission rates.</li></p>

<p><li> ATM transmits data in 53-byte _________ rather than variable-length frames.</li></p>

<p><li> ATM switches are multiport devices that can act as either ____________ to爁orward data
from one computer to another within a network or _________________ to forward data at high
speeds to remote networks.</li></p>

<p><li>ATM uses switches as ___________________________ to permit several computers to put data on a network simultaneously.</li></p>

<p><li>ATM can be used with existing _____________ designed for other communications systems.</li></p>

<p><li> Basic Rate ISDN divides its available ________________ into three data channels.</li></p>

<p><li>FDDI is a specification that describes a high-speed (100 Mbps) token-ring LAN that uses ___________ - __________ media.</li></p>

<p><li> FDDI can be used for __________________ networks to which other, low-capacity LANs can connect.</li></p>

<p><li>A computer on an FDDI network can transmit as many frames as it can produce within a predetermined time before letting the ____________ go.</li></p>

<p><li>Traffic in an FDDI network consists of two similar streams flowing in opposite directions around two counter-rotating ______________.</li></p>

<p><li> An advantage of the dual-ring topology is ______________________.</li></p>

<p><li> To isolate serious failures in the ring, FDDI uses a system called _________________ in
which a computer that detects a fault sends a signal onto the network.

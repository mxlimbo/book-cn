<A NAME="588"><h1>Chapter Summary</h1></A>
<p>The following points summarize the key concepts of this chapter:</p>

<A NAME="589"><h3>Making Networks Secure</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li> Network planning must include plans for security.</li></p>

<p><li>The level of security needed depends on the size of the organization and the sensitivity of the data.</li></p>

<p><li>The two security models that keep data and hardware resources safe are password-protected shares and access permissions.</li></p>

<p><li>Merely requiring users to log on does not, in itself, ensure the security of the爊etwork.</li></p>

<p><li>The best way to assign permissions is through setting up groups. Administrators can then assign permissions to the group rather than to individuals.</li></p>

<p><li>Ways to enhance security include use of auditing, diskless computers, data encryption, and virus protection.</li></p>

<p><li>Building in virus prevention and recovery policies should be part of a network爏trategy.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="590"><h3>Maintaining a Healthy Network Environment</h3></A>
<ul>
<li> When assessing network environmental conditions and requirements, it is important to
consider components that are out of sight, such as wiring, as爓ell燼s visible components, such
as computers.</li>

<p><li> Controlling temperature and humidity are key factors in maintaining a user-friendly environment.</li></p>

<p><li>The accumulation of material on and around computers can lead to network failures.</li></p>

<p><li>It is important to be aware of the environmental stresses placed on hidden network components, as well as components in plain view.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="591"><h3>Avoiding Data Loss</h3></A>
<ul>
<p><li>Planning for a disaster is an essential part of implementing a successful network.</li></p>

<p><li> A network disaster plan should encompass the loss of hardware and data.</li></p>

<p><li> Tape backup is the most common method of preventing data loss.</li></p>

<p><li>Loss of electrical power can causes files to become corrupted, and any data being held in RAM to be lost.</li></p>

<p><li>An uninterruptible power supply provides temporary power so that critical data can be properly stored before the network or computer goes down.</li></p>

<p><li> Fault tolerance is the automatic duplication of data to prevent loss.</li></p>

<p><li>Fault tolerant strategies are called redundant arrays of independent disks (RAID) and include disk striping and disk mirroring.</li></p>

<p><li> Sector sparing is an advanced method of fault tolerance.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="489"><h1>Lesson 1: Creating Network Shares</h1></A>
<p>In this lesson we define network shares, examine which resources can be shared on a network,
and look at who is able to set network shares.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to:</b> </p>

<ul>
<p><li> Describe how to share files and directories with anyone on a network.</li></p>

<p><li> Share a printer on a network.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 20 minutes</b> </p>

<A NAME="490"><h2>Sharing Resources on a Network</h2></A>
<p>Before you can share resources with another computer, your workstation must have client
software installed and be configured as a network client. You will have to establish the
computer's network identity, enable sharing, and set access privileges for the resources
the computer will share. The procedure for installing and configuring client software depends
on the operating system you are using and the operating system of the network on which you
intend to share resources.</p>

<A NAME="491"><h2>Sharing Disks and Files</h2></A>
<p>At its simplest, resource sharing between computers consists of nothing more than passing
files from one computer to another on floppy disks. This method places severe limits on the
volume of data, as well as the speed and distance in which it can be shared, but even this
method is occasionally useful.</p>

<p>Another technique for resource sharing is to directly connect two computers together by
means of a cable link between the serial communications (COM) ports of each computer. Figure
9.1 shows two computers connected through their COM ports. To connect computers in this way
requires a null modem cable and serial communication software. (A null modem cable connects the
output pins in one computer's serial port to the input pins in the other.)</p>

</p>


<p>Communication software is required for each computer in order to make use of the physical
connection between the computers. You must configure one computer as a host, or server, and one
as a client. The client computer will then have access to data on the host. While this is not a
true local area network (LAN), it is a practical method for providing a temporary connection
between computers for the transfer of files. Direct cable connections are most often used to
share files between a desktop computer and a laptop computer.</p>

<p>Sharing information efficiently is not as simple as connecting computers together with
cables. In a network environment, with many users and job requirements, access rights, or
permissions, need to be established. These allow specific network users to access information
according to the needs of their jobs, while blocking unwelcome access to confidential or
valuable data.</p>

<A NAME="492"><h2>Sharing in a Peer-to-Peer Environment</h2></A>
<p>The simplest and most convenient method of networking is peer-to-peer. In this networking
environment, data sharing occurs at the drive or folder level. Any drive or any folder on a
drive can be shared. Each computer shares its drive or folder resources to the network, and
each user is responsible for setting the shares. The user can also choose to share printer
resources.</p>

<A NAME="493"><h3>Software</h3></A>
<p>In order to share on a peer-to-peer network, no matter which operating system is燽eing used,
file and print sharing must first be enabled on the computer. Each operating system has its own
methods for enabling sharing.</p>

<A NAME="494"><h3>Sharing Printers, Drives, and Folders</h3></A>
<p>After sharing has been enabled, you can decide which drives, folders, and printers to make
available to the network. Sharing options include hard drives, CD-ROM drives, floppy-disk
drives, and folders. To set up any of these printer or file-related devices for sharing, you
will have to designate each one as a shared resource and identify the level of sharing
available. (Devices such as scanners and modems cannot be shared.) Remember that after a
resource is shared on a peer-to-peer network, it is available to the entire network.</p>

<p>The rest of this lesson discusses how networks share resources on specific operating
systems.</p>

<A NAME="495"><h3>Microsoft Windows 95 and 98 Networking</h3></A>
<p><b>Software</b></p>

<p>Microsoft Windows 95 and 98 include several choices of client software. The most common is
Microsoft's Client for Microsoft Networks. To install Client for Microsoft Networks, open
the Control Panel and double-click the <b>Network</b> icon. Click <b>Add</b> 爐o display the <b>
Select Network Component Type</b> dialog box. Because you will be adding a Microsoft network
client, select <b>Client</b> and then click <b>Add.</b> The燿ialog box shown in Figure 9.2 will
be displayed.</p>

<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('f09xx02x.htm')"> <img src="images/f09xx02.JPG" width=404 height=295 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 9.2</b> <i>Select Network Client dialog box</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>In the <b>Manufacturers</b> list, select <b>Microsoft</b> and in the <b>Network Client</b> 
list, select <b>Client for Microsoft Networks</b>. Select <b>OK</b> to add the client service
to the system.</p>

<p>At this point, you will need to add a networking protocol. Client for Microsoft Networks can
be used with the IPX/SPX, NetBEUI, and TCP/IP protocols. Select the protocol appropriate to
your networking environment.</p>

<p>After you have installed Client for Microsoft Networks software, you will be able to share
resources with any network that uses the SMB (Server Message Block) file-sharing protocol. This
includes any computer using Windows 95 and 98, Windows NT Workstation, Windows for Workgroups,
or LAN Manager.</p>

<p><b>Sharing Printers, Drives, and Folders</b></p>

<p>After networking has been enabled on the computer, directorys, folders, and printers can be
shared on the network. To share these resources you must enable <b>File and Print
Sharing</b>.</p>

<p>Right-click the <b>Network Neighborhood</b> icon and click <b>Properties</b> from the menu
to open the <b>Network Properties</b> dialog box. Then click the <b>File and Print Sharing</b> 
button. See Figure 9.3.</p>


<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F09xx03x.htm')"> <img src="images/F09xx03.JPG" width=404 height=420 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 9.3</b> <i>Network Properties dialog box</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>The <b>File and Print Sharing</b> dialog box contains two check boxes:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>I want to be able to give others access to my files</b>.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>I want to be able to allow others to print to my printer(s)</b>.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>You can select either one or both check boxes. After you have enabled either or both check
boxes, you can start sharing your computer's resources.</p>

<p>Although you have enabled sharing on the computer, your resources won't be available on
the network until you have designated which resources you want to share. To share a device or
folder, open Windows Explorer, right-click the device or folder icon, and click <b>Sharing</b> 
from the menu. This displays the <b>Sharing</b> tab, as shown in Figure 9.4, in the <b>
Properties</b> dialog box for the device or folder.</p>


<p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 9.4</b> <i>Sharing tab</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>Selecting the <b>Shared As</b> radio button allows you to set the share name and to add a
brief description of the shared resource. (The radio button is a circle appearing next to each
of several options in a dialog box; when selected, it has a smaller black circle inside it.) In
the <b>Access Type</b> area of the dialog box, you can select the radio button corresponding to
any one of three access types. Selecting <b>Read Only</b> restricts access to the shared folder
so that its contents can be read and copied, but not edited in any way. Selecting <b>Full</b> 
gives complete access to the contents of爐he folder; and selecting <b>Depends on Password</b> 
forces users to provide a password in order to access the shared resource.</p>


<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
When a folder or device is shared, you will see a hand as part of the
icon displayed in My Computer or Windows Explorer.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>In the Windows NT environment, you can apply the added security features provided by the
NTFS file system. This file system is a relational database in which everything is seen as a
file.</p>

<p><b>Software</b></p>

<p>To install networking software, several protocols are available:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Client service for NetWare</li></p>

<p><li> Client for Microsoft Networks</li></p>

<p><li> NWLink NetBIOS</li></p>

<p><li> NWLink IPX/SPX/NetBIOS Compatible Transport Protocol</li></p>

<p><li> Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)</li></p>
</ul>

<p>You must have administrative rights in order to enable sharing on a Windows NT Server.</p>

<p><b>Sharing Directories and Files</b></p>

<p>To share a folder locally (you are logged onto the workstation), right-click the
folder's icon and select the <b>Sharing</b> option. This will open the <b>Properties</b> 
dialog box for the directory, as shown in Figure 9.5. The <b>Share</b> tab will be
selected.</p>


<p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 9.5</b> <i>Folder Properties dialog box</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>The maximum number of connections that can be set for Windows NT Workstation is 10,
regardless of the setting. This setting is optional.</p>

<p>Assign permissions to the shared folder. By following the dialog boxes, you can limit who
has permission to access this folder or give permission to everyone. By using the <b>New
Share</b> button, you can configure multiple shares using different names and assign different
levels of permissions.</p>

<p>To share folders and drives in Windows 2000, you must be logged on as a member of the
Administrators, Server Operators, or Power Users group.</p>

<p>To share a Windows 2000 folder or drive with other users, open Windows Explorer, and then
locate the folder or drive you want to share. (To open Windows Explorer, click <b>Start</b>,
point to <b>Programs</b>, point to <b>Accessories</b>, and then click <b>Windows Explorer</b>.)
Right-click the folder or drive, and then click <b>Sharing</b>. On the <b>Sharing</b> tab,
click <b>Share this folder</b>.</p>

<p>To change the name of the shared folder or drive, type a new name in <b>Share Name</b>. The
new name is what users will see when they connect to this shared folder or drive; the actual
name of the folder or drive does not change.</p>

<p>To add a comment about the shared folder or drive, type the text in <b>Comment</b>. To爈imit
the number of users who can connect to the shared folder or drive at one time, under <b>User
limit</b>, click <b>Allow</b>, then enter a number of users.</p>

<p><b>Sharing Printers</b></p>

<p>To share a Windows NT/Windows 2000 printer on a Windows NT network, click <b>Start</b>,
select <b>Settings</b>, and click <b>Printers</b>. Right-click the printer to be shared, and
click <b>Sharing</b> from the menu. Select the <b>Share as</b> button and enter a name that
will clearly identify the printer to the network. After the printer has been shared and
identified on the network, security for the printer can be set.</p>

<A NAME="496"><h3>AppleShare Networking</h3></A>
<p><b>Software</b></p>

<p>Apple's file-server software is called AppleTalk. Sharing resources with AppleTalk
requires the following steps:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>To select a network port</b> Select the Control Panels' AppleTalk submenu to
open the <b>AppleTalk</b> dialog box. There you can select the appropriate network connection
port.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>To turn on AppleTalk</b> In order to activate AppleTalk on a computer, the
computer must be connected to an AppleTalk network. To do so, open the <b>Apple Chooser</b> and
set the <b>AppleTalk</b> radio button to <b>Active</b>.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>To enable sharing</b> Establish a network identity by assigning a name to the
computer. Then turn on sharing in the Apple Control Panel's <b>File Sharing</b> dialog
box.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Sharing Drives and Folders</b></p>

<p>Like all peer-to-peer networks, AppleShare provides sharing at the folder level, but not at
the file level. If the owner of the server computer has designated any files or folders for
sharing, these will be available to anyone who logs on.</p>

<p>A folder's owner sets the folder's sharing by opening the folder's sharing
window. From the <b>Choose File</b> menu, select <b>Get Info</b>, and click <b>Sharing</b>. For
each user or group listed, the owner sets one of the following privileges for working within
the folder:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Read &amp; Write</li></p>

<p><li> Read Only</li></p>

<p><li> Write Only (Drop Box)</li></p>

<p><li> None</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Restrictions can also be placed on the shared folders themselves so that they cannot be
altered by anyone other than the folder's owner. To set such a restriction, open the <b>
Sharing Info</b> dialog box and click the <b>Can't move, rename, or delete this item
(locked<i>)</i></b> check box.</p>

<p><b>Sharing Printers</b></p>

<p>To share a directly connected printer from an Apple computer, open the <b>Apple Chooser</b> 
dialog box and select the printer you want to share. Then click the <b>Setup</b> button to open
the printer <b>Sharing Setup</b> dialog box. In this dialog box, you can click the <b>Share
this Printer</b> check box and enter a name for the printer and a password (optional). You can
also click the <b>Keep Log of Printer Usage</b> check box if you want to record information
about printer usage.</p>

<A NAME="497"><h3>UNIX</h3></A>
<p>The UNIX operating system exists in a number of configurations and is available from a
variety of manufacturers or, in the case of Linux, from no corporate entity at all. UNIX
support for interoperability with other network operating systems varies with the manufacturer.
Sun's Solaris Easy Access Server, for example, includes native support for many Windows NT
network services including authentication, file and print services, and directory services.
Linux distributions include Apple access modules for AppleTalk access, third-party software
such as Samba, which makes UNIX file systems available to any networked computer using
the SMB file-sharing protocol, and modules for NTFS and MS-DOS file-system accessibility.</p>

<A NAME="498"><h2>Sharing in a Client/Server Environment</h2></A>
<A NAME="499"><h3>Overview</h3></A>
<p>Sharing folders on a server-based network is similar to sharing on a peer-to-peer network.
The primary difference is in the level of security available, which is achieved through the
server's directory services. Microsoft NT Server and Novell NetWare provide file-level
permissions in addition to printer, drive, and directory permissions.</p>

<A NAME="500"><h3>Novell</h3></A>
<p>Unlike other network operating systems, NetWare does not require that sharing be enabled
prior to actually making the server's resources available. Enabled sharing is the default
setting for a NetWare network.</p>

<p>A second difference is that access to shared resources is set entirely through user and
group account rights. In other words, printers, directories, and files are not themselves
restricted. This subject is discussed in the next lesson of this chapter.</p>
<p><img src="images/practic.JPG" width=68 height=54 border="0"></p>
<A NAME="501"><h2>Exercise 9.1: Case Study Problem</h2></A>
<p>Your task in this exercise is to designate shares in a peer-to-peer network configuration.</p>

<p>For this configuration, assume that the company to be networked is small, numbering 20
employees, only 10 of which have computers. These computers are running compatible operating
systems. Employees include the managing director, three people in the Sales Department, two in
the Accounting Department, two in the Product Design Department, and two in the Shipping
Department. There are two laser printers available; one is connected directly to the managing
director's computer, and the other is connected directly to the lead accountant's
computer.</p>

<p>In this exercise you will:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Designate which resources will be shared.</li></p>

<p><li> Enable sharing on the appropriate computers.</li></p>

<p><li> Share printers, disks, folders, and, if appropriate, files.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><a href="chaai.htm#ans39">Answers</a></p>

<A NAME="502"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>The following points summarize the main elements of this lesson:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> When files are transferred using a direct cable connection, one computer is
configured as a host and the other as a client. The client can then access files and
directories on the host computer.</li></p>

<p><li>Client software must be enabled before a computer can access any resources shared on a network.</li></p>

<p><li>Microsoft Network client software enables users to share resources with any network that uses the SMB (Server Message Block) file-sharing protocol.</li></p>

<p><li>Before a computer can act as a server and share resources to a network, it爉ust first have the client software enabled, and then have File and Print Sharing enabled.</li></p>

<p><li> AppleShare provides folder-level sharing on Macintosh machines.</li></p>

<p><li>Linux file systems can be accessed by computers using AppleTalk and燽y燾omputers using the SMB file sharing protocol.</li></p>

<p><li>The maximum number of connections that can be set for Windows NT Workstation is 10.</li></p>
</ul>

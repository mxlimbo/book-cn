<A NAME="8"><h1>Chapter and Appendix Overview</h1></A>
<p>This self-paced training course combines notes, hands-on procedures, multimedia
presentations, and review questions to teach you the essentials of computer networking. The
course is designed to be completed in sequence, from beginning to end, but you can also choose
a customized track and complete only the sections that interest you. (See the next section,
&quot;<A HREF="atbf.htm#9">Finding the Best Starting Point for You</A>,&quot; for more information.) If you choose the
customized-track option, check the &quot;<A HREF="ch01a.htm#32">Before You Begin</A>&quot; section in each chapter before
you begin to read it; these sections describe any prerequisite text readers are expected to
have read before beginning the new chapter.</p>

<p>The book is divided into the following parts and chapters:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> The section you are reading, &quot;<A HREF="atba.htm#1">About This Book</A>,&quot; contains a self-paced
training overview and introduces the components of this training. Reading this section
thoroughly will help you get the most educational value from this self-paced training and plan
which lessons you will complete.</li></p>

<p><li> <a href="P01.htm">Part I</a>, &quot;Networking Fundamentals,&quot; introduces, in seven chapters, the
basic concepts and principles that underlie computer networking. It presents an overview of
networking terminology, examines different network topologies and architectures, discusses the
physical components of computer networks, and reviews the principles of network
connectivity.</li></p>

<p><li> <A HREF="ch01a.htm#30">Chapter 1</a>, &quot;Introduction to Networking,&quot; acquaints you with some of the
fundamental concepts upon which computer networks are built. The chapter discusses advantages
and effects of networking computers&#8212;whether to create a local area network (LAN), such as
a corporate intranet, or a wide area network (WAN), such as the Internet. It also gives an
overview of how an organization's information needs help to determine its optimal network
configuration.</li></p>

<p><li> <A HREF="ch02a.htm#92">Chapter 2</a>, &quot;Basic Network Media,&quot; looks deeper into how networks are
physically assembled and discusses the cables and circuitry that connect one computer to
another. The chapter examines the construction, features, and operation of the primary cable
types, citing the advantages and disadvantages of each. It explores the different types of
network interface cards (NICs)&#8212;the燾omponents that provide the interface between cables
and computers&#8212;as爓ell as the various connectors used to attach the cards to the cables,
and looks at how their performance affects a network. It also presents an overview of
wireless-network technology.</li></p>

<p><li> <A HREF="ch03a.htm#149">Chapter 3</a>, &quot;Understanding Network Architecture,&quot; explores the three
principal access methods used to convey data onto network cables: contention, token passing,
and demand priority. This chapter also advances the discussion of network architecture by
examining the data itself and how it is put together before it is sent on its way. Last, this
chapter examines the most common network architectures (Ethernet, Token Ring, AppleTalk, and
ArcNet).</li></p>

<p><li> <A HREF="ch04a.htm#226">Chapter 4</A>, &quot;Survey of Network Operating Systems,&quot; outlines various network
operating systems (NOSs), focusing primarily on Novell and Microsoft network operating systems,
but also including AppleTalk, UNIX, and Banyan Vines. The chapter briefly surveys peer-to-peer
LANs, including systems running Microsoft Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95 and 98, and
IBM's燨S/2.</li></p>

<p><li> <A HREF="ch05a.htm#285">Chapter 5</A>, &quot;Introducing Network Standards,&quot; describes the Open Systems
Interconnection (OSI) reference model, standards that provide for how data is爌ackaged and
transmitted from a sending application through the physical cables to a receiving application.
The text goes on to discuss the 802 Project, enhancements to the OSI reference model specific to NICs and cabling, developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. This chapter also looks at device drivers and how they relate to the
OSI reference model.</li></p>

<p><li> <A HREF="ch06a.htm#321">Chapter 6</A>, &quot;Defining Network Protocols,&quot; discusses the prominent protocols
used with networks and defines the relationship of each protocol to the OSI reference model,
including Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), an industry-standard suite
of protocols that provide communications in a heterogeneous environment. This chapter also
explores the protocols used by Novell NetWare, as well as several of the lesser, yet most
commonly used, protocols and how they relate to the OSI reference model.</li></p>

<p><li> <A HREF="ch07a.htm#374">Chapter 7</A>, &quot;Elements of Network Connectivity,&quot; explores the devices and
technologies available to expand networks beyond the scope of LANs. The燿iscussion begins with
modems, moves on to repeaters, bridges, routers, brouters, and gateways, and concludes with a
look at remote-access computing.</li></p>

<p><li> <a href="P02.htm">Part II</a>, &quot;Implementing a Network,&quot; chapters 8-13, shifts the focus from
general networking principles to implementation. Integrating elements from Part I, the emphasis
now is on the nuts and bolts of designing and rolling out a complete network: choosing a
network type (peer-to-peer or server-based), selecting hardware and software for installation,
and choosing and establishing security through setting up shares and accounts. Part II examines
environmental impacts on networks, as well as how to administer, upgrade, and relocate
networks, and concludes with tips for troubleshooting problems and where to find helpful
resources.</li></p>

<p><li> <A HREF="ch08a.htm#423">Chapter 8</A>, &quot;Designing and Installing a Network,&quot; expands the reader's
knowledge of networking hardware. How to take a detailed inventory of network hardware and
software is described. By creating a simple networking plan for a fictitious company and
exploring how to install and configure networking hardware for it, readers have the opportunity
to design a network. The chapter concludes by taking a look at some related
hardware-compatibility issues.</li></p>

<p><li> <A HREF="ch09a.htm#486">Chapter 9</A>, &quot;Establishing Network Shares and Accounts,&quot; describes the
process of establishing sharing on a peer-to-peer network, including how to make directories or
printers available to other network users. For server-based networks, readers are shown how
accounts are used to establish who can access which files, directories, and printers. This
chapter explores the differences between shares and accounts and demonstrates how to use each
appropriately.</li></p>

<p><li> <A HREF="ch10a.htm#528">Chapter 10</A>, &quot;Ensuring Network Security,&quot; revisits some of the ways to
enable sharing on a network that were covered in Chapter 9. Here, the focus shifts away from
sharing procedures; instead the chapter discusses sharing from the perspective of how to
establish and maintain network and data security. Security is more than preventing unauthorized
access to computers and their data; it includes maintaining the proper physical environment to
permit the network to function effectively. Special attention is paid to preventive maintenance
and how to take steps to prevent data loss and minimize network failures, whether from human or
other causes, such as natural disasters.</li></p>

<p><li> <A HREF="ch11a.htm#593">Chapter 11</A>, &quot;Printing on a Network,&quot; covers one of the fundamental reasons
for networking: to be able to share printers among workstations. Network printers are expensive
and draw extensively on electrical resources; however, a single user is likely to require a
printer only intermittently. By sharing the printer among many users, considerable savings in
cost and energy are achieved. This chapter covers the devices and management of network
printers and takes a look at fax modems.</li></p>

<p><li> <A HREF="ch12a.htm#622">Chapter 12</A>, &quot;Administering Change,&quot; discusses how to document a running
network and how to develop a baseline by carefully recording network performance and
components. This baseline can be referred to later when assessing network performance issues.
When and how to upgrade network components and confirm that the upgrading was successful are
also discussed. The chapter concludes with a look at how to physically relocate a network
installation.</li></p>

<p><li> <A HREF="ch13a.htm#676">Chapter 13</A>, &quot;Troubleshooting a Network,&quot; surveys the process of
troubleshooting a network. It begins by exploring how to get to the bottom of network problems,
then looks at the various hardware and software tools that can help in troubleshooting. A point
usually comes when outside expertise is needed. What resources are available, what they can do,
and how to access them round out this chapter.</li></p>

<p><li> <a href="chaaa.htm#888">Appendix A</a>, &quot;Questions and Answers,&quot; lists each lesson-checkup question,
review question, and exercise sequentially for every chapter, referencing the爌age number where
the question appears in the text. In <a href="chaaa.htm">Appendix A</a>, suggested answers are also provided for each
question and exercise.</li></p>

<p><li> <a href="chaba.htm#833">Appendix B</a>, &quot;Common Network Standards and Specifications,&quot; contains a
summary of standards, specifications, and description of standard-setting organizations that
preside over aspects of computer networking.</li></p>

<p><li> The <a href="glossa.htm">Glossary</a> includes definitions of key networking and relevant scientific terms
used in the book.</li></p>

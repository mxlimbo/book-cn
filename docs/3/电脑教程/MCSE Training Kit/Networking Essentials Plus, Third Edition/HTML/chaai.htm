<h2>Lesson 1: Creating Network Shares</h2>

<a name="ans39"><h3>Exercise  9.1: Case Study Problem</h3></a>

<p>Your task in this exercise is to designate shares in a peer-to-peer network
configuration.</p>

<p>For this configuration, assume that the company to be networked is small, numbering 20
employees, only 10 of which have computers. These computers are running compatible operating
systems. Employees include the managing director, three people in the Sales Department, two in
the Accounting Department, two in the Product Design Department, and two in the Shipping
Department. There are two laser printers available; one is connected directly to the managing
director's computer, and the other is connected directly to the lead accountant's
computer.</p>

<p>In this exercise you will:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Designate which resources will be shared.</li></p>

<p><li> Enable sharing on the appropriate computers.</li></p>

<p><li> Share printers, disks, folders, and, if appropriate, files.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Configure all computers to share folders.</b></p>

<p><b>Configure the Managing Director's computer and the lead
accountant's computer to share their printers with names MANAGE and ACCOUNT
respectively.</b></p>

<p><b>Configure all computers except the Managing Director's to
print to the ACCOUNT printer. The MANAGE printer will be used by the Managing Director, but
will be available to others should the ACCOUNT printer fail.</b></p>

<p><b>Create one folder in each of the computers for exchanging files.
Share each folder as PUBLIC.</b></p>

<p><b>Set sharing for the PUBLIC folder so that all users have full
rights within the folder.</b></p>

<p><b>Users will be able to make files in their PUBLIC folders available
to others, and will have the option of copying files to the other PUBLIC folders if that is
more convenient.</b></p>

<h2>Lesson 2: Establishing and Managing Network Accounts</h2>

<a name="ans40"><h3>Exercise  9.2: Case Study Problem</h3></a>

<p>For this exercise we will return to the same 20-employee company that was the
subject of Exercise 9.1 in Lesson 1. Your job is to design user and group accounts for the
10-computer server-based network. To do this, you should determine what kinds of groups are
appropriate to the company and its work. You will also need to establish a password policy and
a personnel policy that takes into account what will happen when an employee departs from the
company.</p>

<p>After you have established the account policies, create the appropriate user and group
accounts and set whatever restrictions will be necessary for each of the groups. These should
include the days and hours during which groups can log on to the network. Assign printing
rights to the groups as needed and, finally, add the users to the appropriate groups.</p>

<p><b>Account policies&#8212;Create groups that correspond to the working
methods of the company. Set each user's account so that passwords must be changed every 30
days. Allow users to change their own passwords. If an employee leaves the company, all users
should change their passwords, and the departed employee's account should be disabled or,
better, deleted.</b></p>

<p><b>Accounts&#8212;Create an account for each user on the server.
Create a group account on the server for the Managing Director, and one group each for the
sales, accounting, design and shipping employees. Add the Managing Director to the DIRECTOR
group. Add the three sales employees to the SALES group. Add the two accounting employees to
the ACCOUNT group. Add the two product designers to the DESIGN group. Add the two shipping
department employees to the SHIPPING group.</b></p>

<p><b>Account restrictions&#8212;Restrictions must follow the working
methods of the company. The Managing Director and the accountant may need access during the
evening or very early morning, or weekends. Restrict their accounts accordingly. The other
employees are likely to work regular hours. Their accounts can be restricted to whatever their
workgroup agrees upon.</b></p>

<p><b>Printing&#8212;Configure all computers except the Managing
Director's to print to the ACCOUNT printer. The MANAGE printer will be used by the Managing
Director, but will be available to others should the ACCOUNT printer fail.</b></p>

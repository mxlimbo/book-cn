<A NAME="33"><h1>Lesson 1: What Is a Network?</h1></A>
<p>This lesson introduces some basic principles of computer-based networking, discusses
advantages of networking, and presents the idea of connecting computers together to form a
local area network (such as a corporate intranet) and a wide area network (such as the
Internet).</p>

<A NAME="34"><h2>The Concept of Networking</h2></A>
<p>The idea of networking has been around for a long time and has taken on many meanings. If
you were to look up &quot;network&quot; in your dictionary, you might find any of the following
definitions:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> An openwork fabric; netting</li></p>

<p><li> A system of interlacing lines, tracks, or channels</li></p>

<p><li> Any interconnected system; for example, a television-broadcasting network</li></p>

<p><li>A system in which a number of independent computers are linked together to share data and peripherals, such as hard disks and printers</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, the last definition is the one we are concerned with in this course. The key word
in the definition is &quot;share.&quot; Sharing is the purpose of computer networking. The
ability to share information efficiently is what gives computer networking its power and its
appeal. And when it comes to sharing information, human beings are in many ways similar to
computers. Just as computers are little more than collections of the information they have been
given, so we are, in large part, collections of our experiences and the information given to
us. When we want to expand our knowledge, we broaden our experience and gather more
information. For example, to learn more about computers, we might talk informally with friends
in the computer industry, go back to school and take a class, or work through a self-paced
training course like this one. Whichever options we choose, when we seek to share the knowledge
and experiences of others, we are networking.</p>

<p>Another way to think of networking is to envision a network as a team. This might be a
sports team, such as a football team, or a project team, such as the one that created this
training course. Through the efforts of all involved&#8212;the sharing of time, talent, and
resources&#8212;a goal is accomplished or a project is completed. Similarly, managing a computer
network is not unlike managing a team of people. Sharing and communicating can be simple and
easy (a quarterback calling a play in the huddle) or complex (a virtual project team located in
different time zones around the world that communicates through teleconferencing, e-mail, and
multimedia presentations over the Internet to complete a project).</p>

<A NAME="35"><h2>Introducing Computer Networking</h2></A>
<p>At its most elementary level, a computer network consists of two computers connected to each
other by a cable that allows them to share data. All computer networking, no matter how
sophisticated, stems from that simple system. While the idea of connecting two computers by a
cable may not seem extraordinary, in retrospect it has proven to be a major achievement in
communications.</p>

<p>Computer networking arose as an answer to the need to share data in a timely fashion.
Personal computers are powerful tools that can process and manipulate large amounts of data
quickly, but they do not allow users to share that data efficiently. Before networks, users
needed either to print out documents or copy document files to a disk for others to edit or use
them. If others made changes to the document, there was no easy way to merge the changes. This
was, and still is, known as &quot;working in a stand-alone environment.&quot; (See Figure
1.1.)</p>


<p>

</p>


<p>Copying files onto floppy disks and giving them to others to copy onto their computers was
sometimes referred to as the &quot;sneakernet.&quot; This early form of computer networking is
one that many of us have used and perhaps still use today. See Figure 1.2; it might bring back
some fond memories.</p>

</p><p>

</p>


<p>This system works well in certain situations and has its advantages&#8212;it allows us to
stop for a cup of coffee or socialize with a friend while we exchange and merge data&#8212;but
it is far too slow and inefficient to meet the needs and expectations of today's computer
users. The amount of data available to be shared and the distances we want the data to travel
far exceed the capabilities of the sneakernet.</p>

<p>But what if the computer shown in Figure 1.1 were to be connected to other computers? Then,
it could share data with the other computers and send documents to the other printers. This
connecting together of computers and other devices is called a <i>network</i>, and the concept
of connected computers sharing resources is called networking. (See Figure 1.3.)</p>

<A NAME="36"><h2>Why Use a Computer Network?</h2></A>
<p>With the availability and power of today's personal computers, you might ask why
networks are needed. From the earliest networks to today's high-powered personal computers,
the answer has remained the same: networks increase efficiency and reduce costs. Computer
networks achieve these goals in three primary ways:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Sharing information (or data)</li></p>

<p><li> Sharing hardware and software</li></p>

<p><li> Centralizing administration and support</li></p>
</ul>

<p>More specifically, computers that are part of a network can share:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Documents (memos, spreadsheets, invoices, and so on).</li></p>

<p><li> E-mail messages.</li></p>

<p><li> Word-processing software.</li></p>

<p><li> Project-tracking software.</li></p>

<p><li> Illustrations, photographs, videos, and audio files.</li></p>

<p><li> Live audio and video broadcasts.</li></p>

<p><li> Printers.</li></p>

<p><li> Fax machines.</li></p>

<p><li> Modems.</li></p>

<p><li> CD-ROM drives and other removable drives, such as Zip and Jaz drives.</li></p>

<p><li> Hard drives.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>And more sharing options exist. The capabilities of networks are constantly expanding as new
ways are found to share and communicate by means of computers.</p>

<A NAME="37"><h3>Sharing Information (or Data)</h3></A>
<p>The ability to share information quickly and inexpensively has proven to be one of the most
popular uses of networking technology. It has been reported that e-mail is by far the
number-one activity of people who use the Internet. Many businesses have invested in networks
specifically to take advantage of network-based e-mail and scheduling programs.</p>

<p>By making information available for sharing, networks can reduce the need for paper
communication, increase efficiency, and make nearly any type of data available simultaneously
to every user who needs it. Managers can use these utilities to communicate quickly and
effectively with large numbers of people and to organize and schedule meetings with people
drawn from an entire company or business enterprise far more easily than was previously
possible. (See Figure 1.4.)</p>

<A NAME="38"><h3>Sharing Hardware and Software</h3></A>
<p>Before the advent of networks, computer users needed their own printers, plotters, and other
peripherals; the only way users could share a printer was to take turns sitting at the computer
connected to the printer. Figure 1.5 shows a typical stand-alone workstation with a
printer.</p>


<p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 1.5</b> <i>A printer in a stand-alone environment</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>Networks make it possible for several people to share data and peripherals simultaneously.
If many people need to use a printer, they can all use the printer available on the network.
Figure 1.6 shows a typical network environment in which five workstations share a single
printer.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 1.6</b> <i>Sharing a printer in a networking environment</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>Networks can be used to share and standardize applications, such as word processors,
spreadsheets, inventory databases, and so on, to ensure that everyone on the network is using
the same applications and the same versions of those applications. This allows documents to be
shared easily and creates training efficiencies: it is easier for people to master one word
processing application thoroughly than to try to learn four or five different word processing
applications.</p>

<A NAME="39"><h3>Centralizing Administration and Support</h3></A>
<p>Networking computers can simplify support tasks as well. It is far more efficient for
technical personnel to support one version of one operating system or application and to set up
all computers in the same manner than to support many individual and unique systems and
setups.</p>

<A NAME="40"><h2>The Two Major Types of Networks: LANs and WANs</h2></A>
<p>Computer networks are classified into one of two groups, depending on their size and
function. A <i>local area network</i> <i>(LAN)</i> is the basic building block of any computer
network. A LAN can range from simple (two computers connected by a cable) to complex (hundreds
of connected computers and peripherals throughout a major corporation). (See Figure 1.7.) The
distinguishing feature of a LAN is that it is confined to a limited geographic area.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 1.7</b> <i>A local area network (LAN)</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>A <i>wide area network (WAN),</i> on the other hand, has no geographical limit (see Figure
1.8). It can connect computers and other devices on opposite sides of the world. A WAN is made
up of a number of interconnected LANs. Perhaps the ultimate WAN is the Internet.</p>

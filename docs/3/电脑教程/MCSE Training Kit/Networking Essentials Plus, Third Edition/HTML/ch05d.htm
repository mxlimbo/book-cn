<A NAME="306"><h1>Lesson 3: Device Drivers and OSI</h1></A>
<P>NICs play an important role in connecting a computer to the physical part of the
network. No discussion of networking standards is complete without including drivers, the small
software programs that enable a computer to work with a network card or other device. In this
lesson we look at device drivers and how they relate to the OSI reference model.</P>

<A NAME="307"><h2>The Role of Drivers</h2></A>
<P>A <i>driver</i> (sometimes called a device driver) is software that enables a
computer to work with a particular device. Although a device might be installed on a computer,
the computer's operating system cannot communicate with the device until the driver for
that device has been installed and configured. The software driver tells the computer how to
drive or work with the device so that the device performs the job it is assigned in the way it
is supposed to.</P> 

<p>There are drivers for nearly every type of computer device and peripheral including:</p>


<ul>
<p><li> Input devices, such as mouse and keyboard devices.</li></p>

<p><li> SCSI and IDE disk controllers.</li></p>

<p><li> Hard and floppy-disk drives.</li></p>

<p><li> Multimedia devices such as microphones, cameras, and recorders.</li></p>

<p><li> Network interface cards (NICs).</li></p>

<p><li> Printers, plotters, tape drives, and so on.</li></p>
</ul>



<P>Usually, the computer's operating system works with the driver to make the
device perform. Printers provide a good illustration of how drivers are used. Printers built by
different manufacturers all have different features and functions. It would be impossible for
computer makers to equip new computers with all the爏oftware necessary to identify and work
with every type of printer. Instead, printer manufacturers make drivers available for each
printer. Before your computer can send documents to a printer, you must install the driver for
that printer on your computer's hard drive.</P> 

<p>As a general rule, manufacturers of components, such as peripherals or cards that must be
physically installed, are responsible for supplying the drivers for their equipment. For
example, NIC manufacturers are responsible for making drivers available for their cards.
Drivers generally are included on a disk with the equipment when it is purchased, included with
the computer's operating system, or made available for downloading from an Internet service
provider such as the Microsoft Network (MSN), CompuServe, or others.</p>


<A NAME="308"><h2>The Network Environment</h2></A>
<P>Network drivers provide communication between a NIC and the network redirector
running in the computer. The redirector is the part of networking software that accepts
input/output (I/O) requests for remote files and then sends, or redirects, them over the
network to another computer. During installation, the driver is stored on the computer's
hard disk.</P>

<A NAME="309"><h3>Drivers and the OSI Reference Model</h3></A>
<P>NIC drivers reside in the MAC sublayer of the OSI reference model's data-link layer. The
MAC sublayer is responsible for providing shared access to the physical layer for the
computer's NICs. As shown in Figure 5.10, the NIC drivers provide virtual communication
between the computer and the NIC. This, in turn, provides a link between the computer and the
rest of the network.</P>

<A NAME="310"><h3>Drivers and the Networking Software</h3></A>
<P>It is common for a NIC manufacturer to provide drivers to the networking-software
vendor so that the drivers can be included with the network operating software.</P>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><HR>
When purchasing a new hardware device, always make sure that it contains the
correct drivers for the specified computer operating system on which it will be installed. If
in doubt, or if you are missing the appropriate driver, consult the manufacturer before you
install the device. Updated drivers or drivers for various operating systems often are
available over the Internet for downloading.
</blockquote></div></p>

<P>The hardware compatibility list (HCL) supplied by operating-system manufacturers
describes the drivers they have tested and included with their operating system. The HCL for a
network operating system might list more than 100 NIC drivers. This does not mean that an
unlisted driver won't work with that operating system; it means only that the
operating-system manufacturer has not tested it.</p> 

<p>Even if the driver for a particular card has not been included with the network operating
system, it is usual for the manufacturer of the NIC to include drivers for most popular network
operating systems on a disk that is shipped with the card. Before buying a card, however, make
sure that the card has a driver that will work with a particular network operating system.
Installation and configuration of drivers is discussed in detail in

<A NAME="311"><h2>Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS)</h2></A>
<P><i>Network Driver Interface Specification</i> (NDIS) is a standard that defines an
interface for communication between the MAC sublayer and the protocol drivers. By permitting
the simultaneous use of multiple protocols and drivers, NDIS allows for a flexible environment
of data exchange. It defines the software interface, known as the NDIS interface. Protocol
drivers use this interface to communicate with the NICs. The advantage of NDIS is that it
offers protocol multiplexing, so爐hat multiple protocol stacks can be used at the same time.
Three types of network software have interfaces described by NDIS:</P>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Protocol stack</b> Provides network communications. A stack generates and
disassembles frames (control information and data) that are sent to and received from the
network.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Adapter driver</b> Controls the network interface hardware. Works in the MAC sublayer and moves frames between the protocol stack and the interface hardware.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Protocol Manager</b> Controls the activity between the protocol stack and the燤AC.</li></p>
</ul>

<P>Microsoft and 3Com jointly developed the NDIS specification for use with Warp
Server and Windows NT Server. All NIC manufacturers make their boards work with these operating
systems by supplying NDIS-compliant software drivers.</P>

<A NAME="312"><h2>Open Data-Link Interface (ODI)</h2></A>
<P><i>Open Data-Link Interface</i> (ODI) is a specification adopted by Novell and
Apple to simplify driver development for their network operating systems. ODI provides support
for multiple protocols on a single NIC. Similar to NDIS, ODI allows Novell NetWare drivers to
be written without reference to the protocol that will be used on top of them. All NIC
manufacturers can make their boards work with these operating systems by supplying
ODI-compliant software drivers.</P>

<A NAME="313"><h2>Bridging NDIS and ODI</h2></A>
<P>ODI and NDIS are incompatible. They present different programming interfaces to the
upper layers of the network software. Novell, IBM, and Microsoft offer ODI-to-NDIS translation
software to bridge the two interfaces. Two examples are ODI2NDI.SYS and
ODINSUP.SYS.</P>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><HR>
Most network card manufacturers supply both NDIS- and ODI-compliant drivers with
their boards.</blockquote></div></p>

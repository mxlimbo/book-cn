<A NAME="563"><h2>Data Protection</h2></A>
<p>A site disaster is defined as anything that causes you to lose your data. Many large
organizations have extensive disaster-recovery plans to maintain operations and rebuild after a
natural disaster such as an earthquake or a hurricane. Many, but not all, include a plan to
recover the network. However, a network can incur a disastrous failure from many more sources
than natural disasters. Disaster recovery for a network goes beyond the replacing of the
physical hardware; the data must be protected as well. The causes of a network disaster,
ranging from human acts to natural causes, include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Component failure.</li></p>

<p><li> Computer viruses.</li></p>

<p><li> Data deletion and corruption.</li></p>

<p><li> Fire caused by arson or electrical mishaps.</li></p>

<p><li> Natural disasters, such as lightning, floods, tornadoes, and earthquakes.</li></p>

<p><li> Power-supply failure and power surges.</li></p>

<p><li> Theft and vandalism.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>In the event of a site disaster, the downtime spent recovering data from backup storage (if
you have backups) could result in a serious loss of productivity. And without backups, the
consequences are even more severe, possibly resulting in significant financial losses. There
are several ways to prevent or recover from data loss, including:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Tape backup systems.</li></p>

<p><li> An uninterruptible power supply (UPS).</li></p>

<p><li> Fault-tolerant systems.</li></p>

<p><li> Optical drives and disks.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Any or all of these approaches can be used, depending on how valuable the data is to the
organization and on the organization's budget constraints.</p>

<A NAME="564"><h2>Tape Backup</h2></A>
<p>The simplest, most inexpensive way to avoid disastrous loss of data is to implement a
schedule of periodic backups with storage offsite. Using a tape backup is still one of the few
simple and economical ways to ensure that data remains safe and usable.</p>

<p>Experienced network engineers advise that a backup system should be the first line of
defense against data loss. A secure backup strategy minimizes the risk of losing data by
maintaining a current backup&#8212;copies of existing files&#8212;so that files can be recovered
if harm comes to the original data. To back up data requires:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Appropriate equipment.</li></p>

<p><li> A regular schedule for periodic backups.</li></p>

<p><li> Ensuring that backup files are current.</li></p>

<p><li> Personnel assigned to make sure this schedule is carried out.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>The equipment usually consists of one or more tape drives and tapes or other mass storage
media. Any expense incurred in this area is likely to be minimal compared to the value of what
will be saved in the event of data loss.</p>

<A NAME="565"><h3>Implementing a Backup System</h3></A>
<p>The rule is simple: if you cannot get along without it, back it up. Whether you back up
entire disks, selected directories, or files depends on how fast you will need to燽e
operational after losing important data. Complete backups make restoring disk configurations
much easier, but can require multiple tapes if there are large amounts of data. Backing up
individual files and directories might require fewer tapes, but could require the administrator
to manually restore disk configurations.</p>

<p>Critical data should be backed up according to daily, weekly, or monthly schedules,
depending on how critical the data is and how frequently it is updated. It is best to schedule
backup operations during periods of low system use. Users should be爊otified when the backup
will be performed so that they will not be using the servers during server backup.</p>

<p><b>Selecting a Tape Drive</b></p>

<p>Because the majority of backing up is done with tape drives, the first step is to select a
tape drive, weighing the importance of a variety of factors, such as:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> How much data needs to be backed up.</li></p>

<p><li> The network's requirements for backup reliability, capacity, and speed.</li></p>

<p><li> The cost of the tape drive and related media.</li></p>

<p><li> The tape drive's compatibility with the operating system.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, a tape drive should have more than enough capacity to back up a network's
largest server. It should also provide error detection and correction during backup and restore
operations.</p>

<p><b>Backup Methods</b></p>

<p>As listed in Table 10.2, an efficient backup policy uses a combination of methods:</p>

<p><b>Table 10.2</b> <i>Backup Methods</i></p>

<p><table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr>
<th>Method</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Full backup</td>
<td valign="top">Backs up and marks selected files, whether or not they have 
 changed since the last backup.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Copy</td>
<td valign="top">Backs up all selected files without marking them as being 
 backed up.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Incremental backup</td>
<td valign="top">Backs up and marks selected files only if they have changed 
 since the last time they were backed up.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Daily copy</td>
<td valign="top">Backs up only those files that have been modified that day, 
 without marking them as being backed up.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Differential backup</td>
<td valign="top">Backs up selected files only if they have changed since the 
 last time they were backed up, without marking them as being 
 backed up.</td>
</tr></table></p>

<p>Tapes can be backed up based on a multiple-week cycle, depending on how many tapes are
available. No rigid rules govern the length of the cycle. On the first day of the cycle, the
administrator performs a full backup and follows with an incremental backup on succeeding days.
When the entire cycle has finished, the process begins again. Another method is to schedule
streaming backups throughout the day.</p>

<A NAME="566"><h3>Testing and Storage</h3></A>
<p>Experienced administrators test the backup system before committing to it. They perform a
backup, delete the information, restore the data, and attempt to use the燿ata.</p>

<p>The administrator should test the backup procedures regularly to verify that what is
expected to be backed up is actually being backed up. Additionally, the restore procedure
should be tested to ensure that important files can be restored quickly.</p>

<p>Ideally, an administrator should make two copies of each tape: one to be kept onsite, and
the other stored offsite in a safe place. Remember that although storing tapes in a fireproof
safe can keep them from actually burning, the heat from a fire will ruin the data stored on
them. After repeated usage, tapes lose the ability to store data. Replace tapes regularly to
ensure a good backup.</p>

<A NAME="567"><h3>Maintaining a Backup Log</h3></A>
<p>Maintaining a log of all backups is critical for later file recovery. A copy of the log
should be kept with the backup tapes, as well as at the computer site. The log should record
the following information:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Date of backup</li></p>

<p><li> Tape-set number</li></p>

<p><li> Type of backup performed</li></p>

<p><li> Which computer was backed up</li></p>

<p><li> Which files were backed up</li></p>

<p><li> Who performed the backup</li></p>

<p><li> Location of the backup tapes</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="568"><h3>Installing the Backup System</h3></A>
<p>Tape drives can be connected to a server or a computer, and backups can be initiated from
the computer to which the tape drive is attached. If you run backups from a server, backup and
restore operations can occur very quickly because the data does not have to travel across the
network.</p>

<p>Backing up across the network is the most efficient way to back up multiple systems;
however, it creates a great deal of network traffic and slows the network down considerably.
Network traffic can also cause performance degradation. This爄s one reason why it is important
to perform backups during periods of low server use.</p>

<p>If multiple servers reside in one location, placing a backup computer on an isolated segment
can reduce backup traffic. As shown in Figure 10.8, the backup computer is then connected to a
separate NIC on each server.</p>

</p>


<A NAME="569"><h2>Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)</h2></A>
<p>An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is an automated external power supply designed to keep
a server or other device running in the event of a power failure. The UPS system takes
advantage of uninterruptible power supplies that can interface with an operating system such as
Microsoft Windows NT. The standard UPS provides a network with two crucial components:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> A power source to run the server for a short time</li></p>

<p><li> A safe shutdown management service</li></p>
</ul>

<p>The power source is usually a battery, but the UPS can also be a gasoline engine running an
AC power supply.</p>

<p>If the power fails, users are notified of the failure and warned by the UPS to finish their
tasks. The UPS then waits a predetermined amount of time and performs an orderly system
shutdown.</p>

<p>A good UPS system will:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Prevent any more users from accessing the server.</li></p>

<p><li> Send an alert message to the network administrator through the server.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>As shown in Figure 10.9, the UPS is usually located between the server and a power
source.</p>


<p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 10.9</b> <i>Uninterruptible power supply as a backup power source</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>If power is restored while the UPS is active, the UPS will notify the users that the power
has returned.</p>

<A NAME="570"><h3>Types of UPS Systems</h3></A>
<p>The best UPS systems perform online. When the power source fails, the UPS batteries
automatically take over. The process is invisible to users.</p>

<p>There are also stand-by UPS systems that start when power fails. These are less expensive
than online systems, but are not as reliable.</p>

<A NAME="571"><h3>Implementing UPS</h3></A>
<p>Answering the following questions will help the network administrator determine which UPS
system best fits the needs of the network:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Will the UPS meet the basic power requirements of this network? How many components can it support?</li></p>

<p><li>Does the UPS communicate with the server to notify it when a power failure has occurred and the server is running on batteries?</li></p>

<p><li> Does the UPS feature surge protection to guard against power spikes and surges?</li></p>

<p><li>What is the life span of the UPS battery? How long can it be inactive before it starts to degrade?</li></p>

<p><li> Will the UPS warn the administrator and users that it is running out of power?</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="572"><h2>Fault-Tolerant Systems</h2></A>
<p>Fault-tolerant systems protect data by duplicating data or placing data in different
physical sources, such as different partitions or different disks. Data redundancy allows
access to data even if part of the data system fails. Redundancy is a prominent feature common
to most fault-tolerant systems.</p>

<p>Fault-tolerant systems should never be used as replacements for regular backup of servers
and local hard disks. A carefully planned backup strategy is the best insurance policy for
recovering lost or damaged data.</p>

<p>Fault-tolerant systems offer these alternatives for data redundancy:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Disk striping</li></p>

<p><li> Disk mirroring</li></p>

<p><li> Sector sparing</li></p>

<p><li> Mirrored drive arrays</li></p>

<p><li> Clustering</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="573"><h3>Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)</h3></A>
<p>Fault-tolerance options are standardized and categorized into levels. These levels are known
as redundant array of independent disks (RAID), formerly known as redundant array of
inexpensive disks. The levels offer various combinations of performance, reliability, and
cost.</p>

<p><b>Level 0&#8212;Disk Striping</b></p>

<p>Disk striping divides data into 64K blocks and spreads it equally in a fixed rate and order
among all disks in an array. However, disk striping does not provide any fault tolerance
because there is no data redundancy. If any partition in the disk array fails, all data is
lost.</p>

<p>A stripe set combines multiple areas of unformatted free space into one large logical drive,
distributing data storage across all drives simultaneously. In Windows NT, a stripe set
requires at least two physical drives and can use up to

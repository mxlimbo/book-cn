<p>This lesson presents an overview of the network printing process and describes how a shared
printer works within a network operating system.</p>

<A NAME="597"><h2>The Network Printing Process</h2></A>
<p>As shown in Figure 11.1, when network users want to print data on a shared network printer,
they send their data to a print server. The server then feeds that data to a shared
printer.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 11.1</b> <i>Data to be printed goes first to the print server</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>A <i>print spooler</i> is software that intercepts a print job on its way from the
application (a word processor, for example) to the printer, and sends it to a print queue. A
<i>print queue</i> is a buffer where the print job is held until the printer is ready for
it.</p>

<p>Network printing occurs in the following four steps.</p>

<ol>
<p><li>An application formats its document data into a form the printer can use, and爏ends it out.</li></p>

<p><li>The computer's redirector sends the data onto the network, where it travels to爐he print server computer.</li></p>

<p><li>The print-spooler software on the print server computer places the data in a爌rint queue on the server.</li></p>

<p><li> The print queue stores the data until the printer is free to print it.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>Print queues generally use RAM for storage because it can move data faster than a hard disk
can. However, if numerous documents are sent to the printer at once and the queue overflows,
the overflow documents will be sent to the print server's hard disk to wait their turn in
the queue.</p>

<A NAME="598"><h3>Sharing a Printer</h3></A>
<p>Connecting a printer to a network print server will not, in itself, make the printer
available to network users. The printer is a resource on the server, and&#8212;like any other
resource&#8212;it must be shared to the network before anyone can access it. In a server-based
network, access to the printer can be controlled in the same way as access to any other
resource on the server.</p>

<p>To send print jobs to a printer, users have to be able to identify or see the printer from
their computers. In other words, the network operating system (NOS) must provide a way for the
printer to contact network computers to identify itself and signal that it is available.</p>

<p><b>Essential Printer Information</b></p>

<p>Every NOS has its own version of printer sharing, but each requires the administrator to
provide printer drivers and supply the NOS with information about the printer.</p>

<p>These procedures include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Loading printer drivers so that the printer can work with the print server.</li></p>

<p><li>Creating a share name for the printer so that other network users are able to recognize and access it.</li></p>

<p><li>Identifying the destination of the output so that the redirector knows where to爏end the print job.</li></p>

<p><li>Setting information and output format parameters so that the NOS will know how to handle and format the print job.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>The Print-Sharing Utility</b></p>

<p>This process can seem complex, but most network operating systems have utilities to help
administrators enter the information. In Windows NT Server, for example, a爑tility called the
Print Manager presents the printer setup screen shown in Figure 11.2.</p>

</p><p>

</p>


<A NAME="599"><h3>Connecting to a Printer</h3></A>
<p>After a printer has been shared, users must use the NOS to connect to it. To do this, users
need to know two things:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> The name of the server to which the printer has been connected</li></p>

<p><li> The name of the printer</li></p>
</ul>

<p>This explains why the administrator needs to supply a name for the printer during the
sharing process. Current computer operating systems, such as Windows, provide a graphical user
interface to help users connect to a printer.</p>

<p>To use Windows NT as an example, you can double-click on the server name and select the
printer. To connect to the printer on the server, double-click the server icon, and then select
the required printer from the list.</p>

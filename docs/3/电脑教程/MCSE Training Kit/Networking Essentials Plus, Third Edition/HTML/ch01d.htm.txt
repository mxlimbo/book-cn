<A NAME="60"><h1>Lesson 3: Network Topology</h1></A>
<p>This lesson describes designs for connecting computers. You will also learn about variations
that are often used and what you need to consider when planning your network.</p>

<p><li> Identify the four standard topologies and their variations.</li></p>

<p><li> Describe the advantages and disadvantages of each topology.</li></p>

<p><li> Determine an appropriate topology for a given network plan.</li></p>

<A NAME="61"><h2>Designing a Network Topology</h2></A>
<p>The term <i>topology</i>, or more specifically, network topology, refers to the arrangement
or physical layout of computers, cables, and other components on the network.
&quot;Topology&quot; is the standard term that most network professionals use when they refer
to the network's basic design. In addition to the term &quot;topology,&quot; you will find
several other terms that are used to define a network's design:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Physical layout</li></p>

<p><li> Design</li></p>

<p><li> Diagram</li></p>

<p><li> Map</li></p>
</ul>

<p>A network's topology affects its capabilities. The choice of one topology over another
will have an impact on the:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Type of equipment the network needs.</li></p>

<p><li> Capabilities of the equipment.</li></p>

<p><li> Growth of the network.</li></p>

<p><li> Way the network is managed.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Developing a sense of how to use the different topologies is a key to understanding the
capabilities of the different types of networks.</p>

<p>Before computers can share resources or perform other communication tasks they must be
connected. Most networks use cable to connect one computer to another.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
Wireless networks connect computers without using cable. This technology
is discussed in Chapter 2 in <a href="ch02d.htm#132">Lesson 3: Wireless Networking</a>.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>However, it is not as simple as just plugging a computer into a cable connecting other
computers. Different types of cable&#8212;combined with different network cards, network
operating systems, and other components&#8212;require different types of arrangements.</p>

<p>To work well, a network topology takes planning. For example, a particular 
topology can determine not only the type of cable used but also how the cabling runs through
floors, ceilings, and walls.</p>

<p>Topology can also determine how computers communicate on the network. 
Different topologies require different communication methods, and these 
methods have a great influence on the network.</p>

<A NAME="62"><h2>Standard Topologies</h2></A>
<p>All network designs stem from four basic topologies:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Bus</li></p>

<p><li> Star</li></p>

<p><li> Ring</li></p>

<p><li> Mesh</li></p>
</ul>

<p>A <i>bus topology</i> consists of devices connected to a common, shared cable. Connecting
computers to cable segments that branch out from a single point, or hub, is referred to as
setting up a <i>star topology</i>. Connecting computers to a cable that forms a loop is
referred to as setting up a <i>ring topology</i>. A <i>mesh topology</i> connects all computers
in a network to each other with separate cables.</p>

<p>These four topologies can be combined in a variety of more complex hybrid topologies.</p>

<A NAME="63"><h3>Bus</h3></A>
<p>The bus topology is often referred to as a &quot;linear bus&quot; because the computers
are燾onnected in a straight line. This is the simplest and most common method of networking
computers. Figure 1.15 shows a typical bus topology. It consists of a single cable called a <i>
trunk</i> (also called a backbone or segment) that connects all of the computers in the network
in a single line.</p>

<p><b>Communication on the Bus</b></p>

<p>Computers on a bus topology network communicate by addressing data to a particular computer
and sending out that data on the cable as electronic signals. To understand how computers
communicate on a bus, you need to be familiar with three concepts:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Sending the signal</li></p>

<p><li> Signal bounce</li></p>

<p><li> Terminator</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Sending the Signal</b> Network data in the form of electronic signals is sent to all the
computers on the network. Only the computer whose address matches the address encoded in the
original signal accepts the information. All other computers reject爐he data. Figure 1.16 shows
a message being sent from 0020af151d8b to

<A NAME="250"><h2>Introduction to Windows NT</h2></A>
<p>Unlike the NetWare operating system, Windows NT combines the computer and network operating
system in one. Windows NT Server configures a computer to provide server functions and
resources to a network, and Windows NT Workstation provides the client functions of the
network.</p>

<p>Windows NT operates on a domain model. A domain is a collection of computers that share a
common database and security policy. Each domain has a unique name. Within each domain, one
server must be designated as the Primary Domain Controller (PDC). This server maintains the
directory services and authenticates any users that log on. The Windows NT directory services
can be implemented in various ways by using the account and security database.</p>

<p>There are four different domain models to choose from.</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Single-domain</b> A single server maintains the security and accounts database.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Single-master</b> A single master network may have several domains, but one is designated as the master and maintains the user-accounts database.</li></p>

<li> <b>Multiple-master</b> A multiple master network includes several domains, but the
accounts database is maintained on more than one server. This model is designated for very
large organizations.</li>

<p><li><b>Complete-trust</b> A &quot;complete trust&quot; means there are several domains, but no爏ingle domain is designated as a master. All domains completely trust each爋ther.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="251"><h2>Windows NT Services</h2></A>
<p>The following services are among the most important services Windows NT Server and
Workstation provide to a network:</p>

<A NAME="252"><h3>File Services</h3></A>
<p>There are two approaches to sharing files on a Windows NT network. The first is燽ased on
simple file sharing, as on a peer-to-peer network. Any workstation or爏erver can publicly share
a directory to the network and set the attributes of the data (No Access, Read, Change, or Full
Control). One big difference between Windows NT and Windows 95 and 98 operating systems is that
in order to share a Windows NT resource, you must have administrative privileges. The next
level of sharing takes full advantage of Windows NT's security features. You can assign
directory-level and file-level permissions. This allows you to restrict access to specified
individuals or groups. In order to take advantage of the more advanced file sharing, you will
need to use the Windows NT file system (NTFS). During installation of Windows NT, you can
choose between NTFS or a 16-bit FAT (MS-DOS) file system. You can install both systems on
different hard drives or on different partitions of a single hard drive, but when the computer
is running in MS-DOS mode, the NTFS directories will be unavailable. Any client not using NTFS
can share to the network, but is limited to public sharing and cannot take advantage of the
security features of NTFS.</p>


<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
Windows 95, version C, and Window 98 use a 32-bit file allocation table
(FAT) file system. Windows NT is not compatible with 32-bit FAT. Windows NT cannot be installed
on a 32-bit FAT system and will not recognize any files existing on a 32-bit FAT
partition.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="253"><h3>Security</h3></A>
<p>Like any major NOS, Windows NT provides security for any resource on the network. A Windows
NT network domain server maintains all the account records, and manages permissions and user
rights. In order to access any resource on the network, a user must have rights to complete a
task and the permission to use the爎esource.</p>

<A NAME="254"><h3>Printing</h3></A>
<p>In a Windows NT network, any client or server can function as a print server. By sharing a
printer to the network, it becomes available to anyone on the network (subject to the rules of
sharing). When installing a printer, you will first be asked whether or not the printer will be
designated as a local printer (My Computer) or燼 network printer. If you choose the network
printer, a dialog box will appear, listing all the available network printers. All you need to
do is select the one you want to use. Remember that you can install more than one printer to a
machine. Also, if you are installing a local printer, you will be asked if you want to share
the printer to the network for others to use.</p>

<A NAME="255"><h3>Network Services</h3></A>
<p>Windows NT provides several services to help facilitate a smooth-running network. The
following list summarizes these services:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Messenger Service</b> Monitors the network and receives pop-up messages for爕ou.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Alerter Service</b> Sends notifications that are received by the messenger service.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Browser Service</b> Provides a list of servers available on domains and workgroups.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Workstation Service</b> Runs on a workstation and is responsible for connections to servers. This is also referred to as the redirector.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Server Service</b> Provides network access to the resources on a computer.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="256"><h2>Interoperability</h2></A>
<p>The NWLink network protocol is designed to make Windows NT compatible with NetWare.
(Protocols are discussed in detail in <A HREF="ch06a.htm">Chapter 6</A>, &quot;Defining Network Protocols.&quot;) The
following NetWare services are available:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW)</b> All Windows NT clients within a燿omain
must contact a NetWare server through a single source. GSNW provides the gateway connection
between a Windows NT domain and a NetWare server. This works well for low-volume situations but
will cause a decrease in performance as the number of requests increases.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Client Services for NetWare (CSNW)</b> This service enables a Windows NT
Workstation to access file and print services on a NetWare server. It is included as part of
GSNW.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>File and Print Service for NetWare (FPNW)</b> This utility allows NetWare clients
to access Windows NT file and print services. This is not a part of the Windows NT package and
must be purchased separately.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Directory Service Manager for NetWare (DSMN)</b> This add-on utility integrates
NetWare and Windows NT user and group account information. This is爊ot a part of the Windows NT
package and must be purchased separately.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Migration Tool for NetWare</b> This tool is used by administrators who are
converting from NetWare to Windows NT. It sends a NetWare server's account information to a
Windows NT domain controller.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="258"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>The following points summarize the main elements of this lesson:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Windows NT is Microsoft's network operating system.</li></p>

<p><li>Windows NT incorporates both the computer and the network operating system into one.</li></p>

<p><li> Windows NT Server is the server module of the network.</li></p>

<p><li> Windows NT Workstation is the client module of the network.</li></p>

<p><li> Windows NT networks are designed to take advantage of the domain model in爓hich all
computers share a common security database. This information is stored on a server that is
designated as the domain controller. Windows Server and Workstation will operate as part of a
peer-to-peer network (share model), but you will not be able to take advantage of the
additional security features provided in the domain model.</li></p>

<p><li>Windows NT provides several utilities to provide interoperability between NetWare and Windows NT.</li></p>

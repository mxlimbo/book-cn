<A NAME="392"><h1>Lesson 2: Connection Services</h1></A>
<p>In <a href="ch07b.htm#377">Lesson 1</a>, we examined devices that allow us to extend a LAN. As our networks grow, they
quickly exceed the capacity of standard network media, and it is no longer practical to run our
own cabling, especially if one of the nodes is located across the street or in another state.
In this lesson, we explore the various connection services that we can employ with the hardware
discussed in <a href="ch07b.htm#377">Lesson 1</a> to extend a network.</p>

<p>This lesson examines connection service options. Many network connection choices are
available, and each has advantages and disadvantages. We begin with simple telephone lines and
move on to cover high-speed digital services.</p>

<A NAME="393"><h2>Carriers</h2></A>
<p>A modem is useless unless it can communicate with another component. All modem communication
takes place over some kind of communication line or cable. Which type of cable it is, as well
as who provides it and its related services, makes a difference in network performance and
cost.</p>

<p>The issue is simple: it is difficult and expensive to move data quickly over long distances.
The three factors an administrator must take into account when considering how to implement
modem communications are:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Throughput.</li></p>

<p><li> Distance.</li></p>

<p><li> Cost.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>You need to apply these factors when deciding which type of telephone lines to install for
your network.</p>

<A NAME="394"><h3>Telephone Lines</h3></A>
<p>Two types of telephone lines are available for modem communications:</p>

<p><b>Dial-Up Lines</b></p>

<p>Dial-up lines are common telephone lines. They are slow, require users to make a connection
for each communication session manually, and can be unreliable for transmitting data. However,
for some companies it may be practical to temporarily use a dial-up communication link between
sites for a certain amount of time each day to transfer files and update databases.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>Run the <b>c07dem16</b> video located in the <b>Demos</b> folder on the CD accompanying this
book to view a presentation of a dial-up communication link.</p>

<p>Carriers are continually improving their dial-up line service. Some digital lines support
data transmission speeds of up to 56 Kbps using error correction, data compression, and
synchronous modems.</p>

<p><b>Leased (Dedicated) Lines</b></p>

<p>Leased, or dedicated, lines provide full-time, dedicated connections that do not use a
series of switches to complete the connection. The quality of the line is often higher than the
quality of a telephone line designed for voice transmission only. They typically range in speed
from 56 Kbps to 45 Mbps or more.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>Run the <b>c07dem17</b> video located in the <b>Demos</b> folder on the CD accompanying this
book to view a presentation of leased (dedicated) lines.</p>

<p>Most long-distance carriers use switched circuits to provide what appears to be a dedicated
line. These are called &quot;virtual private networks&quot; (VPNs).</p>

<A NAME="395"><h3>Remote Access Service (RAS)</h3></A>
<p>Frequently, businesses need to be able to communicate beyond the bounds of a single network.
Most server-based network operating systems provide a service, called Remote Access Service
(RAS), to meet that need. To establish a remote connection requires two services: RAS and a
client service known as dial-up networking (DUN). The server or workstation uses RAS to link
remote computers to the network by means of a dial-in connection over a modem. DUN, the other
side of the service, is used by remote computers to connect to the RAS server. Together, these
two services provide the ability to extend a network and can, in effect, convert a LAN into a
WAN. Because many Internet service providers use telephone-line access, a RAS server often
serves as an Internet interface for its network.</p>


<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
The key difference between RAS service on a server computer and on a
client computer lies in the number of simultaneous connections allowed. For example, a Windows
NT Server allows 256 inbound connections, whereas a Windows NT Workstation client allows only
one.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>Separate computers and LANs can be connected to each other over the Public Switched
Telephone Network, packet-switched networks, or Integrated Services Digital Network; (these
services are discussed later in this lesson).</p>

<p>Once a user has made a connection, the telephone lines become transparent (invisible
to&#8212;not perceived by&#8212;the user), and users at the remote client can access all network
resources just as they would if they were sitting at their computers at the network site.
Figure 7.20 shows a remote client connected to a network server using RAS.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 7.20</b> <i>RAS allows remote users to access the network</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p><b>RAS Connections</b></p>


<p>The physical connection to a RAS server can be made using several different media. These
include the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)</b> This service is otherwise known as the public telephone system.</li></p>

<p><li><b>X.25</b> This packet-switched network service can be used to make dial-up or direct connections.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)</b> This service provides high-speed
remote access, but at greater cost than a dial-up connection. An ISDN connection requires an
ISDN card in place of a modem.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>RAS Protocols</b></p>

<p>RAS supports three connection protocols. The oldest, dating from 1984, is the Serial Line
Interface protocol (SLIP). It has a number of shortcomings. SLIP does not support dynamic IP
addressing or the NetBEUI or IPX protocols, it cannot encrypt logon information, and it is
supported only by RAS clients.</p>

<p>Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) overcomes many of the limitations of SLIP. In addition to
TCP/IP, it supports the IPX, NetBEUI, AppleTalk, and DECnet protocols. It also supports
encrypted passwords.</p>

<p>Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is an essential part of VPN technology. Like PPP,
it does not discriminate among protocols. PPTP provides secure transmission over TCP/IP
networks because its connections are encrypted. This enables highly private network links over
the public Internet.</p>

<p><b>RAS and Security</b></p>

<p>The actual methods by which RAS ensures security can vary with the operating system. RAS
security functions include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Auditing</b> An audit trail can be kept that identifies users and the times during which they logged on.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Callback</b> RAS can be configured to call back to the host that is requesting a
connection, and the list of those host telephone numbers can be restricted to prevent
unauthorized use of the system.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Security host</b> A security host can require additional authentication steps in addition to those that exist on the host's network.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>PPTP filtering</b> This filtering process can prevent processing of any packets
except PPTP. This provides a secure transfer of data over a VPN, preventing intruders from
accessing the server.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Installing RAS</b></p>

<p>To plan for a RAS installation, begin by gathering appropriate documentation about the
network and its users. Information you will need includes:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Modem specifications, drivers, and settings (you will need a RAS-capable modem).</li></p>

<p><li> Type of communication port to be configured.</li></p>

<p><li> Whether this connection will be dial-in, dial-out, or both.</li></p>

<p><li> Client protocols.</li></p>

<p><li> Security requirements.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Configuring RAS</b></p>

<p>After RAS is installed, it has to be configured. Be prepared to provide settings for the
communication ports, network protocols, and RAS encryption.</p>

<p><b>Configuring Dial-Up Networks</b> If the server will be used to dial other networks, the
Internet, or other computers, these connections must be configured. The method of configuration
depends on the computer and network operating systems in use.</p>

<p><b>Limitations of RAS</b></p>

<p>Using a RAS connection is not always the best choice to achieve network expansion. But it
does provide many features and opportunities that might not be otherwise available. It is
important to know when to choose RAS and when to select a different option.</p>

<p>Use RAS if you determine that your bandwidth requirements are not greater than 128 Kbps, if
you do not require a full-time connection, or if you must keep system costs down. Do not use
RAS if you need a higher bandwidth than that provided by an asynchronous modem or if you need a
dedicated full-time connection.</p>

<A NAME="396"><h3>Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)</h3></A>
<p>This protocol supports multiprotocol VPNs. This support allows remote clients to connect and
access the organizations network securely via the Internet. Using PPTP, the remote client
establishes a connection to the RAS server on the Internet using PPTP.</p>

<p>PPTP provides a way to route IP, IPX, or NetBEUI point-to-point protocol packets over a
TCP/IP network. By encapsulating these dissimilar protocol packets, any of these packets can be
sent over the TCP/IP network. This virtual WAN is supported through the public networks such as
the Internet.</p>

<A NAME="397"><h2>WAN Overview</h2></A>
<p>While LANs work well, they have physical and distance limitations. Because LANs are not
adequate for all business communication, they must be able to connect between LANs and other
types of environments to ensure access to full communication services.</p>

<p>Using components such as bridges and routers, along with communications service providers, a
LAN can be expanded from an operation that serves a local area to encompass a wide area network
that can support data communications statewide, countrywide, or even worldwide. To the user,
the WAN appears to function like a local area network. When a WAN has been properly
implemented, it appears indistinguishable from a LAN.</p>

<p>Most WANs are combinations of LANs and other types of communications components connected by
communication links called &quot;WAN links.&quot; WAN links can include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Packet-switching networks.</li></p>

<p><li> Fiber-optic cable.</li></p>

<p><li> Microwave transmitters.</li></p>

<p><li> Satellite links.</li></p>

<p><li> Cable television coaxial systems.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Because WAN links, such as wide-area telephone connections, are too expensive and complex
for most private companies to purchase, implement, and maintain on their own, they are usually
leased from service providers.</p>

<p>Communication between LANs will involve one of the following transmission technologies:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Analog</li></p>

<p><li> Digital</li></p>

<p><li> Packet switching</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Each of these technologies is described in detail in this lesson.</p>

<A NAME="398"><h3>Analog Connectivity</h3></A>
<p>The same network that your telephone uses is available to computers. One name for this
worldwide network is the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). In the context of computing,
the PSTN, offering voice-grade dial-up telephone lines, can be thought of as one large WAN
link.</p>

<p><b>Dial-Up Lines</b></p>

<p>The fact that the PSTN was designed primarily for voice-grade communication makes it slow;
dial-up analog lines require modems that can make them even slower. Figure 7.21 shows a typical
dial-up connection. Because the PSTN is a circuit-switched network, the connection quality is
inconsistent. Any single communication session will be only as good as the circuits linked for
that particular session. Over long distances&#8212;country to country, for example&#8212;there
can be considerable inconsistency in the circuits from one session to the next. With ADSL
technology becoming more available, improvements are likely to be made to dial-up lines in the
future.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 7.21</b> <i>An analog telephone line can connect two computers using modems</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p><b>Dedicated Analog Lines</b></p>

<p>Unlike dial-up lines that must be reopened each time they are used, dedicated (or leased)
analog lines remain open at all times. A leased analog line is faster and more reliable than a
dial-up connection. However, it is also relatively expensive, because the carrier is dedicating
resources to the leased connection whether or not the line is being used.</p>

<p><b>Dial-Up or Dedicated?</b></p>

<p>No type of service is best for all users. The best choice will depend on a number of factors
including:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> The amount of time the connection will be used.</li></p>

<p><li> The cost of the service.</li></p>

<p><li>The importance of having higher or more reliable data rates from a conditioned line.</li></p>

<p><li> The need for a 24-hour-a-day connection.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>If the need for connectivity is infrequent, dial-up lines can work well. If the connection
needs a high level of reliability and usage will be fairly continuous over the month, then the
service quality provided by a dial-up line might not be adequate.</p>

<A NAME="399"><h3>Digital Connectivity</h3></A>
<p>In some cases, analog lines provide sufficient connectivity. However, when an organization
generates so much WAN traffic that the transmission time makes an analog connection inefficient
and expensive, it might be time to consider alternatives.</p>

<p>Organizations requiring a faster, more secure transmission environment than that which
analog lines provide can turn to digital data service (DDS) lines. DDS provides point-to-point
synchronous communication at 2.4, 4.8, 9.6, or 56 Kbps. Point-to-point digital circuits are
dedicated circuits that are provided by several telecommunications carriers. The carrier
guarantees full-duplex bandwidth by setting up a permanent link from each endpoint to the
LAN.</p>

<p>The primary advantage of digital lines is that they provide transmission that is nearly 99
percent error free. Digital lines are available in several forms, including DDS, T1, T3, T4,
and switched 56.</p>

<p>Because DDS uses digital communication, it does not require modems (See Figure 7.22).
Instead, DDS sends data from a bridge or router through a device called a Channel Service
Unit/Data Service Unit (CSU/DSU). This device converts the standard digital signals that the
computer generates into the type of digital signals (bipolar) that are part of the synchronous
communication environment. It also contains electronics to protect the DDS service
provider's network.</p>


<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F07xx22x.htm')"> <img src="images/F07xx22.JPG" width=404 height=460 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 7.22</b> <i>Digital data service line connecting two remote networks</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p><b>T1 Service</b></p>

<p>For higher data speeds, T1 service is perhaps the most widely used type of digital line. It
is a point-to-point transmission technology that uses two-wire pairs (one pair to send and the
other to receive) to transmit a full-duplex signal at a rate of 1.544 Mbps. T1 is used to
transmit digital voice, data, and video signals.</p>

<p>T1 lines are among the most costly of all WAN links. Subscribers who do not need or cannot
afford the bandwidth of an entire T1 line can subscribe to one or more T1 channels in 64 Kbps
increments, known as Fractional T-1 (FT-1).</p>

<p>Outside the United States, T1 service might not be available, but a similar service, called
E1, often is. E1 is very similar to T1, but has a signaling rate of 2.048 Mbps.</p>

<p><b>Multiplexing</b> Developed by Bell Labs, T1 uses technology called <i>multiplexing</i>, or
&quot;muxing.&quot; Several signals from different sources are collected into a component
called a multiplexer and fed into one cable for transmission. At the receiving end, the data is
demultiplexed back into its original form. This approach emerged when telephone cables, which
carried only one conversation per cable, became overcrowded. The solution to the problem,
called a T-Carrier network, enabled Bell Labs to carry many calls over one cable.</p>

<p><b>Dividing the Channel</b> A T1 channel can carry 1.544 megabits of data per second, the
basic unit of T-Carrier service. T1 divides this into 24 channels and samples each channel 8000
times per second. Using this method, T1 can accommodate 24 simultaneous data transmissions over
each two-wire pair.</p>

<p>Each channel sample incorporates eight bits. Because each channel is sampled 8000 times per
second, each of the 24 channels can transmit at 64 Kbps. This data rate standard is known as
DS-0. The 1.544 Mbps rate is known as DS-1.</p>

<p>DS-1 rates can be multiplexed to provide even greater transmission rates, known as DS-1C,
DS-2, DS-3, and DS-4. These have the transmission rates listed in Table 7.3 that follows:</p>

</table></p>

<p>Copper wire will accommodate T1 and T2. However, T3 and T4 require a high-frequency medium
such as microwave or fiber-optic cable.</p>

<p><b>T3 Service</b></p>

<p>T3 and Fractional T-3 leased line service provides voice and data-grade service from 6 Mbps
to 45 Mbps. These offer the highest-capacity leased-line service commonly available today. T3
and FT-3 are designed for transporting large volumes of data at high speed between two fixed
points. A T3 line can be used to replace several T1 lines.</p>

<p><b>Switched 56 Service</b></p>

<p>Both local and long-distance telephone companies offer Switched 56 Service, a LAN-to-LAN
digital dial-up service that transmits data at 56 Kbps. Switched 56 is merely a
circuit-switched version of a 56-Kbps DDS line. The advantage of Switched 56 is that it is used
on demand, thereby eliminating the expense of a dedicated line. Each computer using this
service must be equipped with a CSU/DSU that can dial up another Switched 56 site.</p>

<A NAME="400"><h3>Packet-Switching Networks</h3></A>
<p>Because packet technology is fast, convenient, and reliable, it is used to transmit data
over extensive areas such as across cities, states, or countries. Networks that send packets
from many different users along many different possible paths are called &quot;packet-switching
networks&quot; because of the way they package and route data.</p>

<p><b>How Packet Switching Works</b></p>

<p>The original data package is broken into packets, and each packet is tagged with a
destination address and other information. This makes it possible to send each packet
separately over the network.</p>

<p>In packet switching, as shown in Figure 7.23, packets are relayed through stations in a
computer network along the best route currently available between the source and the
destination.</p>

<p>Each packet is switched separately. Two packets from the same original data package can
follow completely different paths to reach the same destination. The data paths selected for
individual packets are based on the best route open at any given instant.</p>

<p>Even when each packet travels along a different path and the packets composing a message
arrive at different times or out of sequence, the receiving computer is still able to
reassemble the original message.</p>


<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F07xx23x.htm')"> <img src="images/F07xx23.JPG" width=404 height=151 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 7.23</b> <i>Simple packet-switching network</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>Switches direct the packets over the possible connections and pathways. These networks are
sometimes called any-to-any connections. Exchanges in the network read each packet and forward
them along the best route available at that moment.</p>

<p>Packet size is kept small. If there is an error in transmission, retransmitting a small
packet is easier than retransmitting a large packet. Also, small packets tie up switches for
only short periods of time.</p>

<p>Using packet-switching networks to send data is similar to shipping vast quantities of
merchandise by truck instead of loading it all onto one train. If a problem should arise with
the merchandise on one truck, it is easier to fix or reload than it would be to clean up the
mess after a train runs off the track. Also, single trucks do not tie up crossings and
intersections (switches) as trains do.</p>

<p>Packet-switching networks are fast and efficient. To manage the tasks of routing traffic and
assembling and disassembling packets, such networks require some intelligence from the
computers and software that control delivery. Packet-switching networks are economical because
they offer high-speed lines on a 
per-transaction basis instead of for a flat-fee rate.</p>

<p><b>Virtual Circuits</b></p>

<p>Many packet-switching networks use <i>virtual circuits</i>. These are circuits composed of a
series of logical connections between the sending computer and the receiving computer. The
circuit is bandwidth allocated on demand, not an actual cable or permanent, physical link
between two stations. The connection is made after both computers exchange information and
agree on communication parameters that establish and maintain the connection. These parameters
include the maximum message size and the path the data will take.</p>

<p>Virtual circuits incorporate the following communication parameters to ensure
reliability:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Acknowledgments</li></p>

<p><li> Flow control</li></p>

<p><li> Error control</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Virtual circuits can last either as long as the conversation lasts (temporary) or as long as
the two communicating computers are up and running (permanent).</p>

<p><b>Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs)</b> In Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs), the connection
between end computers uses a specific route across the network. Network resources are dedicated
to the circuit, and the route is maintained until the connection is terminated. These are also
known as point-to-many-point connections.</p>

<p><b>Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVCs)</b> Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVCs) are similar to
leased lines that are permanent and virtual, except that the customer pays only for the time
the line is used.</p>

<A NAME="401"><h2>Sending Data Across a WAN</h2></A>
<p>If the technologies discussed in previous lessons do not deliver the speed or bandwidth an
organization needs, the network administrator should consider several advanced WAN environments
that are becoming more popular as their technology matures. These include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> X.25.</li></p>

<p><li> Frame relay.</li></p>

<p><li> Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).</li></p>

<p><li> Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN).</li></p>

<p><li> Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI).</li></p>

<p><li> Synchronous Optical Network (SONET).</li></p>

<p><li> Switched Multimegabit Data Service (SMDS).</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="402"><h3>X.25</h3></A>
<p>X.25 is a set of protocols incorporated in a packet-switching network. The packet-switching
network is made up of switching services that were originally established to connect remote
terminals to mainframe host systems.</p>

<p>An X.25 packet-switching network, as shown in Figure 7.24, uses switches, circuits, and
routes, as available, to provide the best routing at any particular time. Because these
components (switches, circuits, and routes) change rapidly depending on the need and what is
available, they are sometimes depicted as clouds. The clouds are intended to convey the idea
that this is an ever-changing situation, or that there is no standard set of circuits.</p>


<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F07xx24x.htm')"> <img src="images/F07xx24.JPG" width=404 height=150 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 7.24</b> <i>X.25 packet switching uses the best routing for each transmission</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>The early X.25 networks used telephone lines to transmit data. This was an unreliable medium
that resulted in frequent errors, so X.25 incorporated extensive error checking. As a
consequence of all of the error checking and retransmission, X.25 can appear to be slow.</p>

<p>Today's X.25 protocol suite defines the interface between a synchronous packet-mode host
or other device and the public data network (PDN) over a dedicated or leased-line circuit. This
interface is a data terminal equipment/data communications equipment (DTE/DCE) interface.</p>

<p>Examples of DTEs include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> A host computer with an X.25 interface.</li></p>

<p><li> A packet assembler/disassembler (PAD) that receives asynchronous characters, entered
from a low-speed terminal, and assembles them into packets to be transmitted over the network.
The PAD also disassembles packets received from the network so that the data can be delivered
as characters to the terminals.</li></p>

<p><li> A gateway between the PDN and a LAN or WAN.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>For all three of these DTE examples, the DCE half of the DTE/DCE is the PDN. See Figure 7.25 for examples of DTEs.</p>

<A NAME="403"><h3>Frame Relay</h3></A>
<p>As network communications move toward digital and fiber-optic environments, new technologies
are appearing that require less error checking than earlier analog packet-switching
methods.</p>

<p>Frame relay is an advanced fast-packet variable-length, digital, packet-switching
technology. With this technology, designers have stripped away many X.25 accounting and
checking functions that are not necessary in a reliable, secure, fiber-optic circuit
environment.</p>

<p>Frame relay, as shown in Figure 7.26, is a point-to-point system that uses a PVC to transmit
variable length frames at the data-link layer. The data travels from a network over a digital
leased line to a data switch and into the frame-relay network. It passes through the
frame-relay network and arrives at the destination network.</p>


<p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 7.26</b> <i>Frame relay uses a point-to-point system</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>Frame-relay networks are popular because they are much faster than other switching systems
at performing basic packet-switching operations. This is because frame relay uses PVC so the
entire path from end-to-end is known. There is no need for frame-relay devices to perform
packet disassembly and reassembly, or to provide best-path routing.</p>

<p>Frame-relay networks can also provide subscribers with bandwidth as needed, which lets the
customer make nearly any type of transmission.</p>

<p>Frame-relay technology requires a frame-relay-capable router or bridge to successfully
transmit data over the network. A frame-relay router needs at least one WAN port for a
connection to the frame-relay network and another port for the LAN.</p>

<A NAME="404"><h3>Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)</h3></A>
<p>Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) is an advanced implementation of packet switching that
provides high-speed data transmission rates to send fixed-size packets over broadband and
baseband LANs or WANs. ATM can accommodate:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Voice.</li></p>

<p><li> Data.</li></p>

<p><li> Fax.</li></p>

<p><li> Real-time video.</li></p>

<p><li> CD-quality audio.</li></p>

<p><li> Imaging.</li></p>

<p><li> Multimegabit data transmission.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>The CCITT defined ATM in 1988 as part of the broadband Integrated Services Digital Network
(BISDN), discussed later in this lesson. Because of ATM's power and versatility, it is
influencing the development of network communications. It is equally adaptable to LAN and WAN
environments, and it can transmit data at very high speeds (155 Mbps to 622 Mbps or more).</p>

<p><b>ATM Technology</b></p>

<p>ATM is a broadband cell relay method that transmits data in 53-byte cells rather than in
variable-length frames. Figure 7.27 illustrates an ATM cell. These cells consist of 48 bytes of
application information with five additional bytes of ATM header data. For example, ATM would
divide a 1000-byte packet into 21 data frames and put each data frame into a cell. The result
is a technology that transmits a consistent, uniform packet.</p>


<p>
<img src="images/F07xx27.JPG" width=270 height=208 border="0">
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 7.27</b> <i>ATM cells have 48 bytes of data and a 5-byte header</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>Network equipment can switch, route, and move uniform-sized frames much more quickly than it
can move random-sized frames. The consistent, standard-sized cell uses buffers efficiently and
reduces the work required to process incoming data. The uniform cell size also helps in
planning application bandwidth.</p>

<p>Theoretically, ATM can offer throughput rates of up to 1.2 gigabits per second. Currently,
however, ATM measures its speed against fiber-optic speeds that can reach as high as 622 Mbps.
Most commercial ATM boards will transmit data at about 155 Mbps.</p>

<p>As a reference point, at 622 Mbps ATM could transmit the entire contents of the latest
edition of the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>, including graphics, in less than one second. If
the same transfer were tried using a 2400-baud modem, the operation would take more than two
days.</p>

<p>ATM can be used in LANs and WANs at approximately the same speed in each. ATM relies on
carriers such as AT&amp;T and Sprint for implementation over a wide area. This creates a
consistent environment that does away with the concept of the slow WAN and the differing
technologies used in the LAN and WAN environments.</p>

<p><b>ATM Components</b></p>

<p>ATM components are currently available through only a limited number of vendors. All
hardware in an ATM network must be ATM-compatible. Implementing ATM in an existing facility
will require extensive equipment replacement. This is one reason why ATM has not been adopted
more quickly.</p>

<p>However, as the ATM market matures, various vendors will be able to provide:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Routers and switches to connect carrier services on a global basis.</li></p>

<p><li> Backbone devices to connect all the LANs within a large organization.</li></p>

<p><li>Switches and adapters that link desktop computers to high-speed ATM connections for running multimedia applications.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>ATM Media</b> ATM does not restrict itself to any particular media type. It can be used
with existing media designed for other communications systems including:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Coaxial cable.</li></p>

<p><li> Twisted-pair cable.</li></p>

<p><li> Fiber-optic cable.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>However, these traditional network media in their present forms do not support all of
ATM's capabilities. An organization called the ATM Forum recommends the following physical
interfaces for ATM:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> FDDI (100 Mbps)</li></p>

<p><li> Fiber Channel (155 Mbps)</li></p>

<p><li> OC3 SONET (155 Mbps)</li></p>

<p><li> T3 (45 Mbps)</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Other interfaces include frame relay and X.25, discussed earlier in this lesson.</p>

<p><b>ATM Switches</b> ATM switches are multiport devices that can act as either of
the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Hubs to forward data from one computer to another within a network</li></p>

<p><li> Router-like devices to forward data at high speeds to remote networks</li></p>
</ul>

<p>In some network architectures, such as Ethernet and Token Ring, only one computer at a time
can transmit. In Figure 7.28, three routers are feeding data into the ATM switch and onto the
ATM network at the same time.</p>

<p><b>ATM Considerations</b></p>

<p>ATM technology requires special hardware and exceptional bandwidth to reach its potential.
Applications that support video or voice would overwhelm most older network environments and
frustrate users trying to use the network for normal business. Also, implementing and
supporting ATM requires expertise that is not widely available.</p>

<A NAME="405"><h3>Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)</h3></A>
<p>Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is an inter-LAN digital connectivity
specification that accommodates voice, data, and imaging. One of the original goals of ISDN
developers was to link homes and businesses over copper telephone wires. The early ISDN
implementation plan called for converting existing telephone circuits from analog to digital.
This plan is being implemented worldwide.</p>

<p>Basic Rate ISDN divides its available bandwidth into three data channels. Two of these move
data at 64 Kbps, while the third transmits at 16 Kbps.</p>

<p>The 64 Kbps channels are known as B channels. These can carry voice, data, or images. The
slower 16 Kbps channel is called the D channel. The D channel carries signaling and link
management data. ISDN Basic Rate desktop service is called 2B+D.</p>

<p>A computer connected to an ISDN service can use both B channels together for a combined 128
Kbps data stream. If both end stations also support compression, much higher throughput can be
achieved.</p>

<p>Primary Rate ISDN uses the entire bandwidth of a T1 link by providing 23 B channels at 64
Kbps and one D channel at 64 Kbps. The D channel is used only for signaling and link
management.</p>

<p>Networks that plan to use ISDN services should consider whether to use Basic Rate or Primary
Rate, based on their need for data throughput. ISDN is the digital replacement for PSTN and, as
such, is a dial-up service only. It is not designed to be a 24-hour (like T1) or
bandwidth-on-demand (like frame relay) service.</p>

<A NAME="406"><h3>Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)</h3></A>
<p>Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is a specification that describes a high-speed (100
Mbps) token-ring network that uses fiber-optic media. It was produced by the X3T9.5 committee
of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and released in 1986. FDDI was designed for
use with high-end computers that required greater bandwidth than the 10 Mbps Ethernet or 4 Mbps
of existing Token Ring architectures.</p>

<p>FDDI is used to provide high-speed connections for various types of networks. FDDI can be
used for metropolitan area networks (MANs) to connect networks in the same city with a
high-speed fiber-optic cable connection. It is limited to a maximum ring length of 100
kilometers (62 miles), so FDDI is not really designed to be used as a WAN technology.</p>

<p>Networks in high-end environments use FDDI to connect components, such as large and small
minicomputers, in a traditional computer room. These are sometimes called &quot;back-end networks.&quot; These networks typically handle file transfer far more than interactive
communication. When communicating with a mainframe, minicomputers or personal computers often
require constant, real-time use of the media. They might even need exclusive use of the media
for extended periods of time.</p>

<p>FDDI works with backbone networks to which other low-capacity LANs can connect. It is not
wise to connect all the data-processing equipment in a company to a single LAN because the
traffic can overload the network, and a failure can halt the company's entire
data-processing operation.</p>

<p>LANs that require high data rates and fairly extensive bandwidth can use FDDI connections.
These are networks composed of engineering computers or other computers that must support
high-bandwidth applications such as video, computer-aided design (CAD), and computer-aided
manufacturing (CAM).</p>

<p>Any office requiring high-speed network operations might consider using FDDI. Even in
business offices, the need to produce graphics for presentations and other documentation can
saturate and slow a network.</p>

<p><b>Token Passing</b></p>

<p>While FDDI uses a standard token-passing system, there are differences between FDDI and
802.5. A computer on an FDDI network can transmit as many frames as it can produce within a
predetermined time before letting the token go. As soon as a computer has finished
transmitting, it releases the token.</p>

<p>Because a computer releases the token when it has finished transmitting, there can be
several frames circulating on the ring at once. This explains why FDDI offers higher throughput
than a Token Ring network, which allows only one frame at a time to circulate.</p>

<p><b>Topology</b></p>

<p>FDDI operates at 100 Mbps over a dual-ring topology that supports 500 computers over a
distance of up to 100 kilometers (62 miles).</p>

<p>FDDI uses shared network technology. This means that more than one computer at a time can
transmit. Although FDDI can provide 100 Mbps service, the shared network approach can still
become saturated. For example, if 10 computers all transmit at 10 Mbps, the total transmission
will equal 100 Mbps. In transmitting video or multimedia, even the 100 Mbps transmit rate can
become a bottleneck.</p>

<p>As shown in Figure 7.29, FDDI uses the token-passing system in a dual-ring setting. Traffic
in an FDDI network consists of two similar streams flowing in opposite directions around two
counter-rotating rings. One ring is called the &quot;primary ring&quot; and the other is called
the &quot;secondary ring.&quot;</p>


<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F07xx29x.htm')"> <img src="images/F07xx29.JPG" width=404 height=332 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 7.29</b> <i>FDDI uses a dual-ring topology</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>Traffic usually flows only on the primary ring. If the primary ring fails, FDDI
automatically reconfigures the network so that the data flows onto the secondary ring in the
opposite direction.</p>

<p>One of the advantages of the dual-ring topology is redundancy. One of the rings is used for
transmission, and the other is used for backup. If there is a problem, such as a ring failure
or a cable break, the ring reconfigures itself and continues transmitting.</p>

<p>The total cable length of both rings combined must not exceed 200 kilometers (124 miles),
and it cannot hold more than 1000 computers. However, because the second, redundant ring
protects against ring failure, the total capacities should be divided in half. Therefore, each
FDDI network should be limited to 500 computers and 100 kilometers (62 miles) of cable. Also,
there must be a repeater every two kilometers (1.24 miles) or less.</p>

<p>Computers may connect to one or both FDDI cables in a ring. As shown in Figure 7.30, those
that connect with both cables are known as Class A stations, and those that connect to only one
ring are called Class B stations.</p>

<p>If there is a network failure, Class A stations can help reconfigure the network; Class B
stations cannot.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 7.30</b> <i>Class A computers connect to both rings; Class B computers connect to only one</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p><b>FDDI in a Star</b> FDDI computers can accommodate point-to-point links to a hub. This
means that FDDI can be implemented using the star-ring topology. This is an advantage in that
it can:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Help in troubleshooting.</li></p>

<p><li>Take advantage of the management and troubleshooting capabilities of advanced hubs.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Beaconing</b></p>

<p>All computers in an FDDI network are responsible for monitoring the token-passing process.
To isolate serious failures in the ring, FDDI uses a system called <i>beaconing</i>. With
beaconing, the computer that detects a fault sends a signal, called a &quot;beacon,&quot; onto
the network. The computer continues to send the beacon until it notices a beacon from its
upstream neighbor, and then it stops sending. This process continues until the only computer
sending a beacon is the one directly downstream of the failure.</p>

<p>As illustrated in Figure 7.31, Computer 1 faults. Computer 3 detects the fault, starts to
beacon, and continues to do so until it receives a beacon from Computer 2. Computer 2 continues
to beacon until it receives a beacon from Computer 1. Because Computer 1 is the one with the
fault, Computer 2 will continue to beacon and pinpoint the fault's location on Computer
1.</p>


<p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 7.31</b> <i>FDDI uses beaconing to isolate problems</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>When the beaconing computer finally receives its own beacon, it assumes the problem has been
fixed and regenerates a token; then the network returns to normal operation.</p>

<p><b>Media</b></p>

<p>FDDI's primary medium is fiber-optic cable. This means that FDDI is:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Immune to electromagnetic interference or noise.</li></p>

<p><li>Secure, because fiber-optic cable does not emit a signal that can be monitored, and it cannot be tapped.</li></p>

<p><li> Able to transmit long distances before needing a repeater.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>FDDI can also be used on copper wire, known as copper-distributed data interface (CDDI), but
this will seriously limit its distance capabilities.</p>

<A NAME="407"><h3>Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)</h3></A>
<p>Synchronous optical network (SONET) is one of several emerging systems that take advantage
of fiber-optic technology. It can transmit data at more than one gigabit per second (Gbps).
Networks based on this technology are capable of delivering voice, data, and video
communication.</p>

<p>SONET is a standard for optical transport that was formulated by the Exchange Carriers
Standards Association (ECSA) for ANSI. SONET has also been incorporated into the Synchronous
Digital Hierarchy recommendations of the CCITT, also known as the International
Telecommunications Union (ITU), which sets the standards for international
telecommunications.</p>

<p>SONET defines optical-carrier (OC) levels and electrical-equivalent synchronous transport
signals (STSs) for the fiber optic-based transmission hierarchy.</p>

<p>SONET uses a basic transmission rate of STS-1, which is equivalent to 51.84 Mbps. However,
higher-level signals are achievable and are integer multiples of the base rate. For example,
STS-3 is three times the rate of STS-1 (3 X 51.84 = 155.52 Mbps). An STS-12 would be a rate of
12 x 51.84 = 622.08 Mbps.</p>

<p>SONET provides sufficient payload flexibility that it can be used as the underlying
transport layer for BISDN ATM cells. BISDN is a single ISDN network that can handle voice,
data, and video services. ATM is the CCITT standard that supports cell-based voice, data,
video, and multimedia communication in a public network under BISDN. The ATM Forum is aligning
with SONET as the transport layer for cell-based traffic.</p>

<A NAME="408"><h3>Switched Multimegabit Data Service (SMDS)</h3></A>
<p>Switched Multimegabit Data Service (SMDS) is a switching service provided by some local
exchange carrier services. Transmission speeds range from 1 Mbps to 34 Mbps with many-to-many
connectivity. Unlike a dedicated mesh network (a network with multiple active paths), this
connectionless service offers high bandwidth at reduced network costs.</p>

<p>SMDS uses the same fixed-length cell relay technology as ATM. One SMDS line with the
appropriate bandwidth connects into the local carrier and can provide connections between all
sites without a call setup or teardown procedure. SMDS does not perform error checking or flow
control; that is left up to the sites being connected.</p>

<p>SMDS is compatible with the IEEE 802.6 MAN standard as well as with BISDN, but SMDS provides
management and billing services not specified in the IEEE 802.6 specification.</p>

<p>SMDS uses the distributed queue dual bus (DQDB) as the interface and access method for the
network. SMDS is a dual-bus topology that forms a ring that is not closed.</p>

<A NAME="409"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>

<A NAME="410"><h2>Exercise 7.1: Troubleshooting Problem</h2></A>
<p>Use the information below to help you solve the troubleshooting problem that follows.</p>

<A NAME="411"><h3>Background Information</h3></A>
<p>One of the key resources for troubleshooting communications problems is the vendor who
manufactured the product. Most system administrators do not have extensive knowledge of
telecommunications technology, while telecommunications vendors typically have staff members
who have this type of expertise. Often, however, actual problems are not nearly as difficult to
resolve as they first appear to be. Consider the following example:</p>

<p>A medium-sized computer firm lost its telephone service every Monday morning for nearly six
months. Each Monday, employees would arrive at work to find that the telephone system was not
working. Because no one in the company had the expertise to solve the problem, they contacted
their telephone vendor, who sent someone out to repair the system. The telephone company sent a
different technician each time, and each time it took the technician only about 15 minutes to
fix the system.</p>

<p>One Monday, one of the computer firm's own technicians went to watch the telephone
vendor's technician bring the system back up. The technician simply located the telephone
system's surge suppressor and hit the reset switch. That was the total fix, and anyone who
knew how to reset the surge suppressor (simply by pressing a reset button) could now repair the
telephone system.</p>

<p>The point of this story is that even in a complex environment, problems and their solutions
do not necessarily have to be complex.</p>

<p>While the answer was ultimately simple, the telephone company's technician was the only
person who had the initial expertise necessary to locate and eliminate the problem. If you have
WAN communication problems and you have eliminated the LAN's local components as a source
of trouble, do not hesitate to call the service provider to ask for help. While this can result
in an initial expense, time and money will be saved in the long run.</p>

<p>With that story in mind, forge ahead and work through the following troubleshooting
problem.</p>

<p><b>The Problem</b></p>

<p>You are the multitalented network administrator and technician for this computer firm. Your
LAN is connected to another LAN in a city 806 kilometers (500 miles) away. The communication
link is a digital T1 with a multiplexer that allows you to send telephone conversations and
data simultaneously on the same link.</p>

<p>When you came into work on Monday morning, you immediately began to hear complaints from
employees who could not use the WAN to access resources at the other site. After some checking,
you discovered that you can use the T1 for telephone conversations, but you cannot send or
receive data over the link. You now examine all the equipment and connectors but cannot see any
obvious loose or frayed connections, and all of the equipment appears to be plugged in and
turned on.</p>

<p>What can you do to start the troubleshooting process?</p>

<A NAME="412"><h2>Exercise 7.2: Case Study Problem</h2></A>
<p>A magazine publisher based in Seattle has two branch offices: one in Fort Lauderdale,
Florida, and one in New York City. Each office is internally and separately networked. The
networks were implemented five years ago, and each has a coaxial linear-bus topology supporting
Ethernet 10 Mbps traffic. The branch offices stay in touch with each other by telephone and
Federal Express.</p>

<p>Recently, the company has begun to develop projects that involve team members from more than
one office. Each office has resources that the other two do not; the current projects require
all of these resources. The internal networks have had frequent cable problems, and each time
they have a problem, the entire office network goes down until the problem is resolved.</p>

<p>The management team would like a network design that offers easier troubleshooting, less
down time, and provides WAN communication between sites. They would like the WAN connection to
be able to support about 256 Kbps of data and several analog telephone conversations between
sites (the long-distance bills have been unacceptably high). The combination of long-distance
and Federal Express charges should be eliminated by the WAN. Management would like the WAN to
be able to continue operating even if one of the WAN links should fail.</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Identify at least two network items in each branch-office network site that need upgrading.</li></p>

<A NAME="413"><h2>Exercise 7.3: Network Planning Problem</h2></A>
<p>Answering the following questions will help you determine which, if any, WAN or advanced
transmission components you should consider for your network needs.</p>

<A NAME="414"><h3>Modems</h3></A>
<ol>
<p><li>Do you need to communicate with bulletin board services (BBSs) and information service providers such as the Microsoft Network, America Online, or CompuServe?</li></p>


<p>Yes ____</p>

<p>No ____</p>


<p><li> Do you need individual connectivity to the Internet?</li></p>


<p>Yes ____</p>

<p>No ____</p>


<p><li>Do you need to transfer files periodically with another user at a different location?</li></p>


<p>Yes ____</p>

<p>No ____</p>

<p>If the answers to any of the first three questions was yes, you need a modem. Your next step
is to research which vendor's modem best fits your needs.</p>


<p><li>Will several users at once need to communicate occasionally with an online service or any remote resource?</li></p>


<p>Yes ____</p>

<p>No ____</p>

<p>If the answer is yes, you should consider a modem pool.</p>


<p><li> Do your users periodically need to access the network from home or on the road?</li></p>

<p>Yes ____</p>

<p>No ____</p>

<p>If the answer is yes, you might need remote access service. To implement this, you will also
need a remote access server.</p>
</ol>

<A NAME="415"><h3>Creating Larger Networks</h3></A>
<p>You should consider adding WAN connectivity devices to your network if it is getting too
large and difficult to manage. Difficulties could result from the addition of an unanticipated
number of users, or where existing users have acquired new applications that generate greater
network traffic than the original network was designed to accommodate. You might also need to
connect multiple sites or multiple networks.</p>

<p>The determining factors in choosing a WAN connection service include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Which services are available in your area.</li></p>

<p><li> What kinds of services you need.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>The following questions will help you identify which connectivity devices would be
appropriate for your system.</p>

<p><b>Repeaters</b></p>

<ol>
<p><li>Do you need to extend the cable length of your network to accommodate new users located farther from the server?</li></p>

<p>Yes ____</p>

<p>No ____</p>


<p><li>If you extend the length of your network cable, will the newly extended cable length exceed the specifications for that type of cable?</li></p>


<p>Yes ____</p>

<p>No ____</p>


<p><li> Do you need to transmit signals on different media than that which you are already using
for your network? (For example, do you need to connect a thinnet segment to an Ethernet 10BaseT
network?)</li></p>

<p>Yes ____</p>

<p>No ____</p>
</ol>

<p>If the answer to any of the above questions is yes, you should consider using a repeater to
expand your network.</p>


<p><b>Bridges</b></p>


<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
A rule of thumb among many experienced network professionals is to use a
bridge when dealing with nonroutable protocols. Otherwise, use a router.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<ol>
<p><li> Do you need to connect two or more network segments?</li></p>


<p>Yes ____</p>

<p>No ____</p>


<p><li>Do you need to connect two networks with different network architectures (such as Ethernet to Token Ring)?</li></p>


<p>Yes ____</p>

<p>No ____</p>


<p><li> Is your network performance slower than you would like it to be?</li></p>


<p>Yes ____</p>

<p>No ____</p>

<p>If the answer is yes, keep that in mind while you answer the next question.</p>

<p><li>Does your network serve different departments that usually transmit network traffic only within their own department?</li></p>


<p>Yes ____</p>

<p>No ____</p>
</ol>

<p>If you answered yes to any of the questions, consider using bridges either to segment a
single network or to join two different networks.</p>


<p><b>Routers</b></p>


<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
Many network professionals prefer to use routers when it is possible to
use either a bridge or a router to solve the problem. Their general rule is to use a bridge
only with nonroutable protocols. In other cases, they use a router. The cost difference between
a bridge and a router is small when weighed against the additional capabilities of a
router.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<ol>
<p><li> Do you need to join several LAN segments into a single network?</li></p>

<p>Yes ____</p>

<p>No ____</p>

<p><li>Do you need to connect different network architectures (such as Ethernet to Token Ring)?</li></p>


<p>Yes ____</p>

<p>No ____</p>


<p><li> Do you need to isolate or filter traffic between multiple segments?</li></p>


<p>Yes ____</p>

<p>No ____</p>


<p><li>Are network performance and data integrity important enough to maintain redundant paths between multiple segments simultaneously?</li></p>


<p>Yes ____</p>

<p>No ____</p>


<p><li>If you have multiple paths available, do you want to route packets on a &quot;best path&quot; algorithm?</li></p>


<p>Yes ____</p>

<p>No ____</p>
</ol>

<p>If the answer to any of these questions is yes, you should consider implementing routers
between the different segments.</p>


<p><b>Gateways</b></p>

<ol>
<p><li> Do you need to allow communication between unlike systems? (For example, do any users
need to access a mainframe computer? Do users of Microsoft network software need to access
servers running network software from Novell? Do users of network software from Novell need to
access files on a computer running UNIX?)</li></p>


<p>Yes ____</p>

<p>No ____</p>
</ol>

<p>If your answer is yes, you should consider a gateway.</p>

<A NAME="416"><h3>Choosing Advanced WAN Transmission Technologies</h3></A>
<p>Choosing a WAN connection service varies from location to location based on available
services and your network needs. You will need to do some market research to determine which
service provider can best meet your system needs. The following questions can help you identify
some of the services you will need.</p>

<ol>
<p><li> Do you have only two sites to link?</li></p>

<p>Yes ____</p>

<p>No ____</p>

<p>If the answer is yes, you probably need point-to-point service.</p>


<p><li> Does your system need to link multiple sites to a central location?</li></p>


<p>Yes ____</p>

<p>No ____</p>

<p>If the answer is yes, you probably need a point-to-multipoint service.</p>


<p><li> Does your system need to link many sites simultaneously?</li></p>


<p>Yes ____</p>

<p>No ____</p>

<p>If the answer is yes, you probably need a multipoint-to-multipoint service.</p>


<p><li>Is the data that you transmit so critical to protect that you require multiple links between sites to provide redundancy in case of link failure?</li></p>


<p>Yes ____</p>

<p>No ____</p>

<p>If the answer is yes, you might need multiple links.</p>
</ol>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
Frame relay and other switching technologies provide redundancy, but
not at the transmitting or receiving site. Also, because service providers bill for packet
switching by the packet, switching technology can be either more or less expensive than T1,
depending on the type of data and frequency of transmission. The service provider is the best
source of information about costs.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<ol>
<p><li value="5"> Which kind of network traffic will be on the link? (Check all that apply.)</li></p>

<ul>
<p><li> Voice ____</li></p>

<p><li> E-mail ____</li></p>

<p><li> Light file transfer ____</li></p>

<p><li> Heavy file transfer ____</li></p>

<p><li> Client/server database activity (likely to be fairly light network traffic) ____</li></p>

<p><li> Client-computer database activity with the data files stored on a remote server (can
be very heavy traffic) ____</li></p>
</ul>

<p><li> Based on the amount of network traffic identified in the previous question,
approximately how much network bandwidth do you need? (Your WAN vendor might be able to help
you determine this.)</li></p>

<ul>
<p><li> Less than 56 Kbps ____</li></p>

<p><li> 56 to 64 Kbps ____</li></p>

<p><li> 128 Kbps ____</li></p>

<p><li> 256 Kbps ____</li></p>

<p><li> 1 Mbps ____</li></p>

<p><li> More than 1 Mbps ____</li></p>
</ul>


<p><li>Which types and speeds of WAN connection services (service providers) are available in your area?</li></p>
</ol>

<P><div class="note"><blockquote><B>NOTE</B><HR>
 You will need to do some homework and research service providers to answer
this.</blockquote></div>
</P>

<ol>
<p><li value="8">Which of the above services can meet your requirements as determined by your answers to questions 1 to 3?</li></p>

<p><li>Which service that can meet your requirements provides the best price and performance for your WAN needs?</li></p>
</ol>

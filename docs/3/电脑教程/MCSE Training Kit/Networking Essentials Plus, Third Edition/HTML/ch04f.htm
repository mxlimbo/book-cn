<A NAME="269"><h1>Lesson 5: Network Operating Systems in Multivendor Environments</h1></A>
<p>We have taken a look at the principal network operating systems from Novell and燤icrosoft.
We have also briefly surveyed Apple, Banyan Vines, and UNIX systems. Typically, NOSs have to
integrate hardware and software products manufactured by different vendors. This lesson
presents an overview of the issues and problems involved in implementing a multivendor
network.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to:</b> </p>

<ul>
<p><li>Describe at least one way in which clients and servers can achieve interoperability.</li></p>

<p><li>Describe how manufacturers integrate their products with those of other manufacturers.</li></p>

<p><li>Determine which network operating system and redirector are appropriate for燼 given site.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="270"><h2>The Multivendor Environment</h2></A>
<p>Most networks today exist in multivendor environments. While such networks can pose
challenges, they work well when properly planned and implemented.</p>

<p>The character of a network changes when software components manufactured by燿ifferent
vendors must operate on the same network. Problems can arise when爐he network is running more
than one type of network operating system.</p>

<p>In order for a network to function properly in a heterogeneous computing environment, the
server's operating system, the client's operating system, and the redirector must all
be compatible. In a multivendor environment, it is necessary to find a common language in which
all computers can communicate. For example, in the network shown in Figure 4.6, a Windows NT
server is supporting three clients: one computer is running Microsoft Windows 95, another is
running UNIX, and a third is running AppleTalk.</p>

<A NAME="271"><h2>Implementing Multivendor Solutions</h2></A>
<p>Ensuring interoperability in multivendor environments can be carried out at either the
server end (also referred to as the &quot;back end&quot;) or the client end (also referred to
as the &quot;front end&quot;). The choice you make depends on the vendors you are using.</p>

<A NAME="272"><h3>Client Interoperability</h3></A>
<p>In situations involving multiple NOSs, the key to establishing interoperability is the
redirector. Just as you can use more than one telephone service provider when you communicate
with different people, your computer can have more than one redirector to communicate over a
network with different network servers.</p>

<p>Each redirector handles only the packets sent in the language or protocol that it can
understand. If you know what your destination is and which resource you want to access, you can
implement the appropriate redirector, and the redirector will forward your request to the
appropriate destination.</p>

<p>In the example shown in Figure 4.7, a Windows NT client needs to access a Novell server. To
accomplish this, the network administrator loads the Microsoft redirector for accessing Novell
servers on top of Windows NT, installed in the client.</p>

</p>


<A NAME="273"><h3>Server Interoperability</h3></A>
<p>The second way to implement communication between a client and a server is to install
communication services on the server, an approach used to bring an Apple Macintosh into a
Windows NT environment. Microsoft supplies Services for Macintosh, software that allows a
Windows NT Server-based server to communicate with the Apple client.</p>

<p>The Windows NT Server, shown in Figure 4.8, has had Services for Macintosh installed on it.
This allows Macintosh users to access resources on a Windows NT server. The same service also
converts files between Macintosh and Windows NT-based computers, which allows Macintosh and
Windows NT users to utilize their own interfaces to share the same files.</p>

</p>


<p>Thanks to this interoperability, a Macintosh user can follow standard Macintosh procedures
and view Macintosh icons, such as the Chooser and Finder, even though that user is accessing
resources on a Windows NT server.</p>

<A NAME="274"><h3>Vendor Options</h3></A>
<p>The three major networking product vendors are:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Microsoft.</li></p>

<p><li> Novell.</li></p>

<p><li> Apple.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Figure 4.9 shows these three operating systems in a multivendor environment. Each of these
vendors provides utilities that:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Make it possible for its operating systems to communicate with servers from the other two vendors.</li></p>

<p><li> Help its servers recognize clients from the other two vendors.</li></p>
</ul>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 4.9</b> <i>Multivendor connectivity</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p><b>Microsoft</b></p>

<p>Microsoft has built a redirector that recognizes Microsoft networks into the following
Microsoft operating systems:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Windows NT</li></p>

<p><li> Windows 95 and 98</li></p>

<p><li> Windows for Workgroups</li></p>
</ul>

<p>The redirectors are automatically implemented during the operating system installation. A
setup utility loads the required drivers and then edits the startup files so爐he redirector
will function when the user turns on the computer.</p>

<p>Microsoft redirector software not only makes it possible for clients to access resources,
but also provides each Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT client with the capability to
share its own resources.</p>

<p><b>Microsoft in a Novell Environment</b> Microsoft and Novell products are interoperable.</p>

<ul>
<li> To connect a Windows NT Workstation-based client to a Novell NetWare 3.<i>x</i> or
4.<i>x</i> network requires either NWLink and Client Service for NetWare (CSNW) or Novell's
NetWare Client for Windows NT.</li>

<p><li>To connect a Windows NT Server-based server to a NetWare network requires NWLink and Gateway Service for NetWare (GSNW).</li></p>


<p>NWLink is the Microsoft implementation of the Internetwork Packet Exchange/Sequenced Packet
Exchange ( IPX/SPX) protocol. CSNW is the Microsoft implementation of a NetWare <i>
requester</i> (Novell's term for redirector).</p>


<p><li>To connect a Windows 95- or 98-based client to a NetWare network requires IPX/SPX and Microsoft CSNW networks.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services (NDS) is client software for NetWare that
incorporates support for Novell Network 4.<i>x</i> and 5.<i>x</i> Directory Services. Microsoft
NDS provides users with logon and browsing support for NetWare 3.<i>x</i>, and 4.<i>x</i>
bindery services as NetWare 4.<i>x</i> and 5.<i>x</i> NDS servers.</p>

<p><b>MS-DOS-Based Clients</b> Server operating system vendors offer utilities that allow
MS-DOS-based clients to access servers from the three vendors. All these utilities can reside
on one machine so that one MS-DOS-based client can access servers from all three
environments.</p>

<p><b>Novell</b></p>

<p>Novell servers recognize the following clients for file and print services. NetWare
character-based clients running MS-DOS can connect to:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Novell NetWare servers.</li></p>

<p><li> Windows NT Server-based computers.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Windows NT clients running Novell's NetWare requester and the Windows NT redirector can
connect to:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Novell NetWare servers.</li></p>

<p><li> Windows NT Workstation-based and Windows NT Server-based computers.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Novell provides requesters for client operating systems including:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> MS-DOS.</li></p>

<p><li> OS/2.</li></p>

<p><li> NetWare Client for Windows NT.</li></p>
</ul>



<p><b>Apple</b></p>

<p>In the Macintosh environment, the redirector for AppleShare networking is included with the
AppleTalk operating system and provides the file-sharing function. The client software is
included with every copy of the Apple operating system. There is also an AppleShare print
server, which is a server-based print spooler. This means that Macintoshes are equipped to
participate in Apple networks.</p>

<p><b>MS-DOS-Based Client</b> AppleShare networking software offers MS-DOS-based clients access
to AppleShare file and print servers. With LocalTalk personal-computer software and a
LocalTalk personal-computer card installed on their personal computers, users can access
file-server volumes (file storage) and printers on an AppleTalk network. The LocalTalk
personal-computer card contains firmware to control the link between the AppleTalk network and
the personal computer. The LocalTalk personal-computer driver software implements many of the
AppleTalk protocols and interacts with the card to send and receive packets.</p>

<p><b>Services for Macintosh</b> Through Services for Macintosh, a Windows NT server becomes
available to燤acintosh clients. This product makes it possible for 
MS-DOS-based and Macintosh-based clients to share files and printers. Services for Macintosh
includes AppleTalk Protocol versions 2.0 and 2.1, LocalTalk, EtherTalk, TokenTalk, and
FDDITalk. In addition, Services for Macintosh supports version 5.2 or later of the LaserWriter
printer.</p>

<A NAME="277"><h2>Exercise 4.1: Case Study Problem</h2></A>
<p>To carry out this exercise, you will need to draw on information presented in all lessons in
this chapter.</p>

<p>A small company in Montana designs and manufactures kits for building log houses. Thanks to
a successful product and solid reputation, its prospects are good. The owner of the company
wants to connect the office by means of a network that is capable of supporting as many as 10
computers and users. The company employs two salespeople, an office manager, a drafter, a
graphic designer, the mill foreman, and a number of employees who do not use computers.</p>

<p>The owner's computer is running Windows 98 with a standard suite of office-application software and a popular project management-software application. The office manager,
whose Windows 98 machine runs the same kind of office-application suite as the owner, prints to
a letter-size laser printer that is connected directly to the computer. The owner and the
office manager have internal modems in their computers that are daisy-chained through the fax
machine to the single analog phone line.</p>

<p>The company also employs a computer-aided drafting (CAD) operator, who makes fabrication
drawings for the employees in the mill. His computer operating system is Windows NT, and his
primary application is a vector CAD program which plots to a roll-feed device that is cabled
directly to the computer's printer port.</p>

<p>The two salespeople have portable computers that run Windows 98. Their major applications
are included in the same office suite.</p>

<p>The computer graphic artist, who creates catalog art and presentation material, uses an
Apple G3 computer running high-end graphics software as well as the same office suite as the
owner and office manager. His computer prints to a high-resolution color postscript printer
through its standard port.</p>

<p>The owner wants everyone on this network to be able to exchange files, use both printers,
and have access to company e-mail through an Internet service provider. She has made it clear
that she does not want a network that requires high administrative overhead.</p>

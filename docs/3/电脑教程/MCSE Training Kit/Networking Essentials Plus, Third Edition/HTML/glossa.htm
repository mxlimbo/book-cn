allowing Macintoshes to be integrated into any network that uses an operating system that
recognizes AFP.</p>

<p><a name="1025"></a><b>application layer</b> The top (seventh) layer of the OSI reference model. This layer
serves as the window that application processes use to access network services. It

<p><a name="1030"></a><b>ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network)</b> Acronym for the Department of
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. A pioneering wide area network (WAN), ARPANET was
designed to facilitate the exchange of information between universities and other research
organizations. ARPANET, which became operational in the 1960s, is the network from which the
Internet evolved.</p>

<p><a name="1031"></a><b>ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)</b> A coding scheme that
assigns numeric values to letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and certain other characters. By
standardizing the values used for these characters, ASCII enables computers and computer
programs to exchange information.</p>

<p><b>Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL)</b> A recent modem technology that converts existing
twisted-pair telephone lines into access paths for
multimedia and high-speed data communications.
These new connections can transmit more than
8 Mbps to the subscriber and up to 1 Mbps from
the subscriber. ADSL is recognized as a physical
layer transmission protocol for unshielded
twisted-pair media.

<p><a name="1032"></a><b>asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)</b> An advanced implementation of packet switching that
provides high-speed data transmission rates to send fixed-size cells over broadband LANs or
WANs. Cells are 53 bytes; 48 bytes of data with five additional bytes of address. ATM
accommodates voice, data, fax, real-time video, CD-quality audio, imaging, and multimegabit
data transmission. ATM uses switches as multiplexers to permit several computers to put data on
a network simultaneously. Most commercial ATM boards transmit data at about 155 Mbps, but
theoretically a rate of 1.2 gigabits per second is possible.</p>

<p><a name="1033"></a><b>asynchronous transmission</b> A form of data transmission in which information is sent
one character at a time, with variable time intervals between characters. Asynchronous
transmission does not rely on a shared timer that would allow the sending and receiving units
to separate characters by specific time periods. Therefore, each transmitted character consists
of a number of data bits (which compose the character itself) preceded by a start bit and
ending in an optional parity bit followed by a 1-, 1.5-, or 2-stop bit.</p>

<p><a name="1034"></a><b>ATM</b> <i>See</i> <a href="#1032">asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)</a>.</p>

<p><a name="1035"></a><b>attachment unit interface (AUI)</b> The connector used with standard Ethernet that often
includes a cable running off the main, or backbone, coaxial cable. Also known as a DIX
connector.</p>

<p><a name="1036"></a><b>attenuation</b> The weakening or degrading (distorting) of a transmitted signal as it
travels farther from its point of origin. This could be a digital signal on a cable or the
reduction in amplitude of an electrical signal, without the appreciable modification of the
waveform. Attenuation is usually measured in decibels. Attenuation of a signal transmitted over
a long cable is corrected by a repeater, which amplifies and cleans up an incoming signal
before sending it farther along the cable.</p>

<p><a name="1037"></a><b>auditing</b> A process that tracks network activities by user accounts and a routine
element of network security. Auditing can produce records of list users that have
accessed&#8212;or attempted to access&#8212;specific resources, help administrators identify
unauthorized activity, and track activities such as logon attempts, connection and
disconnection from designated resources, changes made to files and directories, server events
and modifications, password changes, and logon parameter changes.</p>

<p><a name="1038"></a><b>AUI</b> <i>See</i> <a href="#1035">attachment unit interface (AUI)</a>.</p>

<p><a name="1039"></a><b>authentication</b> Verification based on user name, passwords, and time and account
restrictions.</p>

<p><a name="1040"></a><b>AWG (American Wire Gauge)</b> A standard that determines wire diameter. The diameter
varies inversely to the gauge number.</p>

<A NAME="849"><h2>B</h2></A>
<p><a name="1041"></a><b>backbone</b> The main cable, also known as the trunk segment, from which transceiver
cables connect to computers, repeaters, and bridges.</p>

server<i>.</i></p>

<p><a name="1043"></a><b>backup</b> A duplicate copy of a program, a disk, or data, made to secure valuable files
from loss.</p>

<p><a name="1044"></a><b>backup domain controller (BDC)</b> In a Windows NT Server domain, a computer that
receives a copy of the domain's security policy and domain database and authenticates
network logons. It provides a backup if the primary domain controller (PDC)
becomes unavailable. A domain is not required to have a BDC, but it is recommended to have a
BDC to back up the PDC. <i>See also</i> <a href="#1137">domain</a>, <a href="#1138">domain controller</a>, <a href="#1339">primary domain controller</a>.</p>

<p><a name="1045"></a><b>bandwidth</b> In communications, the difference between the highest and lowest
frequencies in a given range. For example, a telephone accommodates a bandwidth of 3000 Hz, or
the difference between the lowest (300 Hz) and highest (3300 Hz) frequencies it can carry. In
computer networks, greater bandwidth indicates faster or greater data-transfer capability.</p>

<p><a name="1046"></a><b>barrel connector</b> A component that can connect two pieces of cable to make a
longer piece of cable.</p>

<p><a name="1047"></a><b>baseband</b> A system used to transmit the encoded signals over cable. Baseband uses
digital signaling over a single frequency. Signals flow in the form of discrete pulses of
electricity or light. With baseband transmission, the entire communication-channel capacity is
used to transmit a single data signal.</p>

<p><a name="1048"></a><b>base I/O port</b> Specifies a channel through which information is transferred between a
computer's hardware, such as the network interface card (NIC), and its CPU.</p>

<p><a name="1049"></a><b>base memory address</b> Defines the address of the location in a computer's memory
(RAM) that is used by the NIC. This setting is sometimes called the RAM start address.</p>

<p><a name="1050"></a><b>baud</b> A measure of data-transmission speed named after the French engineer and
telegrapher Jean-Maurice-Emile Baudot. It is a measure of the speed of oscillation of the sound
wave on which a bit of data is carried over telephone lines. Because baud was originally used
to measure the transmission speed of telegraph equipment, the term sometimes refers to the
data-transmission speed of a modem. However, current modems can send at a speed higher than one
bit per oscillation, so baud is being replaced by the more accurate bps (bits per second) as a
measure of modem speed.</p>

<p><a name="1051"></a><b>baud rate</b> Refers to the speed at which a modem can transmit data. Often confused with
bps (the number of bits per second transmitted), baud rate actually measures the number of
events, or signal changes, that occur in one second. Because one event can actually encode more
than one bit in high-speed digital communication, baud rate and bps are not always synonymous,
and the latter is the more accurate term to apply to modems. For example, the 9600-baud modem
that encodes four-bits per event actually operates at 2400 baud, but transmits at 9600 bps
(2400 events times 4-bits per event), and thus should be called a 9600-bps modem.</p>

<p><a name="1054"></a><b>beaconing</b> The process of signaling computers on a ring system that token passing has
been interrupted by a serious error. All computers in an FDDI or Token Ring network are
responsible for monitoring the token-passing process. To isolate serious failures in the ring,
FDDI and Token Ring use beaconing in which a computer that detects a fault sends a signal,
called a beacon, onto the network. The computer continues to send the beacon until it notices a
beacon from its upstream neighbor. This process continues until the only computer sending a
beacon is the one directly downstream of the failure. When the beaconing computer finally
receives its own beacon, it assumes the problem has been fixed and regenerates a token.</p>

<p><a name="1055"></a><b>bind</b> To associate two pieces of information with one another.</p>

<p><a name="1056"></a><b>binding</b> A process that establishes the communication channel between a protocol
driver and a network interface card driver.</p>

<p><a name="1057"></a><b>BISDN</b> <i>See</i> <a href="#1070">broadband ISDN (BISDN)</a>.</p>

<p><a name="1058"></a><b>bisync (binary synchronous communications protocol)</b> A communications protocol
developed by IBM. Bisync transmissions are encoded in either ASCII or EBCDIC. Messages can be
of any length and are sent in units called frames, optionally preceded by a message header.
Because bisync uses synchronous transmission, in which message elements are separated by a
specific time interval, each frame is preceded and followed by special characters that enable
the sending and receiving machines to synchronize their clocks.</p>

<p><a name="1059"></a><b>bit</b> Short for binary digit: either 1 or 0 in the binary number system. In processing
and storage, a bit is the smallest unit of information handled by a computer. It is represented
physically by an element such as a single pulse sent through a circuit or small spot on a
magnetic disk capable of storing either a 1 or 0. Eight bits make a byte.</p>

<p><a name="1060"></a><b>bits per second (bps)</b> A measure of the speed at which a device can transfer data. <i>
See also</i> baud rate.</p>

<p><a name="1061"></a><b>bit time</b> The time it takes for each station to receive and store a bit.</p>

<p><a name="1062"></a><b>BNC components</b> A family of components that include the BNC cable connector, BNC T
connector, BNC barrel connector, and the BNC terminator. The origin of the acronym
&quot;BNC&quot; is unclear; names ascribed to these letters range from &quot;British Naval
Connector&quot; to &quot;Bayonet Neill-Councelman.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="1063"></a><b>BNC cable connector</b> A connector for coaxial cable that locks when one connector is
inserted into another and is rotated 90 degrees.</p>

<p><a name="1064"></a><b>Boot-sector virus</b> A type of virus that resides in the first sector of a floppy-disk
or hard drive. When the computer is booted, the virus executes. In this common method of
transmitting viruses from one floppy disk to another, the virus replicates itself onto the new
drive each time a new disk is inserted and accessed.</p>

<p><a name="1065"></a><b>bottleneck</b> A device or program that significantly degrades network performance. Poor
network performance results when a device uses noticeably more CPU time, consumes too much of a
resource, or lacks the capacity to handle the load. Potential bottlenecks can be found in the
CPU, memory, NIC, and other components.</p>

<p><a name="1066"></a><b>bounce</b> <i>See</i> <a href="#1404">signal bounce</a>.</p>

<p><a name="1068"></a><b>bridge</b> A device used to join two LANs. It allows stations on either network to access
resources on the other. Bridges can be used to increase the length or number of nodes for a
network. The bridge makes connections at the data-link layer of the OSI reference model.</p>

<p><a name="1069"></a><b>bridged network</b> A network that is connected by bridges.</p>

<p><a name="1070"></a><b>broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (BISDN)</b> A consultative committee for
the CCITT that recommends definitions for voice, data, and video in the megabit-gigabit range.
BISDN is also a single ISDN network that can handle voice, data, and video services. BISDN
works with an optical cable transport network called Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) and an
asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switching service. SMDS (Switched Multimegabit Data Services)
is a BISDN service that offers high bandwidth to WANs.</p>

<p><a name="1071"></a><b>broadband network</b> A type of LAN on which transmissions travel as analog
(radio-frequency) signals over separate inbound and outbound channels. Devices on a broadband
network are connected by coaxial or fiber-optic cable, and signals flow across the physical
medium in the form of electromagnetic or optical waves. A broadband system uses a large portion
of the electromagnetic spectrum with a range of frequencies from 50 Mbps to 600 Mbps. These
networks can simultaneously accommodate television, voice, data, and other services over
multiple transmission channels.</p>

<p><a name="1072"></a><b>broadcast</b> A transmission sent simultaneously to more than one recipient. In
communications and on networks, a broadcast message is one distributed to all stations or
computers on the network.</p>

<p><a name="1073"></a><b>broadcast storm</b> An event that occurs when there are so many broadcast messages on the
network that they approach or surpass the capacity of the network bandwidth. This can happen
when one computer on the network transmits a flood of frames saturating the network with
traffic so it can no longer carry messages from any other computer. Such a broadcast storm can
shut down a network.</p>

<p><a name="1074"></a><b>brouter</b> A network component that combines the best qualities of a bridge and a
router. A brouter can act as a router for one protocol and as a bridge for all the others. Brouters
can route selected routable protocols, bridge nonroutable protocols, and deliver more
cost-effective and manageable internetworking than separate bridges and routers. A brouter is a
good choice in an environment that mixes several homogeneous LAN segments with two different
segments.</p>

<p><a name="1075"></a><b>buffer</b> A reserved portion of RAM in which data is held temporarily, pending an
opportunity to complete its transfer to or from a storage device or another location in
memory.</p>

<p><a name="1076"></a><b>built-in groups</b> One of four kinds of group accounts used by Microsoft Windows NT and
Windows NT Server . Built-in groups, as the name implies, are included with the network
operating system. Built-in groups have been granted useful collections of rights and built-in
abilities. In most cases, a built-in group provides all the capabilities needed by a particular
user. For example, if a domain user account belongs to the built-in Administrators group,
logging on with that account gives a user administrative capabilities over the domain and the
servers in the domain. <i>See also</i> <a href="#1485">user account</a>.</p>

<p><a name="1077"></a><b>bulletin board system (BBS)</b> A computer system equipped with one or more modems or
other means of network access that serves as an information and message-passing center for
remote users. Many software and hardware companies run proprietary BBSs for customers that
include sales information, technical support, and software upgrades and patches.</p>

<p><a name="1078"></a><b>bus</b> Parallel wires or cabling that connect components in a computer.</p>

<p><a name="1079"></a><b>bus topology</b> A topology that connects each computer, or station, to a single cable.
At each end of the cable is a terminating resistor, or terminator. A transmission is passed
back and forth along the cable, past the stations and between the two terminators, carrying a
message from one end of the network to the other. As the message passes each station, the
station checks the message's destination address. If the address in the message matches the
station's address, the station receives the message. If the addresses do not match, the bus
carries the message to the next station, and so on.</p>

<p><a name="1080"></a><b>byte</b> A unit of information consisting of 8 bits. In computer processing or storage, a
byte is equivalent to a single character, such as a letter, numeral, or punctuation mark.
Because a byte represents only a small amount of information, amounts of computer memory are
usually given in kilobytes (1024 bytes or 2 raised to the 10th power), megabytes (1,048,576
bytes or 2 raised to the 20th power), gigabytes (1024 megabytes), terabytes (1024 gigabytes),
petabytes (1024 terabytes), or exabytes (1024 petabytes).</p>

<A NAME="850"><h2>C</h2></A>
<p><a name="1081"></a><b>cable categories</b> The three major groups of cabling that connect the majority of
networks: coaxial, twisted-pair (unshielded twisted-pair and shielded twisted-pair) and
fiber-optic cabling.</p>

<p><a name="1082"></a><b>cable tester</b> <i>See</i> <a href="#1012">advanced cable testers</a>.</p>

<p><a name="1083"></a><b>cache</b> A special memory subsystem or part of RAM in which frequently used data values
are duplicated for quick access. A memory cache stores the contents of frequently accessed RAM
locations and the addresses where these data items are stored. When the processor references an
address in memory, the cache checks to see whether it holds that address. If it does hold the
address, the data is returned to the processor; if it does not, a regular memory access occurs.
A cache is useful when RAM accesses are slow as compared to the microprocessor speed.</p>

<p><a name="1084"></a><b>carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) access method</b> An
access method by which each computer signals its intent to transmit before it actually
transmits data, thus avoiding possible transmission collisions. <i>See also</i> <a href="#1007">access method</a>.</p>

<p><a name="1085"></a><b>carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method</b> An
access method generally used with bus topologies. Using CSMA/CD, a station &quot;listens&quot;
to the physical medium to determine whether another station is currently transmitting a data
frame. If no other station is transmitting, the station sends its data. A station
&quot;listens&quot; to the medium by testing the medium for the presence of a carrier, a
specific level of voltage or light, thus the term carrier-sense. The multiple access indicates
that there are multiple stations attempting to access or put data on the cable at the same
time. The collision detection indicates that the stations are also listening for collisions. If
two stations attempt to transmit at the same time and a collision occurs, the stations must
wait a random period of time before attempting to transmit.</p>

standard, affect hardware connections.</p>

<p>Other standards govern data transmission, including the parameters and handshaking signals
such as XON/OFF used in asynchronous (typically, modem) communications, as well as such
data-coding methods as bit- and byte-oriented protocols. Still other protocols, such as the

which messages are passed around the stations on a LAN. Protocols represent attempts to ease
the complex process of enabling computers of different makes and models to communicate.

acknowledgments, flow control, and error control to ensure reliability. They can be either
temporary, lasting only as long as the conversation, or permanent, lasting as long as the users
keep the communications channel open.</p>

<p><a name="1491"></a><b>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</b> A set of computers on a public network such as the
Internet that communicate among themselves using encryption technology. In this way their
messages are as safe from being intercepted and understood by unauthorized users. VPNs operate
as if the computers were connected by private lines.</p>

<p><a name="1492"></a><b>virus</b> Bits of computer programming, or code, that hide in computer programs or on the
boot sector of storage devices such as hard-disk drives and floppy-disk drives. The primary
purpose of a virus is to reproduce itself as often as possible; a secondary purpose is to
disrupt the operation of the computer or the program.</p>

<p><a name="1494"></a><b>volume set</b> A collection of hard disk partitions that are treated as a single
partition, thus increasing the disk space available in a single drive letter. Volume sets are
created by combining between 2 and 32 areas of unformatted free space on one or more physical
drives. These spaces form one large logical volume set which is treated like a single
partition.</p>

<A NAME="871"><h2>X</h2></A>
<p><a name="1503"></a><b>X.25</b> A recommendation published by the CCITT that defines the connection between a
terminal and a packet-switching network. A packet-switching network routes packets whose
contents and format are controlled standards such as those defined in the X.25 recommendation.
X.25 incorporates three definitions: the electrical connection between the terminal and the
network, the transmission or link-access protocol, and the implementation of virtual circuits
between network users. Taken together, these definitions specify a synchronous, full-duplex
terminal-to-network connection. Packets transmitted in such a network can contain either data
or control commands. Packet format, error control, and other features are equivalent to
portions of the HDLC protocol defined by the ISO. X.25 standards are related to the lowest
three levels of the OSI reference model.</p>

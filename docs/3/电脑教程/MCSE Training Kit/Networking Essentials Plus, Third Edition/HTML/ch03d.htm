<A NAME="168"><h1>Lesson 3: Ethernet</h1></A>
<p>This lesson introduces the Ethernet network architecture. Over the years, Ethernet has
become the most popular media access method to the desktop computer and is used in both small
and large network environments. Ethernet is a nonproprietary industry standard that has found
wide acceptance by network hardware manufacturers. Problems related to using Ethernet hardware
products from different hardware manufacturers in a single network are nearly nonexistent. This
lesson presents an overview of the major Ethernet components, features, and functions.</p>

<A NAME="169"><h2>The Origin of Ethernet</h2></A>
<p>In the late 1960s, the University of Hawaii developed a WAN called ALOHA. (A WAN extends LAN
technology across a larger geographical area. For more information on WANs, see <A HREF="ch01a.htm#30">Chapter 1</A>,
&quot;Introduction to Networking.&quot;) The university occupied a wide area and sought to
connect computers that were spread throughout the campus. One of the key features of the
university's network was its use of CSMA/CD as the access method.</p>

<p>This early network was the foundation for today's <i>Ethernet</i> architecture. In 1972,
Robert Metcalfe and David Boggs invented a cabling and signaling scheme at the Xerox Palo Alto
Research Center (PARC) and in 1975 introduced the first Ethernet product. The original version
of Ethernet was designed as a system of 2.94 megabits per second (Mbps) to connect over 100
computers on a 1-kilometer (.62 miles) cable.</p>

<p>Xerox Ethernet was so successful that Xerox, Intel Corporation, and Digital Equipment
Corporation drew up a standard for a 10-Mbps Ethernet. Today, the 10-Mbps Ethernet is one of
several specifications describing methods for computers and data systems to connect and share
cabling.</p>

<A NAME="170"><h2>Ethernet Specifications</h2></A>
<p>Although networking standards are not discussed in detail until <a href="ch05a.htm">Chapter 5</a>, it is important
for you to be aware of them at this point. In 1978, the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) released a set of specifications for connecting dissimilar devices. This set of standards
is referred to as the <i>OSI reference model</i> (OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection). The
Ethernet specification performs the same functions as the OSI physical and data-link layers of
this model. As you will see later, these specifications affect how hardware links, or passes
information to and from, ISO standards. In the 1980s the IEEE published Project 802. This
project generated standards for design and compatibility for hardware components that operated
within the OSI physical and data-link layers. The standard that pertains to Ethernet is the
IEEE 802.3 specification.</p>

<A NAME="171"><h2>Ethernet Features</h2></A>
<p>Ethernet is currently the most popular network architecture. Figure 3.13 shows a simple
Ethernet bus network. Notice that the cable is terminated at both ends. This baseband
architecture uses a bus topology, usually transmits at 10 Mbps, and relies on CSMA/CD to
regulate traffic on the main cable segment.</p>

<p>The Ethernet media is passive, which means it requires no power source of its own and thus
will not fail unless the media is physically cut or improperly terminated.</p>

<A NAME="173"><h3>The Ethernet Frame Format</h3></A>
<p>Ethernet breaks data down into packages in a format that is different from the packets used
in other networks: Ethernet breaks data down into frames. (Remember that the terms
&quot;packet&quot; and &quot;frame&quot; can be used interchangeably; in the context of
Ethernet, the term &quot;frame&quot; is used.) A <i>frame</i> is a package of information
transmitted as a single unit. An Ethernet frame can be between 64 and 1518 bytes long, but the
Ethernet frame itself uses at least 18 bytes; therefore, the data in an Ethernet frame can be
between 46 and 1500 bytes long. Every frame contains control information and follows the same
basic organization.</p>

<p>For example, the Ethernet II frame, used for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
(TCP/IP), which gets transmitted across the network, consists of the sections listed in Table
3.3 (TCP/IP has become the de facto standard for data transmission over networks, including the
Internet):</p>

<p>Ethernet networks include a variety of cabling and topology alternatives. The remaining
sections of this lesson present these alternatives based on their IEEE specification.</p>

<A NAME="174"><h2>The 10-Mbps IEEE Standards</h2></A>
<p>This section looks at four 10 Mbps Ethernet topologies:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> 10BaseT</li></p>

<p><li> 10Base2</li></p>

<p><li> 10Base5</li></p>

<p><li> 10BaseFL</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="175"><h3>10BaseT Standard</h3></A>
<p>In 1990, the IEEE committee published the 802.3 specification for running Ethernet over
twisted-pair wiring. The result, <i>10BaseT</i> (10 Mbps, baseband, over twisted-pair cable),
is an Ethernet network that typically uses unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cable to connect
computers. Usually, 10BaseT employs UTP, but shielded twisted-pair (STP) cabling will also work
without changing any of the 10BaseT parameters.</p>

<p>Most networks of this type are configured in a star pattern, but internally they use a bus
signaling system like other Ethernet configurations. Figure 3.15 shows a multiport hub used to
extend an Ethernet LAN. Typically, the hub of a 10BaseT network serves as a multiport repeater
and often is located in a wiring closet of the building. Each computer is located at the
endpoint of a cable that is connected to the hub. Each computer has two pairs of wire; one pair
is used to receive data, and one pair is used to transmit data.</p>

<p>The maximum length of a 10BaseT segment is 100 meters (328 feet). Repeaters can be used to
extend this maximum cable length. The minimum cable length between computers is 2.5 meters
(about 8 feet). A 10BaseT LAN will serve 1024 computers.</p>

</p>


<p>Figure 3.16 shows how a 10BaseT solution provides the advantages of a star-wired topology.
The UTP cable features data transmission at 10 Mbps. It is easy to make changes by moving a
modular patch cord on the patch panel. A change at the patch panel will not affect other
devices on the network; this differs from a traditional Ethernet bus network.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 3.16</b> <i>A patch panel makes moving computers easy</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>Patch panels should be tested for rates higher than 10 Mbps. The latest hubs can provide
connections for both thick and thin Ethernet cable segments. In this implementation, it is also
easy to convert thick Ethernet cable to 10BaseT cable by attaching a mini 10BaseT transceiver
to the AUI port of any network interface card. Table 3.4 summarizes 10BaseT specifications:</p>

<A NAME="176"><h3>10Base2 Standard</h3></A>
<p>Another topology is <i>10Base2,</i> given this name in the IEEE 802.3 specification because
it transmits at 10 Mbps over a baseband wire and can carry a signal about two times 100 meters
(the actual distance is 185 meters, or 607 feet).</p>

<p>This type of network uses thin coaxial cable, or thinnet, which has a maximum segment length
of 185 meters (607 feet) and a minimum cable length of at least 0.5 meters (20 inches) between
workstations. There is also a 30-computer maximum per 185-meter segment.</p>

<p>Thinnet cabling components include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> BNC barrel connectors.</li></p>

<p><li> BNC T connectors.</li></p>

<p><li> BNC terminators.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Thinnet networks generally use a local bus topology. IEEE standards for thinnet do not allow
a transceiver cable to be used from the bus T connector to a computer. Instead, a T connector
fits directly on the NIC.</p>

<p>A BNC barrel connector may be used to connect thinnet cable segments together, thus
extending a length of cable. For example, if you need a length of cable that is nine meters (30
feet) long, but all you have is a 7.5-meter (25-foot) length and a 1.5-meter ( 5-foot) length
of thinnet cable, you can join the two cable segments together using a BNC barrel connector.
However, the use of barrel connectors should be kept to a minimum because each connection in
the cable reduces the signal quality and adds to the risk of cable separation and
disconnection.</p>

<p>A thinnet network is an economical way to support a small department or workgroup. The cable
used for this type of network is:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Relatively inexpensive.</li></p>

<p><li> Easy to install.</li></p>

<p><li> Easy to configure.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>A single thinnet network can support a maximum of 30 nodes (computers and repeaters) per
cable segment, as per the IEEE 802.3 specification.</p>

<p><b>The 5-4-3 Rule</b></p>

<p>A thinnet network can combine as many as five cable segments connected by four repeaters;
but only three segments can have stations attached. Thus, two segments are untapped and are
often referred to as &quot;inter-repeater links.&quot; This is known as the <i>5-4-3
rule</i>.</p>

<p>In Figure 3.17, there are five segments, four repeaters, and trunk segments 1, 2, and 5 are
populated (have computers attached to them). Trunk segments 3 and 4 exist only to increase the
total length of the network and to allow the computers on trunk segments 1 and 5 to be on the
same network.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 3.17</b> <i>The thinnet 5-4-3 rule: 5 segments, 4 repeaters, and 3 populated segments</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>Because normal Ethernet limits are too confining for a large business, repeaters can be used
to join Ethernet segments and extend the network to a total length of 925 meters (3035 feet).

<A NAME="177"><h3>10Base5 Standard</h3></A>
<p>The IEEE specification for this topology is 10 Mbps, baseband, and 500-meter (five
100-meter) segments. It is also called <i>standard Ethernet</i>.</p>

<p>This topology makes use of thick coaxial cable (see Figure 3.18), also known as thicknet.
Thicknet generally uses a bus topology and can support as many as 100 nodes (stations,
repeaters, and so on) per backbone segment. The backbone, or trunk segment, is the main cable
from which transceiver cables are connected to stations and repeaters. The distances and
tolerances for thicknet are greater than those for thinnet: a thicknet segment can be 500
meters (1640 feet) long for a total network length of 2500 meters (8200 feet).</p>

<p>The thicknet cabling components include:</p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Transceivers</b> These are devices that can both transmit and receive, provide
communications between the computer and the main LAN cable, and are located in the vampire taps
attached to the cable.</li>

<p><li><b>Transceiver cables</b> The transceiver cable (drop cable) connects the transceiver to the NIC.</li></p>

<p><li><b>DIX (or AUI) connectors</b> These are the connectors on the transceiver cable.</li></p>

<li> <b>N-series connectors, including N-series barrel connectors, and N-series

<p><b>The 5-4-3 Rule in Thicknet</b></p>

<p>One thicknet Ethernet network can have a maximum of five backbone segments connected using
repeaters (based on the IEEE 802.3 specification), of which up to three can accommodate
computers. Figure 3.20 shows how the 5-4-3 rules are applied to thicknet. The length of the
transceiver cables is not used to measure the distance supported on the thicknet cable; only
the end-to-end length of the thicknet cable segment itself is used.</p>

<A NAME="178"><h3>Combining Thicknet and Thinnet Cable</h3></A>
<p>It is common for larger networks to combine thick and thin Ethernet cable. Thicknet cable is
good for backbones, while thinnet cable is used for branch segments. What this means is that
the thicknet cable is the main cable covering the long distances. As described in <A HREF="ch02a.htm">Chapter 2</A>,
&quot;Basic Network Media,&quot; thicknet cable has a larger copper core and can, therefore,
carry signals for a longer distance than thinnet. The transceiver attaches to the thicknet
cable, and the transceiver cable's AUI connector plugs into a repeater. The branching
segments of thinnet plug into the repeater and connect the computers to the network.</p>

<A NAME="179"><h3>10BaseFL Standard</h3></A>
<p>The IEEE committee published a specification for running Ethernet over fiber-optic cable.
The result, <i>10BaseFL</i> (10Mbps, baseband, over fiber-optic cable) is an Ethernet network
that typically uses fiber-optic cable to connect computers and repeaters.</p>

<p>The primary reason for using 10BaseFL is to accommodate long cable runs between repeaters,
such as between buildings. The maximum distance for a 10BaseFL segment is 2000 meters (about
6500 feet).</p>

<A NAME="180"><h2>The 100-Mbps IEEE Standards</h2></A>
<p>New Ethernet standards are pushing the traditional Ethernet limits beyond the original 10
Mbps. These new capabilities are being developed to handle such highbandwidth applications
as:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Computer-aided design (CAD).</li></p>

<p><li> Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM).</li></p>

<p><li> Video.</li></p>

<p><li> Imaging and document storage.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Two Ethernet standards that can meet the increased demands are:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> 100BaseVG-AnyLAN Ethernet.</li></p>

<p><li> 100BaseX Ethernet (Fast Ethernet).</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Both 100BaseVG-AnyLAN and Fast Ethernet are about 5 to 10 times faster than standard
Ethernet. They are also compatible with existing 10BaseT cabling systems. This means they allow
for Plug and Play upgrades from existing 10BaseT installations.</p>

<A NAME="181"><h3>100VG-AnyLAN Standard</h3></A>
<p>The <i>100VG (Voice Grade) AnyLAN</i> is an emerging networking technology that combines
elements of both Ethernet and Token Ring architectures. Originally developed by
Hewlett-Packard, it is currently being refined and ratified by the IEEE 802.12 committee. The
802.12 specification is a standard for transmitting 802.3 Ethernet frames and 802.5 Token Ring
packets.</p>

<p>This technology goes by any of the following names, all of which refer to the same type of
network:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> 100VG-AnyLAN</li></p>

<p><li> 100BaseVG</li></p>

<p><li> VG</li></p>

<p><li> AnyLAN</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Specifications</b></p>

<p>Some of the current 100VG-AnyLAN specifications include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> A minimum data rate of 100 Mbps.</li></p>

<p><li>The ability to support a cascaded star topology over Category 3, 4, and 5 twisted-pair and fiber-optic cable.</li></p>

<p><li>The demand-priority access method that allows for two priority levels (low and high).</li></p>

<p><li>The ability to support an option for filtering individually addressed frames at the hub to enhance privacy.</li></p>

<p><li> Support for both Ethernet frames and Token Ring packets.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Topology</b></p>

<p>A 100VG-AnyLAN network is built on a star topology in which all computers are attached to a
hub. Figure 3.21 shows a parent hub with five child hubs. Adding child hubs to the central hub
can expand the network. The child hubs act as computers to their parent hubs. The parent hubs
control transmission of computers attached to their children.</p>


<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F03xx21x.htm')"> <img src="images/F03xx21.JPG" width=404 height=231 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 3.21</b> <i>Parent hub with five attached child hubs</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p><b>Considerations</b></p>

<p>This topology requires its own hubs and cards. Also, the cable distances of 100BaseVG are
limited when compared to 10BaseVG and other implementations of Ethernet. The longest cable from
the 100BaseVG hub to a computer cannot exceed 250 meters (about 820 feet). Extending this limit
requires special equipment used to expand the size of a LAN. These cable-length limits mean
that 100BaseVG will require more wiring closets than 10BaseVG.</p>

<A NAME="182"><h3>100BaseX Ethernet Standard</h3></A>
<p>This standard, sometimes called <i>Fast Ethernet</i>, is an extension of the existing
Ethernet standard. It runs on UTP Category 5 data-grade cable and uses CSMA/CD in a star-wired
bus topology, similar to 10BaseT where all cables are attached to a hub.</p>

<p><b>Media Specifications</b></p>

<p>100BaseX incorporates three media specifications:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> 100BaseT4 (4-pair Category 3, 4, or 5 UTP)</li></p>

<p><li> 100BaseTX (2-pair Category 5 UTP or STP)</li></p>

<p><li> 100BaseFX (2-strand fiber-optic cable)</li></p>
</ul>

<p>These media are described further in Table 3.7:</p>

<A NAME="183"><h2>Performance Considerations</h2></A>
<p>Ethernet architecture can use multiple communication protocols and can connect mixed
computing environments such as Netware, UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.</p>

<A NAME="184"><h3>Segmentation</h3></A>
<p>Ethernet performance can be improved by dividing a crowded segment into two less-populated
segments and joining them with either a bridge or a router. Bridges and routers are discussed
later in more detail in <A HREF="ch07a.htm">Chapter 7</A>, &quot;Elements of Network Connectivity.&quot; Figure 3.22
shows how a bridge is used to extend a network. This reduces traffic on each segment. Because
fewer computers are attempting to transmit onto the segment, access time improves.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 3.22</b> <i>Using a bridge to segment a network and reduce network traffic</i><!--/caption-->
</p>


<p>Consider dividing segments if large numbers of new users are joining the network or if new,
high-bandwidth applications, such as database or video programs, are being added to the
network.</p>

<A NAME="185"><h3>Network Operating Systems on Ethernet</h3></A>
<p>Ethernet will work with most popular network operating systems including:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows 2000.</li></p>

<p><li> Microsoft Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server.</li></p>

<p><li> Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional and Windows 2000 Server.</li></p>

<p><li> Microsoft LAN Manager.</li></p>

<p><li> Microsoft Windows for Workgroups.</li></p>

<p><li> Novell NetWare.</li></p>

<p><li> IBM LAN Server.</li></p>

<p><li> AppleShare.</li></p>

<p><li> UNIX.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="186"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>The following points summarize the main elements of this lesson:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Ethernet is one of the most popular network architectures.</li></p>

<p><li>Ethernet is governed by the specifications found in the OSI reference model physical layer and data-link layer, as well as IEEE 802.3.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Table 3.8 summarizes the specifications for Ethernet architecture discussed in this lesson.
It outlines the minimum set of standards required to conform to IEEE specifications. A
particular implementation of the network architecture may differ from the information in the
table.</p>

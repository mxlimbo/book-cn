<A NAME="708"><h1>Lesson 3: Where to Find Help</h1></A>
<p>If a network problem is beyond the scope of the administrator's knowledge, it is爐ime to
seek outside help. Assistance can be sought from coworkers, sources providing CD-based
information, or online. Knowing where to locate the best information resources will help speed
up the problem-solving process.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to:</b> </p>

<ul>
<p><li> Describe sources for network troubleshooting information.</li></p>

<p><li> Identify which source is best to help solve a given problem.</li></p>

<p><li> Identify Internet services that offer network-troubleshooting support.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 30 minutes</b> </p>

<A NAME="709"><h2>Network Support Resources</h2></A>
<p>It is as important to know when and where to get support in resolving network problems as it
is to give support to others. With the proliferation of hardware, software, protocols, and
standards, it is impossible for any network administrator to know everything. This is
especially true with the constant product changes being made by network manufacturers and
suppliers. Network support resources can be爁ound in a wide range of locations&#8212;from
coworkers, manufacturer and vendor help desks to CD-based technical references. Software
products, online support services, print materials, and telephone-based support services offer
additional resources. Obtaining access to several resources is th0e key to successful network
troubleshooting.</p>

<A NAME="710"><h2>TechNet</h2></A>
<p>Microsoft Technical Information Network (TechNet) provides information to support all
aspects of networking with an emphasis on Microsoft products. Figure 13.4 shows a sample of a
TechNet screen. With Microsoft KnowledgeBase you can find up-do-date articles on many topics
and learn about the latest software releases, updates, and revisions.</p>

<A NAME="711"><h3>Installing TechNet</h3></A>
<p>TechNet's compact disc installs just like any other program. When installed, it燼dds
icons to the appropriate program group for easy access.</p>

<p>There are several methods of locating the information you need on TechNet. The燭echNet Find
tool is an efficient choice. Refer to the Help menu on the CD for more information on using the
various features of TechNet.</p>

<A NAME="712"><h3>Subscribing to TechNet</h3></A>
<p>On-line information about Microsoft TechNet can be found at: 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/subscription/about.htm" target="_window2">www.microsoft.com/technet/subscription/about.htm</a>.</p>

<p>The on-line version of TechNet can be found at: 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/" target="_window2">www.microsoft.com/technet/</a></p>

<p>You can subscribe to TechNet by calling: 
(800) 344-2121</p>

<A NAME="713"><h2>Bulletin Board System (BBS)</h2></A>
<p>Numerous electronic bulletin board systems (BBS) exist that are devoted to technical
subjects such as networking. You can access the knowledge of experienced networking
professionals by posting troubleshooting questions to them. Once very popular, BBS use is
diminishing and is being replaced by the Internet and the Web, discussed later in this
lesson.</p>

<A NAME="714"><h2>User Groups</h2></A>
<p>User groups are a good source of information. There is a wealth of knowledge available at
group meetings. Some meetings are held online; for others, groups meet in person. User groups
tend to be organized around a particular operating system or hardware platform.</p>

<p>The local addresses or Internet addresses for user groups can be found online or listed on
the premises of local computer businesses. Joining a local user group can be beneficial,
allowing you to establish a link to colleagues in your area. Through these contacts, you can
learn how others have solved problems resembling yours, as well as problems you have not yet
encountered.</p>

<A NAME="715"><h2>Periodicals</h2></A>
<p>Networking technology is in a constant state of evolution. There are many books available on
networking, but they quickly become outdated. Network industry periodicals are often a better
resource because they provide you with the most current information available. Many periodicals
and related resources are also available through the Internet.</p>

<p><i>LAN Magazine</i>, published monthly, features a regular section called
&quot;Tutorial.&quot; Each tutorial focuses on an important network topic and presents it as an
instructional guide to the subject rather than as a news story.</p>

<p>It can be helpful to maintain a catalog of articles from various periodicals. Cut out or
copy articles from the periodical, assign them an identification number, and store them in a
notebook. Then, using a simple database program, create an爄ndex of identification numbers,
subjects, and key words. The next time you encounter a problem, you can search the database and
then retrieve the article.</p>

<A NAME="716"><h2>The Internet: A Worldwide Resource</h2></A>
<p>The Internet is a source of a wide selection of information that can help those responsible
for network&#8212;network administrators or support engineers&#8212;to perform their jobs. The
Internet gives users access to information ranging from the latest technologies to product
information to troubleshooting help.</p>

<A NAME="717"><h3>Internet Overview</h3></A>
<p>The Internet is a worldwide collection of networks, gateways, servers, and computers linked
together using a common set of telecommunications protocols. The Internet provides worldwide
access to vast stores of information resources that are easily accessible from universities,
government organizations, the military, libraries, and other private and public
organizations.</p>

<p>The Internet evolved from a U.S. Department of Defense project, the Advanced Research
Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), which was designed as a test for packet-switching networks.
The protocol used for ARPANET was TCP/IP, which continues to be used on the Internet today.</p>

<A NAME="718"><h3>Internet Services</h3></A>
<p>Today the Internet is growing tremendously along with the services it provides. Some of the
best-known services available on the Internet today include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> The World Wide Web (WWW).</li></p>

<p><li> File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers.</li></p>

<p><li> Electronic mail.</li></p>

<p><li> News.</li></p>

<p><li> Telnet.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>The World Wide Web</b></p>

<p>The World Wide Web (the Web) contains a vast storehouse of hypertext documents written using
the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Extensible Markup Language (XML), and Standard
Generalized Markup Language (SGML), among others. Hypertext is a method for presenting text,
images, sound, and videos that are linked together in a nonsequential web of associations. The
hypertext format allows the user to browse through topics in any order. Internet tools and
protocols help to locate and transport resources between computers.</p>

<p>Most of today's network and electronics manufacturers maintain Web sites. While the
primary function of these sites is to promote sales, most also offer connections to various
levels of technical support. At the very least, a good corporate Web site will have:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> FAQs (Frequently asked questions and answers).</li></p>

<p><li> Updated technical information about their products.</li></p>

<p><li> Updated software drivers (if their products use them).</li></p>

<p><li> E-mail addresses to which users can write to get answers to questions.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Some of the better sites will contain a complete, searchable knowledge base. Within this
database is technical information collected about present and past products.</p>

<p>Becoming familiar with the Web sites of network manufacturers can greatly expand your
resources for network maintenance, upgrading, and troubleshooting.</p>

<p><b>Domain Name System (DNS)</b></p>

<p>Every computer on the Internet has a unique IP address. The IP address is four sets of
digits separated by dots (such as 198.46.8.34).</p>

<p>Because these strings of numbers are hard to remember and difficult to accurately type, the
domain name system (DNS) was created. Domain names enable short, alphabetical names to be
assigned to IP addresses to describe where a computer is located. In the example,
http://www.microsoft.com, the domain name is www.microsoft.com. A Web site with a recognizable
or memorable name will receive more hits than a site with an unimaginative name. Domain names
can represent the corporate identity, as is the case with Amazon.com, or become part of it, as
is the case with cnn.com.</p>

<p>In Microsoft Windows NT Server the HOSTS and LMHOSTS files are configuration files that are responsible for name resolution. The HOSTS file resolves host names to IP addresses, and the LMHOSTS file resolves NetBIOS names to IP addresses. Both are ASCII files that can be edited with Microsoft Notepad or any other plain-text editor.

<p>The last three characters of the DNS or UNC address indicate the type of domain.</p>

<p>Examples of domain types common in the United States include the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Commercial organizations:.com</li></p>

<p><li> Educational institutions:.edu</li></p>

<p><li> Governmental organizations (except the military):.gov</li></p>

<p><li> Military organizations:.mil</li></p>

<p><li> Network service providers:.net</li></p>

<p><li> Organizations (such as nonprofit groups):.org</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Examples of international domain designations include the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Australia:.au</li></p>

<p><li> France:.fr</li></p>

<p><li> United Kingdom:.uk</li></p>

<p><li> United States:.us</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Internet Names</b></p>

<p>Every resource on the Internet has its own location identifier or Uniform Resource Locator
(URL). The URLs specify the server to access as well as the access method and the location.</p>

<p>A URL consists of several parts. The simplest version contains:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> The protocol to be used.</li></p>

<p><li> A colon.</li></p>

<p><li> The address of the resource.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>The address begins with two forward slashes. Aside from using forward slashes rather than
backslashes, this is very similar to the universal naming convention (UNC) format. The address
below is the entry for accessing the Microsoft World Wide Web server. The &quot;http:&quot;
indicates the protocol you use. The rest of the entry, 
//www.microsoft.com, is the address of the computer.</p>

<p>http://www.microsoft.com</p>

<p>The entry below shows how to access the Microsoft FTP server. In this case, you燼re using
the FTP protocol.</p>

<p>ftp://ftp.microsoft.com</p>

<p><b>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</b></p>

<p>The most common protocol used for sending files between computers is the File Transfer
Protocol (FTP). FTP support is one method of supporting remote networks. FTP servers can
provide vast amounts of information stored as files. The data in these files cannot be accessed
directly; instead, the entire file must be transferred from the FTP server to the local
computer. This file-transfer program is for TCP/IP environments and is implemented at the
Application layer of the OSI reference model.</p>

<p>FTP allows for transferring both text and binary files. Figure 13.5 shows a client screen
for FTP.</p>

<p><b>Notational Conventions</b></p>

<ul>

<p><li> Characters or commands that you type appear in <b>bold lowercase</b> type.</li></p>

<p><li> <i>Italic</i> in syntax statements indicates placeholders for variable information. <i>Italic</i> is also used for book titles.</li></p>

<p><li> Names of files appear in Title Caps, except when you are to type them directly. Unless otherwise indicated, you can use all lowercase letters when you type a filename in a dialog box or at a command prompt.</li></p>

<p>
	<table valign="top" cellpadding="5" width="95%">

		<tr>
			<th>Icon</th>
			<th>Represents</th>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><img src="images/practic.JPG" width=92 height=74 border="0"></td>
			<td valign="top">A hands-on practice. You should perform the practice to give 
 yourself an opportunity to use the skills being presented in

		</tr>
		
	</table>
</p>


</ul>

<p><b>Keyboard Conventions</b></p>

<ul>

<p><li> A plus sign (+) between two key names means that you must press those keys at the same time. For example, &quot;Press Alt+Tab&quot; means that you hold down Alt while you press Tab.</li></p>

<p><li> A comma ( , ) between two or more key names means that you must press each of the keys consecutively, not together. For example, &quot;Press Alt, F, X&quot; means that you press and release each key in sequence. &quot;Press Alt+W, L&quot; means that you first press Alt and W together, and then release them and press L.</li></p>

<p><li> You can choose menu commands with the keyboard. Press the Alt key to activate the menu bar, and then sequentially press the keys that correspond to the highlighted or underlined letter of the menu name and the command name. For some commands, you can also press a key combination listed in the menu.</li></p>

<p><li> You can select or clear check boxes or option buttons in dialog boxes with the keyboard. Press Tab until the option is highlighted, and then press the spacebar to select or clear the check box or option button.</li></p>

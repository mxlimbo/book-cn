<A NAME="518"><h1>Lesson 1: Locating Active Directory Objects</h1></A>
<p>Active Directory stores information about objects on the network. Each object is a distinct, named set of attributes that represents a specific network entity. Active Directory is designed to provide information to queries about directory objects from both users and programs. In this lesson you will learn how to use Find (located in the Active Directory Users and Computers console) to locate Active Directory objects.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>

<p><li> Identify the types of Active Directory objects</li></p>

<p><li> Use Find to locate any type of Active Directory object</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 15 minutes</b></p>

</blockquote></div>
</p>


<A NAME="519"><h2>Understanding Common Active Directory Objects</h2></A>
<p>Adding new resources to your network creates new Active Directory objects that represent these resources. You should be familiar with some of the common Active Directory objects. Table 11.1 describes the most common object types that you can add to Active Directory.</p>

<p><b>Table 11.1</b> <i>Common Object Types and Their Contents</i></p>

		</tr>

		<tr>

			<td valign="top">The information that allows a user to log on to Windows 2000, such as user logon name. This information also has many optional fields including first name, last name, display name, telephone number, e-mail, and home page.</td>

Shared folders and printers exist in the registry of a computer. When you publish a shared folder in Active Directory, you are creating an object that contains a pointer to the shared folder.</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td valign="top">Printer</td>
			<td valign="top">A pointer to a printer on a computer. You must manually publish a printer on a computer that is not in Active Directory. Microsoft Windows 2000 automatically adds printers that you create on domain computers to Active Directory.</td>

			<td valign="top">The information about a computer that is a member of the domain.</td>

			<td valign="top">Organizational Unit (OU)</td>
			<td valign="top">Contains other objects, including other OUs. Used to organize Active Directory objects.</td>

</p>


<A NAME="520"><h2>Using Find</h2></A>
<p>To locate Active Directory objects, open the Active Directory Users and Computers console located in the Administrative Tools folder. Then right-click a domain or a container in the console tree and click Find. The Find dialog box provides options that allow you to search the global catalog to locate Active Directory objects (see Figure 11.1). The Find dialog box helps you create an LDAP query that will be executed against the directory or a specific OU. The global catalog contains a partial replica of the Entire Directory, so it stores information about every object in a domain tree or forest. Because the global catalog contains information about every object, a user can find information regardless of which domain in the tree or forest contains the data. Active Directory automatically generates the contents of the global catalog from the domains that make up the directory.</p>

<A NAME="521"><h2>Practice: Searching Active Directory</h2></A>
<p>In this practice you search Active Directory for objects based on search criteria that you provide. First, you create user accounts for the practice. Then you find a user's account based on his or her primary phone number, and finally you find a printer that is able to staple the pages it prints.</p>

<p>
<div class="warning"><blockquote><b>IMPORTANT</b><hr>
You need to have a local printer installed on your computer. However, you do <i>not</i> need a printing device connected to the computer. If you do not have a local printer installed, create one now. Remember that <i>printing device</i> refers to the physical machine that prints and that <i>local printer</i> refers to the software that Windows 2000 needs to send data to the printing device.
</blockquote></div>

<p><li> Log on to your domain as Administrator, then open the Active Directory Users and Computers console.</li></p>

<p><li> In the console tree, click Users.</li></p>

<p><li> On the Action menu, point to New, then click User.</li></p>

<p>Notice that the New Object-User dialog box shows that the new user account is being created in the Users folder of your domain.</p>

<A NAME="522"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>In this lesson you learned that common Active Directory objects include user accounts, contacts, groups, shared folders, printers, computers, domain controllers, and OUs. You learned to locate objects by starting the Active Directory Users and Computers console, right-clicking an object within a domain in the console tree, and clicking Find. The Find dialog box provides fields that allow you to search for Active Directory objects.</p>

<p>In the practice portion of this lesson you searched Active Directory for objects based on search criteria you specified.</p>

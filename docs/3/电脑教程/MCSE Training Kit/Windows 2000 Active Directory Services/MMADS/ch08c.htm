<A NAME="375"><h1>Lesson 2: Planning a Group Strategy</h1></A>
<p>To use groups effectively, you need a strategy for using the different group scopes. This lesson presents a strategy for implementing global, domain local, and universal groups.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b> 

<ul>
<p><li> Describe the steps of a sound implementation strategy</li></p>

<p><li> Plan a group strategy</li></p>
</ul>

<b>Estimated lesson time: 30 minutes</b> 
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="376"><h2>Planning Global and Domain Local Groups</h2></A>
<p>It is important to have a group strategy in place before you create groups. The recommended method is to use global and domain local groups. When you plan to use global and domain local groups, use the following strategy:</p>

<ol>
<p><li> <b>Assign users with common job responsibilities to global groups.</b> Identify users with common job responsibilities and add the user accounts to a global group. For example, in an accounting department, add user accounts for all accountants to a global group called Accounting.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Create a domain local group for resources to be shared.</b> Identify the resources or group of resources, such as related files or printers, to which users need access and then create a domain local group for that resource. For example, if you have a number of color printers in your company, create a domain local group called Color Printers.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Add global groups that need access to the resources to the domain local group.</b> Identify all global groups that share the same access needs for resources and make them members of the appropriate domain local group. For example, add the global groups Accounting, Sales, and Management to the domain local group Color Printers.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Assign resource permissions to the domain local group.</b> Assign the required permissions for the resource to the domain local group. For example, assign the necessary permissions to use color printers to the Color Printers group. Users in the Accounting, Sales, and Management global groups receive the required permissions because their global group is a member of the domain local group Color Printers.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>Figure 8.3 illustrates the strategy for using groups: Place user accounts into global groups, create a domain local group for a group of resources to be shared in common, place the global groups into the domain local group, and then assign permissions to the domain local group. This strategy gives you the most flexibility for growth and reduces permissions assignments.</p>

</p>


<p>Some of the possible limitations of other strategies include the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Placing user accounts in domain local groups and assigning permissions to the domain local groups.</b> This strategy does not allow you to assign permissions for resources outside of the domain. This strategy reduces the flexibility when your network grows.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Placing user accounts in global groups and assigning permissions to the global groups.</b> This strategy can complicate administration when you are using multiple domains. If global groups from multiple domains require the same permissions, you have to assign permissions for each global group.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="377"><h2>Using Universal Groups</h2></A>
<p>When you plan to use universal groups, follow these guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Use universal groups to give users access to resources that are located in more than one domain. Unlike domain local groups, you can assign permissions to universal groups for resources in any domain in your network. For example, if executives need access to printers throughout your network, you can create a universal group for this purpose and assign it permissions for using printers on print servers in all domains.</li></p>

<p><li> Use universal groups only when their membership is static. In a domain tree, universal groups can cause excessive network traffic between domain controllers whenever you change membership for the universal group because changes to the membership of universal groups may be replicated to a larger number of domain controllers.</li></p>

<p><li> Add global groups from several domains to a universal group, and then assign permissions for access to a resource to the universal group. This allows you to use a universal group in the same way as domain local groups to assign permissions for resources. However, unlike a domain local group, you can assign permissions to a universal group to give users access to a resource that is located in any domain.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="378"><h2>Practice: Planning New Group Accounts</h2></A>
<p>In this practice you plan the groups that are required for a business scenario.</p>

<A NAME="379"><h3>Scenario</h3></A>
<p>You are an administrator for the customer service division of a manufacturing company. You administer a domain that is part of your company's domain tree. You do not administer other domains, but you may have to give selected user accounts from other domains access to resources in your domain. Users at the company use several shared network resources. The company is also planning to implement an e-mail program that uses Active Directory.</p>

<p>As the administrator, you must determine the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Which groups are needed.</li></p>
<p><li> The membership of each group. This can be user accounts or other groups.</li></p>
<p><li> The type and scope for each group.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Record your planning strategies on the Group Planning Worksheet. Follow these instructions to complete the worksheet:</p>

<ol>
<p><li> On the worksheet, provide a name for each group. Record each name in the Group Name column.</li></p>

<p><li> Specify type and scope of the group.</li></p>

<p><li> List the members of the group.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>After completing the exercise, turn to <a href="chaaa.htm#1022">Appendix A</a>, Chapter 8 and compare your worksheet to the sample provided. The sample presents only one set of possible answers. You may have planned your accounts differently.</p>

<p>Table 8.2 provides the job function and number of employees in each job function in the customer service division.</p>

<ol>
<p><li> Does your network require local groups?</li></p>

<p><li> Does your network require universal groups?</li></p>

<p><li> Sales representatives at the company frequently visit the company headquarters and other divisions. Therefore, you need to give sales representatives with user accounts in other domains the same permissions for resources that sales representatives in your domain have. You also want to make it easy for administrators in other domains to assign permissions to sales representatives in your domain. How can you accomplish this?</li></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="381"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>In this lesson you learned a couple of common group strategies. The group strategy you choose depends on your Windows 2000 network environment. In a single domain, the best strategy is to use global and domain local groups to assign permissions to network resources, and this is Microsoft's recommendation for most Windows 2000 installations.</p>

<p>You also learned that the strategy for using global and domain local groups is to place user accounts into global groups. You then create a domain local group for a group of resources to be shared in common, and place the global groups into the domain local group. Finally, you assign permissions to the domain local group. This strategy gives you the most flexibility for growth and reduces permissions assignments.</p>

<A NAME="314"><h2>Creating Domain User Accounts</h2></A>
<p>Using the Active Directory Users and Computers console (illustrated in Figure 7.4), you create, delete, or disable domain user accounts on the domain controller, or local user accounts on any computer in the domain.</p>

<p>When you create the domain user account, the user logon name defaults to the domain in which you are creating the domain user account. However, you can select any domain in which you have permissions to create domain user accounts. You must select the container in which to create the new account. You can create the domain user account in the default Users container or in a container that you create to hold domain user accounts.</p>

<p><li><b> To create domain user accounts</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li> Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, then click Active Directory Users And Computers.</li></p>

<p><li> Click the domain, right-click the Users container, point to New, and click User.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
In a live system environment, the Users container is merely a default container. Actual users should be added to a custom OU rather than the Users container.</blockquote></div>

<p>The following procedure outlines the steps that are required to create the first user account using the Active Directory Users and Computers console. After you have created the first user account, follow the same steps to create the remaining user accounts.</p>

<p><li><b> To create a domain user account</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li> Log on as Administrator.</li></p>

<p><li> Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, then click Active Directory Users And Computers.</li></p>

<p>Windows 2000 displays the Active Directory Users and Computers console.</p>

<p><li> Expand microsoft.com (if you did not use Microsoft as your domain name, expand your domain), and then double-click Users.</li></p>

<p>In the details pane, notice the default user accounts.</p>

<p>Which user accounts does the Active Directory Installation Wizard create by default?</p>

<p><li> Right-click Users, point to New, then click User.</li></p>

<p>Windows 2000 displays the New Object-User dialog box.</p>

<p>Where in the Active Directory will the new user account be created?</p>

<p><li> Type <b>User</b> in the First Name box.</li></p>

<p><li> Type <b>One</b> in the Last Name box.</li></p>

<p>Notice that Windows 2000 completes the Full Name box for you.</p>

<p><li> Type <b>user1</b> in the User Logon Name box.</li></p>

<p><li> In the list to the right of the User Logon Name box, select @microsoft.com. (The domain name will vary if you did not use microsoft.com as your DNS domain name.)</li></p>

<p>The user logon name, combined with the domain name in the box that appears to the right of the User Logon Name box, is the user's full Internet logon name. This name uniquely identifies the user throughout the directory (for example, user1@microsoft.com).</p>

<p>Notice that Windows 2000 completes the pre-Windows 2000 logon name box for you.</p>

<p>When is the pre-Windows 2000 logon name used?</p>

<p><li> Click Next to continue.</li></p>

<p>Windows 2000 displays the New Object-User dialog box, prompting you to supply password options and restrictions.</p>

<p><li> In the Password box and the Confirm Password box, type the password or leave these boxes blank if you are not assigning a password.</li></p>

<p>If you enter a password, notice that the password is displayed as asterisks as you type. This prevents onlookers from viewing the password as it is entered.</p>

<p><li> Specify whether or not the user can change his or her password.</li></p>

<p>What are the results of selecting both the User Must Change Password At Next Logon check box and the User Cannot Change Password check box? Explain.</p>

<p>Under what circumstances would you select the Account Is Disabled check box when creating a new user account?</p>

<p><li> After you have selected the appropriate password options, click Next.</li></p>

<p>Windows 2000 displays the New Object-User dialog box, displaying the options and restrictions that you have configured for this user account.</p>

<p><li> Verify that the user account options are correct, then click Finish.</li></p>

</ol>

<A NAME="317"><h2>User Account Properties</h2></A>
<p>A set of default properties is associated with each user account that you create. After you create a user account you can configure personal and account properties, logon options, and dial-in settings. For domain users, these account properties equate to object attributes.</p>

<p>You can use the properties that you define for a domain user account to search for users in the directory or for use in other applications as objects' attributes. For this reason, you should provide detailed definitions for each domain user 
account that you create.</p>

<p>The tabs in the Properties dialog box (see Figure 7.6) contain information about each user account. Table 7.10 describes the tabs in the Properties dialog box.</p>

<A NAME="320"><h2>Setting Logon Hours</h2></A>
<p>Set logon hours to control when a user can log on to the domain. Restricting logon hours limits the hours that users can explore the network. By default, Windows 2000 permits access for all hours on all days. You might want to allow users to log on only during working hours. Setting logon hours reduces the amount of time that the account is open to unauthorized access.</p>

<p><li><b> To set logon hours</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li> In the Properties dialog box, on the Account tab, click Logon Hours.</li></p>

<p>On the Logon Hours dialog box for the user, a blue box indicates that the user can log on during the hour. A white box indicates that the user cannot log on (see Figure 7.8).</p>

<p><li> To allow or deny access, do one of the following:</li></p>


<ul>
<p><li> Select the rectangles on the days and hours for which you want to allow access, click the start time, drag to the end time, and then click Logon Permitted.</li></p>

<p><li> Select the rectangles on the days and hours for which you want to deny access, click the start time, drag to the end time, and then click Logon Denied.</li></p>

<p><li value="3"> Click OK.</li></p>

<p>It is important that you remember that any connections to network resources on the domain are not disconnected when the user's logon hours run out. However, the user will not be able to make any new connections.</p>

<p>Setting logon options for a domain user account allows you to control the computers from which a user can log on to the domain. By default, each user can log on from all computers in the domain. Setting the computers from which a user can log on prevents users from accessing another user's data that is stored on that user's computer.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
To control the computers from which a user can log on to a domain, NetBIOS must be enabled over TCP/IP.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p><li><b> To set logon workstations</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li> In the Properties dialog box, on the Account tab, click Log On To.</li></p>

<p><li> On the Logon Workstations dialog box (see Figure 7.9), select the option that specifies from which computers a user can log on.</li></p>

<p><li> Add the computers from which a user can log on.</li></p>

<p>Use the computer name that you specified when you installed Windows 2000, which is the name of the computer account in the directory.</p>

<p><li> If necessary, delete or edit the name of a computer from which the user can log on.</li></p>

<A NAME="322"><h2>Configuring Dial-In Settings</h2></A>
<p>Configuring dial-in settings for a user account permits you to control how a user can make a dial-in connection to the network from a remote location. To gain 
access to the network, the user dials in to a computer running the Windows 2000 Remote Access Server (RAS).</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
In addition to configuring dial-in settings and having RAS on the server 
to which the user is dialing in, you must also set up a dial-up connection for the server on the client computer. Set up a dial-up connection by using the Network Connection Wizard, which you can access from Network Connections in 
My Computer.</blockquote></div>

<p>Configure dial-in settings on the Dial-In tab of the Properties dialog box. Table 7.12 describes the required options for setting up security for a dial-up connection.</p>

<p>There are several ways to allow regular users to log on at a domain controller. In the next procedure you add the users to the Print Operators group, because this group has the right to log on to a domain controller. Only users belonging to certain administrative groups may log on interactively onto a domain controller. A group is a collection of user accounts. Groups simplify administration by allowing you to assign permissions to a group of users rather than having to assign permissions to each individual user account. For more information on groups, see

<A NAME="327"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>In this lesson you learned that local user accounts are created using the Local 
Users and Groups snap-in built into the Computer Management console, and 
domain user accounts are created using the Active Directory Users and Computers console. When you create a domain user account, it is always created on the first available domain controller that is contacted by Microsoft Management Console (MMC), and then the account is replicated to all domain controllers.</p>

<p>You also learned that there is a set of default properties associated with each user account that you create. You learned that for domain user accounts, these properties equate to object attributes, so you can use these properties to search for 
domain users in the directory.</p>

<p>In the practice portion of this lesson, you created five domain user accounts. You then configured account properties including modifying the logon hours, setting account expiration, and determining when and if a user can change his or her password. Finally, you tested these properties to verify that they worked 
as expected.</p>

<A NAME="344"><h1>Lesson 5: Creating Home Directories</h1></A>
<p>Although the My Documents folder is the default location for users to store their personal documents, Windows 2000 provides another location for storage. This additional location is the user's home directory.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li> Manage home directories</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 5 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="345"><h2>Introducing Home Directories</h2></A>
<p>A <i>home directory</i> is an additional folder that you can provide for users to store personal documents, and, for older applications, it is sometimes the default folder for saving documents. You can store a home directory on a client computer or in a shared folder on a file server. Because a home directory is not part of a roaming user profile, its size does not affect network traffic during the logon process. You can locate all users' home directories in a central location on a network server.</p>

<p>Storing all home directories on a file server provides the following advantages:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Users can gain access to their home directories from any client computer on the network.</li></p>

<p><li> The backing up and administration of user documents is centralized.</li></p>

<p><li> The home directories are accessible from a client computer running any Microsoft operating system (including MS-DOS, Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows 2000).</li></p>
</ul>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
You should store home directories on a Windows NT file system (NTFS) volume so that you can use NTFS permissions to secure user documents. If you store home directories on a file allocation table (FAT) volume, you can only 
restrict home directory access by using shared folder permissions.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="346"><h2>Creating Home Directories on a Server</h2></A>
<p>To successfully complete the tasks for creating home directories, you must have permission to administer the object in which the user accounts reside. To create a home directory on a network file server, you must perform the following tasks:</p>

<ol>
<p><li> Create and share a folder in which to store all home directories on a network server. The home directory for each user will reside in this shared folder.</li></p>

<p><li> For the shared folder, remove the default permission Full Control from the Everyone group and assign Full Control to the Users group. This ensures that only users with domain user accounts can gain access to the shared folder.</li></p>

<p><li> Provide the path to the user's home directory folder in the shared home directory folder in the Profile tab of the Properties dialog box (see Figure 7.12) for the user account. Because the home directory is on a network server, click Connect and specify a drive letter to use to connect. In the To box, specify a UNC name, for example, <i>\\server_name\shared_folder_ name\user_ logon_name</i>. Type the <i>%username%</i> variable as the user's logon name to automatically name each user's home directory as the user logon name. For example, type <b>\\server_name\Users<i>\%username%</i></b>.</li></p>

<!-- caption --><b>Figure 7.12</b> <i>Specifying a path to a home directory folder</i><!-- /caption -->
</p>


<p>If you use <i>%username%</i> to name a folder on an NTFS volume, the user is assigned the NTFS Full Control permission and all other permissions are removed for the folder, including those for the Administrator account.</p>

</ol>

<A NAME="347"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>In addition to the My Documents folder, Windows 2000 provides you with the means to create a home directory for users to store their personal documents. You can create a home directory on a client computer or in a shared folder on a file server. Because a home directory is not part of a roaming user profile, its size does not affect network traffic during the logon process.</p>

<p>Storing all home directories on a file server provides several advantages. The first advantage is that users can gain access to their home directories from any client computer on the network. The second advantage is that backup and administration of user documents is centralized. Another advantage is that home directories are accessible from client computers running any Microsoft operating system 
(including MS-DOS, Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows 2000).</p>

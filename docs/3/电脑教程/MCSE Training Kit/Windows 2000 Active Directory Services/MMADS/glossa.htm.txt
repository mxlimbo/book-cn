<p><a name="1001"></a><b>access control list (ACL)</b> The mechanisms for limiting access to certain items of information or certain controls based on users' identity and their membership in various predefined groups. Access control is typically used by system administrators for controlling user access to network resources such as servers, directories, and files and is 
typically implemented by granting permissions to users and groups for access to specific objects.</p>

<p><a name="1002"></a><b>access token</b> The user's identification for the computers in the domain or for that local computer. The access token contains the user's security settings, including the user's security ID (SID).</p>

<p><a name="1003"></a><b>account lockout</b> A Windows 2000 security feature that locks a user account if a number of failed logon attempts occur within a specified amount of time, based on security policy lockout settings. Locked accounts cannot log on.</p>

<p><a name="1004"></a><b>ACL</b> <i>See</i> <a href="#1001">access control list (ACL)</a>.</p>

<p><a name="1006"></a><b>active</b> The window or icon that you are currently using or that is currently selected. Windows 2000 always applies the next keystroke or command you choose to the active window. Windows or icons on the desktop that are not selected are <i>inactive.</i></p>

<p><a name="1007"></a><b>Active Directory</b> The directory service included with Microsoft Windows 2000 Server. It stores information about objects on a network and makes this information available to users and network administrators. Active Directory gives network users access to permitted resources anywhere on the network using a single logon process. It provides network administrators with an intuitive hierarchical view of the network and a single point of administration for all network objects.</p>

<p><a name="1008"></a><b>Active Directory Domains and Trusts console</b> An administrative tool that allows you to manage trust relationships between domains.

<p><a name="1023"></a><b>API</b> <i>See</i> <a href="#1026">application programming interface (API)</a>.</p>

<p><a name="1024"></a><b>application</b> A complete, self-contained set of computer instructions that you use to perform a specific task, such as word processing, accounting, or data management. An application is also called a <i>program.</i></p>

<p><a name="1025"></a><b>application assignment</b> A process that uses Software Installation (an extension of group policy) to assign programs to groups of users. The programs appear to be installed and available on the users' desktops when they log on. You assign programs to a particular group policy object (GPO), which in turn is associated with a selected directory object (site, domain, or organizational unit). When you assign programs, they are advertised to every user managed by the GPO. Advertising the program installs only enough information about the program to make program shortcuts appear on the Start menu and the necessary file associations appear in the registry. When users managed by the GPO log on to a computer running Microsoft Windows 2000, the program appears on their Start menu. When users select the program from the Start menu for the first time, the program is installed. You can also install advertised programs by clicking a document managed by the program (either by file extension or by COM-based activation).</p>

<p><a name="1026"></a><b>application programming interface (API)</b> A set of routines that a program uses to request and carry out lower level services performed by another component, such as the computer's operating system or a service running on a network computer. These maintenance chores are performed by the computer's operating system, and an API provides the program with a means of communicating with the system, telling it which system-level task to perform and when.</p>

<p><a name="1027"></a><b>ASCII file</b> <i>See</i> <a href="#1022">American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) file</a>.</p>

<p><a name="1088"></a><b>details pane</b> The pane in the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) that displays the details for the selected item in the console tree. The details can be a list of items or they can be administrative properties, services, and events that are acted on by a console or snap-in.</p>

<p><a name="1089"></a><b>device driver</b> A program that allows a specific device, such as a modem, network card, or printer, to communicate with Microsoft Windows 2000. For example, without serial port drivers, network connections cannot use a modem to connect to a network. Although a device may be installed on your system, Windows 2000 cannot use the device until you have installed and configured the appropriate driver. If a device is listed in the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL), a driver is usually included with Windows 2000. Device drivers load automatically (for all enabled devices) when a computer is started, and thereafter run invisibly.</p>

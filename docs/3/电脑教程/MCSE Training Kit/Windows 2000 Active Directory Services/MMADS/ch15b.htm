</p>


<p>Remote OS Installation uses some of the existing services that may already be deployed and in use within your organization and it adds some services that you may or may not be familiar with. Remote OS Installation requires Active Directory, an updated Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server, and a compliant version of DNS.</p>

<A NAME="830"><h2>Remote Install Server Components</h2></A>
<p>When RIS is installed, these additional services are added to the server:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Boot Information Negotiation Layer (BINL).</b> The BINL service is added during the RIS installation process and provides overall management of the RIS environment. The BINL service is responsible for answering client computer network service requests, querying Active Directory on behalf of the client computer, and ensuring that the correct policy and configuration settings are applied to the client computer during the OS installation. The BINL service makes sure the client is passed the correct files and, in the case of a prestaged client, makes sure it is serviced by the correct RIS server. If the client computer has not been prestaged, BINL creates the client computer account object within Active Directory.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Trivial File Transfer Protocol Daemon (TFTPD).</b> This server-side TFTP service is responsible for hosting specific file download requests made by the client computer. The TFTPD service is used to download the Client Installation Wizard (CIW) and all client dialog boxes contained within the CIW for a given session.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Single Instance Store (SIS).</b> SIS is the service responsible for reducing disk space requirements on the volumes used for storing RIS installation images. When you install RIS as an optional component, you are prompted for a drive and directory where you would like to install RIS, known as the RIS volume. The SIS service attaches itself to the RIS volume and looks for any duplicate files that are placed on that volume. If duplicate files are found, SIS creates a link to the duplicates, thus reducing the disk space required.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="831"><h2>Remote Install Client Components</h2></A>
<p>There are two types of remote boot-enabled client computers:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Computers with Pre-Boot eXecution Environment (PXE) DHCP-based remote boot ROMS</li></p>
<p><li>Computers with network cards supported by the RIS Boot Disk</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="832"><h3>PXE Remote Boot Technology</h3></A>
<p>Remote OS Installation uses the new PXE DHCP-based remote boot technology to initiate the installation of an OS from a remote source to a client hard disk. The remote source&#8212;a server that supports RIS&#8212;provides the network equivalent of a CD-based installation of Windows 2000 Professional or a preconfigured Remote Installation Preparation (RIPrep) desktop image. The Windows 2000 Professional OS is currently the only installation option supported by RIS.</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>CD-based installation.</b> The CD-based option is similar to setting up a workstation directly from the Windows 2000 Professional CD-ROM; however, the source files reside across the network on available RIS servers.</li></p>
<p><li> <b>RIPrep image format.</b> The RIPrep imaging option allows a network administrator to clone a standard corporate desktop configuration, complete with OS configurations, desktop customizations, and locally installed applications. After first installing and configuring the Windows 2000 Professional OS, its services, and any standard applications on a computer, the network administrator runs a wizard that prepares the installation image and replicates it to an available RIS server on the network for installation on other clients.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Once the images have been posted on the RIS server(s), end users equipped with PXE-based remote boot-enabled client computers can request to install those images from any available RIS server on the network. The fact that the user can install the OS without administrator assistance means the administrator is free to complete other tasks requiring his or her attention, thus saving both the time and expense normally associated with OS installations.</p>

<A NAME="833"><h3>How the PXE Remote Boot Technology Works</h3></A>
<p>PXE is a new form of remote boot technology that has been created within the computing industry. PXE provides companies with the ability to use their existing Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network infrastructure with DHCP to discover RIS servers on the network. Net PC/PC98-compliant systems can take advantage of the remote boot technology included in the Windows 2000 OS. Net PC/PC98 refers to the annual guide for hardware developers co-authored by Microsoft with Intel, including contributions from Compaq and other industry hardware manufacturers. PC98 is intended to provide standards for hardware development that advance the PC platform and enable Microsoft to include advanced features, like RIS, in the Windows platform.</p>

<p>Figure 15.2 describes the step-by-step process the PXE remote boot ROM goes through during every network service boot request.</p>

<p>When a PXE-enabled client computer is turned on, the PXE-based ROM requests an IP address from a DHCP server using the normal DHCP discovery process. As part of the initial DHCP discover request, the client computer identifies itself as being PXE-enabled, which indicates to the RIS servers on the network that it is looking to be serviced. Any available RIS server on the network can respond by providing the client with its IP address and the name of a boot file the client should request if that client wants service from that server. When the client computer responds to the server indicating that it wants service, the DHCP service sends a message granting service. The client must also request service from the BINL service, which then passes the bootstrap file to the client and ensures that prestaged clients are serviced by the correct RIS server.</p>

<p>After the network bootstrap program is sent to the client by the BINL service, the client-side experience will be different, depending on the remote installation server vendor that is responding to the client request for service. The following section details the implementation of Remote OS Installation that is included in the Windows 2000 Server OS.</p>

</p>


<A NAME="834"><h3>The RIS Boot Disk</h3></A>
<p>For computers that do not contain a PXE-based remote boot ROM, Windows 2000 provides the administrator with a tool to create a remote boot disk for use with RIS. The RIS remote boot disk can be used with a variety of Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)-based network adapter cards. Using the RIS boot disk eliminates the need to retrofit existing client computers with new network cards that contain a PXE-based remote boot ROM to take advantage of the Remote OS Installation feature. The RIS boot disk simulates the PXE remote boot sequence and supports frequently used network cards.</p>

<A NAME="835"><h2>How the Remote OS Installation Process Works</h2></A>
<p>A graphical representation of how the Remote OS Installation process works is shown in Figure 15.3. The process is the same for both the PXE remote boot ROM and the RIS boot disk boot processes. Each step of the process is then discussed in detail.</p>

<p>The process of contacting an RIS server and selecting an OS image is accomplished in a few steps. The following steps outline the sequence of events when a PXE-enabled client computer starts on the network and is serviced by an RIS server.</p>

<p>

</p><p>
<!-- caption --><b>Figure 15.3</b> <i>RIS architecture</i><!-- /caption -->
</p>


<A NAME="836"><h3>The Remote OS Installation Process</h3></A>
<ol>
<p><li> An RIS client connected to the network starts, and during the power up, the computer initiates a network service request. As part of the network service request, a DHCP discover packet is sent to the network requesting an IP address from the closest DHCP server, the IP address of an available RIS server. As part of that request, the client sends its globally unique identifier (GUID). The GUID is present in client computers that are PC98- or Net PC-compliant and is found in the system basic input/output system (BIOS) of the computer. The DHCP server responds to the request by providing an IP address to the client. Any available RIS server can respond with its IP address and the name of the boot file the client should request if the client selects that RIS server for service. The user is prompted to press the F12 key to initiate service from that RIS server.</li></p>

<p><li> The RIS server (using the BINL service) must check in Active Directory for the existence of a prestaged client computer account that matches this client computer. BINL checks for the existence of a client computer by querying Active Directory for a client computer that matches the GUID sent in Step 1.</li></p>

<p><li> Once the RIS server has checked for the existence of a client computer account, the CIW is downloaded to the client computer. It prompts the user to log on to the network.</li></p>

<p><li> Once the user logs on, the RIS server checks Active Directory for a corresponding user account, verifying the password. RIS then checks the RIS-specific group policy settings to find out which installation options the user should have access to. RIS also checks to see which OS images the specific user should be offered. The CIW makes those options available to the client (see Figure 15.4).</li></p>

<p><li> If the user is only allowed a single installation option and OS choice, the user is not prompted to select anything. If the user has more than one installation option and OS image available to him or her for installation, the list of images is displayed for selection. The CIW warns the user that the installation will reformat his or her hard disk and previously stored information will be deleted, and then prompts the user to start the Remote OS Installation.</li></p>

</p><p>
<!-- caption --><b>Figure 15.4</b> <i>CIW installation options</i><!-- /caption -->
</p>

</ol>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
To configure the setup options displayed to users in the CIW, see <A HREF="ch15c.htm">Lesson 2</A>, &quot;Implementing RIS,&quot; for more information.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<ol start="6">
<p><li> Once the user confirms the installation settings on the summary screen, the OS installation begins. At this point, if a client computer account was not present in Active Directory, the BINL service creates the client computer account, thus automatically providing a name for the computer. The OS is installed locally as an unattended installation, which means the end user is not offered any installation choices during the OS installation phase.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>
<div class="warning"><blockquote><b>IMPORTANT</b> <hr>
Because the CIW is running in a preboot execution environment, there is no support for extended characters in either the text displayed or the input fields (user name, password, domain, or any custom input parameters). Careful consideration should be taken before creating user or domain names that contain extended characters because they will be not be usable with RIS.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>The Remote OS Installation process is straightforward from an end user perspective. The administrator can guide the user through a successful OS installation by predetermining the installation options, if any, an end user has access to. The administrator can also restrict the OS image or images a user has access to, thus ensuring the correct OS installation type is offered to the user for a successful installation.</p>

<A NAME="837"><h2>RIS Server and Client Requirements</h2></A>

<p>Server hardware requirements:</p>
<ul>
<p><li>Pentium or Pentium II 166 MHz (200 MHz or faster processor recommended)</li></p>

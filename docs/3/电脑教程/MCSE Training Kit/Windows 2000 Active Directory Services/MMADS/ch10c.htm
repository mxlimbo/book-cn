<A NAME="473"><h1>Lesson 2: Planning Shared Folders</h1></A>
<p>When you plan shared folders, you can reduce administrative overhead and ease user access. To 
plan shared folders, you must determine which resources you want shared, and then organize 
resources according to function, use, and administration needs.</p>

<p>Shared folders can contain applications and data. Use shared application folders to centralize 
administration. Use shared data folders to provide a central location for users to store and gain 
access to common files. This lesson outlines the points you must consider when sharing application 
and data folders.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li>Plan which shared folder permissions to assign to user accounts and groups for application 
and data folders</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 5 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="474"><h2>Application Folders</h2></A>
<p>Shared application folders are used for applications that are installed on a network server and 
they can be used from client computers. The main advantage of shared applications is that you do 
not need to install and maintain most components of the applications on each computer. Whereas 
program files for applications can be stored on a server, configuration information for most 
network applications is often stored on each workstation. The exact way in which you share 
application folders will vary depending on the application, your particular network environment, 
and your organization.</p>

<p>When you share application folders, consider the points in Figure 10.3, explained in more detail 
as follows:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Create one shared folder for applications and organize all of your applications under this 
folder. When you combine all applications under one shared folder, you designate one location for 
installing and upgrading software.</li></p>

<p><li>Assign the Administrators group the Full Control permission for the applications folder so 
that administrators can manage the application software and control user permissions.</li></p>

<p><li>Remove the Full Control permission from the Everyone group and assign Read permission to the 
Users group. This provides more security because the Users group includes only user accounts that 
you created, whereas the Everyone group includes anyone who has access to network resources, 
including the Guest account.</li></p>

<p><li>Assign the Change permission to groups that are responsible for upgrading and 
troubleshooting applications.</li></p>

<p><li>Create a separate shared folder outside your application folder hierarchy for any 
application for which you need to assign different permissions. Then assign the appropriate 
permissions to that folder.</li></p>

</p>
</ul>


<A NAME="475"><h2>Data Folders</h2></A>
<p>Users on a network use data folders to exchange public and working data. Working data folders 
are used by members of a team who need access to shared files. Public data folders are used by 
larger groups of users who all need access to common data.</p>

<p>When you use data folders, create and share common data folders on a volume that is separate 
from the operating system and applications. Data files should be backed up frequently, and with 
data folders on a separate volume, you can conveniently back them up. If the operating system 
requires reinstallation, the volume containing the data folder remains intact.</p>

<A NAME="476"><h3>Public Data</h3></A>
<p>When you share a common public data folder, do the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Use centralized data folders so that data can be easily backed up.</li></p>

<p><li>Assign the Change permission to the Users group for the common data folder (see Figure 
10.4). This will provide users with a central, publicly accessible location for storing data files 
that they want to share with other users. Users will be able to gain access to the folder and read, 
create, or change files in it.</li></p>

</p><p>
<!-- caption --><b>Figure 10.4</b> <i>Public data and working data shared folders</i><!-- /caption -->
</p>

</ul>

<A NAME="477"><h3>Working Data</h3></A>
<p>When you share a data folder for working files, do the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Assign the Full Control permission to the Administrators group for a central data folder so 
that administrators can perform maintenance more easily.</li></p>

<p><li>Share lower-level data folders below the central folder with the Change permission for the 
appropriate groups when you need to restrict access to those folders.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>For an example, see Figure 10.4. To protect data in the Accountants folder, which is a subfolder 
of the Data folder, share the Accountants folder and assign the Change permission only to the 
Accountants group so that only members of the Accountants group can gain access to the Accountants 
folder.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
Because an administrator will always be able to take ownership of a file, your organization may 
find it necessary to encrypt files and folders to meet security requirements. You can find more 
information about encryption in the &quot;File encryption overview&quot; topic in system help and 
by researching on your own.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="478"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>In this lesson you learned that you use shared application folders to centralize 
administration and make it easier to upgrade application software. When you use shared application 
folders, you should assign the Administrators group the Full Control permission for the 
applications folder so that members of this group can manage the application software and control 
user permissions. You should also remove the Full Control permission from the Everyone group and 
assign Read permission to the Users group. This provides more security because the Users group 
includes only user accounts that you created, whereas the Everyone group includes anyone who has 
access to network resources, including the Guest account.</p>

<p>You also learned that you use shared data folders to provide a central location for users to 
store and gain access to common files. When you use data folders, you should create and share 
common data folders on a volume that is separate from the operating system and applications. Data 
files should be backed up frequently, and with data folders on a separate volume, you can 
conveniently back them up.</p>

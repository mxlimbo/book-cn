<A NAME="889"><h2>Review Questions</h2></A>
<ol>
<p><li> What is the primary difference between Windows 2000 Professional and Windows 2000 Server?</li></p>

<p><b>Windows 2000 Professional is optimized for use alone as a desktop operating system, as a networked computer in a peer-to-peer workgroup 
environment, or as a workstation in a Windows 2000 Server domain 
environment. Windows 2000 Server is optimized for use as a file, print, and application server, as well as a Web-server platform.</b></p>

<p><li> What is the major difference between a workgroup and a domain?</li></p>


<p><b>The major difference between a workgroup and a domain is where the user account information resides for user logon authentication. For a workgroup, user account information resides in the local security 
database on each computer in the workgroup. For the domain, the user account information resides in the Active Directory database.</b></p>


<p><li> Which of the integral subsystems is responsible for running Active Directory?</li></p>


<p><b>The Security subsystem.</b></p>


<p><li> What is the purpose of Active Directory?</li></p>


<p><b>Active Directory is the directory service included in Windows 2000 Server. It stores information about objects on a network and makes this information available to users and network administrators. Active 
Directory gives network users access to permitted resources anywhere on the network using a single logon process. It provides network administrators with an intuitive hierarchical view of the network and a single point of administration for all network objects.</b></p>


<p><li> What happens when a user logs on to a domain?</li></p>


<p><b>Windows 2000 sends the logon information to a domain controller, which compares it to the user's information in the directory. If the 
information matches, the domain controller authenticates the user and issues an access token for the user.</b></p>


<p><li> How would you use the Windows Security dialog box?</li></p>


<p><b>The Windows 2000 Security dialog box provides easy access to important security options, including the ability to lock a computer, change a password, stop programs that are not responding, log off a computer, and shut down the computer. You can also determine the domains to which you are logged on and the user account that you used to log on.</b></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="890"><h1>Chapter 2</h1></A>
<A NAME="891"><h2>Review Questions</h2></A>
<ol>
<p><li> What is the Active Directory schema?</li></p>


<p><b>The schema contains a formal definition of the contents and structure of Active Directory, including all attributes, classes, and class properties.</b></p>


<p><li> What is the purpose of an organizational unit (OU)?</li></p>


<p><b>An OU is a container used to organize objects within a domain into logical administrative groups that mirror your organization's functional or 
business structure. An OU can contain objects such as user accounts, contacts, groups, computers, printers, applications, file shares, and other OUs from the same domain.</b></p>


<p><li> What are sites and domains and how are they different?</li></p>


<p><b>A site is a combination of one or more IP subnets that should be connected by a high-speed link. A domain is a logical grouping of servers and other network resources organized under a single name. A site is a component of Active Directory's physical structure, whereas a domain is a component of the logical structure.</b></p>


<p><li> What is the difference between implicit two-way transitive trusts and explicit one-way nontransitive trusts?</li></p>


<p><b>An implicit two-way transitive trust is a trust between domains that are part of the Windows 2000 scalable namespace, for example, between parent and child domains within a tree and between the top-level domains in a forest. These trust relationships make all objects in all the domains of the tree available to all other domains in the tree.</b></p>

<p><b>An explicit one-way nontransitive trust is a relationship between domains that are not part of the same tree. One-way trusts support connections to existing pre-Windows 2000 domains to allow the configuration of trust relationships with domains in other trees.</b></p>
</ol>

<a name="1002"><h3>Practice: Using Microsoft Management Console</h3></a>

<a name="1003"><h3>Exercise 1: Using a Preconfigured MMC</h3></a>

<p><li><a name="1051"><b>To use a preconfigured MMC</b></a></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li value="2"> Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click Event Viewer.</li></p>

<p>Windows 2000 displays the Event Viewer console, which gives you access to the contents of the event log files on your computer. You use Event Viewer to monitor various hardware and software activities.</p>

<p>Looking at the console tree, what three logs are listed?</p>


<p><b>Application Log, Security Log, System Log.</b></p>


<p>Can you add snap-ins to this console? Why or why not?</p>


<p><b>No. This is a preconfigured console and therefore it was saved in User mode. You cannot modify consoles that are saved in User mode.</b></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="894"><h2>Exercise 2: Creating a Custom Microsoft Management Console</h2></A>
<p><li><a name="1052"><b>To create a custom MMC</b></a></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li value="5"> To view the currently configured options, click Options on the Console menu.</li></p>


<p>MMC displays the Options dialog box with the Console tab active. The 
Console tab allows you to configure the console mode.</p>

<p>How does a console that is saved in User mode differ from one that is saved in Author mode?</p>

<p><b>You can modify consoles that are saved in Author mode. You can't modify consoles that are saved in User mode after they have been saved. Different levels of User mode restrict the degree of user access.</b></p>
</ol>

<p><li><a name="1053"><b>To remove extensions from a snap-in</b></a></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li value="12"> Click Computer Management (Local), and then click the Extensions tab.</li></p>


<p>MMC displays a list of available extensions for the Computer Management snap-in.</p>

<p>What determines which extensions MMC displays in this dialog box?</p>

<p><b>The available extensions depend on the snap-in you select.</b></p>


<p><li value="15"> Expand Computer Management and then expand System Tools to confirm that System Information and Device Manager have been removed.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
Do not use any of the tools at this point.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<ol>
<p>When should you remove extensions from a console?</p>

<p><b>To customize the console for limited administrative tasks. This allows you to include only those extensions that are relevant to the computer that you are administering. You should also remove extensions when you 
create consoles for administrators who perform only limited tasks.</b></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="895"><h2>Review Questions</h2></A>
<ol>
<p><li> What are the functions of the Active Directory Domains and Trusts, the Active Directory Sites and Services, and the Active Directory Users and Computers consoles?</li></p>

<p><b>The Active Directory Domains and Trusts console manages the trust 
relationships between domains. The Active Directory Sites and Services console creates sites to manage the replication of Active Directory information. The Active Directory Users and Computers console manages 
users, computers, security groups, and other objects in Active Directory.</b></p>


<p><li> What is the purpose of creating custom MMCs?</li></p>

<p><b>Create custom MMCs to meet your administrative requirements. Combine snap-ins that you use together to perform common administrative tasks. Creating custom MMCs allows you to perform most administrative tasks with one MMC. You do not have to switch between different programs or MMC files because all of the snap-ins that you need to use are located in the same MMC file.</b></p>


<p><li> When and why would you use an extension?</li></p>


<p><b>When specific snap-ins need additional functionality. Extensions are snap-ins that provide additional administrative functionality to another snap-in. A standalone snap-in provides one function or a related set of functions.</b></p>


<p><li> You need to create a custom MMC for an administrator who only needs to use the Computer Management and Active Directory Users and Computers consoles. The administrator</li></p>



<ul>
<p><li> Must not be able to add any additional consoles or snap-ins</li></p>

<p><li> Needs full access to both consoles</li></p>

<p><li> Must be able to navigate between consoles</li></p>
</ul>

<p>What console mode would you use to configure the custom MMC?</p>

<p><b>User Mode, Full Access.</b></p>


<p><li> What do you need to do to remotely administer a computer running Windows 2000 Server from a computer running Windows 2000 Professional?</li></p>


<p><b>Windows 2000 Professional does not include all snap-ins that are 
included in Windows 2000 Server. To enable remote administration of many Windows 2000 Server components from a computer running 
Windows 2000 Professional, you need to add the required snap-ins on 
the computer running Windows 2000 Professional. This is done by 
executing the <i>systemroot</i>\system32\adminpak.msi file on the Windows 2000 Server using My Network Places from the Windows 2000 
Professional desktop.</b></p>


<p><li> You need to schedule a maintenance utility to run once a week on a computer running Windows 2000 Server. What do you use to accomplish this?</li></p>


<p><b>Use Task Scheduler to schedule the necessary maintenance utilities to run at specific times.</b></p>

<a name="1006"><h3>Exercise 1: Promoting a Standalone Server to a Domain Controller</h3></a>

<p><li><a name="1054"><b>To install the Active Directory service on a standalone server</b></a></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li value="12"> Ensure that the SYSVOL folder location is <i>systemroot</i>\SYSVOL. (If you did not install Windows 2000 in the WINNT directory, the SYSVOL location should default to a SYSVOL folder in the folder where you installed Windows 2000.)</li></p>


<p>What is the one SYSVOL location requirement?</p>

<p><b>SYSVOL must be located on a Windows 2000 partition that is formatted as NTFS 5.0.</b></p>

<p>What is the function of SYSVOL?</p>

<p><b>SYSVOL is a system volume hosted on all Windows 2000 domain controllers. It stores scripts and part of the group policy objects for both the current domain and the enterprise. <i>systemroot</i>\SYSVOL\SYSVOL stores domain public files.</b></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="899"><h2>Exercise 3: Viewing a Domain Using the Active Directory Users and Computers Console</h2></A>
<p><li><a name="1056"><b>To view a domain using the Active Directory Users and Computers console</b></a></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li value="2"> In the console tree, double-click microsoft.com (or the name of your domain).</li></p>

<a name="1007"><h3>Practice: Creating an OU </h3></a>

<p><li><a name="1057"><b>To create an OU</b></a></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li value="3"> Expand the microsoft.com domain (or the domain you set up).</li></p>


<p>The OUs appear as folders with a directory book icon under the 
domain. Plain folders are specialized containers.</p>

<p>What are the default OUs in your domain?</p>

<p><b>Domain Controllers. The Builtin, Computers, and Users folders are 
container objects.</b></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="901"><h2>Review Questions</h2></A>
<ol>
<p><li> What are some reasons for creating more than one domain?</li></p>


<p><b>Some reasons for creating more than one domain are decentralized 
network administration, replication control, different password requirements between organizations, massive numbers of objects, different Internet domain names, international requirements, and internal 
political requirements.</b></p>


<p><li> Your company has an external Internet namespace reserved with a DNS registration authority. As you plan the Active Directory implementation for your company, you decide to recommend extending the namespace for the internal network. What benefits does this option provide?</li></p>


<p><b>Extending an existing namespace provides consistent tree names for internal and external resources. In addition, this plan allows your company to use the same logon and user account names for internal and external resources. Finally, you do not have to reserve an additional DNS namespace.</b></p>


<p><li> In what two ways does your site configuration affect Windows 2000?</li></p>


<p><b>Workstation logon and authentication. When a user logs on, Windows 2000 will try to find a domain controller in the same site as the user's computer to service the user's logon request and subsequent requests for network information.</b></p>

<p><b>Directory replication. You can configure the schedule and path for 
replication of a domain's directory differently for intersite replication, as 
opposed to replication within a site. Generally, you should set replication between sites to be less frequent than replication within a site.</b></p>


<p><li> What is the shared system volume, what purpose does it serve, where is it located, and what is its name?</li></p>


<p><b>The shared system volume is a folder structure that exists on all Windows 2000 domain controllers. It stores scripts and some of the group policy objects for both the current domain and the enterprise. The default location and name for the shared system volume is <i>systemroot</i>\SYSVOL. The shared system volume must be located on a partition or volume formatted with NTFS 5.0.</b></p>

<p><li> What is the purpose of the operations master roles?</li></p>


<p><b>Because some changes are impractical to perform in multimaster 
fashion, one or more domain controllers can be assigned to perform 
operations that are single-master (not permitted to occur at different places in a network at the same time). Operations master roles are 
assigned to domain controllers to perform single-master operations.</b></p>


<p><li> What administrative tool is used to create OUs?</li></p>


<p><b>Use the Active Directory Users and Computers console to create OUs.</b></p>

<a name="1008"><h3>Lesson 2: Understanding and Configuring Zones</h3></a>

<a name="1009"><h3>Practice: Configuring Zones</h3></a>

<a name="1010"><h3>Exercise 3: Adding a Resource Record </h3></a>

<p><li><a name="1058"><b>To add a PTR resource record for a zone</b></a></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li value="2"> Click 10.10.1.x Subnet. (If you did not use 10.10.1.1 as the static IP address for your server name, click the appropriate subnet.)</li></p>


<p>What types of resource records exist in the reverse lookup zone?</p>

<p><b>Start of Authority and Name Server.</b></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="904"><h2>Review Questions</h2></A>
<ol>
<p><li> What is the function of a forward lookup query? A reverse lookup query?</li></p>


<p><b>A forward lookup query resolves a name to an IP address. A reverse lookup query resolves an IP address to a name.</b></p>


<p><li> What are the advantages of using the Active Directory-integrated zone type?</li></p>


<p><b>Multimaster update and enhanced security are based on the capabilities of Active Directory. Zones are replicated and synchronized to new 
domain controllers automatically whenever a new zone is added to an 
Active Directory domain. By integrating storage of your DNS namespace in Active Directory, you simplify planning and administration for both DNS and Active Directory. Directory replication is faster and more 
efficient than standard DNS replication.</b></p>


<p><li> What is the purpose of the SOA resource record?</li></p>


<p><b>The SOA resource record identifies which name server is the authoritative source of information for data within this domain. The first record in the zone database file must be the SOA record. The SOA resource record also stores properties such as version information and timings that affect zone renewal or expiration. These properties affect how often transfers of the zone are done between servers authoritative for the zone.</b></p>


<p><li> What must be done when you delegate zones within a namespace?</li></p>


<p><b>When you delegate zones within a namespace, you must also create SOA resource records to point to the authoritative DNS server for the new zone. This is necessary both to transfer authority and to provide correct referral to other DNS servers and clients of the new servers being made authoritative for the new zone.</b></p>


<p><li> Why is an IXFR query more efficient than an AFXR query?</li></p>


<p><b>An IFXR query allows the secondary server to pull only those zone changes it needs to synchronize its copy of the zone with its source, either a primary or secondary copy of the zone maintained by another DNS server. An AXFR query provides a full transfer of the entire zone database.</b></p>

<p><li> What two site configuration objects does the Active Directory Installation Wizard create automatically?</li></p>


<p><b>The Active Directory Installation Wizard automatically creates an object named Default-First-Site-Name in the Sites container and an object named DEFAULTIPSITELINK in the IP container.</b></p>


<p><li> Which replication protocol uses RPCs for replication over site links (inter-site) and within a site (intra-site)?</li></p>


<p><b>IP replication protocol.</b></p>


<p><li> What three tasks must be completed to configure inter-site replication?</li></p>


<p><b>Create site links, configure site link attributes (such as site link cost, replication frequency, and replication availability), and create site link bridges.</b></p>


<p><li> What is the difference between replication frequency and replication availability?</li></p>


<p><b>Replication frequency is the duration between replications on a site link. Replication availability is when a site link is available to replicate directory information.</b></p>


<p><li> What is the function of a bridgehead server?</li></p>


<p><b>A bridgehead server provides some ranking or criteria for choosing which domain controller should be preferred as the recipient for inter-site replication. The bridgehead server then distributes the directory 
information via inter-site replication.</b></p>

<A NAME="917"><h2>Review Questions</h2></A>
<ol>
<p><li> What different capabilities do local user accounts and domain user accounts provide to users?</li></p>


<p><b>A local user account allows the user to log on at and gain access to 
resources on only the computer where you create the local user account. A domain user account allows a user to log on to the domain from any computer in the network and to gain access to resources anywhere in the domain, provided the user has permission to access these resources.</b></p>


<p><li> What should you consider when you plan new user accounts?</li></p>


<ul>
<p><li> <b>A naming convention that ensures unique but consistent user account names</b></li></p>

<p><li><a name="1077"><b>Whether you or the user will determine the user account password</b></a></li></p>

<p><li> <b>The hours when users need to have access to the network or be restricted from using the network</b></li></p>


<p><li> <b>Whether the user account should be disabled</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>The type of user profile to use</b></li></p>

<p><li> <b>Whether My Documents or home directories will be used</b></li></p>
</ul>


<p><li> What information is required to create a domain user account?</li>  </p>

<p><b>A first or last name, logon name, and pre-Windows 2000 logon name.</b></p>


<p><li>A user wants to gain access to network resources remotely from home. The user does not want to pay the long-distance charges for the telephone call. How would you set up the user account to accomplish this?</li></p>


<p><b>In the Dial-In tab of the Properties dialog box for the user account, click the Set By Caller (Routing and Remote Access Service Only) option to have the RAS server call the user back at a telephone number that he or she specifies. You can also click the Always Callback To option to have the RAS server use a specified telephone number to call back the user. However, the user must be at the specified telephone number to make a connection to the server.</b></p>


<p><li> What is the difference between a local user profile and a roaming user profile?</li></p>


<p><b>A local user profile is stored on the computer where the user logs on. 
A roaming user profile is stored on a domain server and is copied to the client computer where the user logs on.</b></p>


<p><li> What do you do to ensure that a user on a client computer running Windows 2000 has a roaming user profile?</li></p>


<p><b>First, create a shared folder on a network server. Second, for each user account, in the Properties dialog box for each user, provide a path to the shared folder on the server. The next time that the user logs on, the roaming user profile is created.</b></p>


<p><li> How can you ensure that a user has a centrally located home directory?</li></p>


<p><b>First, create and share a parent folder on a server. Second, change the permission for the folder to Full Control for the Users group. Third, provide a path to the shared folder, including the name of the individual user's home directory (<i>\\server_name\shared_folder_name\ user_logon_name</i>).</b></p>


<p><li> Why would you rename a user account and what is the advantage of doing so?</li></p>


<p><b>Rename a user account if you want a new user to have all of the properties of a former user, including permissions, desktop settings, and group membership. The advantage of renaming an account is that you do not have to rebuild all of the properties as you do for a new user account.</b></p>

<p><li> Does your network require local groups?</li></p>


<p><b>No. The scenario presents no need to create local groups, which you can only use on a single computer.</b></p>


<p><li> Does your network require universal groups?</li></p>


<p><b>No. The scenario presents no need to create universal groups. Your 
domain has no groups that need to have access to resources in multiple domains and also need to have members from multiple domains.</b></p>


<p><li> Sales representatives at the company frequently visit the company headquarters and other divisions. Therefore, you need to give sales representatives with user accounts in other domains the same permissions for resources that sales representatives in your domain have. You also want to make it easy for administrators in other domains to assign permissions to sales representatives in your domain. How can you accomplish this?</li></p>


<p><b>Create global groups for sales representatives in all other domains. 
Add these global groups to the appropriate domain local groups in your 
domain. Tell administrators in other domains about the global group that represents sales representatives in your domain. Have the administrators add the sales representatives group from your domain to the appropriate domain local groups in their domains.</b></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="920"><h2>Review Questions</h2></A>
<ol>
<p><li> Why should you use groups?</li></p>


<p><b>Use groups to simplify administration by granting rights and assigning permissions once to the group rather than multiple times to each 
individual member.</b></p>


<p><li> What is the purpose of adding a group to another group?</li></p>


<p><b>Adding groups to other groups (nesting) creates a consolidated group and can reduce the number of times that you need to assign permissions.</b></p>


<p><li> When should you use security groups instead of distribution groups?</li></p>


<p><b>Use security groups to assign permissions. Use distribution groups when the only function of the group is not security related, such as an e-mail distribution list. You cannot use distribution groups to assign permissions.</b></p>


<p><li> What strategy should you apply when you use domain local and global groups?</li></p>


<p><b>Place user accounts into global groups, place global groups into domain local groups, and then assign permissions to the domain local group.</b></p>


<p><li> Why should you not use local groups on a computer after it becomes a member of a domain?</li></p>



<p><b>Local groups do not appear in Active Directory, and you must administer local groups separately for each computer.</b></p>


<p><li> What is the easiest way to give a user complete control over all computers in a domain?</li></p>


<p><b>Add his or her user account to the Domain Admins predefined global group. Then he or she can perform all administrative tasks on all domain computers and in Active Directory. The user receives administrative control because Windows 2000 makes the Domain Admins predefined global group a member of both the Administrators built-in domain local group and the Administrators built-in local group on each member server and computer running Windows 2000 Professional. The Administrators built-in domain local group has complete control over all domain controllers and Active Directory. Each Administrators built-in local group has 
complete control over the computer on which it exists.</b></p>


<p><li> Why shouldn't you run your computer as an administrator? What action should you take instead?</li></p>


<p><b>Running Windows 2000 as an administrator makes the system vulnerable to Trojan horse attacks and other security risks. For most computer 
activity, you should assign yourself to the Users or Power Users group. Then, if you need to perform an administrator-only task, you should log on as an administrator, perform the task, and then log off. If you frequently need to log on as an administrator, you can use Run As to start a program as an administrator.</b></p>

<p><li> Suppose the headquarters for this chapter's imaginary manufacturing company has a single domain that is located in Paris. The company has managers who need to access the inventory database to perform their jobs. What would you do to ensure that the managers have the required access to the inventory database?</li></p>


<p><b>Place all of the managers into a global group. Create a domain local group for inventory database access. Make the managers global group a member of the inventory database domain local group and assign permissions to gain access to the inventory database to the domain local group.</b></p>


<p><li> Now suppose the company has a three-domain environment with the root domain in Paris and the other two domains in Australia and North America. Managers from all three domains need access to the inventory database in Paris to perform their jobs. What would you do to ensure that the managers have the required access and that there is a minimum of administration?</li></p>


<p><b>In each domain, create a global group and add user accounts for the managers in that domain to the global group. Create a domain local group for the inventory database access in the domain where the database is located (Paris). Add the managers global groups from each of the domains to the inventory database domain local group. Then, assign permissions to gain access to the inventory database to the domain local group.</b></p>

<p><li> If a user has Write permission for a folder and is also a member of a group with Read permission for the folder, what are the user's effective permissions for the folder?</li></p>


<p><b>The user has both Read permission and Write permission for the folder because NTFS permissions are cumulative.</b></p>


<p><li> If you assign the Modify permission to a user account for a folder and the Read permission for a file, and then copy the file to that folder, what permission does the user have for the file?</li></p>


<p><b>The user can modify the file because the file inherits the Modify permission from the folder.</b></p>

<ol>
<p><li> In the first example, the Data folder is shared. The Sales group has the shared folder Read permission for the Data folder and the NTFS Full Control permission for the Sales subfolder.</li></p>

<p>What are the Sales group's effective permissions for the Sales subfolder when Sales group members gain access to the Sales subfolder by making a connection to the Data shared folder?</p>

<p><b>The Sales group has Read permission for the Sales subfolder because when shared folder permissions are combined with NTFS permissions, the more restrictive permission applies.</b></p>


<p><li> In the second example, the Users folder contains user home folders. Each user home folder contains data that is only accessible to the user for whom the folder is named. The Users folder has been shared, and the Users group has the shared folder Full Control permission for the Users folder. User1 and User2 have the NTFS Full Control permission for only their home folder and no NTFS permissions for other folders. These users are all members of the Users group.</li></p>


<p>What permissions does User1 have when he or she accesses the User1 subfolder by making a connection to the Users shared folder? What are User1's permissions for the User2 subfolder?</p>

<p><b>User1 has the Full Control permission for the User1 subfolder because both the shared folder permission and the NTFS permission allow full control.

<p><b>You have two choices for permissions. You can rely entirely on NTFS 
permissions and assign Full Control for all shared folders to the Everyone group, or you can use shared folder permissions according to resource needs. The following suggested shared folders include required permissions if you decide to assign shared folder permissions.</b></p>

<p><b>Share the Management Guidelines folder as MgmtGd. Assign the Full Control permission to the Managers group.</b></p>

<p><b>Share the Data folder as Data. Assign the Full Control permission to the Administrators built-in group.</b></p>

<p><b>Share the Data\Customer Service folder as CustServ. Assign the Change permission to the Customer Service group.</b></p>

<p><b>Share the Data\Public folder as Public. Assign the Change permission to the Users built-in group and the Full Control permission to the Administrators built-in group.</b></p>

<p><b>Share the Applications folder as Apps. Assign the Read permission to the Users built-in group and the Full Control permission to the Administrators built-in group.</b></p>

<p><b>Share the Project Management folder as ProjMan. Assign the Change permission to the Managers group and the Full Control permission to the Administrators built-in group.</b></p>

<p><b>Share the Database\Customers folder as CustDB. Assign the Change 
permission to the CustomerDBFull group, the Read permission to the CustomerDBRead group, and the Full Control permission to the 
Administrators built-in group.</b></p>

<p><b>Share the Users folder as Users. Create a folder for every employee below this folder. Assign the Full Control permission to each employee for his or her own folder. Preferably, have Windows 2000 create the folder and

<p>Are the standard permissions for a user object the same as those for an OU object? Why or why not?</p>

<p><b>No. Standard permissions for each type of object are different. The reason for the differences is that different object types are used for different tasks, and therefore the security needs for each object type differ.</b></p>

<ol>
<p><li> How does the global catalog help users locate Active Directory objects?</li></p>


<p><b>The global catalog contains a partial replica of the entire directory, so it stores information about every object in a domain tree or forest. Because the global catalog contains information about every object, a user can find information regardless of which domain in the tree or forest contains the data. Active Directory automatically generates the contents of the 
global catalog from the domains that make up the directory.</b></p>


<p><li> You want to allow the manager of the Sales department to create, modify, and delete only user accounts for sales personnel. How can you accomplish this?</li></p>


<p><b>Place all of the sales personnel user accounts in an OU, and then delegate control of the OU to the manager of the Sales department.</b></p>

<p><li> What happens to the permissions of an object when you move it from one OU to another OU?</li></p>


<p><b>Permissions assigned directly to the object remain the same. The object also inherits permissions from the new OU. Any permissions previously inherited from the old OU no longer affect the object.</b></p>


<p><li> The Delegation Of Control Wizard allows you to set administrative control at what level?</li></p>


<p><b>OU or container.</b></p>


<p><li> When backing up Active Directory, what type of data must you specify to be backed up? What is included in this data type?</li></p>


<p><b>You must indicate that you need to back up System State data. For Windows 2000 Server operating systems, the System State data comprises the registry, COM+ Class Registration database, system boot files, and the Certificate Services database (if the server is a certificate server). If the server is a domain controller, Active Directory and the SYSVOL directory are also contained in the System State data.</b></p>


<p><li> When you restart the computer in Directory Services Restore Mode, what logon must you use? Why?</li></p>


<p><b>When you restart the computer in Directory Services Restore Mode, you must log on as an Administrator by using a valid Security Accounts 
Manager (SAM) account name and password, <i>not</i> the Active Directory Administrator's name and password. This is because Active Directory is offline, and account verification cannot occur. Rather, the SAM accounts database is used to control access to Active Directory while it is offline. You specified this password when you set up Active Directory.</b></p>

</ol>

<A NAME="949"><h2>Review Questions</h2></A>
<ol>
<p><li> What is a GPO?</li></p>


<p><b>A GPO is a group policy object. Group policy configuration settings are contained within a GPO. Each Windows 2000 computer has one local GPO, and may in addition be subject to any number of nonlocal (Active Directory-based) GPOs.</b></p>

<p><b>One local GPO is stored on each computer whether or not the computer is part of an Active Directory environment or a networked environment. Local GPO settings can be overridden by nonlocal GPOs.</b></p>

<p><b>Nonlocal GPOs are linked to Active Directory objects (sites, domains, or OUs) and can be applied to either users or computers. To use nonlocal GPOs, you must have a Windows 2000 domain controller installed. 
Following the properties of Active Directory, nonlocal GPOs are applied hierarchically from the least restrictive group (site) to the most restrictive group (OU) and are cumulative.</b></p>


<p><li> What are the two types of group policy settings and how are they used?</li></p>


<p><b>The two types of group policy settings are computer configuration settings and user configuration settings. Computer configuration settings are used to set group policies applied to computers, regardless of who logs onto them. Computer configuration settings are applied when the operating 
system initializes. User configuration settings are used to set group policies applied to users, regardless of which computer the user logs on to. User configuration settings are applied when users log on to the computer.</b></p>


<p><li> In what order is group policy implemented through the Active Directory structure?</li></p>


<p><b>Group policy is implemented in the following order: site, domain, and then OU.</b></p>


<p><li> Name the tasks for implementing group policy.</li></p>


<p><b>The tasks for implementing group policy are: creating a GPO, creating a snap-in for the GPO, delegating administrative control of the GPO, specifying group policy settings for the GPO, disabling unused group policy settings, indicating any GPO processing exceptions, filtering the scope of the GPO, and linking the GPO to a site, domain, or OU.</b></p>


<p><li> What is the difference between Block Policy Inheritance and No Override?</li></p>


<p><b>Block Policy Inheritance is applied directly to the site, domain, or OU. It is not applied to GPOs, nor is it applied to GPO links. Thus Block Policy Inheritance deflects <i>all</i> group policy settings that reach the site, domain, or OU from above (by way of linkage to parents in the Active Directory hierarchy) no matter what GPOs those settings originate from. GPO links set to No Override are always applied and cannot be blocked using the Block Policy Inheritance option.</b></p>

<p><b>Any GPO linked to a site, domain, or OU (not the local GPO) can be set to No Override with respect to that site, domain, or OU, so that none of its policy settings can be overwritten. When more than one GPO has been set to No Override, the one highest in the Active Directory hierarchy (or higher in the hierarchy specified by the administrator at each fixed level in Active Directory) takes precedence. No Override is applied to the 
GPO link.</b></p>


<p><li> What is the difference between assigning software and publishing software?</li></p>


<p><b>Assign a software application when you want everyone to have the application on his or her computer. An application can be published to both computers and users.</b></p>

<p><b>Publish a software application when you want the application to be available to people managed by the GPO, should the person want the application. With published applications it is up to each person to decide whether or not to install the published application. An application can only be published to users.</b></p>


<p><li> What folders can be redirected?</li></p>

<p><li> On which computer do you set an audit policy to audit a folder that is located on a member server that belongs to a domain?</li></p>


<p><b>You set the audit policy on the member server; the audit policy must be set on the computer where the folder is located.</b></p>


<p><li> What is the difference between what the audit policy settings track for directory service access and object access?</li></p>


<p><b>Directory service access tracks if a user gained access to an Active 
Directory object. Object access tracks if a user gained access to a file, folder, or printer.</b></p>


<p><li> When you view a security log, how do you determine if an event failed or was successful?</li></p>


<p><b>Successful events appear with a key icon. Unsuccessful events appear with a lock icon.</b></p>


<p><li> How are user rights different from permissions?</li></p>


<p><b>User rights are different from permissions because user rights apply to user accounts and permissions are attached to objects.</b></p>


<p><li> What is a security template and why is it useful?</li></p>

<p><li> What is the difference between a counter log and a trace log?</li></p>


<p><b>Counter logs collect performance counter data for a specified interval. Trace logs record data collected by the operating system provider or one or more nonsystem providers when certain activities such as a disk I/O operation or a page fault occur. When counter logs are in use, the Performance Logs and Alerts service obtains data from the system when the 
update interval has elapsed, rather than waiting for a specific event, as for trace logs.</b></p>

<p><li> What is RIS? What types of remote booting are supported by RIS?</li></p>


<p><b>Remote Installation Services (RIS) are software services that allow an 
administrator to set up new client computers remotely without having to visit each client. The target clients must support remote booting. There are two types of remote boot-enabled client computers: Computers with Pre-Boot eXecution Environment (PXE) DHCP-based remote boot ROMS and computers with network cards supported by the RIS 
Boot Disk.</b></p>


<p><li> What does PXE remote boot technology provide?</li></p>


<p><b>Pre-Boot eXecution Environment (PXE) is a new form of remote boot technology that has been created within the computing industry. PXE provides companies with the ability to use their existing TCP/IP network infrastructure with DHCP to discover RIS servers on the network. Net PC/PC98-compliant systems can take advantage of the remote boot 
technology included in the Windows 2000 OS. Net PC/PC98 refers to the 
annual guide for hardware developers co-authored by Microsoft with Intel, including contributions from Compaq and other industry hardware manufacturers. PC98 is intended to provide standards for hardware development that advance the PC platform and enable Microsoft to 
include advanced features, like RIS, in the Windows platform.</b></p>


<p><li> What is the RIS boot disk?</li></p>


<p><b>For computers that do not contain a PXE-based remote boot ROM, 
Windows 2000 provides the administrator with a tool to create a remote boot disk for use with RIS. The RIS remote boot disk can be used with a variety of PCI-based network adapter cards. Using the RIS boot disk eliminates the need to retrofit existing client computers with new network cards that contain a PXE-based remote boot ROM to take advantage of the Remote OS Installation feature. The RIS boot disk simulates the PXE remote boot sequence and supports frequently used network cards.</b></p>


<p><li> What is an RIPrep image?</li></p>


<p><b>The Remote Installation Preparation (RIPrep) imaging option allows a network administrator to clone a standard corporate desktop configuration, complete with OS configurations, desktop customizations, and 
locally installed applications. After first installing and configuring the Windows 2000 Professional OS, its services, and any standard applications on a computer, the network administrator runs a wizard that 
prepares the installation image and replicates it to an available RIS server on the network for installation on other clients.</b></p>


<p><li> What is the CIW?</li></p>


<p><b>Users of a remote boot-enabled client use the Client Installation Wizard (CIW) to select installation options, OSs, and maintenance and troubleshooting tools. The wizard prompts the user for his or her user name, password, and domain name. After the user's credentials have been 
validated, the wizard displays the installation options that are available for the user. After the user selects an option, the selected OS installation 
image is copied to the client computer's local hard disk.</b></p>

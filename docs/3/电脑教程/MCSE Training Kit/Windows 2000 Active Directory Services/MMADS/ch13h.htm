<tr>
<th colspan="2">Symptom: Received error message: Event message: Event ID 1202, 
Event source: scecli, Warning (0x%x) occurs to apply security policies</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Cause</th>

<tr>
<td valign="top">The most likely causes for this error are network-related.</td>
<td valign="top">Check the DNS configuration for the following: Make sure that there are no stale entries 
 in the DNS database. Resolve local DNS 
 servers and Internet service provider (ISP) 
 DNS server entries. For example, the DNS 
 settings for a local LAN network adapter 
 points to two DNS servers: the local 
 DNS server (possibly the same computer) 
 and the DNS server of an ISP. If you try to 
 ping your domain, a message may indicate 
 that this is an unknown host. Even with 
 correct local DNS entries, the ISP DNS 
 server cannot identify your domain, so there 
 is a difference in their databases. To resolve 
 this error, remove the second and add the 
 ISP DNS server <i>IPAddress</i> to the forwarders 
 in the local DNS server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th colspan="2">Symptom: Modified security settings are not taking effect</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Cause</th>
<th>Solution</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Any policies configured locally  
may be overridden by like  
policies specified in the domain. 
If your setting shows up in local 
policy but not in effective policy, 
it implies that there is a policy 
from the domain that is overriding 
your setting. Also, as group policy 
changes are applied periodically, 
it is likely that the policy changes 
made in the directory have not 
yet been refreshed in your computer.</td>
<td valign="top">Manually do a policy refresh by typing the following at the command line: <b>secedit/refreshpolicy machine_policy</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th colspan="2">Symptom: Policies do not migrate from Windows NT 4.0 to Windows 2000</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Cause</th>
<th>Solution</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Windows NT 4.0 policies cannot be migrated to Windows 2000. In Windows NT 4.0, system policies were stored in one .pol file with group information embedded; no method is available to translate that information to the Windows 2000 Active Directory structure. Groups are handled very differently in Windows 2000.</td>
<td valign="top">Windows NT 4.0 clients accessing a Windows 2000 
Server computer and Windows 2000 Professional 
clients accessing a Windows NT 4.0 Server com- 
puter will use the Netlogon share (the Windows 
NT 4.0 model). With Windows 2000 Server, 
when a Windows NT 4.0 client is upgraded to 
Windows 2000, it will get only Active Directory- 
based group policy settings and not Windows NT 
4.0-style policies. Although Windows NT 4.0- 
style policies may be enabled (using a group 
 policy setting) if the administrator chooses to do 
 so, this practice is strongly discouraged. Windows 
 NT 4.0-style policies are applied only during the 
 logon process. This means that both computer and 
 user settings are processed. This is not optimal 
 behavior for the following reasons: The Windows 
 NT 4.0-style computer settings override the group 
 policy settings that have already been applied to 
 the computer during startup. During the group 
 policy settings refresh cycle, the group policy 
 settings change any conflicting settings back. 
 This creates an indeterminate state. Windows NT 
 4.0-style policies result in persistent settings in 
 the registry (tattooing). Note also that Terminal 
 Server cannot allow computer settings to be set 
 based on a user logon.</td>

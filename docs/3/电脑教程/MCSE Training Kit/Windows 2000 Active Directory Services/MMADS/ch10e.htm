<A NAME="487"><h1>Lesson 4: Combining Shared Folder Permissions and NTFS Permissions</h1></A>
<p>You share folders to provide network users with access to resources. If you are using a FAT 
volume, the shared folder permissions are all that is available to provide security for the folders 
you have shared and the folders and files they contain. If you are using an NTFS volume, you can 
assign NTFS permissions to individual users and groups to better control access to the files and 
subfolders in the shared folders. When you combine shared folder permissions and NTFS permissions, 
the more restrictive permission is always the overriding permission. This lesson introduces you to 
strategies for combining shared folder and NTFS permissions, and provides shared folder management 
practice.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li>Combine shared folder permissions and NTFS permissions</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 45 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="488"><h3>Strategies for Combining Shared Folder Permissions and NTFS Permissions</h3></A>
<p>One strategy for providing access to resources on an NTFS volume is to share folders with the 
default shared folder permissions and then control access by assigning NTFS permissions. When you 
share a folder on an NTFS volume, both shared folder permissions and NTFS permissions combine to 
secure file resources.</p>

<p>Shared folder permissions provide limited security for resources. You gain the greatest 
flexibility by using NTFS permissions to control access to shared folders. Also, NTFS permissions 
apply whether the resource is accessed locally or over the network.</p>

<p>When you use shared folder permissions on an NTFS volume, the following rules apply:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>You can apply NTFS permissions to files and subfolders in the shared folder. You can apply 
different NTFS permissions to each file and subfolder that a shared folder contains.</li></p>

<p><li>In addition to shared folder permissions, users must have NTFS permissions for the files and 
subfolders that shared folders contain to gain access to those files and subfolders. This is in 
contrast to FAT volumes, where permissions for a shared folder are the only permissions protecting 
files and subfolders in the shared folder.</li></p>

<p><li>When you combine shared folder permissions and NTFS permissions, the more restrictive 
permission is always the overriding permission.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>In Figure 10.9, the Users group has the shared folder Full Control permission for the Public 
folder and the NTFS Read permission for FileA. The Users group's effective permission for FileA is 
Read because Read is the more restrictive permission. The effective permission for FileB is Full 
Control because both the shared folder permission and the NTFS permission allow this level of 
access.</p>

<A NAME="489"><h2>Practice: Managing Shared Folders</h2></A>
<p>In this practice you determine users' effective permissions, plan shared folders, plan 
permissions, share a folder, assign shared folder permissions, connect to a shared folder, stop 
sharing a folder, and test the combined effects of shared folder permissions and NTFS 
permissions.</p>

<p>

in the domain is ideal. However, you can still perform the steps if you have one 
computer.</blockquote></div>

<A NAME="490"><h3>Exercise 1: Combining Permissions</h3></A>
<p>Figure 10.10 shows examples of shared folders on NTFS volumes. These shared folders contain 
subfolders that also have been assigned NTFS permissions. Determine a user's effective permissions 
for each example.</p>

<ol>
<p><li>In the first example, the Data folder is shared. The Sales group has the shared folder Read 
permission for the Data folder and the NTFS Full Control permission for the Sales 
subfolder.</li></p>

<p>What are the Sales group's effective permissions for the Sales subfolder when Sales group 
members gain access to the Sales subfolder by making a connection to the Data shared folder?</p>

<p><li>In the second example, the Users folder contains user home folders. Each user home folder 
contains data that is only accessible to the user for whom the folder is named. The Users folder 
has been shared, and the Users group has the shared folder Full Control permission for the Users 
folder. User1 and User2 have the NTFS Full Control permission for only their home folder and no 
NTFS permissions for other folders. These users are all members of the Users group.</li></p>

<p>What permissions does User1 have when he or she accesses the User1 subfolder by making a 
connection to the Users shared folder? What are User1's permissions for the User2 subfolder?</p>
</ol>

<A NAME="491"><h3>Exercise 2: Planning Shared Folders</h3></A>
<p>In this exercise you plan how to share resources on servers in the main office of a 
manufacturing company. Record your decisions in Table 10.6 at the end of this exercise.</p>

<p>Figure 10.11 illustrates a partial folder structure for the servers at the manufacturing 
company.</p>

<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('10wtk11x.htm')"> <img src="images/10wtk11.jpg" width=404 height=323 border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!-- caption --><b>Figure 10.11</b> <i>Partial folder structure for the servers at a manufacturing Company</i><!-- /caption -->
</p>


<p>You need to make resources on these servers available to network users. To do this, 
determine which folders to share and what permissions to assign to groups, including the 
appropriate built-in groups.</p>

<p>Base your planning decisions on the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Members of the Managers group need to read and revise documents in the Management Guidelines 
folder. Nobody else should have access to this folder.</li></p>

<p><li>Administrators need complete access to all shared folders, except for Management 
Guidelines.</li></p>

<p><li>The Customer Service department requires its own network location to store working files. 
All customer service representatives are members of the Customer Service group.</li></p>

<p><li>All employees need a network location to share information with each other.</li></p>

<p><li>All employees need to use the spreadsheet, database, and word processing software.</li></p>

<p><li>Only members of the Managers group should have access to the project management 
software.</li></p>

<p><li>Members of the CustomerDBFull group need to read and update the customer database.</li></p>

<p><li>Members of the CustomerDBRead group need to read the customer database only.</li></p>

<p><li>Each user needs a private network location to store files. This location must be accessible 
by that user only.</li></p>

<p><li>Share names must be accessible from Windows 2000, Windows NT, Windows 95, and non-Windows 
NT-based platforms.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="498"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>In this lesson you learned that you share folders to provide network users with access 
to resources. On a FAT volume, the shared folder permissions are all that is available to 
provide security for the folders you have shared and for the folders and files they contain. 
On an NTFS volume, you can assign NTFS permissions to individual users and groups to better 
control access to the files and subfolders in the shared folders. You also learned that when 
you combine shared folder permissions and NTFS permissions, the more restrictive permission 
is always the overriding permission.</p>

<p>In the practice portion of this lesson, you created and shared folders, stopped sharing a 
folder, created folders, applied NTFS permissions, and then shared the folders. If you have a 
second computer, you were able to test how the shared folder permissions and NTFS permissions 
combined to provide access to resources.</p>

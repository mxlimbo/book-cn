<A NAME="424"><h1>Lesson 2: Assigning NTFS Permissions</h1></A>
<p>There are certain guidelines you should follow for assigning NTFS permissions. Assign permissions according to group and user needs; this includes allowing or preventing permissions inheritance from parent folders to subfolders and files that are contained in the parent folder. This lesson presents guidelines for 
planning NTFS permissions and then walks you through the steps of assigning NTFS permissions.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li> Plan what permissions to assign to users or groups for applications and data folders</li></p>

<p><li> Assign NTFS folder and file permissions to user accounts and groups</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 60 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="425"><h2>Planning NTFS Permissions</h2></A>
<p>If you take the time to plan your NTFS permissions and follow a few guidelines, you will find that NTFS permissions are easy to manage. Use the following guidelines when you assign NTFS permissions:</p>

<ol>
<p><li> To simplify administration, group files into application, data, and home folders. Centralize home and public folders on a volume that is separate from applications and the operating system. Doing so provides the following benefits:</li></p>

<ul>
<p><li> You assign permissions only to folders, not to individual files.</li></p>

<p><li> Backup is less complex because there is no need to back up application files, and all home and public folders are in one location.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><li> Allow users only the level of access that they require. If a user only needs to read a file, assign the Read permission to his or her user account for the file. This reduces the possibility of users accidentally modifying or deleting important documents and application files.</li></p>

<p><li> Create groups according to the access that the group members require for resources, and then assign the appropriate permissions to the group. Assign permissions to individual user accounts only when necessary.</li></p>

<p><li> When you assign permissions for working with data or application folders, assign the Read &amp; Execute permission to the Users group and the Administrators group. This prevents application files from being accidentally deleted or damaged by users or viruses.</li></p>

<p><li> Turn off the permissions inheritance option at the home directory level. This allows the user to consider permissions for each file or folder in the home directory.</li></p>

<p><li> When you assign permissions for public data folders, assign the Read &amp; Execute permission and the Write permission to the Users group, and the Full Control permission to CREATOR OWNER identity group. The user who creates a file is by default the creator and owner of the file. After you create a file, you may grant another user permission to take ownership of the file. The person who takes ownership would then become the owner of the file. If you assign the Read &amp; Execute permission and the Write permission to the Users group, and the Full Control permission to CREATOR OWNER, users have the ability to read and modify documents that other users create and the ability to read, modify, and delete the files and folders that they create.</li></p>

<p><li> Deny permissions only when it is essential to deny specific access to a specific user account or group.</li></p>

<p><li> Encourage users to assign permissions to the files and folders that they create and educate them about how to do so.</li></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="426"><h2>Setting NTFS Permissions</h2></A>
<p>By default, when you format a volume with NTFS, the Full Control permission is assigned to the Everyone group. You should change this default permission and assign other appropriate NTFS permissions to control the access that users have to resources. Be careful if you assign permissions to the Everyone group and 
enable the Guest account. Windows 2000 will authenticate a user who does not have a valid user account as Guest. The user automatically gets all rights and 
permissions that you have assigned to the Everyone group.</p>

<A NAME="427"><h3>Assigning or Modifying Permissions</h3></A>
<p>Administrators, users with the Full Control permission, and the owners of files and folders (CREATOR OWNER) can assign permissions to user accounts and groups.</p>

<p><li><b>To assign or modify NTFS permissions for a file or a folder</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li> Right-click the file or folder for which you want to assign permissions, then click Properties.</li></p>

<p><li> In the Security tab (see Figure 9.3) of the Properties dialog box for the file or folder, configure the options that are described in Table 9.3.</li></p>

<p>By default, subfolders and files inherit permissions that you assign to their parent folder. This is indicated in the Security tab in the Properties dialog box by a check in the Allow Inheritable Permissions From Parent To Propagate To This Object check box. If the check boxes under Permissions are shaded, then the file or folder has inherited permissions from the parent folder. To prevent a subfolder or file from inheriting permissions from a parent folder, clear the Allow Inheritable Permissions From Parent To Propagate To This Object check box. If you clear this check box, you are prompted to select one of the options described in Table 9.4.</p>

<A NAME="429"><h2>Practice: Planning and Assigning NTFS Permissions</h2></A>
<p>In this practice you plan NTFS permissions for folders and files based on a business scenario. Then you apply NTFS permissions for folders and files on your computer based on a second scenario. Finally, you test the NTFS permissions that you set up to make sure that they are working properly.</p>

<A NAME="430"><h3>Exercise 1: Planning NTFS Permissions</h3></A>
<p>In this exercise you plan how to assign NTFS permissions to folders and files on a computer running Windows 2000 Server, based on the scenario described in the next section.</p>

<A NAME="431"><h3>Scenario</h3></A>
<p>The default NTFS folder and file permissions are Full Control for the Everyone group. Figure 9.4 shows the folder and file structure used for this practice. You need to review the following security criteria and record the changes that you should make to the NTFS folder and file permissions to meet the security criteria.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/09wtk04.JPG" width=138 height=166>
</p><p>
<!-- caption --><b>Figure 9.4</b> <i>Folder and file structure for practice</i><!-- /caption -->
</p>


<p>To plan NTFS permissions, you must determine the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> What groups to create and what built-in groups to use</li></p>

<p><li> What permissions users will require to gain access to folders and files</li></p>

<p><li> Whether or not to clear the Allow Inheritable Permissions From Parent To Propagate To This Object check box for the folder or file for which you are assigning permissions</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Keep the following general guidelines in mind:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> NTFS permissions that are assigned to a folder are inherited by all of the folders and files that it contains. To assign permissions for all of the folders and files in the Apps folder, you need only assign NTFS permissions to the Apps folder.</li></p>

<p><li> To assign more restrictive permissions to a folder or file that is inheriting permissions, you must either deny the unwanted permissions or block inheritance by clearing the Allow Inheritable Permissions From Parent To Propagate To This Object check box.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>The decisions that you make are based on the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> In addition to the default built-in groups, the following groups have been created in the domain:</li></p>

<ul>
<p><li> Accounting</li></p>

<p><li> Managers</li></p>

<p><li> Executives</li></p>
</ul>

<p><li> Administrators require the Full Control permission for all folders and files.</li></p>

<p><li> All users will run programs in the WordProc folder, but they should not be able to modify the files in the WordProc folder.</li></p>

<p><li> Only members of the Accounting, Managers, and Executives groups should be able to read documents in the Spreadsh and Database application folders by running the associated spreadsheet and database applications, but they should not be able to modify the files in those folders.</li></p>

<p><li> All users should be able to read and create files in the Public folder.</li></p>

<p><li> All users should be prevented from modifying files in the Public\Library folder.</li></p>

<p><li> Only USER81 should be able to modify and delete files in the Public\Manuals folder.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>When you apply custom permissions to a folder or file, which default permission entry should you remove?</p>

<p>Complete Table 9.5 to plan and record your permissions.</p>

<A NAME="437"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>In this lesson you learned that by default, when you format a volume with NTFS, the Full Control permission is assigned to the Everyone group. You learned that you should change this default permission and assign other appropriate NTFS permissions to control the access that users have to resources. You learned that Administrators, the owners of files or folders, and users with Full Control permission can assign NTFS permissions to users and groups to control access to files and folders. You learned how to assign or modify NTFS permissions for a file or a folder by using the Security tab of the Properties dialog box for the file or folder.</p>

<p>You also learned that by default, subfolders and files inherit permissions that you assign to their parent folder, and you learned how to disable this feature so that subfolders and files do not inherit the permissions assigned to their parents. In the practice exercises, you created some folders, assigned NTFS permissions, and then tested the permissions you set up to determine if you set them up correctly.</p>

<p>The following questions are intended to reinforce key information presented in this chapter. If you are unable to answer a question, review the appropriate lesson and then try the question again. Answers to the questions can be found in <A HREF="chaaa.htm#861">Appendix A</a>, &quot;Questions and Answers.&quot;</p>

<ol>
<p><li>You have used the Compact utility to compress the files contained in the Users subfolders on an NTFS partition. You have enabled the Folder Option, Display Compressed Files And Folders With Alternate Color. A week later you use Windows Explorer to see if files are being compressed. To your surprise, user account subfolders, located directly under the Users folder created after you ran the compress utility, are not compressed. Why did this happen and how can you fix it?</li></p>

<p><li>Your department has recently archived several GB of data from a computer running Windows 2000 Server to CD-ROMs. As users have added files to the server, you have noticed that the server has been taking longer than usual to gain access to the hard disk. How can you increase disk access time for the server?</li></p>

<p><li>You are the administrator for a computer running Windows 2000 Server that is used to store user's home folders and roaming user profiles. You want to restrict users to 25 MB of available storage for their home folder while monitoring, but not limiting, the disk space used for the roaming user profiles. How should you configure the volumes on the server?</li></p>

<p><li>You notice that a new server is not performing as well as you expected. You need to obtain summary information on a server's performance, and then you want to use a utility to obtain detailed reports of performance bottlenecks. After you have resolved the performance problem, what should you do to track the performance of the server as more users begin to access the server?</li></p>

<p><li>You want to filter out all network traffic except for traffic between two computers, and you also want to locate specific data within the packets. Which Network Monitor filter features should you specify?</li></p>

<p><li>You goal is to make sure that only two network management stations in your organization are able to communicate with the SNMP agents. What measures can you take when configuring the SNMP service to enhance security?</li></p>

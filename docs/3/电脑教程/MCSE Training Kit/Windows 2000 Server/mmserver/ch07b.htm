<A NAME="290"><h1>Lesson 1: Using the Microsoft Management Console</h1></A>
<p>One of the primary administrative tools you use to manage Windows 2000 is the MMC. The MMC provides a standardized method to create, save, and open administrative tools. It unifies and simplifies day-to-day management tasks. The MMC does not provide management functions itself, but it is the program that hosts management applications called snap-ins, which you use to perform one or more administrative tasks.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b> 

<ul>
<p><li>Describe the function and components of MMC, including snap-ins and console options</li></p>

<p><li>Create a custom MMC console</li></p>
</ul>

<b>Estimated lesson time: 45 minutes</b> 
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="291"><h2>The MMC Environment</h2></A>
<p>MMC is a common console framework for management applications. MMC consoles can run on Windows 2000, Windowsç‡¦T 4.0, Windows 98, and Windows 95.</p>

<p>The MMC itself does not provide management capability but does provide a common environment for <i>snap-ins,</i> the tools that support the actual management functionality. The MMC environment provides seamless integration among the various snap-ins, even those provided by different vendors. Administrators can create tools that include multiple snap-ins and then save the tools for later use or to share with other administrators.</p>

<p>The MMC allows you to do the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Perform most administrative tasks by using only the MMC</b> Being able to use one interface instead of numerous interfaces saves time.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Centralize administration</b> You can use MMC consoles to perform the majority of your administrative tasks from one computer.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Use most snap-ins for remote administration</b> Not all snap-ins are available for remote administration, so Windows 2000 prompts you with a dialog box when you can use the snap-in for remote administration.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Build a customized console</b> MMC provides for the creation of specialized consoles containing all or part of multiple snap-ins. These custom consoles can then be distributed to support groups in order to delegate administrative tasks.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
MMC 1.1 did not support more than one snap-in, while MMC 1.2 in Windows 2000 supports multiple snap-ins in a single console window.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="292"><h3>The MMC Window</h3></A>
<p>At first glance, an MMC user interface looks and feels much like a version of Windows Explorer. The components of an MMC console are contained in the MMC window. This window has several menus and a toolbar that provides commands to open, create, and save MMC consoles. The menu and toolbar are called the <i>main menu bar</i> and the <i>main toolbar</i>. In addition, there is a status bar at the bottom of the window and a description bar along the top of the details pane. The parent window contains the child windows, which are the actual MMC consoles.</p>

<p>The MMC, as shown in Figure 7.1, can be configured to contain powerful management tools. MMC is also designed to offer a scaled-down view that is much less complex to less-experienced administrators.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 7.1</b> <i>The MMC window</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<A NAME="293"><h3>MMC Consoles</h3></A>
<p>An MMC console is a set of one or more snap-ins. Consoles are saved as files that use an .msc extension. Each console file is represented as a child window in the MMC interface. An MMC console file contains the console tree, which displays the hierarchical organization of multiple snap-ins contained within the file. All the settings for the snap-ins contained in the console are saved and are restored when the file is opened, even if the console file is opened on a different computer or network.</p>

<p><b>Console Window</b></p>

<p>A console window (child window), which is an interface to an MMC console file, offers many differing views. Each console window includes a command bar, a console tree (left pane), and a detail pane (right pane). The console window in the background of Figure 7.2 shows three snap-ins, and the foreground window is a child window of the Computer Management console.</p>

<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('f07xx02x.htm')"> <img src="images/f07xx02.jpg" border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 7.2</b> <i>An MMC console containing multiple snap-ins, and a child window</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>The command bar contains both pull-down menus and buttons. The following table describes the console window menus.</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Menu  </th>
<th>Description  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Action  </td>
<td valign="top">Create, delete, and modify the items that are managed by the snap-in. Specific functions vary depending on the active snap-in.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">View   </td>
<td valign="top">Configure the snap-in display.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Favorites  </td>
<td valign="top">Organize snap-ins or nodes of snap-ins, or manage folders that contain MMC objects. These components then appear under the Favorites tab. The Favorites tab is behind the Tree tab in Figures 7.1 and 7.2.  </td></tr>
</table></p>


<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
Additional pull-down menu items will appear for some objects in the console tree. For example, Figure 7.2 shows that when the System Information node is selected from the console tree, a Tools pull-down menu appears.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>The console tree, also referred to as the scope pane, organizes snap-ins that are part of an MMC console. This organization allows you to locate a specific snap-in easily. Items that you add to the console tree appear under the console root. The console tree displays the tool's namespace and the tree-formatted listing of all visible nodes, each of which represents a manageable object, task, or view. The console tree might not be visible in all views.</p>

<p>Each detail pane, also referred to as the results pane, displays the results of selecting a node in the console tree. In many cases, it is a list of a folder's contents, but in other cases, it is a management related view, which can be Web-based or ActiveX control-based.</p>

<p><b>Types of MMC Consoles</b></p>

<p>There are two types of MMC consoles: customized and preconfigured.</p>

<p><b>Customized MMC Consoles</b></p>

<p>You can combine one or more snap-ins or parts of snap-ins to create customized MMC consoles, which can then be used to centralize and combine administrative tasks. MMC allows administrators to perform the following tasks:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Saving the customized MMC to use again</li></p>

<p><li>Distributing to and sharing the customized MMC with other administrators</li></p>

<p><li>Using the customized MMC from any computer to centralize and unify administrative tasks</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Although you can use many of the preconfigured MMC consoles for administrative tasks, sometimes you will need to create your own custom MMC consoles. You can combine multiple preconfigured snap-ins with third-party snap-ins provided by independent software vendors (ISVs) that perform related tasks to create custom MMC consoles. Creating custom MMC consoles allows you to meet your administrative requirements by combining snap-ins that you use to perform common administrative tasks. By creating a custom MMC console, you do not have to switch between different programs or different preconfigured MMC consoles because all the snap-ins you need to perform your job are located in the custom MMC console.</p>

<p>By default, Windows 2000 saves customized MMC files in the My Administrative Tools folder with an .msc file extension. If the My Administrative Tools folder does not exist, Windows 2000 creates it. Windows 2000 saves the My Administrative Tools folder contents separately for each user.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
For more information about creating MMC consoles, see the Supplemental Course Materials CD-ROM (\chapt07\articles\microsoft management console.doc) that accompanies this book.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p><b>Preconfigured MMC Consoles</b></p>

<p>When Windows 2000 is installed, preconfigured MMC consoles are also installed. These MMC consoles contain commonly used snap-ins that are used to perform administrative tasks. Preconfigured MMC consoles cannot be modified nor can additional snap-ins be added.</p>

<p>Preconfigured MMC consoles contain only one snap-in that provides the functionality to perform a related set of administrative tasks. The consoles function in user mode, which means that you cannot modify them, save them, or add additional snap-ins. User mode operation is indicated by the absence of the MMC console pull-down menus (Console, Window, and Help) and the absence of the MMC toolbar objects. Also, MMC consoles are sometimes added when you install additional components. For example, when you install the Domain Name System (DNS) service, Windows 2000 also installs the DNS console.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
To select preconfigured MMC consoles, click the Start button, point to Programs, and then click Administrative Tools.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>Which MMC consoles are installed on a computer varies depending on which Windows 2000 operating system is running and which Windows 2000 components are installed. Windows 2000 Server and Windows 2000 Professional have different preconfigured MMC consoles that appear on the Administrative Tools menu. The preconfigured MMC consoles included in Windows 2000 Server can be added to Windows 2000 Professional to enable remote administration of server functions. A convenient way to add all the Windows 2000 Server administrative tools is by running Adminpak.msi from the Windows 2000 Server installation CD-ROM.</p>

<A NAME="294"><h2>Snap-Ins</h2></A>
<p>Each MMC console is made up of a collection of smaller tools called snap-ins. <i>Snap-ins</i> are applications designed to work in MMC. One snap-in represents one unit of management functionality. A snap-in is the smallest unit of console extension. A snap-in extends the MMC console by adding and enabling management capability and functionality. You can use snap-ins to perform a variety of administrative tasks. There are two types of snap-ins: stand-alone and extension. Figure 7.3 shows the Add/Remove Snap-In dialog box, which is accessed from the MMC console menu. Both types of snap-ins are added from this dialog box.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 7.3</b> <i>The Add/Remove Snap-In dialog box showing how snap-in extensions are adjusted from the Extensions tab</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<A NAME="295"><h3>Stand-Alone Snap-Ins</h3></A>
<p>Stand-alone snap-ins are usually referred to simply as snap-ins. Use stand-alone snap-ins to perform Windows 2000 administrative tasks. Each snap-in provides one function or a related set of functions. Windows 2000 Server comes with standard snap-ins. Windows 2000 Professional includes a smaller set of standard snap-ins.</p>

<A NAME="296"><h3>Extension Snap-Ins</h3></A>
<p>Extension snap-ins are usually referred to as extensions. They provide additional administrative functionality to another snap-in. Extensions are designed to work with one or more stand-alone snap-ins, based on the function of the stand-alone snap-in. When you add an extension, Windows 2000 displays only extensions that are compatible with the stand-alone snap-in. Windows 2000 places the extensions into the appropriate location within the stand-alone snap-in. Some snap-ins, such as Event Viewer, can act as a snap-in or an extension.</p>

<p>Extensions can provide a variety of functionality. Some actually extend the console namespace. For example, a snap-in that provides system information about computers would add that system information to the namespace under each computer in the namespace. Other extensions simply extend context menus or specific wizards.</p>

<p>Many snap-ins offer stand-alone functionality while extending the functionality of other snap-ins. For example, the Event Log snap-in will read the event logs of computers. If the Computer Management object exists in the console, Event Log automatically extends each instance of a Computer Management object and provides the event logs for the computer. Alternatively, the event log can also operate in Stand-alone mode, in which case it does not appear as a node below the Computer Management node.</p>

<A NAME="297"><h2>Console Options</h2></A>
<p>An MMC console holds snap-ins that perform specific tasks. Console options determine how an MMC console operates. By using console options, you can create MMC consoles for other administrators to use from their computers to perform specific tasks. The Console mode determines the MMC console functionality for the person who is using a saved MMC console. There are two available Console modes: author mode and user mode.</p>

<A NAME="298"><h3>Author Mode</h3></A>
<p>When you save an MMC console in author mode, you enable full access to all MMC functionality, which includes modifying the MMC console. An MMC console that has been saved in author mode allows users to do the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Add or remove snap-ins</li></p>

<p><li>Create new windows</li></p>

<p><li>View all portions of the console tree</li></p>

<p><li>Save MMC consoles</li></p>
</ul>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
By default, all new MMC consoles are saved in author mode.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="299"><h3>User Mode</h3></A>
<p>If you plan to distribute an MMC console to other administrators, you should usually save the MMC console in user mode. When you set an MMC console to user mode, users cannot add snap-ins to, remove snap-ins from, or save the MMC console.</p>

<p>There are three types of user modes. Each type provides a different level
of access and functionality. The following table describes when to use each user mode.</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Type of user mode  </th>
<th>Description  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Full Access  </td>
<td valign="top">Allows users to navigate between snap-ins, open new windows, and gain access to all portions of the console tree.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Limited Access, Multiple Windows  </td>
<td valign="top">Prevents users from opening new windows or gaining access to a portion of the console tree, but allows them to view multiple windows in the console.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Limited Access, Single Window  </td>
<td valign="top">Prevents users from opening new windows or gaining access to a portion of the console tree, and allows them to view only one window in the console.  </td></tr>

<A NAME="300"><h3>Exercise 1: Navigating and Creating a Custom MMC</h3></A>
<p>In this exercise, you use one of the MMC consoles included with Windows 2000 Server. Then you create a customized MMC console.</p>

<p><li> <b>Procedure 1: Using an existing MMC console</b></li></p>

<p>In this procedure, you use MMC consoles that ship with Windows 2000 Server. Complete this exercise from Server01.</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Log on as Administrator with a password of &quot;password.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click Event Viewer.</li></p>


<p>Windows 2000 displays the Event Viewer console, which gives you access to the contents of the Event Log service files on your computer. You use Event Viewer to monitor various hardware and software activities.</p>

<p>Notice that a number of logs are listed. The logs always appearing when Windows 2000 Server is installed are the Application log, Security log, and System log. Additional logs appear as additional services are added. You should see the Directory Service log because Server01 is configured to run Active Directory services, a DNS Server log because it is configured to run as a DNS server, and a File Replication Service log because Server01 is running FRS.</p>


<p><li>Close the Event Viewer console.</li></p>
</ol>

<p><li> <b>Procedure 2: Creating and manipulating a customized MMC console</b></li></p>

<A NAME="301"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>

<p>One of the primary administrative tools you use to manage Windows 2000 Server is the MMC, which provides a standardized method to create, save, and open administrative tools. These tools, called MMC consoles, hold one or more snap-ins, which are management applications used to perform administrative tasks. By default, Windows 2000 saves custom MMC console files with the .msc extension in the Administrative Tools folder. Every MMC console has a console tree, which displays the hierarchical organization of the snap-ins contained in that console, and a details pane, which lists the contents of the active snap-in. There are two types of snap-ins: stand-alone and extension. A stand-alone snap-in provides one function or a related set of functions. An extension snap-in adds administrative functionality to a stand-alone snap-in. Each console can be configured to operate in one of two modes: user mode or author mode. User mode prevents other users from adding or removing snap-ins to the console or saving the
console. Author mode enables full access to all MMC functionality. Consoles can be customized and distributed to users running in the network.</p>

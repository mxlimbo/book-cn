<p>This lesson introduces you to the family of Windows 2000 products, which includes Windows 2000 Professional, Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Advanced Server, and Windows 2000 Datacenter Server. The lesson goes on to describe the features and benefits of Windows 2000, with a focus on features specific to Windows 2000 Professional and Windows 2000 Server.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b> 

<ul>
<p><li>Describe the key features of the four editions of Windows 2000 and identify how these editions differ from one another</li></p>
</ul>

<b>Estimated lesson time: 15 minutes</b> 
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="35"><h2>Editions of Windows 2000</h2></A>
<p>Windows 2000 is a multipurpose operating system with integrated support for client/server and peer-to-peer networks. The Windows 2000 family of products has been designed to increase reliability, deliver higher levels of system availability, and provide for scalability from a small network to a large enterprise network. Windows 2000 incorporates technologies that reduce the total cost of ownership by allowing organizations to increase the value of their existing investments while lowering overall computing costs. In addition, Windows 2000 incorporates comprehensive Internet and applications support, building on the success of Windows NT Server 4.0 as an Internet-aware, application-enabled server operating system.</p>

<p>Microsoft has released four editions of Windows 2000: Windows 2000 Professional, Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Advanced Server, and Windows 2000 Datacenter Server. These products support an advanced PC-based, client/server infrastructure that lowers costs and allows an organization to adapt quickly to change. The Windows 2000 platform provides administrators with more control over their networks and client/server infrastructure, maximizing flexibility while supporting the kind of centralized control typically associated with a mainframe/terminal model.</p>

<A NAME="36"><h3>Windows 2000 Professional</h3></A>
<p>Windows 2000 Professional is the main Microsoft desktop operating system for businesses of all sizes. It is a high-performance, secure-network client computer and corporate desktop operating system that incorporates the best business features of Windows 98 and builds in the traditional strengths of Windows燦T Workstation. Windows 2000 Professional includes a simplified user interface, plug and play capabilities, enhanced power management, and support for a broad range of hardware devices. In addition, Windows 2000 Professional significantly extends the manageability, reliability, and security of Windows燦T because of its new file encryption system and application management tools.</p>

<A NAME="37"><h3>Windows 2000 Server</h3></A>
<p>Windows 2000 Server is a file, print, and application server, as well as a Web-server platform, and contains all the features of Windows 2000 Professional plus many new server-specific functions. At the core of Windows 2000 is a complete set of infrastructure services based on Active Directory services. Active Directory services centralizes the management of users, groups, security services, and network resources. Windows 2000 Server supports uniprocessor systems to four-way symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) systems with up to 4 gigabytes (GB) of physical memory. It includes the multipurpose capabilities required for workgroups and branch offices as well as for departmental deployments of file and print servers, application servers, Web servers, and communication servers. Windows 2000 Server is ideal for small-to-medium sized enterprise application deployments.</p>

<A NAME="38"><h3>Windows 2000 Advanced Server</h3></A>
<p>Windows 2000 Advanced Server is a more powerful departmental and application server operating system that includes the full feature set of Windows 2000 Server and adds the advanced high availability and improved scalability required for enterprise and larger departmental solutions. Windows 2000 Advanced Server supports eight-way SMP and integrates high-availability two-way clustering, and it is ideal for database-intensive work. Hardware that is designed around the Intel Physical Address Extensions (PAEs) allows Windows 2000 Advanced Server to take advantage of more physical memory.</p>

<A NAME="39"><h3>Windows 2000 Datacenter Server</h3></A>
<p>Windows 2000 Datacenter Server is a specialized high-end version of Windows 2000 Server designed for large-scale enterprise solutions. Windows 2000 Datacenter Server is optimized for large data warehouses, econometric analysis, large-scale simulations in science and engineering, online transaction processing (OLTP), and server consolidation projects. It is also ideal for large-scale Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Web site hosting. Windows 2000 Datacenter Server includes the full feature set of Windows 2000 Advanced Server, providing load balancing services and enhancing clustering services by supporting four-way clustering. It is a specialized high-end version of Windows 2000 Server that supports up to 16-way SMP and up to 32-way SMP through original equipment manufacturer (OEM) operating system enhancements.</p>

<A NAME="40"><h2>Features of Windows 2000</h2></A>

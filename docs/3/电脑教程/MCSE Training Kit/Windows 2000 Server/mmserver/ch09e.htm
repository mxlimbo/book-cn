<A NAME="467"><h1>Lesson 4: Windows Internet Naming Service</h1></A>
<p>This lesson explains the purpose and function of WINS and name registration. It also covers the WINS server and client configuration, support for non-WINS clients, and how to use the DHCP snap-in to configure WINS on a DHCP client computer.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b> 

<ul>
<p><li>Explain the purpose and function of the WINS process, including name registration, renewal and name release, and name query</li></p>

<p><li>Implement WINS in a Windows 2000 environment</li></p>
</ul>

<b>Estimated lesson time: 35 minutes</b> 
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="468"><h2>Introduction to WINS</h2></A>
<p>In a mixed network environment, down-level clients, such as computers running Windows 98 or Windows NT 4.0, use Network Basic Input/Output System (NetBIOS) names to communicate. As a result, a Microsoft Windows 2000 network with down-level clients requires a means of resolving NetBIOS names to IP addresses. WINS is an enhanced NetBIOS name server that registers NetBIOS computer names and resolves them to IP addresses. WINS also provides a dynamic database that maintains mapping of computer names to IP addresses.</p>

<p><img src="images/cd.JPG" border="0"></p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
For more information about WINS, see the Supplemental Course Materials CD (\chapt09\articles\WINS2000.doc) that accompanies this book.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="469"><h3>The WINS Name Resolution Process</h3></A>
<p>The WINS name resolution process allows WINS clients to register their name and IP address with WINS servers. WINS clients can query the WINS servers to locate and communicate with other resources on the network.</p>

<p>The following steps outline the WINS name resolution process:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Every time a WINS client starts, it registers its NetBIOS name/IP address mapping with a designated WINS server. It then queries the WINS server for computer name resolution.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
A WINS client automatically updates the WINS database whenever its IP addressing information changes, for example, when dynamic addressing through the DHCP Service results in a new IP address for a computer that moved from one subnet to another.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<ol>
<p><li value="2">When a WINS client initiates a NetBIOS command to communicate with another network resource, it sends the name query request directly to the WINS server instead of broadcasting the request on the local network.</li></p>

<p><li>The WINS server finds a NetBIOS name/IP address mapping for the destination resource in this database, and it returns the IP address to the WINS client.</li></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="470"><h3>Name Registration</h3></A>
<p>Each WINS client is configured with the IP address of a primary WINS server and, optionally, a secondary WINS server. When a client starts, it registers its NetBIOS name and IP address by sending a name registration request directly to the configured WINS server.</p>

<p>If the WINS server is available and another WINS client has not registered the name already, the WINS server returns a successful registration message to the client. This message includes the amount of time that the NetBIOS name is registered to the client, specified as the Time to Live (TTL). In addition, the WINS server stores the client's NetBIOS name/IP address mapping in its database.</p>

<p><b>When a Name Is Already Registered</b></p>

<p>When a name is already registered in the WINS database, the WINS server sends a name query request to the currently registered owner of the name. The WINS server sends the request three times at 500-millisecond intervals. If the registered computer is a multihomed computer, which means it has more than one network adapter card bound to TCP/IP and has an IP address for each network adapter card, the WINS server tries each IP address it has for the computer until it receives a response or until it has tried all the IP addresses.</p>

<p>If the current registered owner responds successfully to the WINS server, the WINS server sends a negative name registration response to the WINS client that is attempting to register the name. However, if the current registered owner does not respond to the WINS server, the WINS server sends a successful name registration response to the WINS client that is attempting to register the name.</p>

<p><b>When the WINS Server Is Unavailable</b></p>

<p>A WINS client makes three attempts to find the primary WINS server. If the client fails after the third attempt, it sends the name registration request to the secondary WINS server (if one is configured for the client). If neither server is available, the client generates three B-node broadcasts on the local network. If the NetBIOS name is found on the local network, the name is resolved to an IP address.</p>

<A NAME="471"><h3>Name Renewal</h3></A>
<p>A WINS server registers all NetBIOS names on a temporary basis so that other computers can use the same name later if the original owner stops using it. Since client name registrations with a WINS server are temporary, a WINS client must renew its name or the lease will expire.</p>

<p>To continue using the same NetBIOS name, a client must renew its lease before the lease expires. If a client does not renew its lease, the WINS server makes the lease available for another WINS client.</p>

<p>A WINS client first attempts to refresh its lease after one-eighth of the TTL interval has expired. If the WINS client does not receive a name refresh response, it continues attempting to refresh its lease every two minutes, until half of the TTL interval has expired.</p>

<p>When half of the TTL interval has expired, the WINS client attempts to refresh its lease with a secondary WINS server, if one is configured. When switching to a secondary WINS server, the WINS client attempts to refresh its lease as if it were the first refresh attempt&#8212;every one-eighth of the TTL interval until successful or until half the TTL interval has expired (four tries). The WINS client then reverts to the primary WINS server.</p>

<p>When a WINS server receives the name refresh request, it sends the client 
a name refresh response with a new TTL. After a client successfully 
refreshes its lease once, it attempts to refresh its lease when half the TTL interval has expired.</p>

<A NAME="472"><h3>Name Release</h3></A>
<p>When a WINS client's name is no longer in use, the client sends a message to the WINS server to release the name. When you shut down a WINS client properly, the client sends a name release request directly to the WINS server for each registered name. The request includes the client's IP address and the NetBIOS name.</p>

<p>When the WINS server receives the name release request, it checks its database for the specified name. If the WINS server encounters a database error, or if a different IP address maps the registered name, it sends a negative name release to the WINS client. Otherwise, the WINS server sends a positive name release, and then the server designates the specified name as released in its database. The name release response contains the released NetBIOS name and a TTL value of 0.</p>

<A NAME="473"><h3>Name Query</h3></A>
<p>After a WINS client has registered its NetBIOS name and IP address with a WINS server, it can communicate with other hosts by obtaining the IP address of other NetBIOS-based computers from the WINS server.</p>

<p>By default, a WINS client attempts to resolve another host's NetBIOS name to an IP address in the following manner:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>The client checks its NetBIOS name cache for the NetBIOS name/IP address mapping of the destination computer.</li></p>

<p><li>If the client cannot resolve the name from its cache, it sends a name query request directly to its primary WINS server.</li></p>

<p><li>If the primary WINS server is unavailable, the client resends the request two more times before switching to the secondary WINS server.</li></p>

<p><li>If either WINS server, primary or secondary, resolves the name, it sends a response to the client with the IP address for the requested NetBIOS name.</li></p>

<p><li>If no WINS server can resolve the name, the client receives a message saying that the requested name does not exist and initiates a network broadcast.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
All WINS communications use directed datagrams over UDP port 137 (NetBIOS Name Service).</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="474"><h2>Implementing WINS</h2></A>
<p>To implement WINS, you must install and configure WINS on a computer running Windows 2000 Server. In addition, you must configure selected options on computers that participate as WINS clients.</p>

<A NAME="475"><h3>WINS Server Configuration</h3></A>
<p>A WINS server requires a computer running Windows 2000 Server; however, the server does not have to be a domain controller. In addition, the server must be configured with WINS and assigned a static IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway.</p>

<p>The WINS server can also include the following configurations:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>A static mapping for all non-WINS clients to allow communication with WINS clients on remote networks</li></p>

<p><li>WINS support through the DHCP Service</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="476"><h3>WINS Client Configuration</h3></A>
<p>A WINS client must be running one of the following operating systems:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Windows 2000</li></p>

<p><li>Windows NT Server 3.5 or later</li></p>

<p><li>Windows NT Workstation 3.5 or later</li></p>

<p><li>Windows 98</li></p>

<p><li>Windows 95</li></p>

<p><li>Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 running Microsoft TCP/IP-32</li></p>

<p><li>Microsoft Network Client version 3.0 for Microsoft MS-DOS with the real-mode TCP/IP driver</li></p>

<p><li>LAN Manager version 2.2c for MS-DOS (LAN Manager version 2.2c for OS/2 is not supported.)</li></p>
</ul>

<p>A WINS client also requires the IP address of a primary WINS server, and, optionally, the IP address of a secondary WINS server.</p>

<A NAME="477"><h3>WINS Installation</h3></A>
<p>The WINS Service is not installed as part of the default Windows 2000 Server installation. You must add the service, as outlined below. To install the WINS Service, use the Add/Remove Programs utility in Control Panel.</p>

<p>After you install the WINS Service on the Windows 2000 Server computer, you should configure its TCP/IP properties so that the computer points to itself. You do this on the WINS tab of the Advanced TCP/IP Settings dialog box.</p>

<A NAME="478"><h3>The WINS Snap-In</h3></A>
<p>You can use the WINS snap-in, shown in Figure 9.8, for all management and configuration tasks of the WINS server. The WINS snap-in provides access 
to detailed information about the WINS servers on a network. The snap-in also allows you to view the contents of the WINS database and search for specific entries.</p>

<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('f09xx08x.htm')"> <img src="images/f09xx08.jpg" border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 9.8</b> <i>The WINS snap-in</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>You can access the WINS snap-in as a stand-alone MMC console or through the Computer Management snap-in, under Services And Applications. WINS must be installed before you can use the Windows 2000 snap-in.</p>

<A NAME="479"><h3>Support for Non-WINS Clients</h3></A>
<p>In a WINS environment, you can provide support for non-WINS clients by using static mappings and configuring a WINS proxy agent.</p>

<p><b>Static Mappings</b></p>

<p>On a network that includes non-WINS clients, you can configure a static NetBIOS name/IP address mapping for each non-WINS client. This ensures that WINS clients can resolve the NetBIOS names of the non-WINS clients.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
If you have DHCP clients that require a static mapping, you must reserve an IP address for the DHCP client so that its IP address is always the same.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>To configure a static entry for non-WINS clients, select Active Registrations and then select New Static Mapping from the Action menu. When you create a static mapping, you can specify a NetBIOS scope. A NetBIOS scope is an optional extension to a computer name that you can use to group computers in a network.</p>

<p>There are five types of static mappings that you can create when you add a 
new static mapping. These types of static mappings are described in the following table.</p>

<p><table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr>
<th>Option</th><th>Description</th>
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Unique</td> <td valign="top">A unique name that maps to a single IP address.</td></tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Group</td> <td valign="top">A name that maps to a group. When adding an entry to a group by using the WINS snap-in, enter the computer name and IP address. The IP addresses of group members are not stored in the WINS database, so there is no limit to the number of members you can add.</td></tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Domain Name</td> <td valign="top">A NetBIOS name/IP address mapping with 0x1C as the 16th byte. A domain group stores up to 25 addresses for members. For registrations after the 25th address, WINS overwrites a replica address or, if none is present, overwrites the oldest registration.</td></tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Internet Group</td> <td valign="top">User-defined groups that you use to group resources, such as printers, for reference and browsing. An Internet group can store up to 25 addresses for members. A dynamic member, however, does not replace a static member that you add by using the WINS snap-in or by importing the LMHOSTS file.</td></tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Multihomed</td> <td valign="top">A unique name that can have more than one address. Use this option for computers with multiple network adapter cards. You can register up to 25 multihomed addresses. For registrations after the 25th address, WINS overwrites a replica address or, if none is present, it overwrites the oldest registration.</td></tr></table></p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
The WINS snap-in adds a static mapping to the WINS database when you click OK. If you enter incorrect information for a static mapping, you must delete that mapping and then create a new one.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p><b>Configuring a WINS Proxy Agent</b></p>

<p>A WINS proxy agent extends the name resolution capabilities of the WINS server to non-WINS clients by listening for broadcast name registrations and broadcast resolution requests and then forwarding them to a WINS server.</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>NetBIOS name registration</b> When a non-WINS client broadcasts a name registration request, the WINS proxy agent forwards the request to the WINS server to verify that no other WINS client has registered that name. The NetBIOS name does not get registered, only verified.</li></p>

<p><li><b>NetBIOS name resolution</b> When a WINS proxy agent detects a name resolution broadcast, it checks its NetBIOS name cache and attempts to resolve the name. If the name is not in cache, the request is sent to a WINS server. The WINS server sends the WINS proxy agent the IP address for the requested NetBIOS name. The WINS proxy agent returns this information to the non-WINS client.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>To configure a WINS proxy agent, edit the registry on a WINS-enabled client by setting the value for the EnableProxy entry to 1, and then restart the computer. The EnableProxy entry is located in the registry under the subkey HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\ 
NetBT\Parameters.</p>

<A NAME="480"><h3>DHCP Server Configuration</h3></A>
<p>If a computer is a DHCP client, you can configure WINS support by using the DHCP snap-in. The snap-in allows you to add and configure the DHCP scope option 044 WINS/NBNS Servers and configure the address of primary and secondary servers (Figure 9.9).</p>

<p>
<img src="images/f09xx09.jpg" border="0">
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 9.9</b> <i>The Scope Options dialog box in the DHCP snap-in</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>When the DHCP client leases or renews an address lease, it receives this DHCP scope option, and the client is configured for WINS support.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
If you configure a client computer with IP addresses for a primary and secondary WINS server, those values take precedence over the same parameters provided by a DHCP server.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>You also can configure the 046 WINS/NBT Node Type option to set the node type. Node types include B-node, P-node, M-node, and H-node.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
For more information about node types, see RFC 1001 and RFC 1002. An RFC (Request for Comment) is a document in which a standard, a protocol, or other information pertaining to the operation of the Internet is published. The RFC is actually issued after discussion and serves as the standard. You can find the text of each RFC that is cited in this book (as well as much associated discussion material) on the Internet. Use your Web browser to search for the RFC of interest. In this case, search for &quot;RFC 1001&quot; and then search for &quot;RFC 1002.&quot; (Earlier chapters included RFCs so that you could see how they are structured.)</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p><img src="images/practic.JPG" border="0"></p>

<A NAME="481"><h3>Exercise 3: Installing and Configuring WINS</h3></A>
<p>In this exercise, you will install WINS on Server01. After the installation, additional settings will be configured for the DHCP Service to support WINS. Make sure the Windows 2000 Server installation CD is running on Server01.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
WINS is required only for legacy support. In your small training network and in a homogeneous network of Windows 2000 clients and servers, WINS is not necessary because all computers running Windows 2000 use DNS for name resolution. This exercise is intended to teach you how to perform a basic installation and configuration of WINS.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p><li><b>Procedure 1: Installing WINS</b></li></p>


<p>In this procedure, you install WINS on Server01.</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Log on to Server01 as Administrator with a password of &quot;password.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li>Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.</li></p>

<p><li>Double-click Add/Remove Programs.</li></p>

<p>The Add/Remove Programs window appears.</p>

<p><li>Click Add/Remote Windows Components in the left frame.</li></p>

<p>The Windows Components wizard appears.</p>

<p><li>In the Components box, click Networking Services, but do not click or change the status of the check box to the left of this option.</li></p>

<p><li>Click Details.</li></p>

<p>The Networking Services dialog box appears.</p>

<p>In the Subcomponents Of Networking Services box, select the Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) check box.</p>

<p><li>Click OK.</li></p>

<p>The Windows Components screen appears.</p>

<p><li>Click Next.</li></p>

<p>The Configuring Components screen makes the configuration changes you requested. A File Copy box will appear as WINS files are copied into the operating system folders.</p>

<p>The Completing The Windows Components Wizard screen appears.</p>

<p><li>Click Finish.</li></p>

<p><li>Close the Add/Remove Programs window.</li></p>

<p><li>Close Control Panel.</li></p>
</ol>

<p><li><b>Procedure 2: Configuring DHCP to support WINS</b></li></p>


<p>In this procedure, you configure WINS settings in the DHCP snap-in on Server01. To give you practice with setting server options, you will use the Server Options node. These settings could also be configured as Scope options if you want them to apply only to a specific scope or even to a specific DHCP client.</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Open the DHCP snap-in on Server01.</li></p>

<p><li>In the console tree, click Server Options.</li></p>

<p><li>Read the message appearing in the details pane.</li></p>

<p><li>Click the Action menu, and then choose Configure Options.</li></p>

<p>The Server Options dialog box appears.</p>

<p><li>Scroll down to 044 WINS/NBNS Servers, and then click this check box.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Server name text box, type <b>Server01</b> and then click Resolve.</li></p>

<p>Server01's IP address, 192.168.1.201, appears in the IP Address box.</p>

<p><li>Click Add.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Available Options box, scroll down to 046 WINS/NBT Node Type and then click this check box.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Byte text box, type <b>8</b> so that the text box entry reads: 0x8.</li></p>

<p>0x8 sets the node type to h-node. Node type determines how WINS resolution occurs at a client computer. H-node instructs the client to check with the WINS server (p-node point-to-point communications with name server) first and then sends out a b-node broadcast if necessary.</p>

<p><li>Click OK.</li></p>

<p>The two server options appear in the details pane.</p>

<p><li>Close the DHCP snap-in.</li></p>
</ol>

<p><li><b>Procedure 3: Testing WINS settings (optional)</b></li></p>


<p>In this procedure, you release and renew the DHCP lease on Server02. Then you load the WINS snap-in on Server01 to verify the registration of Server02 in the WINS database.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
If you just started Server02, skip to step 4. The first three steps are only necessary to update the DHCP lease.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<ol>
<p><li>On Server02, open a command prompt.</li></p>

<p><li>Type <b>ipconfig /release</b>, and then press Enter.</li></p>

<p>A message appears stating that the IP address successfully released for the adapter &quot;Local Area Connection.&quot;</p>

<p><li>Type <b>ipconfig /renew</b>, and then press Enter.</li></p>

<p>The IP configuration is displayed as the lease is renewed.</p>

<p><li>Type <b>ipconfig /all | more</b>, and then press Enter.</li></p>

<p><li>Press Enter as necessary so that you can see the settings for &lt;<i>adapter type</i>&gt; adapter Local Area Connection.</li></p>

<p><li>Notice that Node Type is set to Hybrid. Hybrid is equivalent to h-node. Also notice that the primary WINS server is set to 192.168.1.201. This is the IP address of Server01.</li></p>

<p><li>Close the command prompt on Server02.</li></p>

<p><li>On Server01, click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click WINS.</li></p>

<p>The WINS snap-in appears.</p>

<p><li>Maximize the WINS snap-in.</li></p>

<p><li>Expand SERVER01 [192.168.1.201], and then click Active Registrations.</li></p>

<p><li>Read the message appearing in the details pane.</li></p>

<p><li>Click the Action menu, and then click Find By Name.</li></p>

<p>The Find By Name dialog box appears.</p>

<p><li>In the Find Names Beginning With text box, type <b>Ser</b> and then click find now.</li></p>


<p>Under Record Name, Server02 appears with three entries. These three entries are the services that broadcast the name of Server02 onto the network. The first entry, 00h, is the NetBIOS computer name. 03h is used for sending and receiving broadcast messages. 20h is used for share access by other computers on the network.</p>

<p><li>Close the WINS snap-in.</li></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="482"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>Name registration is an important part of the name resolution process. Each WINS client is configured with the IP address of a primary WINS server and, optionally, a secondary WINS server. Each time a WINS client starts, it registers its NetBIOS name and IP address by sending a name registration request directly to the configured WINS server. A WINS server registers all NetBIOS names on a temporary basis, so a WINS client must renew its name or the lease will expire. When a WINS server receives the name refresh request, it sends the client a name refresh response with a new TTL. In addition, when a WINS client's name is no longer in use, the client sends a message to the WINS server to release the name. When the WINS server receives the name release request, it checks its database for the specified name. If the WINS server finds the correct NetBIOS name/IP address mapping in its database, it sends a positive name release, and then the server designates the specified name as released in its database.
To implement WINS, you must install and configure WINS on a computer running Window 2000 Server. In addition to installing WINS, you must configure selected options on computers that participate as WINS clients. The WINS snap-in provides access to detailed information about the WINS servers on a network and allows you to view the contents of the WINS database and search for specific entries.</p>

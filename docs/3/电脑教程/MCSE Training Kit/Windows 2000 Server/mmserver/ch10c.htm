<A NAME="521"><h1>Lesson 2: Features of the Routing and Remote Access Service</h1></A>
<p>RRAS for Windows 2000 includes a wide variety of features that support unicast and multicast IP routing, IPX routing, AppleTalk routing, remote access, and VPN support.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b> 

<ul>
<p><li>Describe the primary features of Windows 2000 RRAS</li></p>
</ul>

<b>Estimated lesson time: 25 minutes</b> 
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="522"><h2>Unicast IP Support</h2></A>
<p>Windows 2000 provides extensive support for unicast IP routing (routing to a unicast destination IP address) by using the unicast IP routing protocols and features of the Windows 2000 Router. Unicasting is where two computers establish a two-way, point-to-point connection in order to exchange data. Unicast IP routing is where a router or routers forward packets between a two-way, point-to-point connection. Your implementation of unicast routing can be simple or complex depending on the size of your IP internetwork, the use of Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to allocate IP address configuration, connectivity to the Internet, the presence of non-Microsoft or legacy hosts on your internetwork, and other factors.</p>

<p>The following table describes the various components of Unicast IP routing.</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Feature  </th>
<th>Description  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Static IP routing  </td>
<td valign="top">With this inherent function of the TCP/IP protocol for Windows 2000, you can manage static routes by using the Routing And Remote Access snap-in or netsh. The routemon utility is not supported in Windows 2000.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">RIP versions 1 and 2  </td>
<td valign="top">A distance-vector routing protocol commonly used in small and medium IP internetworks.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">OSPF  </td>
<td valign="top">A link-state routing protocol commonly used in medium to large IP internetworks. This protocol is significantly more efficient then RIP because more sophisticated algorithms are used to find the best route between two points.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">DHCP Relay Agent  </td>
<td valign="top"> An agent that relays DHCP messages between DHCP clients and DHCP servers on different network segments. This allows a DHCP server to service many network scopes. See RFC1542 for more information.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Network address translation (NAT) </td>
<td valign="top">A network address translator component that creates a  translated connection between privately addressed networks and the Internet. This allows addressing on an internal network that is not legal on the Internet but is still able to access the Internet.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">IP packet filtering  </td>
<td valign="top">The ability to define what traffic is allowed into and out of each interface based on filters defined by the values of source and destination IP addresses, TCP and UDP port numbers, ICMP types and codes, and IP protocol numbers. This is an important security feature.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">ICMP router discovery  </td>
<td valign="top">The ability to periodically advertise and respond to host router solicitations to support ICMP router discovery by hosts on a network segment.  </td></tr>
</table></p>


<A NAME="523"><h2>IP Multicast Support</h2></A>
<p>Windows 2000 supports the sending, receiving, and forwarding of IP multicast traffic. Multicast traffic is sent to a single host but is processed by multiple hosts who listen for this type of traffic destined for a single host. This is commonly used for delivering real-time data to multiple users, such as when delivering a distributed media presentation. The IP multicast components of RRAS allow you to send and receive IP multicast traffic from remote access clients and multicast-enabled portions of the Internet or a private intranet.</p>

<p>The following table describes the various components of IP multicast routing.</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Feature  </th>
<th>Description  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Multicast forwarding </td>
<td valign="top">With this inherent function of the TCP/IP protocol for Windows  2000, you can view the multicast forwarding table by using the Routing And Remote Access snap-in or you can use the netsh command-line utility.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">IGMP versions 1 and 2 </td>
<td valign="top">The TCP/IP protocol to track multicast group membership on
 attached network segments.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Specific forwarding and routing</td>
<td valign="top">When you use the IGMP routing protocol and configure interfaces for IGMP Router mode and IGMP Proxy mode, the  Windows 2000 router can support multicast forwarding and routing for specific configurations.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Multicast boundaries  </td>
<td valign="top">Multicast boundaries (barriers to the forwarding of IP multicast traffic) can be based on the IP multicast group address, the Time-To-Live (TTL) in the IP header, or on the maximum amount of multicast traffic in kilobytes per second.  </td></tr>
</table></p>



<A NAME="524"><h2>IPX Support</h2></A>
<p>The Windows 2000 Server Router is a fully functional IPX router supporting RIP for IPX, the primary routing protocol used in IPX internetworks; Novell NetWare SAP for IPX, a protocol for the collection and distribution of service names and addresses; and NetBIOS over IPX broadcast forwarding.</p>

<p>The following table describes the various components of IPX routing.</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Feature   </th>
<th>Description  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">IPX packet filtering </td>
<td valign="top">The ability to define what traffic is allowed into and out of each  interface based on filters defined by the values of source and destination IPX network, node, socket numbers, and packet type.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">RIP for IPX  </td>
<td valign="top">A distance-vector-based routing protocol commonly used on IPX internetworks. RRAS also allows you to configure static IPX routes and RIP route filters.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">SAP for IPX  </td>
<td valign="top">SAP is a distance-vector-based advertising protocol commonly used on IPX internetworks to advertise services and their locations. RRAS also provides the ability to configure static SAP services and SAP service filters. SAP service filters reduce unneeded SAP traffic from being sent of RRAS connection.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">NetBIOS over IPX </td>
<td valign="top">NetBIOS over IPX is used by Microsoft networking components  to support file and printer sharing components. RRAS can also forward NetBIOS over IPX broadcasts and configure static NetBIOS names.  </td></tr>
</table></p>


<A NAME="525"><h2>AppleTalk</h2></A>
<p>Windows 2000 RRAS can operate as an AppleTalk router by forwarding AppleTalk packets and supporting the use of the Routing Table Maintenance Protocol (RTMP). Windows 2000 supports an AppleTalk protocol stack and AppleTalk routing software so that the Windows 2000-based server can connect to and provide routing for AppleTalk-based Macintosh networks.</p>

<p>Most large AppleTalk networks, like any large network, are not single physical networks in which all computers are attached to the same network cabling system. Instead, they are AppleTalk internets, which are smaller, physical networks connected by routers.</p>

<p>A Windows 2000-based server can provide routing and seed routing support. RRAS does not limit the number of network adapters on a computer that can support an AppleTalk network, which consists of multiple smaller physical networks connected by routers.</p>

<A NAME="526"><h2>Demand-Dial Routing</h2></A>
<p>Windows 2000 provides support for demand-dial routing, the routing of packets over point-to-point links such as analog telephone lines and ISDN. Demand-dial routing allows you to connect to the Internet, to connect branch offices, or to implement router-to-router VPN connections.</p>

<p>IP and IPX traffic can be forwarded over demand-dial interfaces over persistent or on-demand WAN links. For on-demand connections, RRAS automatically creates a PPP connection to the configured endpoint when traffic matching a static route is received.</p>

<A NAME="527"><h2>Remote Access</h2></A>
<p>RRAS enables a computer to be a remote access server, accepting remote access connections (dial-in) from remote access clients that use traditional dial-up technologies such as analog phone lines and ISDN. Remote access is discussed in detail in Lesson 3, &quot;<A HREF="ch10d.htm">Remote Access</A>.&quot;</p>

<A NAME="528"><h2>VPN Server</h2></A>
<p>RRAS enables a computer to be a VPN server, supporting both PPTP and L2TP over IPSec and accepting both remote access and router-to-router (demand-dial) VPN connections from remote access clients and calling routers. VPN is discussed in detail in Lesson 4, &quot;<A HREF="ch10e.htm#555">Virtual Private Networks</A>.&quot;</p>

<A NAME="529"><h2>RADIUS Client-Server</h2></A>
<p>The Internet Authentication Service (IAS) in Windows 2000 is the Microsoft implementation of a RADIUS server. IAS performs centralized authentication, authorization, auditing, and accounting (AAAA) of connections for dial-up and VPN remote access and demand-dial connections, and it can be used in conjunction with Windows 2000 RRAS. IAS enables the use of a single or multiple vendor network of remote access or VPN equipment.</p>

<p>Internet service providers (ISPs) and corporations maintaining remote access service for their employees are faced with the increasing challenge of managing all remote access from a single point of administration&#8212;regardless of the type of remote access equipment employed. The RADIUS standard supports this functionality in a homogeneous or heterogeneous environment. RADIUS is a client-server protocol, which enables remote access equipment acting as RADIUS clients to submit authentication and accounting requests to a
RADIUS server.</p>

<p>The RADIUS server has access to user account information and can check remote access authentication credentials. If the user's credentials are authentic and the connection attempt is authorized, the RADIUS server authorizes the user's access based on specified conditions and logs the remote access connections as accounting events.</p>

<p>RADIUS supports remote access user authentication and authorization and allows accounting data to be maintained in a central location, rather than on each network access server (NAS). Users connect to a RADIUS-compliant NAS computer, such as a Windows 2000-based computer that is running RRAS, which in turn forwards authentication requests to the centralized
IAS server.</p>

<A NAME="530"><h2>SNMP MIB Support</h2></A>
<p>Windows 2000 and RRAS provide Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) agent functionality with support for Internet MIB II (as documented in RFC 1213). Network Management Stations (NMS), such as HP OpenView, can compile the MIB to manage IP network layer events relating to Windows 2000 remote access router functions. The computer running RRAS must also be running the SNMP service, also called the SNMP agent, in order to be managed by an NMS. Beyond Internet MIB II, support for RRAS additional MIB
enhancements that can be compiled on the NMS to support RRAS include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>IP Forwarding Table MIB</li></p>

<p><li>Microsoft RIP version 2 for Internet Protocol MIB</li></p>

<p><li>Wellfleet-Series7-MIB for OSPF</li></p>

<p><li>Microsoft BOOTP for Internet Protocol MIB</li></p>

<p><li>Microsoft IPX MIB</li></p>

<p><li>Microsoft RIP and SAP for IPX MIB</li></p>

<p><li>Internet Group Management Protocol MIB</li></p>

<p><li>IP Multicast Routing MIB</li></p>
</ul>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
MIB support is also provided for Windows 2000 operating system functions, legacy LAN Manager MIB functions, and the WINS, DHCP, IIS services. IPX is also supported by the SNMP service; however, TCP/IP must be installed to allow for IPX SNMP support.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="531"><h2>API Support for Third-Party Components</h2></A>
<p>RRAS has fully published API sets for unicast and multicast routing protocol and administration utility support. Routing protocol developers can write additional routing protocols and interfaces directly into RRAS architecture. Other software vendors can also use RRAS administration APIs to provide their own management utilities.</p>

<A NAME="532"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>RRAS for Windows 2000 includes a wide variety of features. Windows 2000 supports unicast IP routing (routing to a unicast destination IP address); it also supports the sending, receiving, and forwarding of IP multicast traffic, and can act as a fully functional IPX router. In addition, RRAS supports AppleTalk, demand-dial routing, remote access, and VPN. A Windows 2000 Server computer can also act as a RADIUS server and can provide SNMP agent functionality. Finally, RRAS has fully published API sets for unicast and multicast routing protocol and administration utility support.</p>

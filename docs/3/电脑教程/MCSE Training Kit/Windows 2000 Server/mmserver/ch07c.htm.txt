<A NAME="302"><h1>Lesson 2: Administering User Accounts</h1></A>
<p>User accounts must be created to give users the ability to log on to a domain to access network resources or to log on to a computer to access resources on that computer. A <i>user account</i> is a user's unique credentials. It is a record that defines a user to Windows 2000. This includes the user name and password, if required, for the user to log on, the groups the user account has membership in, and the rights and permissions the user has for using the computer and network and for accessing resources. Each person who regularly uses the network is assigned a user account.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b> 

<ul>
<p><li>Describe the role and purpose of user accounts</li></p>

<p><li>Plan and create user accounts</li></p>

<p><li>Administer user accounts, including setting account properties</li></p>
</ul>

<b>Estimated lesson time: 60 minutes</b> 
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="303"><h2>Windows 2000 User Accounts</h2></A>
<p>A user account provides a user with the ability to log on to the domain to gain access to network resources or to log on to a computer to gain access to resources on that computer. Each person who regularly uses the network should have a user account.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 supports two types of user accounts: domain and local. With a domain user account, a user can log on to the domain to gain access to network resources. With a local user account, a user can log on to a specific computer to gain access to resources on that computer.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 also provides built-in user accounts, which are used to perform administrative tasks or to gain access to network resources.</p>

<A NAME="304"><h3>Domain User Accounts</h3></A>
<p>Domain user accounts allow users to log on to the domain and gain access to resources anywhere on the network. The user provides his or her password and user name during the logon process. By using this information, Windows 2000 authenticates the user and then builds an access token that contains information about the user and security settings. The access token identifies the user to computers running Windows 2000 on which the user tries to gain access to resources. Windows 2000 provides the access token for the duration of the logon session.</p>

<p>You create a domain user account in an organizational unit (OU) in a replica of the Active Directory store (called the directory) on a domain controller. The domain controller replicates the new user account information to all domain controllers in the domain.</p>

<p>After Windows 2000 replicates the new user account information, all the domain controllers in the domain tree can authenticate the user during the logon process.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
It can take a few minutes to replicate the domain user account information to all the domain controllers. This delay might prevent a user from immediately logging on by using the newly created domain user account. Replication of Active Directory information within a site (intrasite replication) occurs automatically every five minutes.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="305"><h3>Local User Accounts</h3></A>
<p>Local user accounts allow users to log on to and gain access to resources on only the computer where you create the local user account. When you create a local user account, Windows 2000 creates the account in that computer's security database only. Windows 2000 does not replicate local user account information to domain controllers. After the local user account is created, the computer uses its local security database to authenticate the local user account, which allows the user to log on to that computer.</p>

<A NAME="306"><h3>Built-In User Accounts</h3></A>
<p>Windows 2000 automatically creates accounts called built-in accounts. Two commonly used built-in accounts are Administrator and Guest. The operating system will not allow built-in accounts to be deleted or the built-in Administrator account to be disabled. However, built-in accounts can be renamed.</p>

<p><b>Administrator</b></p>

<p>Use the built-in Administrator account to manage the overall computer and domain configuration, such as creating and modifying user accounts and groups, managing security policies, creating printers, and assigning permissions and rights to user accounts to gain access to resources.</p>

<p>If you are the administrator, you should create a user account that you use to perform nonadministrative tasks. Use the Administrator account only when you perform administrative tasks. For convenience, use the run as command to run in the context of a more privileged account while logged on with a lesser privileged account. For example, to run MMC as an administrator while logged on with standard user rights, run the following command:</p>

<p><table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr><td>
<pre>runas user:&lt;domain_name&gt;\&lt;administrator_account&gt; mmc</pre>
</td></tr></table>
</p>

<p>If the Administrator account in the microsoft.com domain is named Administrator, the following command can be used to start the MMC as Administrator:</p>

<p><table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr><td>
<pre>runas /user:microsoft\administrator mmc</pre>
</td></tr></table>
</p>

<p>
<div class="tip"><blockquote><b>TIP</b><hr>
Rename the built-in Administrator account to provide a greater degree of security. Use a name that does not identify it as the Administrator account. This makes it difficult for unauthorized users to break into the Administrator account because they do not know which user account it is. For additional security, after you rename the built-in Administrator account, create another account named Administrator that has no rights to the system. This will frustrate a hacker's attempt to use the Administrator account to access the system.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p><b>Guest</b></p>

<p>Use the built-in Guest account to give occasional users the ability to log on and gain access to resources. For example, an employee who needs access to resources for a short time can use the Guest account.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
The Guest account is disabled by default. Enable the Guest account only in low-security networks and always assign it a password.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="307"><h2>Planning New User Accounts</h2></A>
<p>You can streamline the process of creating user accounts by planning and organizing the information for the user accounts. You should plan the following three areas:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Naming conventions for user accounts</li></p>

<p><li>Requirements for passwords</li></p>

<p><li>Account options, such as logon hours, the computers from which users can log on, and account expiration</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="308"><h3>Naming Conventions</h3></A>
<p>The naming convention establishes how users are identified in the domain. A consistent naming convention will help you and your users remember user logon names and locate them in lists.</p>

<p>The following table summarizes several points to consider in determining a naming convention for your organization:</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Consideration  </th>
<th>Explanation  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Unique user logon names </td>
<td valign="top">User logon names for domain user accounts must be unique  to the Directory. Domain user account names must be unique within the OU where you create the domain user account. Local user account names must be unique on the computer where you create the local user account.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">20 characters maximum </td>
<td valign="top">User logon names can contain up to 20 uppercase or  lowercase characters; the field accepts more than 20 characters, but Windows 2000 recognizes only the first 20.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Invalid characters  </td>
<td valign="top">The following characters are invalid: &quot; / \ [ ] : ; | = , + * ? &lt; &gt;  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">User logon names are not case sensitive</td>
<td valign="top">You can use a combination of special and alphanumeric  characters to help uniquely identify user accounts. User  logon names are not case sensitive, but Windows 2000 preserves the case.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Employees with duplicate names </td>
<td valign="top">If two users are named John Doe, you can use the first name  and the last initial and then add letters from the last name to differentiate the duplicate names. In this example, one user account logon name could be Johnd and the other Johndo. Another possibility would be to number each useR logon name, for example, Johnd1 and Johnd2.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Type of employee </td>
<td valign="top">In some organizations, it is useful to identify temporary employees by their user account. For example, to identify temporary employees, you can use a T and a dash in front of the user's logon name: T-Johnd. Or you might use a parenthetical phrase, such as John Doe (Temp).  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Service account naming conventions </td>
<td valign="top">Many background services require user accounts in order to  operate. Consider appending the name of the user account with  an abbreviated generic name such as svc for service or a service type name such as exc for a background account used by Microsoft Exchange services.  </td></tr>
</table></p>

<A NAME="309"><h3>Password Requirements</h3></A>
<p>To protect access to the domain or a computer, every user account should have a password. Consider the following guidelines for passwords:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Always assign a password for the Administrator account to prevent unauthorized access to the account.</li></p>

<p><li>Determine whether the administrator or the users will control passwords. You can assign unique passwords for the user accounts and prevent users from changing them, or you can allow users to enter their own passwords the first time they log on. In most cases, users should control their passwords.</li></p>

<p><li>Use passwords that are hard to guess. For example, avoid using passwords with an obvious association, such as a family member's name.</li></p>

<p><li>Passwords can be up to 128 characters; a minimum length of eight characters is recommended.</li></p>

<p><li>Use both uppercase and lowercase letters, numerals, and valid nonalphanumeric characters. The table above lists the invalid nonalphanumeric characters.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="310"><h3>Account Options</h3></A>
<p>You should assess the hours when a user can log on to the network and the computers from which a user can log on, and you should determine if temporary user accounts need to expire. To determine account options, consider the following information.</p>

<p><b>Logon Hours</b></p>

<p>Set logon hours to control when a user can log on to the domain. Restricting logon hours limits the hours that users can explore the network. By default, Windows 2000 permits access for all hours on all days. You might want to allow users to log on only during working hours. Setting logon hours reduces the amount of time that the account is open to unauthorized access.</p>

<p><b>Computers from Which Users Can Log On</b></p>

<p>Determine the computers that users can log on from. By default, users can log on to the domain by using any computer in the domain. For security, require users to log on to the domain only from their own computers. This prevents users from gaining access to sensitive information stored on other computers.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
If you have disabled NetBIOS over Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), Windows 2000 is unable to determine which computer you are logging on from, and therefore you cannot restrict users to specific computers. This is because this feature restricts access by computer name rather than Message Authentication Code address.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p><b>Account Expiration</b></p>

<p>Determine whether a user account should expire. If so, set an expiration date on the user account to ensure that the account is disabled when the user should no longer have access to the network. As a good security practice, you should set user accounts for temporary employees to expire when their contract ends.</p>

<A NAME="311"><h2>Creating User Accounts</h2></A>
<p>You can create two types of user accounts: domain and local.</p>

<A NAME="312"><h3>Creating Domain User Accounts</h3></A>
<p>Use the Active Directory Users And Computers snap-in to create a new domain user account. When you create a domain user account, it is always created on the first available domain controller contacted by MMC, and then the account is replicated to all domain controllers.</p>

<p>
<div class="tip"><blockquote><b>TIP</b><hr>
You can rapidly create many user accounts by creating and running scripts through the Windows Script Host (WSH). For information on WSH, open Windows 2000 Server Help and locate the book titled <i>Automating Administrative Tasks</i> and the chapter titled &quot;Windows Script Host.&quot;</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p><b>Active Directory Users And Computers Snap-In</b></p>

<p>The Active Directory Users And Computers snap-in allows you to create domain user accounts (Figure 7.4).</p>

<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('f07xx04x.htm')"> <img src="images/f07xx04.jpg" border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 7.4</b> <i>The Active Directory Users And Computers snap-in showing how to navigate to the New Object - User dialog box</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>You must select the OU to create the new account in. You can create the domain user account in the default Users OU or in an OU or in OUs that you create to hold domain user accounts.</p>

<p>To create a domain user account, open the Active Directory Users And Computers snap-in and select the Users OU. In the Action menu, point to New and then point to Users (Figure 7.4). Enter the user information in the New Object - User dialog box.</p>

<p>When you create the domain user account, User Logon Name defaults to the domain in which you are creating the domain user account, as shown in Figure 7.4. However, you can select any domain in which you have permissions to create domain user accounts.</p>

<p>The following table describes the domain user account options:</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Option  </th>
<th>Description  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">First Name  </td>
<td valign="top">The user's first name. This or Last Name is required.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Last Name  </td>
<td valign="top">The user's last name. This or First Name is required.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Full Name  </td>
<td valign="top">The user's full name. Windows 2000 completes this option if you enter information in First Name or Last Name. Windows 2000 displays this name in the OU where the user account is located in the Directory.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">User Logon Name  </td>
<td valign="top">The user's unique logon name, based on your naming conventions. This is required and must be unique within the directory.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">User Logon Name (pre-Windows 2000)  </td>
<td valign="top">The user's unique logon name used to log on from down-level clients, such as Windows NT 4.0 or Windows NT 3.51. This is required and must be unique within the domain.  </td></tr>
</table></p>


<p><b>Setting Password Requirements</b></p>

<p>When you are adding a new user account, you can enter a password for the user. In the New Object - User dialog box, click Next to open a second New Object - User dialog box. This screen contains password settings. In this dialog box, you set the password requirements for the domain user account. You do not have to enter a password for the user. If you don't enter a password, the user will be able to log on to the domain without a password.</p>

<p>The following table describes the password options:</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Option  </th>
<th>Description  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Password  </td>
<td valign="top">The password used to authenticate the user. For greater security, you should always assign a password. Notice that you do not see the password. It is represented as asterisks when you type it.  </td></tr>

<td valign="top">Confirm Password   </td>
<td valign="top">Confirm the password by typing it a second time to make sure you typed it correctly. This is required if you assign a password.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">User Must Change Password At Next Logon</td>
<td valign="top">Select this check box if you want the user to change his or  her password the first time he or she logs on. This ensures  that the user is the only person who knows the password.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">User Cannot Change Password </td>
<td valign="top">Select this check box if you have more than one person using  the same domain user account (such as Guest) or to maintain control over user account passwords. This feature is commonly used for background service account password control.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Password Never Expires  </td>
<td valign="top">Select this check box if the password should never change, for example, for a domain user account that will be used by a program or a Windows 2000 service. The Password Never Expires setting overrides the User Must Change Password At Next Logon setting. If both check boxes are selected, Windows 2000 will automatically clear the User Must Change Password At Next Logon check box.  </td></tr>

<A NAME="313"><h3>Exercise 2: Modifying Domain User Account Properties</h3></A>
<p>In Exercise 5, Procedure 1 of the <a href="ch06a.htm">previous chapter</a>, you created three user accounts. In this exercise, you use the Active Directory Users And Computers snap-in to manipulate the properties of the Jane_Doe, John_Smith, and Bob_Train user accounts. Complete all the procedures in the exercise from Server01.</p>

<p><li> <b>Procedure 1: Manipulating user accounts</b></li></p>

<p>In this procedure, you modify user account properties. You configure the Logon Hours, Account Expiration, and password restriction settings for several of the user accounts that you created in the <a href="ch06a.htm">previous chapter</a>. You add these user accounts to the Print Operators group so that the accounts can log on locally to the domain controller. You then test the Logon Hours restrictions, the password restrictions, and the Account Expiration Settings.</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Log on to Server01 as Administrator with a password of &quot;password.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li>Click Start, point to programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click Active Directory Users And Computers.</li></p>

</ol>

<p><li> <b>Procedure 3: Granting local logon access to user accounts</b></li></p>

<p>There are several ways to allow regular users to log on locally at a domain controller. In this procedure, you add the three users you created in the <a href="ch06a.htm">previous chapter</a> to the Print Operators group, because this group has the right to log on to a domain controller.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
A group is a collection of user accounts. Groups simplify administration by allowing you to assign permissions to a group of users rather than having to assign permissions to each individual user account. You will learn more about groups later in this chapter.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Log on as Administrator with a password of &quot;password.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li>Open Active Directory Users And Computers, and in the console tree, expand the Sales OU.</li></p>

<p><li>In the details pane, double-click the Jane Doe user account.</li></p>

<A NAME="314"><h3>Creating Local User Accounts</h3></A>
<p>A local user account allows a user to log on and access resources only on the computer for which you create the account. Use the Local Users And Groups snap-in to create local user accounts (Figure 7.5).</p>

<p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 7.5</b> <i>The Local Users And Groups snap-in and the New User dialog box</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>You can create local user accounts only on computers running Windows 2000 Professional and on stand-alone servers or member servers running Windows 2000 Server. Local user accounts are not stored in the directory for the domain; they are stored in the security database of the computer where you create them.</p>

<A NAME="315"><h2>Modifying Properties for User Accounts</h2></A>
<p>A set of default properties is associated with each domain user account and local user account created. Domain user accounts contain more properties than local user accounts. Local user account properties represent a subset of domain user account properties.</p>

<p>Properties that are defined for a domain user account can be used to search for users in the Active Directory store. For this reason, detailed property definitions for domain user accounts should be used. For example, a user knows a person's first name and telephone number and wants to find the person's last name. The user can use the telephone number to search for the last name.</p>

<p>The following properties should be configured for each domain user account based on the business requirements of each user:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Personal properties, including General, Address, Telephones, and organization properties</li></p>

<p><li>Account properties</li></p>

<p><li>Logon Hours properties</li></p>

<p><li>Log On To properties</li></p>
</ul>

<p>One way to modify a domain user account is to open the Active Directory Users And Computers snap-in and double-click the user object whose properties you want to modify.</p>

<p>One way to modify a local user account is to open the Computer Management snap-in and select Local Users And Groups. Double-click the user object whose properties you want to modify.</p>

<A NAME="316"><h3>The Properties Dialog Box</h3></A>
<p>The Properties dialog box for each user account contains a set of tabs that allows users to configure various properties for a specific user. All the tabs described below apply to domain user accounts. Only the General, Dial-In, Member Of, and Profile tabs apply to local user accounts.</p>

<p><b>Personal Properties Tabs</b></p>

<p>The personal properties tabs include the General, Address, Telephones, and Organization tabs. Completing the attributes on each of these tabs enables users and administrators to locate other users in Active Directory services.</p>

<p>The following table describes the personal properties tabs:</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Tab  </th>
<th>Description  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">General  </td>
<td valign="top">Use this tab to document the user's name, description, office location, telephone, e-mail name, and home page information.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Address  </td>
<td valign="top">Use this tab to document the user's street address, post office box, city, state or province, zip code, and country.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Telephones  </td>
<td valign="top">Use this tab to document the user's home, pager, mobile, fax, and IP telephone numbers, and to add comments.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Organization  </td>
<td valign="top">Use this tab to document the user's title, department, company manager, and direct reports.  </td></tr>
</table></p>


<p><b>Account Tab</b></p>

<p>The Account tab allows you to define a user's logon name and set other account options for the user account. Some of these options were set as default when the user object was created in the Active Directory store. You can modify these properties as well as configure the additional properties.</p>

<p><b>Profile Tab</b></p>

<p>User profiles automatically create and maintain the desktop settings for each user's work environment on the local computer. The Profile tab allows you to set a path to the network share where the user profiles are to be stored. In addition, you can assign a logon script and home folder for the user account.</p>

<p><b>Published Certificates Tab</b></p>

<p>A <i>certificate</i> is a collection of data used for authentication and secure exchange of information on nonsecured networks, such as the Internet. A certificate securely binds a public encryption key to the entity that holds the corresponding private encryption key. The Published Certificates tab allows you to create a list of X.509 certificates for the user account.</p>

<p><b>Member Of Tab</b></p>

<p>Groups are used to consolidate administrative tasks. For example, assign NTFS permissions to a group and then add users to the group. Each group member is affected by the rights assignment. The Member Of tab allows you to document the groups the user belongs to.</p>

<p><b>Dial-In Tab</b></p>

<p>The Dial-In tab allows you to control how a user can make a dial-in connection to the network from a remote location. To gain access to the network, the user dials in to a computer running the Windows 2000 Remote Access Service (RAS).</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
In addition to configuring dial-in settings and having RAS on the server the user is dialing in to, you must also set up a dial-up connection for the server on the client computer. Set up a dial-up connection by using the Network Connection wizard, which you can access from Network Connections in My Computer.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>The following table describes the required options for setting up security for a dial-up connection:</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Option  </th>
<th>Description  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Allow Access   </td>
<td valign="top">Specifies whether to enable dial-in settings.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Deny Access  </td>
<td valign="top">Specifies whether to disable dial-in settings.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Verify Caller-ID  </td>
<td valign="top">The telephone number that the user must dial in to.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">No Callback  </td>
<td valign="top">Specifies that the RAS server will not call the user back. This allows a user to call from any phone number. This is the default and is designed for a low-security environment or where other dial-in security methods are implemented.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Set By Caller (Routing and Remote Access Service only)</td>
<td valign="top">Specifies that the user provide the telephone number for  the RAS server to call back. This allows a user to call from  any phone number, and the RAS server calls the user back. This calling information can be logged. Use this feature for a medium-security environment.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Always Callback To  </td>
<td valign="top">Specifies that the RAS server calls back the user. The RAS server uses the specified telephone number. The user must be at the specified telephone number to make a connection to the server. This reduces the risk of an unauthorized person dialing in because the number is preconfigured. Use this option in a high-security environment.  </td></tr>
</table></p>


<p><b>Object Tab</b></p>

<p>The Object tab provides the fully qualified domain name of the object. It also provides additional information, such as the object class, the create and modified dates, the original Unique Sequence Number (USN), and the current USN. The USNs are used to track changes to objects in the Active Directory store.</p>

<p><b>Security Tab</b></p>

<p>The Security tab is used to set permissions on the user object in the Active Directory store. You can allow or deny specific permissions to groups or users within the domain. You can also configure advanced permissions, and you can allow or prevent the inheritance of permissions from the parent object to the user object in the Active Directory tree.</p>

<p><b>Terminal Services Tabs</b></p>

<p>The Terminal Services tabs contain information about the user that is specific to Terminal Services. Terminal Services allows a user to log on from a computer terminal and run a Windows 2000 session on the terminal. The information on the Terminal Services tabs includes when users can log on, under what conditions, and how specific desktop settings are stored. The Terminal Services tabs are the Environment, Sessions, Remote Control, and Terminal Services Profile tabs.</p>

<p><b>Environment Tab</b></p>

<p>The Environment tab contains settings for creating the client working environment. If a starting program is specified, it opens automatically whenever the user connects to a Terminal server. It is the only application that can be used by the user. When the application is closed, the connection to the Terminal server closes.</p>

<p>You can also set the user account so that Terminal Services can automatically connect local client drives and printers at logon. When the client logs on to the server, the local drives and printers are detected and the appropriate printer driver is installed on the Terminal server. If multiple printers are connected, you can also default all print jobs to the main client printer.</p>

<p><b>Sessions Tab</b></p>

<p>The Sessions tab of the Terminal Services extension provides settings for limiting the length of sessions based on their current state (active, idle, or disconnected). You can also specify what action to take when a session has reached a time limit.</p>

<p>The following table describes several options on the Sessions tab:</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Time-out setting  </th>
<th>Description  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">End A Disconnected Session  </td>
<td valign="top">Specifies the maximum duration that a disconnected session is retained. The session will be reset and can no longer be reconnected once the time limit has expired.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Active Session Limit  </td>
<td valign="top">Specifies the maximum connection duration. When the time limit is reached, the session will be either disconnected, leaving the session active on the server, or reset.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Idle Session Limit  </td>
<td valign="top">Specifies the maximum idle time (time without connection activity) allowed before the session is disconnected or reset. The session is disconnected or reset when the interval elapses without any activity at the connection.  </td></tr>
</table></p>


<p><b>Remote Control Tab</b></p>

<p>The Remote Control tab allows you to configure Terminal Services' remote control settings. You can monitor the actions of a client logged on to a Terminal server by using remote control from another session. Remote control allows you to either observe or actively control a client session. If you choose to actively control a client session, you will be able to input keyboard and mouse actions to the session. You can warn a client that you want to remotely control the session by choosing to display a message on the client that asks permission to view or take part in the session. You can use either Local Users And Groups (for local users) or Active Directory Users And Computers (for domain users) to enable remote control for a user account.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
This feature does not allow you to run remote control for non-terminal connections. Tools like Systems Management Server (SMS) provide a remote control facility to access network connected computers running Windows.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p><b>Terminal Services Profile Tab</b></p>

<p>The Terminal Services Profile tab allows you to assign a profile to a user to apply to Terminal sessions. Administrators can then create user profiles tailored to the Terminal Services environment. The Terminal Services profile can be used to restrict access to applications by removing them from the user's Start menu. Administrators can also create and store network connections to printers and other resources for use during user sessions.</p>

<p>You can specify a path to a home directory to be used for Terminal sessions. This directory can be either a local directory or a network share. You can also specify whether a user has access to Terminal Services. If the Allow Logon To Terminal Server option is left disabled, the user is not allowed to log on to any Terminal servers.</p>

<A NAME="317"><h2>Administering User Accounts</h2></A>
<p>Administering user accounts goes beyond creating user accounts for new users. It involves modifying user accounts as well as setting up user profiles and home directories. This section explains how to perform each of these tasks.</p>

<A NAME="318"><h3>Managing User Profiles</h3></A>
<p>A user profile is a collection of folders and data that stores your current desktop environment and application settings as well as personal data. A user profile also contains all the network connections that are established when logging on to a computer, such as Start menu items and mapped drives to network servers. User profiles maintain consistency in your desktop environment by providing the same desktop environment you had the last time you logged on to the computer.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 creates a local user profile the first time you log on at a computer. After logging on for the first time, Windows 2000 stores the user profile on that computer.</p>

<p>User profiles operate in the following manner:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>When you log on to a client computer running Windows 2000, you always receive your individual desktop settings and connections, regardless of how many users share your computer.</li></p>

<p><li>The first time you log on to a client computer running Windows 2000, Windows 2000 copies the local Default User folder profile to the %systemdrive%\Documents and Settings\&lt;<i>user_logon_name</i>&gt; folder (typically C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;<i>user_logon_name</i>&gt;), where <i>user_logon_name</i> is your Windows 2000 user account name.</li></p>

<p><li>If the computer where you are logging on was updated from Windows

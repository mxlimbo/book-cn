<A NAME="65"><h1>Lesson 1: Preparing to Install Windows 2000 Server</h1></A>
<p>Before you can begin to install Windows 2000 Server, you must prepare for the installation by gathering information and making decisions about how you want to install the software. This lesson gives you the foundation you need to install Windows 2000 Server. It describes the tasks that you should complete before moving on to the installation.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b> 

<ul>
<p><li>Prepare to install Windows 2000 Server by completing preinstallation tasks such as identifying hardware requirements and gathering the necessary installation information</li></p>
</ul>

<b>Estimated lesson time: 90 minutes</b> 
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="66"><h2>Preparing for Installation</h2></A>
<p>During installation, the Windows 2000 Setup program asks you to provide information about how to install and configure Windows 2000. You should gather all the necessary information. Good preparation helps you avoid problems during and after the installation.</p>

<p>Before you begin the Windows 2000 installation process, review the list of tasks outlined in the table below. Each task is discussed in greater detail in the sections that follow. Initially, you should complete only the first two tasks in this table&#8212;verifying that your computer meets the minimum hardware requirements and checking hardware compatibility. The remaining tasks are completed during the actual installation of Windows 2000 Server, which you will perform in the exercises later in this chapter. This table is meant only to prepare you for the installation so that you can install Windows 2000 Server without any unnecessary delays.</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th colspan="2">Task  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Verify that your computer meets the minimum hardware requirements. 
For example, your hard disk should meet the minimum space
requirements and preferably have a minimum of 2 gigabytes (GB)
of free disk space.  </td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Check all hardware (network adapters, video drivers, sound cards, 
CD-ROM drives, PC cards, and so on) for compatibility by checking
the Windows 2000 Hardware Compatibility List (HCL).  </td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Identify how you want to partition the hard disk drive on which you 
are going to install Windows 2000 Server.  </td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Choose a file system that meets your requirements and provides the 
services you need. Choose NTFS unless you need to run more than
one operating system on your computer.  </td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Select a licensing mode. You can switch to per-seat from per-server 
mode after installation, but not to per-server from per-seat.  </td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Choose the type of network group (workgroup or domain) your 
computer will join. If you are joining a domain, you need additional
information such as the domain name and the computer account name
created for you. With an administrator account and password in the
domain, you can create a computer account in the domain.  </td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Determine whether to perform a new installation or upgrade an 
existing version of Windows燦T Server. Windows燦T Workstation
and Windows 9<i>x</i> cannot be upgraded to Windows 2000 Server.  </td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Select an installation method: Setup boot disks, CD-ROM, or 
over-the-network.  </td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Choose which components you need to install, such as Networking 
Services or Microsoft Indexing Service.  </td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table></p>


<p>In addition to the tasks in the checklist, you should perform the following tasks to prepare for installation and to eliminate potential problems.</p>

<p><b>Working with Domain Name System (DNS)</b></p>

<p>When you create a Windows 2000 domain, the DNS service must be running and configured. If you are joining a domain, you must know the DNS name of the domain that your computer is joining. If DNS is not running, it is installed automatically when you create a domain controller or when you promote a server to a domain controller.</p>

<p><b>Recording Information</b></p>

<p>You should write down the following information: previous operating system (if any), name of the computer (if on a network), name of the workgroup or domain (if on a network), and the IP address (if there is no Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [DHCP] server or an existing DHCP server will not be used for dynamic IP addressing).</p>

<p><b>Backing Up Files</b></p>

<p>Before you install Windows 2000 Server, you should back up the files that you want to preserve. You can back up files to a disk, a tape drive, or another computer on the network.</p>

<p><b>Uncompressing the Drive</b></p>

<p>Uncompress any DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes before installing Windows 2000. You should not install Windows 2000 on a compressed
drive unless the drive was compressed with the NTFS compression utility. DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes are created in Windows 9<i>x</i>. Windows 9<i>x</i> cannot be upgraded to Windows 2000 Server but can coexist on the same computer running Windows 2000 Server.</p>

<p><b>Disabling Disk Mirroring</b></p>

<p>If you are installing a clean copy of Windows 2000 and you have Windows燦T disk mirroring installed on your target computer, disable it before running Setup. You can re-enable disk mirroring after completing the installation. If you are upgrading to Windows 2000, you can leave Windows燦T mirroring enabled during Setup.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
Disabling hardware level disk mirroring to complete a new installation of Windows 2000 is not necessary since the operating system is unaware of redundant array of inexpensive disks (RAID) implemented in hardware.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p><b>Disconnecting UPS Devices</b></p>

<p>If you have UPS equipment connected to your target computer, disconnect the connecting serial cable before running Setup. Windows 2000 Setup attempts to automatically detect devices connected to serial ports, and UPS equipment can cause problems with the detection process.</p>

<p><b>Reviewing Applications</b></p>

<p>Before starting the Windows 2000 Server Setup program, be sure to read Readme.doc (in the root directory of the Windows 2000 Server installation CD-ROM) for information regarding applications that need to be disabled or removed before running Setup. You may need to remove virus-scanning software, third-party network services, or client software before running the Windows 2000 Server installation.</p>

<p><b>Checking the Boot Sector for Viruses</b></p>

<p>A boot sector virus will cause the installation of Windows 2000 to fail. To verify that the boot sector is not infected with a virus, run the Makedisk.bat file in the \Valueadd\3rdparty\CA_antiv directory on the Windows 2000 Server installation CD-ROM. The Makedisk.bat utility creates a diskette that is used to check the boot sector. After creating this diskette, boot the computer with the diskette inserted. This will run a boot sector virus check. After the utility has run, remove the diskette and proceed to the next preinstallation step.</p>

<p><b>Gathering Materials</b></p>

<p>Gather the following materials to prepare for the Windows 2000 installation:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Read any documentation pertaining to installing Windows 2000 for updated installation information. Review the pertinent .txt and .doc files located on the Windows 2000 Server installation CD-ROM.</li></p>

<p><li>Make sure you have all device driver disks and configuration settings for third-party hardware, including any third-party device driver disks and documentation.</li></p>

<p><li>Have the Windows 2000 Server installation CD-ROM or a network share with the Windows 2000 Server files available.</li></p>

<p><li>Format three 3.5-inch 1.44 MB floppy disks (if creating optional Setup Startup disks).</li></p>
</ul>

<p>
<div class="warning"><blockquote><b>IMPORTANT</b><hr>
Windows NT 4.0 Setup disks are not compatible with Windows 2000.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="67"><h2>Minimum Hardware Requirements</h2></A>
<p>You should be familiar with the minimum hardware requirements necessary to install and operate Windows 2000 Server so that you can determine whether your system meets these requirements. The minimum installation requirements for Windows 2000 are listed in the following table.</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Component  </th>
<th>Minimum requirement  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Processor  </td>
<td valign="top"> 32-bit Pentium 133 MHz.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Free hard disk space  </td>
<td valign="top">One or more hard disks where %systemroot% (C:\WINNT by default) is located on a partition with at least 671 MB of free space (2 GB is recommended).  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Memory  </td>
<td valign="top">64 MB for networking with one to five client computers; 128 MB minimum is recommended for most network environments.  </td></tr>

<td valign="top">Mouse or other pointing device.  <p>For network installation: a network adapter and an
MS-DOS-based network operating system that permits connection to a server containing the Windows 2000 Setup files.</p></td></tr>
</table></p>




<A NAME="68"><h2>Hardware Compatibility</h2></A>
<p>Windows 2000 Setup automatically checks your hardware and software and reports any potential conflicts. However, to ensure a successful installation, you should make sure that your computer hardware is compatible with Windows 2000 Server before starting the setup process. To do this, verify that your hardware is on the HCL. The HCL is included on your Windows 2000 Server installation CD-ROM in the Support folder in Hcl.txt. The HCL lists each hardware model that has passed the Hardware Compatibility Tests (HCTs). The list also indicates which devices Windows 2000 Server supports. Testing is conducted by Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) and by some hardware vendors. Installing Windows 2000 Server on a computer that does not have hardware listed in the HCL might not be successful.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
Microsoft releases an updated HCL on a regular basis. Review the
most up-to-date list of supported hardware at the Microsoft WHQL Web
site, <i><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest/hcl" target="_window2">http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest/hcl</a></i>. If this URL fails, try
<i><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=Win2000HCL&amp;pver=1" target="_window2">http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=Win2000HCL&amp;pver=1</a></i> .
This URL should direct you to the WHQL Web site. If it doesn't display the WHQL Web site, search <i><a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_window2">http://www.microsoft.com</a></i> by using the keyword &quot;HCL.&quot;</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>A hardware model is &quot;supported&quot; if it is listed on the HCL and you are using a Microsoft-supplied driver to control that hardware. The term &quot;unsupported&quot; does not imply anything about the relative quality of hardware or of third-party drivers. Many unsupported computers and devices work correctly with Windows 2000. However, the Windows 2000 support staff at Microsoft does not offer a full range of support services for problems specific to unsupported hardware or drivers.</p>

<p>Microsoft supports only those devices on the HCL. If one of the computer's devices is not on the HCL, contact the device manufacturer to request a Windows 2000 driver, if it exists.</p>

<A NAME="69"><h2>Disk Partitions</h2></A>
<p>The Windows 2000 Server Setup program allows you to install Windows 2000 Server onto an existing partition or to create a partition and then install Windows 2000 onto the new one. During installation, the Setup program examines the hard disk. Depending on the state of the disk, you will be provided with some or all of the following partitioning options during the installation:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>If the entire hard disk is unpartitioned, you must create and size the installation partition.</li></p>

<p><li>If the disk has partitions, but there is enough unpartitioned disk space, you can create and size the installation partition by using that unpartitioned space.</li></p>

<p><li>If there is an existing partition that is large enough, you can install Windows 2000 Server onto that partition.</li></p>

<p><li>If the hard disk has an existing partition, you can delete it to create more unpartitioned disk space and then use that unpartitioned space to create the Windows 2000 partition.</li></p>

<p><li>If you specify any action that will cause information to be erased, you will be prompted to confirm your choice. If you delete an existing partition, you will cause any data on that partition to be erased. Performing a new installation of Windows 2000 on a partition that contains another operating system will cause that operating system to be overwritten.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Although you can use the Windows 2000 Setup program to create other partitions, you should create and size only the installation partition. After Windows 2000 is installed, use the Disk Management tool to partition any remaining unpartitioned space on the hard disk.</p>

<A NAME="70"><h3>Sizing the Installation Partition</h3></A>
<p>The Windows 2000 Server Setup program requires a boot partition of at least 671 MB of free space to install all Windows 2000 operating system files. However, it is recommended that you create a boot partition of at least 2 GB to allow for future installations of files and programs, such as the Windows 2000 paging file, operating system tools, and operating system updates. The boot partition holds the core operating system files.</p>

<p>The system partition is the partition that holds the files needed to begin the initial load of Windows 2000. On an <i>x</i>86-based computer, the operating system starts from the system partition. This means that Windows 2000 looks for certain files, such as Ntldr, Ntdetect.com, and Boot.ini in the root directory, usually the C: drive (Disk 0) when the computer is started. The operating system cannot start unless the system partition is marked active.</p>

<p>The boot partition is where Windows 2000 Server is installed. It contains the operating system parent directory (Winnt, by default), the \System32 subdirectory, the Windows 2000 kernel, and all other files required to run the operating system. If Windows 2000 Server is installed on the active partition, it is both the boot and system partition.</p>

<p>The disk partition where you store Windows 2000 files must be on a permanent hard disk and must have enough unused disk space to hold all the files. This partition must be formatted either with the NTFS (NTFS 4.0 or NTFS 5.0) or with the FAT16 or FAT32 file systems. However, you cannot install Windows 2000 to a FAT16 or FAT32 partition that has implemented disk compression, such as Microsoft DriveSpace.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
In Windows 2000, if you choose to format NTFS during the installation, it will format the partition directly to NTFS. In previous versions, the partition was formatted FAT and then converted to NTFS. This new process allows you to create partitions larger than 4 GB, although a limit of 7.8 GB still exists on the PC architecture.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>Winnt.exe and Winnt32.exe, the Setup executable files, report an error if they are unable to find a drive with enough free disk space available (greater than 671 MB), or if the drive specified with the /t: or /tempdrive: switch has insufficient free disk space. If such an error occurs, you must free some disk space and then run Winnt or Winnt32 again.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 looks for certain files in the root directory of the active partition when you start your computer; however, the Windows 2000 operating system may be installed on another drive, such as drive D, as long as the drive is configured with a supported file system. If you want to dual-boot your computer to operating systems that do not support NTFS, such as Windows 98, drive C must be FAT16 or FAT32.</p>

<p>If a system's hard disk contains basic input/output system (BIOS) controlled partitions, other file systems such as network file system (NFS), stripe sets, volume sets, or mirrors, those elements appear on the Setup screen as partitions of an unknown type. To avoid deleting elements inadvertently, do not use Setup to delete partitions that are displayed as unknown.</p>

<p>If you are installing a new copy of Windows 2000 on a partition mirrored in software, you must disable mirroring before running Setup and then reestablish mirroring after installation is complete. However, if you are upgrading Windows NT Server versions 3.51 or 4.0 or Windows 2000 Server, you can leave mirroring enabled during Setup.</p>

<p>Do not install Windows 2000 or upgrade to Windows 2000 on a compressed drive unless the drive was compressed with the NTFS file system compression utility. Uncompress a Windows 9<i>x</i> DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volume before running Windows 2000 Setup on it.</p>

<p>If you are setting up a dual-boot configuration of Windows 2000 with another operating system such as MS-DOS, Windows

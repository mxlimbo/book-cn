<A NAME="144"><h1>Lesson 1: Disk Management Basics</h1></A>
<p>Before you can install Windows 2000 Server on a hard disk, the portion of the disk that Windows 2000 will use must be initialized with a storage type, partitioned, and formatted. If the system and boot partition will be separate, both the disk area to contain the system files and the disk area to contain the operating system must be partitioned and formatted. This lesson provides an overview of how to configure storage media and provides information about specific disk maintenance tasks.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b> 

<ul>
<p><li>Describe disk management concepts</li></p>

<p><li>Identify common disk management tasks</li></p>

<p><li>Create and configure a dynamic disk</li></p>
</ul>

<b>Estimated lesson time: 60 minutes</b>

<A NAME="145"><h2>Setting Up a Hard Disk</h2></A>
<p>Whether you are setting up the remaining free space on a hard disk on which you installed Windows 2000 or setting up a new hard disk, there are several tasks that must be performed to prepare the disk:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Initializing the disk with a storage type</b> Initialization defines the fundamental structure of a hard disk. Windows 2000 supports two types of disk storage structures: basic storage and dynamic storage.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Creating partitions or volumes</b> You must create partitions on a basic disk or create volumes on a dynamic disk.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Formatting the disk</b> After you create a partition or volume, you must format it with a specific file system&#8212;NTFS or one of the two FAT file systems: FAT16 or FAT32. The file system you choose affects disk operations. This includes how you control user access to data, how data is stored, hard disk capacity, and which operating systems can gain access to the data on the hard disk.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="146"><h3>Storage, Partition, and Volume Types</h3></A>
<p>Before you can decide how to perform the tasks for setting up a hard disk, you must understand the storage types, partition types, and volume types available in Windows 2000.</p>

<p><b>Storage Types</b></p>

<p>Windows 2000 supports two types of disk storage: basic storage and dynamic storage. A physical disk must be either basic or dynamic; you cannot use both storage types on one disk. You can, however, use both types of disk storage in a multidisk system, as shown in Figure 4.1.</p>

<p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 4.1</b> <i> Basic and dynamic storage types</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
Windows 2000 storage types are distinct from hardware-level disk array configurations. A disk array is more commonly known as a redundant array of independent disks (RAID). Hardware-level RAID initially appears to Windows 2000 as unallocated space. This space is configured by Windows 2000 as either a basic or dynamic storage type.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p><b>Basic Storage</b></p>

<p>The traditional industry standard is basic storage. It dictates the division of a hard disk into partitions. A <i>partition</i> is a portion of the disk that functions as a physically separate unit of storage. Windows 2000 recognizes primary and extended partitions. A disk that is initialized for basic storage is called a <i>basic disk</i>. A basic disk can contain primary partitions, extended partitions, and logical drives. New disks added to a computer running Windows 2000 are basic disks.</p>

<p>Since basic storage is the traditional industry standard, MS-DOS, all versions of Microsoft Windows, Windows NT, and Windows 2000 support basic storage. For Windows 2000, basic storage is the default, so all disks are basic disks until you convert them to dynamic storage.</p>

<p>A basic disk is backward compatible with Windowsç‡¦T volume sets, striped sets (RAID-0), mirrored volumes (RAID-1), and disk striping with parity (RAID-5).</p>

<p><b>Dynamic Storage</b></p>

<p>Only Windows 2000 supports dynamic storage. To support dynamic storage, a single partition is created that includes the entire disk. A disk that you initialize for dynamic storage is a <i>dynamic disk</i>.</p>

<p>Dynamic disks are divided into volumes, which can consist of a portion or portions of one or more physical disks. A dynamic disk can contain simple volumes, spanned volumes, striped volumes (RAID-0), mirrored volumes (RAID-1), and striped with parity volumes (RAID-5). You create a dynamic disk by upgrading a basic disk.</p>

<p>Dynamic storage does not have the restrictions of basic storage; for example, you can size and resize a dynamic disk without restarting Windows 2000.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
Removable storage devices contain primary partitions only. You cannot create extended partitions, logical drives, or dynamic volumes on removable storage devices. You cannot mark a primary partition on a removable storage device active.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p><b>Partition Types (Basic Disks)</b></p>

<p>You can divide a basic disk into primary and extended partitions. Partitions function as physically separate storage units. This allows you to separate different types of information, such as user data on one partition and applications on another. A basic disk can contain up to four primary partitions, or up to three primary partitions and one extended partition, for a maximum of four partitions. Only one partition can be an extended partition, as shown in Figure 4.2.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/f04xx02g.jpg" border="0">
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 4.2</b> <i>Partition types</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p><b>Primary Partitions</b></p>

<p>Windows 2000 uses primary partitions to start the computer. One of these primary partitions is marked as the active partition. An <i>active partition</i> is where the hardware looks for the boot files to start the operating system. Only one partition on a single hard disk can be active at a time. Multiple primary partitions allow you to isolate different operating systems or types of data. To dual boot Windows 2000 with Microsoft Windows 95 or MS-DOS, the active partition must be formatted as FAT16 because Windows 95 cannot read a partition formatted as FAT32 or NTFS. To dual boot with Microsoft Windows 95 OSR2 (a later release of Windows 95 that contained enhancements, such as the ability to read partitions formatted with FAT32) or with Windows 98, the active partition must be formatted as FAT16 or FAT32.</p>

<p>
<div class="tip"><blockquote><b>TIP</b><hr>
If the active partition is formatted with NTFS, Windows 9<i>x</i> can be started from a floppy diskette. The diskette contains a pointer to the FAT partition containing Windows 9<i>x</i>.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>The Windows 2000 <i>system partition</i> (also called a system volume in Windows 2000 documentation) is the active partition that contains the hardware-specific files required to load the operating system. The Windows 2000 <i>boot partition</i> is the primary partition or logical drive where the operating system files are installed. The boot partition and the system partition can be the same partition. However, the system partition must be on the active partition, typically drive C, while the boot partition could be on another primary partition or on an extended partition.</p>

<p><b>Extended Partitions</b></p>

<p>An <i>extended partition</i> is created from free space. There can be only one extended partition on a hard disk, so it is important to include all remaining free space in the extended partition. Unlike primary partitions, you do not format extended partitions or assign drive letters to them. You divide extended partitions into segments. Each segment is a logical drive. You assign a drive letter to each logical drive and format it with a file system.</p>

<p><b>Volume Types (Dynamic Disks)</b></p>

<p>You can upgrade basic disks to dynamic storage and then create Windows 2000 volumes. Consider which volume type best suits your needs for efficient use of disk space, performance, and fault tolerance. <i>Fault tolerance</i> is the ability of a computer or operating system to respond to a catastrophic event without loss of data. In Windows 2000, RAID-1 and RAID-5 volumes are fault tolerant.</p>

<p><b>Simple Volume</b></p>

<p>A <i>simple volume</i> contains disk space from a single disk and is not fault tolerant. Simple volumes can be extended onto multiple regions (up to 32 regions) of the same disk. Simple volumes cannot provide fault tolerance. In fact, they become less fault tolerant than a nonextended disk because extending a simple volume increases the points of failure on the disk.</p>

<p><b>Spanned Volume</b></p>

<p>A <i>spanned volume</i> includes disk space from multiple disks (up to 32). Windows 2000 writes data to a spanned volume on the first disk, completely filling the space, and continues in this manner through each disk that you include in the spanned volume. A spanned volume is not fault tolerant. If any disk in a spanned volume fails, the data in the entire volume is lost.</p>

<p><b>Mirrored Volume</b></p>

<p>A <i>mirrored volume</i> consists of two identical copies of a simple volume, each on a separate hard disk. Mirrored volumes provide fault tolerance in the event of hard disk failure.</p>

<p><b>Striped Volume</b></p>

<p>A <i>striped volume</i> (RAID-0) combines areas of free space from multiple hard disks (up to 32) into one logical volume. In a striped volume, Windows 2000 optimizes performance by adding data to all disks at the same rate. If a disk in a striped volume fails, the data in the entire volume is lost. Therefore, like extending a simple volume or creating a spanned volume, RAID-0 is not fault tolerant.</p>

<p><b>RAID-5 Volume</b></p>

<p>A <i>RAID-5 volume</i> is a fault-tolerant striped volume. Windows 2000 adds a parity-information stripe to each disk partition in the volume. Windows 2000 uses the parity-information stripe to reconstruct data when a physical disk fails. A minimum of three hard disks is required in a RAID-5 volume.</p>

<p><b>Dynamic Disk and Dynamic Volume Limitations</b></p>

<p>Dynamic disks that are less fault tolerant than the simple volume, extended simple volume, spanned volume, or striped volume cannot contain the boot or system partition. This feature is built into Windows 2000 to provide a baseline of fault tolerance for partitions containing operating system files. Dynamic disks can be read only by computers running Windows 2000. Thus, dynamic disks cannot be used if you need to dual-boot another operating system that requires access to the disks configured for dynamic storage. Dynamic volumes are not supported on portable computers like laptop and notebook computers. Fault-tolerant configurations (RAID-1 and RAID-5) cannot be created locally on computers running Windows 2000 Professional.</p>

<A NAME="147"><h3>File Systems</h3></A>
<p>Windows 2000 provides read and write support for the NTFS, FAT16, and FAT32 file systems. Although NTFS and FAT partitions support basic and dynamic disks, you should use NTFS when you require a partition to have file-level and folder-level security, disk compression, disk quotas, or encryption. Only Windows 2000 and Windowsç‡¦T can access data on a local hard disk that is formatted with NTFS. If you plan to promote a server to a domain controller, format the installation partition with NTFS. This is important because NTFS supports important server-based features such as the Active Directory services and RIS.</p>

<p>FAT16 and FAT32 allow access by, and compatibility with, other operating systems. To dual boot Windows 2000 and another operating system, format the system partition with either FAT16 or FAT32. FAT does not offer many of the features that are supported by NTFS, such as file-level security. Therefore, in most situations, you should format the hard disk with NTFS. The only reason to use FAT16 or FAT32 is for dual booting. <a href="ch04c.htm#158">Lesson 2</a> and <a href="ch04d.htm#165">Lesson 3</a> provide more information about FAT and NTFS.</p>

<A NAME="148"><h2>Common Disk Management Tasks</h2></A>
<p>The Disk Management snap-in (Figure 4.3) provides a central location for disk information and management tasks, such as creating and deleting partitions and volumes. With the proper permissions, you can manage disks locally and on remote computers.</p>

<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('f04xx03x.htm')"> <img src="images/f04xx03.jpg" border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 4.3</b> <i>The Disk Management snap-in</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>You can create a custom MMC and add the Disk Management snap-in to it. The Disk Management snap-in is also included in the preconfigured Computer Management MMC on the Administrative Tools menu. The Disk Management snap-in provides shortcut menus to show you which tasks you can perform on the selected object, and it includes wizards to guide you through creating partitions and volumes and upgrading disks.</p>

<p>Use the Disk Management snap-in to configure and manage your network storage space. The Disk Management snap-in can display your storage system in either a graphical view or a list view. You can modify the display to suit your preferences by using the commands on the View menu.</p>

<p>In addition to monitoring disk information, other disk management tasks that you might need to perform include adding and removing hard disks and changing the disk storage type. Upgrading a disk to the dynamic storage type is shown in Figure 4.4.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 4.4</b> <i>Upgrading a disk from basic to dynamic storage</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<A NAME="149"><h3>Working with Simple Volumes</h3></A>
<p>A simple volume contains disk space from a single disk. You can extend a simple volume to include unallocated space on the same disk. A simple volume is not fault tolerant; however, you can set up two simple volumes that are mirrored to one another. You can format a simple volume with NTFS, FAT16, or FAT32, but you can extend that volume only if it is formatted with NTFS.</p>

<p>You can create a simple volume by selecting Disk Management in the storage section of the Computer Management snap-in. On the dynamic disk where you want to create the volume, right-click the unallocated space and then click Create Volume. This launches the Create Volume wizard. The wizard walks you through the steps necessary to create a simple volume.</p>

<p>To extend an NTFS simple volume, right-click the simple volume you want to extend and click Extend Volume. This launches the Extend Volume wizard. Follow the instructions on your screen to use unallocated space on any dynamic disk to extend the existing volume. When you extend a simple volume to another disk, it becomes a spanned volume.</p>

<A NAME="150"><h3>Working with Spanned Volumes</h3></A>
<p>A spanned volume consists of disk space from multiple disks; spanned volumes enable you to use the total unallocated space on multiple disks more effectively. You can create spanned volumes only on dynamic disks, and you need at least two dynamic disks to create a spanned volume. Spanned volumes cannot be part of a mirror volume or striped volume and are not fault tolerant.</p>

<p><b>Combining Free Space to Create a Spanned Volume</b></p>

<p>You create spanned volumes by combining variously sized areas of free space from 2 to 32 disks into one large logical volume. The areas of free space that make up a spanned volume can be different sizes. Windows 2000 organizes spanned volumes so that data is stored in the space on one disk until it is full, and then, starting at the beginning of the next disk, data is stored in the space on the second disk. Windows 2000 continues this process in the same way on each subsequent disk up to a maximum of 32 disks.</p>

<p>By deleting smaller volumes and combining them into one spanned volume, you can free drive letters for other uses and create a large volume for file system use.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
All dynamic disk configurations available in Windows 2000 can be configured to use different technology, manufacturer, or model controllers in a computer. For example, one dynamic disk in a spanned volume could be connected to an Integrated Device Electronics (IDE) controller while the other disk is connected to a small computer system interface (SCSI) controller.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p><b>Extending and Deleting</b></p>

<p>You can extend existing spanned volumes formatted with NTFS by adding free space. Disk Management formats the new area without affecting any existing files on the original volume. You cannot extend volumes formatted with FAT16 or FAT32.</p>

<p>You can extend spanned volumes on dynamic disks onto a maximum of 32 dynamic disks. After a volume is extended onto multiple disks (spanned), it cannot be part of a mirror volume or a striped volume. After a spanned volume is extended, no portion of it can be deleted without deleting the entire spanned volume. You cannot extend a system volume or a boot volume.</p>

<A NAME="151"><h3>Working with Striped Volumes</h3></A>
<p>Striped volumes offer the best performance of all the Windows 2000 Server disk management strategies. In a striped volume, data is written evenly across all physical disks in 64-kilobyte (KB) units. Because all the hard disks that belong to the striped volume perform the same functions as a single hard disk, Windows 2000 can issue and process concurrent I/O commands on all hard disks simultaneously. In this way, striped volumes can increase the speed of system I/O.</p>

<p>You create striped volumes by combining areas of free space from multiple disks (from 2 to 32) into one logical volume. With a striped volume, Windows 2000 writes data to multiple disks, similar to spanned volumes. However, on a striped volume, the operating system writes files across all disks so that data is added to all disks at the same rate. Like spanned volumes, striped volumes do not provide fault tolerance. If a disk in a striped volume fails, the data in the entire volume is lost.</p>

<p>You need at least two dynamic disks to create a striped volume, and you can create the striped volume onto a maximum of 32 disks. However, you cannot extend or mirror striped volumes. The Disk Management snap-in can be used to create a striped volume. On the dynamic disk where you want to create the striped volume, right-click the unallocated space and then click Create Volume. This launches the Create Volume wizard. The wizard will walk you through the process of creating a striped volume.</p>

<A NAME="152"><h3>Adding Disks</h3></A>
<p>When you install new disks in a computer running Windows 2000, they are added as basic storage.</p>

<p><b>Adding New Disks</b></p>

<p>To add a new disk, install or attach the new physical disk (or disks) and then click Rescan Disks on the Action menu of the Disk Management snap-in. You must use Rescan Disks every time that you remove or add disks to a computer. It should not be necessary to restart the computer when you add a new disk to your computer. However, you might need to restart the computer if Disk Management does not detect the new disk after you run Rescan Disks.</p>

<p><b>Adding a Disk That You Removed from Another Computer</b></p>

<p>The process of removing a disk from one computer and installing it into another computer is different from simply adding a new disk. After you remove the disk from the original computer and install it into the new computer, use Disk Management to add the disk. To do this, right-click the added disk and then click Import Foreign Disk. A wizard provides on-screen instructions.</p>

<p><b>Adding Multiple Disks That You Removed from Another Computer</b></p>

<p>The process of removing multiple disks from one computer and installing them into another computer is much the same as doing it for a single disk. To add multiple inherited disks, you must remove the disks from the original computer and install them in the new computer. Then use Disk Management to specify the disks from the group that you want to add.</p>

<p>When you move a dynamic disk to your computer from another computer running Windows 2000, you can see and use any existing volumes on that disk. However, if a volume on a foreign disk extends to multiple disks and you do not move all the disks for that volume, Disk Management will not show the portion of the volume that resides on the foreign disk.</p>

<A NAME="153"><h3>Changing Storage Type</h3></A>
<p>You can upgrade a disk from basic storage to dynamic storage at any time, with no loss of data. When you upgrade a basic disk to a dynamic disk, any existing partitions on the basic disk become simple volumes. Any existing mirrored, striped, or spanned volume sets created with Windows NT 4.0 become dynamic mirrored, striped, or spanned volumes, respectively. A Windows NT 4.0 stripe set with parity converts to a RAID-5 volume.</p>

<p>Any disks to be upgraded must contain at least 1 MB of unallocated space for the upgrade to succeed. Before you upgrade disks, close any programs that are running on those disks. The following table shows the results of converting a disk from basic storage to dynamic storage.</p>

<p><b>Upgrading Basic Disks to Dynamic Disks</b></p>

<p>To upgrade a basic disk to a dynamic disk, right-click the basic disk that you want to upgrade and then click Upgrade To Dynamic Disk. A wizard provides on-screen instructions. The upgrade process requires that you restart your computer.</p>

<p>After you upgrade a basic disk to a dynamic disk, you can create volumes with improved capabilities on the disk, but the disk cannot contain primary or extended partitions. Only Windows 2000 can access dynamic disks.</p>

<p><b>Refresh and Rescan</b></p>

<p>When you are working with Disk Management, you might need to update the information in the display. The two commands for updating the display are Refresh and Rescan.</p>

<p>Refresh updates drive letter, file system, volume, and removable media information and determines whether unreadable volumes are now readable. To update drive letter, file system, and volume information, click Action and then click Refresh.</p>

<p>Rescan Disks updates hardware information. When Disk Management rescans disks, it scans all attached disks for disk configuration changes. It also updates information on removable media, CD-ROM drives, basic volumes, file systems, and drive letters. Rescanning disks can take several minutes, depending on the number of hardware devices installed. To update disk information, click Action and then click Rescan Disks.</p>

<A NAME="157"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>Before you can store data on a new hard disk, the disk must be initialized with a storage type, partitioned, and formatted. Windows 2000 supports basic storage and dynamic storage. A basic disk can contain primary partitions, extended partitions, and logical drives in the extended partition. For Windows 2000, basic storage is the default, so all disks are basic disks until you convert them to dynamic disks. Dynamic storage creates a single partition that includes the entire disk. You divide dynamic disks into volumes, which can consist of a portion or portions of one or more physical disks. The Disk Management snap-in provides a central location for disk information and management tasks, such as creating and deleting partitions and volumes. With the proper permissions, you can manage disks locally or on remote computers. In addition to monitoring disk information, other disk management tasks you might need to perform include adding and removing hard disks and changing the disk storage type.</p>

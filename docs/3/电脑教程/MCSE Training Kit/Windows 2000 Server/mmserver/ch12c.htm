<A NAME="689"><h1>Lesson 2: Backing Up Data</h1></A>
<p>The goal of all backup jobs is to ensure that lost data can be recovered efficiently and quickly. A backup job is a single process of backing up data. Regularly backing up data on server hard disks and client computer hard disks prevents data loss due to disk drive failures, power outages, virus infections, and other such incidents. If data loss occurs and you have carefully planned and performed regular backup jobs, you can restore the lost data, whether the lost data is a single file or an entire hard disk.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b> 

<ul>
<p><li>Back up data at a computer and over the network</li></p>

<p><li>Schedule a backup job</li></p>

<p><li>Set backup options for Windows Backup</li></p>
</ul>

<b>Estimated lesson time: 60 minutes</b> 
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="690"><h2>Introduction to Windows Backup</h2></A>
<p>Windows 2000 provides Windows Backup (Figure 12.6), which is a tool that allows you to easily back up and restore data. To launch Windows Backup, on the Start menu, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools, and then click Backup; or, on the Start menu, click Run, type <b>ntbackup</b> , and then click OK.</p>

<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('f12xx06x.htm')"> <img src="images/f12xx06.jpg" border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 12.6</b> <i>Welcome tab of the Backup dialog box</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>You can use Backup to back up data manually or to schedule unattended backup jobs on a regular basis. You can back up data to a file or to a tape. Files can be stored on hard disks, removable disks (such as Iomega Zip drives and Jaz drives), recordable compact discs, optical drives, and tapes.</p>

<p>To successfully back up and restore data on a computer running Windows 2000, you must have the appropriate permissions and user rights, as outlined below:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>All users can back up their own files and folders. They can also back up files for which they have the Read, Read and Execute, Modify, or Full Control permission.</li></p>

<p><li>All users can restore files and folders for which they have the Write, Modify, or Full Control permission.</li></p>

<p><li>Members of the Administrators, Backup Operators, and Server Operators groups can back up and restore all files (regardless of the assigned permissions). By default, members of these groups have the Backup Files And Directories and Restore Files And Directories user rights.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="691"><h2>Planning Issues for Windows Backup</h2></A>
<p>You should plan your backup jobs to fit the needs of your company. The primary goal of backing up data is to be able to restore it if necessary, so any backup plan you develop should include how to restore data. You should be able to quickly and successfully restore critical lost data. There is no single correct backup plan for all networks. The following sections cover issues to consider in formulating your backup plan.</p>

<A NAME="692"><h3>Determine Which Files and Folders to Back Up</h3></A>
<p>Always back up critical files and folders that your company needs to operate, such as sales and financial records, the registry for each server, and the Active Directory store.</p>

<A NAME="693"><h3>Determine How Often to Back Up</h3></A>
<p>If data is critical for company operations, back it up daily. If users create or modify reports once a week, backing up the reports weekly is sufficient. You need to back up data only as often as it changes. For example, there is no need to do daily backups on files that rarely change, such as monthly reports.</p>

<A NAME="694"><h3>Determine Which Target Media to Use for Storing Backup Data</h3></A>
<p>With Windows Backup, you can back up to the following removable media:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Files</b> You can store the files on a removable media device, such as an Iomega Zip drive, or on a network location, such as a file server. The file created contains the files and folders you have selected to backup. The file has a .bkf extension. Users can back up their personal data to a network server.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Tape</b> A less expensive medium than other removable media, a tape is more convenient for large backup jobs because of its high storage capacity. However, tapes have a limited life and can deteriorate. Be sure to check the tape manufacturer's recommendations for usage.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
If you use a removable media device to back up and restore data, be sure to verify that the device is supported on the Windows 2000 HCL.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="695"><h3>Determine Whether to Perform Network or Local Backup Jobs</h3></A>
<p>A network backup can contain data from multiple network computers. This allows you to consolidate backup data from multiple computers to a single removable backup media. A network backup also allows one administrator to back up the entire network. Whether you perform a network or local backup job depends on the data that must be backed up. For example, you can back up the registry and the Active Directory store only at the computer from which you are performing the backup.</p>

<p>If you decide to perform local backups, they must be performed at each computer, including servers and client computers. There are several things to consider in performing local backups. First you must move from computer to computer so that you can perform a backup at each computer, or you must rely on users to back up their own computers. Typically most users fail to back up their data on a regular basis. A second consideration with local backups is the number of removable storage media devices available. If you use removable storage media devices, such as tape drives, you must have one for each computer, or you must move the tape drive from computer to computer so that you can perform a local backup on each computer.</p>

<p>You can also choose to use a combination of network and local backup jobs. Do this when critical data resides on client computers and servers and you do not have a removable storage media device for each computer. In this situation, users perform a local backup and store their backup files on a server. You then back up the server.</p>

<A NAME="696"><h2>Setting Backup Options</h2></A>
<p>Windows Backup allows you to change the default settings for all backup and restore jobs. These default settings are on the tabs in the Options dialog box (Figure 12.7). To access the Options dialog box, select Options from the Tools menu.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/f12xx07.jpg" border="0">
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 12.7</b> <i>General tab of the Options dialog box</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>The following list provides an overview of the Windows default backup settings on the tabs in the Options dialog box:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>General tab</b> Settings affect data verification, the status information for backup and restore jobs, alert messages, and what is backed up. You should select the Verify Data After The Backup Completes check box because it is critical that your backup data is not corrupted.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Restore tab</b> Settings affect what happens when the file to restore is identical to an existing file.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Backup Type tab</b> Settings affect the default backup type when you perform a backup job. The options you select depend on how often you back up, how quickly you want to restore, and how much storage space you have. Backup types are discussed in more detail below.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Backup Log tab</b> Settings affect the amount of information included in the backup log.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Exclude Files tab</b> Settings affect which files are excluded from backup jobs.</li></p>

</ul>

<p>You can modify some default settings in the Backup wizard for a specific backup job. For example, the default backup type is normal, but you can change it to another backup type in the Backup wizard. However, the next time you run the Backup wizard, the default backup type (normal) is selected.</p>

<A NAME="697"><h3>Backup Types</h3></A>
<p>Windows Backup provides five backup types that define what data is backed up: normal, copy, differential, incremental, and daily. You can set the default backup types on the Backup Types tab of the Options dialog box (Figure 12.8).</p>

<p>
<img src="images/f12xx08.jpg" border="0">
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 12.8</b> <i>Backup Types tab of the Options dialog box</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>Some backup types use backup markers, also known as archive attributes, which mark a file as having changed. When a file changes, an attribute is set on the file that indicates the file has changed since the last backup. Backing up the file clears or resets the attribute.</p>

<p><b>Normal</b></p>

<p>During a normal backup, known as a full backup, all selected files and folders are backed up. A normal backup does not rely on markers to determine which files to back up, but it does clear the archive attribute from all files. Normal backups speed up the restore process because the backup files are the most current and you do not need to restore multiple backup jobs. However, they are the most time consuming and require the most storage capacity of any backup type.</p>

<p><b>Copy</b></p>

<p>During a copy backup, all selected files and folders are backed up. It neither looks for nor clears markers. If you do not want to clear markers and affect other backup types, use a copy backup. For example, use a copy backup between a normal and an incremental backup to create an archival snapshot of 
network data.</p>

<p><b>Differential</b></p>

<p>During a differential backup, only selected files and folders that have a marker are backed up. Because a differential backup does not clear markers, 
if you did two differential backups in a row on a file, the file would be backed up each time. This backup type is moderately fast at backing up and restoring data. To perform a full restore by using a differential backup, the last normal backup session should be followed by the last differential backup session.</p>

<p><b>Incremental</b></p>

<p>During an incremental backup, only selected files and folders that have a marker are backed up. An incremental backup clears markers. Because it clears markers, if you did two incremental backups in a row on a file and nothing changed in the file, the file would not be backed up the second time. This backup type is very fast at backing up data and slow at restoring data. To perform a full restore using an incremental backup, the last normal backup session is followed by all incremental backup sessions up to the very last incremental backup session.</p>

<p><b>Daily</b></p>

<p>During a daily backup, all selected files and folders that have changed during the day are backed up. A daily backup neither looks for nor clears markers. If you want to back up all files and folders that change during the day without affecting a backup schedule, use a daily backup.</p>

<p><b>Setting Backup Types for Specific Jobs</b></p>

<p>You can set the backup type for a specific backup job when you are running the Backup wizard (Figure 12.9). The Backup wizard is described later in 
this lesson.</p>

<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('f12xx09x.htm')"> <img src="images/f12xx09.jpg" border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 12.9</b> <i>Setting the backup type for a specific backup job</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>You can also set the backup type for a specific backup job when you perform a backup without using the Backup wizard. On the Backup tab of the Windows Backup utility, click Start Backup. In the Backup Job Information screen that appears after you start the backup process, click Advanced. When the Advanced Backup Options dialog box appears, select the backup type from the drop-down list.</p>

<p><b>Combining Backup Types</b></p>

<p>An effective backup strategy is likely to combine different backup types. Some backup types require more time to back up data but less time to restore data. Conversely, other backup types require less time to back up data but more time to restore data. If you combine backup types, markers (archive attribute) are critical. Incremental and differential backup types check for and rely on the markers.</p>

<p>The following information provides examples of combining different 
backup types:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Normal and differential backups</b> On Monday a normal backup is performed, and on Tuesday through Friday differential backups are performed. Differential backups do not clear markers, which means that each backup includes all changes since Monday. If data becomes corrupted on Friday, you need to restore only the normal backup from Monday and the differential backup from Thursday. This strategy takes more time to back up but less time to restore.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Normal and incremental backups</b> On Monday a normal backup is performed, and on Tuesday through Friday incremental backups are performed. Incremental backups clear markers, which means that each backup includes only the files that changed since the previous backup. If data becomes corrupt on Friday, you need to restore the normal backup from Monday and all incremental backups, from Tuesday through Friday. This strategy takes less time to back up but more time to restore.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Normal, differential, and copy backups</b> These backups use the same strategy as the normal and incremental backups, except that on Wednesday, you perform a copy backup. Copy backups include all selected files and do not clear markers or interrupt the usual backup schedule. Therefore, each differential backup includes all changes since Monday. The copy backup type done on Wednesday is not part of the Friday restore. Copy backups are helpful when you need to create a snapshot of your data but you don't want to affect your scheduled backup.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="698"><h2>Backing Up Data</h2></A>
<p>After you have planned your backup, including planning the backup type to use and when to perform backup jobs, the next step is to prepare to back up your data. There are certain preliminary tasks that must be completed before you can back up your data. After you have completed the preliminary tasks, you can perform the backup.</p>

<A NAME="699"><h3>Performing Preliminary Tasks</h3></A>
<p>One task you must do before each backup job is ensure that the files you want to back up are closed. You should send a notification to users to close files before you begin backing up data. Windows Backup does not back up files locked open by applications. You can use e-mail or the Send Console Message dialog box in the File Service Management snap-in to send administrative messages to users. You can access the File Service Management snap-in through the Computer Management snap-in.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
Many third-party backup programs create image backups of open files.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>If you use a removable media device, make sure the following preliminary tasks are completed:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>The backup device is attached to a computer on the network and is turned on. If you are backing up to tape, you must attach the tape device to the computer on which you run Windows Backup.</li></p>

<p><li>The media device is listed on the Windows 2000 HCL.</li></p>

<p><li>The media is loaded in the media device. For example, if you are using a tape drive, ensure that a tape is loaded in the tape drive.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="700"><h3>Selecting Files and Folders to Back Up</h3></A>
<p>After you have completed the preliminary tasks, you can perform the backup by using the Backup wizard. To start the Backup wizard, open Backup and click the Backup Wizard button on the Welcome tab.</p>

<p>The first step of setting up a backup is to specify what to back up (Figure 12.10).</p>

<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('f12xx10x.htm')"> <img src="images/f12xx10.jpg" border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 12.10</b> <i>What To Back Up screen of the Backup wizard</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>You must select one of the following options:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Back Up Everything On My Computer</b> Backs up all files on the computer on which you are running Windows Backup, except those files that Windows Backup excludes by default, such as certain power management files.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Back Up Selected Files, Drives, Or Network Data</b> Backs up selected files and folders. This includes files and folders on the computer from which you run Windows Backup and any shared file or folder on the network. When you click this option, the Backup wizard provides a hierarchical view of the computer and the network (through My network places).</li></p>


<p><li><b>Only Back Up The System State Data</b> Backs up the registry, the Active Directory store, the SYSVOL folder, the COM+ Class Registration database, system startup files, and the Certificate Services (if Certificate Services are installed). The Active Directory store and the SYSVOL folder is available only at a domain controller. Use this option to create a copy of the Active Directory store, which contains all domain objects and their attributes. Back up the Certificate Services and stop the Certificate Services before running this option. Windows Backup will fail if the Certificate Services are running. You should keep the Certificate Services backup file created by backing up the Certificate Services with your backup. All system state data relevant to your computer is backed up or restored. You cannot back up or restore individual components of the system state data because of the dependencies among the system state components.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="701"><h3>Specifying Backup Destination and Media Settings</h3></A>
<p>After you select what you want to back up, provide information about the backup media. The following table describes the information you must provide for the backup media options:</p>

<p><table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr>
<th>Option</th><th>Description</th>
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Backup Media Type</td> <td valign="top">The target medium to use, such as a tape or file. 
A file can be located on any disk-based media, including a hard disk, a shared network folder, 
or a removable disk, such as an Iomega Zip drive.</td></tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Backup Media Or File Name</td> <td valign="top">The location where Windows Backup will store the data. For a tape, enter the tape name. For a file, enter the path for the backup file.</td></tr></table></p>

<p>After you provide the media information, the Backup wizard displays the wizard settings and the opportunity to do either of the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Start the backup</b> If you click Finish, the backup process begins, and the Backup wizard displays status information about the backup job in the Backup Progress dialog box.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Specify advanced backup options</b> If you click Advanced, the Backup wizard allows you to select the advanced backup settings. The advanced backup settings are described in the following section.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
When the backup process is complete, you can choose to review the backup report, which is the backup log. A backup log is a text file that records backup operations and is stored on the hard disk of the computer on which you are running Windows Backup.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="702"><h3>Specifying Advanced Backup Settings</h3></A>
<p>When you specify advanced backup settings, you are changing the default backup settings for the current backup job only. The following table describes the advanced options you can configure:</p>

<p><table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr>
<th>Advanced option</th><th>Description</th>
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Select The Type Of Backup Operation To Perform</td> <td valign="top">Allows you to choose the backup type for this backup job. Select one of the following options: Normal, Copy, 
Incremental, Differential, and Daily.</td></tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Backup Migrated Remote Storage Data</td> <td valign="top">Backs up data that Hierarchical Storage Manager (HSM) has moved to remote storage.</td></tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Verify Data After Backup</td> <td valign="top">Confirms that files are correctly backed up. Windows Backup compares the backup data and the source data to verify that they are the same. Microsoft recommends that you select this option.</td></tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Use Hardware Compression, If Available</td> <td valign="top">Enables hardware compression for tape devices that support it. If your tape device does not support hardware compression, this option is unavailable.</td></tr><tr>
<td valign="top">If The Archive Media Already Contains Backups</td> <td valign="top">Specifies whether to append or replace the existing backup on the backup media. Choose Append to store multiple backup jobs on a storage device, or choose Replace if you do not need to save previous backup jobs and you only want to save the most recent backup data.</td></tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Allow Only The Owner And The Administrator Access To The Backup Data And To Any Backups Appended To The Media</td> <td valign="top">Allows you to restrict who can gain access to the completed backup file or tape. This option is available  only if you choose to replace an existing backup on a backup media, rather than appending to the backup media. If you back up the registry or the Active  Directory store, click this option to prevent others from getting copies of the backup job.</td></tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Backup Label</td> <td valign="top">Allows you to specify a name and description for the backup job. The name and description appear in the backup log. You can change the name and description to a more intuitive name (for example, Sales-normal backup September 14, 2000).</td></tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Media Label</td> <td valign="top">Allows you to specify the name of the backup media (for example, the tape name). The first time you back up to a new media or overwrite an existing backup job, you can specify the name, such as Active Directory store backup.</td></tr><tr>
<td valign="top">When To Back Up</td> <td valign="top">Allows you to specify Now or Later. If you choose later, you specify the job name and start date. You can also set the schedule.</td></tr></table></p>

<p>Depending on whether you choose to back up now or later, the Backup wizard provides you with the opportunity to do either of the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>If you choose to finish the backup process, the Backup wizard displays the Completing The Backup Wizard settings and then presents the option to finish and immediately start the backup. During the backup, the wizard displays status information about the backup job.</li></p>

<p><li>If you choose to back up later, you are shown additional dialog boxes to schedule the backup process to occur later, as described in the next section.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="703"><h3>Scheduling Backup Jobs</h3></A>
<p>Scheduling a backup job means you can have an unattended backup job occur at a later time, for example, when users are not at work and files are closed. You can also schedule backup jobs to occur at regular intervals. Windows 2000 supports this scheduling functionality by integrating Windows Backup with the Task Scheduler service.</p>

<p>To schedule a backup, click the Later radio button on the When To Back Up screen of the Backup wizard. Task Scheduler presents the Set Account Information dialog box, prompting you for your password. The user account must have the appropriate user rights and permissions to perform backup jobs.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
If the Task Scheduler service is not running or not set to start automatically, Windows 2000 displays a dialog box prompting you to start the service. Click OK, and the Set Account Information dialog box appears.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>In the Schedule Job dialog box, you can set the date, time, and number of occurrences for the backup job to repeat, such as every Friday at 10:00 P.M. You can also display all the scheduled tasks for the computer by selecting the Show Multiple Schedules check box. This helps to prevent you from scheduling multiple tasks on the same computer at the same time.</p>

<p>By clicking the Advanced button, you can also schedule how long the backup can last and for how many days, weeks, months, or years you want this schedule to continue.</p>

<p>After you have scheduled the backup job and completed the Backup wizard, Windows Backup places the backup job on the calendar on the Schedule Jobs tab in Windows Backup. The backup job automatically starts at the time you specified.</p>

<p>
<div class="tip"><blockquote><b>TIP</b><hr>
If the computer targeted for backup is running Certificate Services, you can schedule Certificate Services to stop before the backup begins. At the conclusion of the backup, configure the Task Scheduler to restart the Certificate Service. The easiest way to configure this is to stop and start Certificate Services and initiate the backup routine in a single command file. The command file is then scheduled to run through the Task Scheduler. This procedure is described near the conclusion of Exercise 1 in this chapter.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p><img src="images/practic.JPG" border="0"></p>

<A NAME="704"><h3>Exercise 1: Backing Up Files</h3></A>
<p>In this exercise you use the Backup wizard to back up some files to your hard disk. You then create a backup job to perform a backup operation at a later time by using Task Scheduler. Complete this exercise on Server01.</p>

<p><li><b>Procedure 1: Creating, running, and verifying a backup job</b></li></p>

<p>If you need to stop a service, such as Certificate Services, before running a backup routine, you can create a batch file (.cmd or .bat) that stops the service, runs the backup routine, and then restarts the service. The command to stop Certificate Services is:</p>

<p><table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr><td>
<pre>net stop &quot;certificate services&quot;
</pre></td></tr></table></p>

<p>The command to restart Certificate Services is:</p>

<A NAME="705"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>Windows Backup is a tool that allows you to easily back up and restore data. You can use Windows Backup to back up data manually or to schedule unattended backup jobs on a regular basis. You should plan your backup jobs to fit the needs of your company. Windows Backup allows you to change the default settings for all backup and restore jobs. It provides five backup types that define what data is backed up: normal, copy, differential, incremental, and daily. Before you back up data, you must ensure the files that you want to back up are closed and, if applicable, you must prepare any removable media devices. After you have completed the preliminary tasks, you can perform the backup by using the Backup wizard. The Backup wizard allows you to select which files and folders to back up and to specify the backup destination and media settings. The wizard also allows you to specify advanced settings for your current backup job and to schedule backup jobs.</p>

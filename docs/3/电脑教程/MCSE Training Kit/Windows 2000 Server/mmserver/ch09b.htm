<A NAME="420"><h1>Lesson 1: Network Protocols</h1></A>
<p>Protocols are specifications for standardized packets of data that make it possible for networks to share information. The packets of information are moved up and down the protocol stack and across the transmission media. Windows 2000 supports many different protocols. This lesson introduces you to the primary network protocols supported by Windows 2000.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b> 

<ul>
<p><li>Describe the primary network protocols supported by Windows 2000</li></p>
</ul>

<b>Estimated lesson time: 15 minutes</b> 
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="421"><h2>Introduction to Network Protocols</h2></A>
<p>A <i>protocol</i> is a set of rules and conventions for sending information over a network. Among the protocols supported by Windows 2000 is TCP/IP, which Windows 2000 relies on for logon, file and print services, replication of information between domain controllers, and other common functions. In addition to TCP/IP, the primary network protocols that Windows 2000 supports include the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)</li></p>

<p><li>Internetwork Packet Exchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange (IPX/SPX)</li></p>

<p><li>NetBIOS Enhanced User Interface (NetBEUI)</li></p>

<p><li>AppleTalk</li></p>

<p><li>Data Link Control (DLC)</li></p>

<p><li>Infrared Data Association (IrDA)</li></p>
</ul>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
Systems Network Architecture (SNA) protocols are not included in Windows 2000. SNA protocols are available through Microsoft SNA Server. SNA Server is a separate product that supports interoperability with IBM midrange and mainframe computers.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="422"><h3>Protocol Binding Order</h3></A>
<p>Protocols can be added or deleted at will and selectively bound to all network interfaces that are present in the server. Protocol binding order is determined by the order in which the protocols were initially installed, although it can be changed at any time on a per-interface basis, allowing a greater degree of control. For example, the first interface could have TCP/IP and IPX/SPX both bound with TCP/IP having precedence, whereas the second interface could still have both protocols bound while the IPX/SPX protocol has precedence. Additionally, network services can be selectively enabled or disabled on a per-adapter or per-protocol basis or any combination thereof. This selectivity gives system administrators extremely fine control over networking configuration and allows extremely secure configurations (such as disabling all network services on public interfaces connected directly to the Internet) to be constructed with minimal difficulty.</p>

<A NAME="423"><h2>TCP/IP</h2></A>
<p>The TCP/IP suite of protocols has been adopted by Microsoft as the strategic enterprise transport protocol for Windows 2000. The Windows 2000 TCP/IP suite is designed to make it easy to integrate Microsoft enterprise networks into large-scale corporate, government, and public networks, and to provide the ability to operate over those networks in a secure manner. TCP/IP is discussed in greater detail in Lesson 2.</p>

<A NAME="424"><h2>ATM</h2></A>
<p>The Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol is an advanced implementation of packet switching that is ideal for voice, video, and data communications. ATM is a high-speed networking technology that transmits data in cells of a fixed length. It is composed of a number of related technologies including software, hardware, and connection-oriented media. A cell is a fixed-length packet containing 53 bytes of information, as shown in Figure 9.1.</p>

<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('f09xx01gx.htm')"> <img src="images/f09xx01g.jpg" border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 9.1</b> <i>A 1000-byte data packet broken down into 53-byte cells</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>Since the number of bytes&#8212;and consequently the transit time&#8212;of a cell is constant, cells can be switched at a constant interval.</p>

<p>An ATM endpoint establishes a connection or virtual circuit before sending any data on the network. It then sends cells along this path toward the destination. This virtual circuit is a direct path from one endpoint to another. While establishing the connection, the ATM endpoint also negotiates a Quality of Service (QoS) contract for the transmission. This contract spells out the bandwidth, maximum delay, acceptable variance, and other parameters the virtual circuit (VC) provides, and it extends from one endpoint to the other. Since the virtual circuit is connection oriented, data arrives at the receiving end in proper order and with the specified service levels. ATM is an excellent compromise for the transmission of both voice and data on a network. ATM provides a guaranteed QoS on a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), and a public internetwork.</p>

<p>The Windows 2000 architecture uses the following components to support ATM: LAN Emulation, IP over ATM, ATM over xDSL, and native ATM access through Microsoft Windows Sockets (Winsock) 2.0.</p>

<A NAME="425"><h3>LAN Emulation</h3></A>
<p>LAN Emulation (LANE) is a method by which protocols that understand only connectionless media can communicate over ATM. It allows ATM to utilize both legacy networks and applications. Traditional LAN-aware applications and protocols can communicate over an ATM network without modification.</p>

<p>LANE consists of two primary components: the LANE client (Atmlane.sys) and the LANE services. The LANE client is located in the %systemroot%\system32\drivers folder. It allows LAN protocols and LAN-aware applications to function as if they were communicating with a traditional LAN. The LANE client communicates LAN commands to the network protocols and native ATM commands to the ATM protocol layer. The LANE services are a group of ATM components, usually located on a switch that supports LAN emulation.</p>

<A NAME="426"><h3>IP over ATM</h3></A>
<p>IP over ATM is a group of services that is used for communicating over an ATM network and which can be used as an alternative to LAN emulation. IP over ATM uses the connection-oriented properties of ATM to overcome the connectionless nature of IP. It functions in a manner similar to LANE. A central IP server (called an ATMARP server) maintains a database of IP and ATM addresses, and provides configuration and broadcast services. These broadcast services are necessary because ATM is a nonbroadcast protocol. IP over ATM services do not reside in one place and are not usually on an ATM switch. All the IP over ATM services are provided with Windows 2000.</p>

<p>In effect, IP over ATM is a small layer between the ATM protocol and the TCP/IP protocols. The client emulates standard IP to the TCP/IP protocol at its top edge and uses native ATM commands to the ATM protocol layers underneath.</p>

<p>IP over ATM is handled by two primary components: the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) server (Atmarps.sys) and the ARP client (Atmarpc.sys). The ARP server is composed of an ATMARP server and Multicast Address Resolution Service (MARS). The ATMARP server provides services that emulate standard IP functions, while MARS provides broadcast and multicast services. Both services maintain IP address databases.</p>

<A NAME="427"><h3>ATM over xDSL</h3></A>
<p>Digital Subscriber Line (xDSL) technology is a means by which plain old telephone service (POTS) can be used to send digital data over a pair of copper wires to the central station of a telephone company. To connect many DSL users to an ATM backbone network, the DSL data is sent to a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM). The far side of the DSLAM connects to an ATM network that provides gigabit data rates. At the other end of each transmission, a DSLAM demultiplexes the signals and forwards them to appropriate individual DSL connections.</p>

<p>ATM over xDSL offers high-speed network access from the home and small office environment. Many types of DSL, including asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) and very high digital subscriber line (VDSL), are being developed in these areas. These technologies use the <i>local loop,</i> the copper wires for ADSL or fiber optic cable for VDSL, that connect the local central office in a user's neighborhood to the user's data jack. In many areas, this local loop connects directly to an ATM core network run by a telephone company.</p>

<p>ATM over xDSL service preserves the high-speed characteristics and QoS guarantees available in the core ATM network without changing protocols. This creates the potential for an end-to-end ATM network to the residence or small office.</p>

<A NAME="428"><h3>ATM Access through Winsock 2.0 and Native ATM Access</h3></A>
<p>ATM support for Winsock 2.0 is available through the Windows Sockets ATM Service Provider. As a result, applications that use TCP as their transport protocol can use Winsock 2.0 directly to gain access to ATM-based networks.</p>

<p>Applications that use native ATM can create virtual circuits and access QoS guarantees. This capability is supplied by a connection-oriented service added to version 5.0 of the Network Driver Interface Service (NDIS). The connection-oriented service in NDIS 5.0 is called <i>CoNDIS</i>.</p>

<A NAME="429"><h2>NWLink</h2></A>
<p>NWLink is Microsoft's implementation of the Novell NetWare IPX/SPX protocol. NWLink is most commonly used in environments where clients running Microsoft operating systems are used to access resources on NetWare servers, or where clients running NetWare are used to access resources on computers running Microsoft operating systems. NWLink does not allow a computer running Windows 2000 to directly access files or printers shared on a NetWare server, or to act as a file or print server to a NetWare client. To access files or printers on a NetWare server, such as the Client Service for NetWare (CSNW) in Windows 2000 Professional or the Gateway Service for NetWare (GSNW) in Windows 2000 Server, must be used.</p>

<p>GSNW acts as a redirector for a computer running Windows 2000 Server where it is installed and as a gateway for other client computers. The gateway function allows a computer running Windows 2000 Server to share NetWare resources (folders and printers) as if they are located on the Windows 2000 server. As a result, client computers that are able to access shares on the 
Windows 2000 Server computer can use the shares made available through GSNW. GSNW is a low-performance access solution; it allows a single user connection provides gateway access to resources on the NetWare server.</p>

<p>NWLink is useful if there are NetWare client/server applications running that use Winsock or NetBIOS over IPX/SPX protocols. In addition, NetWare NetBIOS Link (NWNBLink) contains Microsoft enhancements to NetBIOS. The NWNBLink component is used to format NetBIOS-level requests and pass them to the NWLink component for transmission on the network.</p>

<A NAME="430"><h3>Setting the Frame Type</h3></A>
<p>The frame type defines the way in which the network adapter, in a computer running Windows 2000, formats data to be sent over a network. To communicate between a computer running Windows 2000 and NetWare servers, you need to configure NWLink on the computer running Windows 2000 with the same frame type as that used by the NetWare servers.</p>

<p>The following table lists the topologies and frame types supported by NWLink.</p>

<p><table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr>
<th>Topology</th><th>Supported frame type</th>
</tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Ethernet</td> <td valign="top">Ethernet II, 802.3, 802.2, and Sub Network Access Protocol (SNAP), which defaults to 802.2</td></tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Token ring</td> <td valign="top">802.5 and SNAP</td></tr><tr>
<td valign="top">Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)</td><td valign="top">802.2 and 802.3</td></tr></table></p>


<p>On Ethernet networks, the standard frame type for NetWare 2.2 and NetWare 3.11 is 802.3. Starting with NetWare 3.12, the default frame type was changed to 802.2.</p>

<p>You can choose to automatically detect or manually configure the frame type. However, the frame type is automatically detected when NWLink is loaded. If multiple frame types are detected in addition to the 802.2 frame type, NWLink defaults to the 802.2 frame type.</p>

<p>If the frame type is manually configured, a computer running Windows 2000 can use multiple frame types simultaneously.</p>

<p>You can configure the frame type by using the NWLink IPX/SPX/NetBIOS-Compatible Transport Protocol Properties dialog box. For more information, see Windows 2000 Help.</p>

<A NAME="431"><h2>NetBEUI</h2></A>
<p>NetBEUI was originally developed as a protocol for small departmental LANs of 20 to 200 computers. NetBEUI is not routable because it doesn't have a network layer. Because of this limitation, you must connect computers running Windows 2000 and NetBEUI by using bridges instead of routers. In addition, NetBEUI is broadcast-based, which means it relies on broadcasts for many of its functions, such as name registration and discovery, and so it creates more broadcast traffic than other protocols. NetBEUI is included with Windows 2000 Server and Windows 2000 Professional primarily as a legacy protocol to support workstations that have not been upgraded to Windows 2000.</p>

<p>NetBEUI provides compatibility with existing LANs that use the NetBEUI protocol. NetBEUI provides computers running Windows 2000 with the following capabilities:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Connection-oriented and connectionless communication between computers</li></p>


<p><li>Self-configuration and self-tuning</li></p>

<p><li>Error protection</li></p>

<p><li>Small memory overhead</li></p>
</ul>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
A Windows 2000 network running Active Directory services cannot use NWLink or NetBEUI as the primary protocol. Only TCP/IP is supported for access to Active Directory services.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="432"><h2>AppleTalk</h2></A>
<p>AppleTalk is a protocol suite developed by Apple Computer Corporation for communication between Macintosh computers. Windows 2000 includes support for AppleTalk, which allows computers running Windows 2000 Server and Apple Macintosh clients to share files and printers. AppleTalk also allows Windows 2000 to be a router and a dial-up server.</p>

<p>For the AppleTalk protocol to function properly, a Windows 2000 Server computer must be configured with Windows 2000 Services for Macintosh and must be available on the network.</p>

<A NAME="433"><h2>DLC</h2></A>
<p>The DLC protocol was developed for IBM mainframe communications. It was not designed to be a primary protocol for network use between personal computers. However, DLC is used to print to Hewlett-Packard printers that are connected directly to networks. Network-attached printers use the DLC protocol because the received frames are easy to disassemble and because DLC functionality can easily be coded into read-only memory (ROM). The usefulness of DLC is limited because it doesn't directly interface with the Transport Driver Interface layer. DLC should be installed only on network machines that perform tasks such as sending data to a network Hewlett-Packard printer. Clients sending print jobs to a network print device through a Windows 2000 print server do not need the DLC protocol installed.</p>

<p>Only the print server communicating directly with the print device requires the DLC protocol to be installed. Once the DLC protocol is installed on a computer running Windows 2000 Server, a new printer port type will be available. Figure 9.2 shows the new port type appearing in the Printer Ports dialog box. This dialog box is accessed from the Ports tab in the Properties dialog box of a printer.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/f09xx02.jpg" border="0">
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 9.2</b> <i>The dialog box used to configure a new DLC-based Hewlett-Packard network printer</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>The network adapter card MAC (Media Access Control) address of DLC-enabled printers or print servers appears in the larger box below Card Address in Figure 9.2. Make sure that the DLC-enabled network print device is connected to the network, turned on, and configured for DLC operation.</p>

<p>After you have configured a Windows 2000 Server computer to perform the role of print server for the DLC-enabled network print device, client computers can connect to the printer share on the Windows 2000 Server. If print jobs are appearing on the DLC-enabled print device that were not sent through the Windows 2000 Server print server, client computers might be running the DLC protocol and printing directly to the DLC-enabled network print device. Use Network Monitor or another network analyzer to determine which computers on the network are running the DLC protocol.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
All Hewlett-Packard JetDirect cards currently support the TCP/IP suite and should be added by using the standard TCP/IP port. Only older Hewlett-Packard JetDirect cards that do not support TCP/IP require the Hewlett-Packard network port that uses the DLC protocol.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="434"><h2>IrDA</h2></A>
<p>IrDA is a group of short-range, high-speed, bidirectional wireless infrared protocols. IrDA allows a variety of devices to communicate with each other, such as cameras, printers, portable computers, desktop computers, and personal digital assistants (PDAs). The IrDA protocol stack is accessed by using NDIS connectionless drivers.</p>

<A NAME="435"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>A protocol is a set of rules and conventions for sending information over a network. Windows 2000 supports a number of protocols, including TCP/IP. The TCP/IP suite of protocols has been adopted by Microsoft as the strategic enterprise transport protocol for Windows 2000. TCP/IP can be transported over a number of networks based on media access technologies such as Ethernet, Token Ring, and ATM. Media access is only part of what ATM provides. ATM is a group of technologies (hardware and software) that together provide for connection-oriented communication that is ideal for voice, video, and data communications. NWLink is a Microsoft-compatible IPX/SPX protocol for Windows 2000. NetBEUI is also included with Windows 2000 Server and Windows 2000 Professional, although it is primarily a legacy protocol used to support workstations that have not been upgraded to Windows 2000. In addition, Windows 2000 includes support for AppleTalk, which allows Windows 2000 to be a router and a dial-up server. DLC was
developed for IBM mainframe communications; however, older models of Hewlett-Packard printers connected directly to networks use DLC. IrDA is a group of short-range, high-speed, bidirectional wireless infrared protocols.</p>

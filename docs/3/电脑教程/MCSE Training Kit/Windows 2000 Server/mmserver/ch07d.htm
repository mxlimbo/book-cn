<A NAME="325"><h1>Lesson 3: Administering Group Accounts</h1></A>
<p>This lesson introduces you to groups and how they are implemented in a Windows 2000 environment. You will learn what groups are and how they are used to simplify user account administration. The chapter also reviews the types of groups and presents the skills and knowledge necessary to implement groups into a domain as well as to implement local groups and built-in groups.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b> 

<ul>
<p><li>Implement groups into a domain</li></p>

<p><li>Implement local groups and built-in groups</li></p>
</ul>

<b>Estimated lesson time: 60 minutes</b> 
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="326"><h2>Introduction to Groups</h2></A>
<p>A <i>group</i> is a collection of user accounts. Groups simplify administration by allowing you to assign permissions and rights to a group of users rather than having to assign permissions to each individual user account. Users can be members of more than one group.</p>

<p>When you assign permissions, you give users the capability to gain access to specific resources and you define the type of access they have. For example, if several users needed to read the same file, you would add their user accounts to a group. Then you would give that group permission to read the file. Rights allow users to perform system tasks, such as changing the time on a computer, backing up or restoring files, or logging on locally.</p>

<p>In addition to user accounts, you can add contacts, computers, and other groups to a group. By adding computers to a group, you can simplify the process of granting a system task on one computer access to a resource on another computer.</p>

<A NAME="327"><h2>Implementing Groups into a Domain</h2></A>
<p>Before you implement groups into a domain, you should have a basic understanding of group types, group scopes, and group membership. From there, you can create the groups, add members to the groups, or change the group scope. You can even delete a group.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
In much of the Windows 2000 documentation, groups that are implemented into a domain are usually referred to simply as groups, whereas other groups in Windows 2000 are specifically referred to as local groups or built-in groups, both of which are discussed later in this lesson. At the same time, the term <i>group</i> is often used in a generic sense, referring to any type of group that can be implemented in Windows 2000.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="328"><h3>Types of Groups</h3></A>
<p>Sometimes you create groups for security, such as assigning permissions. At other times you use them for reasons unrelated to security, such as sending
e-mail messages. To facilitate this, Windows 2000 Server includes two group types: security and distribution. The group type determines how you use the group. Both types of groups are contained in the Active Directory store, which allows you to use them anywhere in your network.</p>

<p><b>Security Groups</b></p>

<p>The Windows 2000 operating system uses only security groups, which you use to assign permissions to gain access to resources. Programs designed to search the Active Directory store can also use security groups for reasons unrelated to security, such as sending e-mail messages to a number of users at the same time. Thus, a security group has all the capabilities of a distribution group.</p>

<p><b>Distribution Groups</b></p>

<p>Applications use distribution groups as lists for functions unrelated to security. Use distribution groups when the only function of the group isn't security related, such as sending e-mail messages to a group of users at the same time. You cannot use distribution groups to assign permissions.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
Only programs that are designed to work with Active Directory services can use distribution groups. For example, future versions of Microsoft Exchange Server will be able to use distribution groups as distribution lists for sending e-mail messages.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="329"><h3>Group Scopes</h3></A>
<p>When you create a group, you must select a group type and group scope (Figure 7.8). Group scopes allow you to use groups in different ways to assign permissions.</p>

</p>

<p>The scope of a group determines where in the network you are able to use the group. The three group scopes are domain local, global, and universal.</p>

<p><b>Domain Local Groups</b></p>

<p>Domain local groups are most often used to assign permissions to resources. A domain local group has the following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Open membership</b> You can add members from any domain.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Access to resources in one domain</b> You can use a domain local group to assign permissions to gain access only to resources that are located in the same domain where you create the domain local group.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Global Groups</b></p>

<p>Global groups are most often used to organize users who share similar network access requirements. A global group has the following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Limited membership</b> You can add members only from the domain in which you create the global group.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Access to resources in any domain</b> You can use a global group to assign permissions to gain access to resources that are located in any domain.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Universal Groups</b></p>

<p>Universal groups are most often used to assign permissions to related resources in multiple domains. A universal security group has the following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Open membership</b> You can add members from any domain.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Access to resources in any domain</b> You can use a universal group to assign permissions to gain access to resources that are located in any domain.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Available in Native mode only</b> Universal security groups are not available in Mixed mode. The full feature set of Windows 2000 is available only in Native mode. Notice in Figure 7.8 that the Universal group is not available because the server is running in Mixed mode and the Group Type shows the Security radio button selected. Universal distribution groups are allowed in Mixed mode.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="330"><h3>Group Membership</h3></A>
<p>The group scope determines the membership of the group. Membership rules define which members a group can contain. Group members include user accounts and other groups. The following table describes group membership rules:</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Group scope  </th>
<th>In Mixed-mode scope can contain </th>
<th>In Native-mode scope can contain  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Domain local  </td>
<td valign="top">User accounts, computer accounts, and global groups from any domain </td>
<td valign="top">User accounts, computer accounts, global groups, and universal groups from any domain local groups from the same domain  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Global  </td>
<td valign="top">User accounts from the same domain, and computer accounts </td>
<td valign="top">User accounts, computer accounts, and global groups from the same domain  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Universal  </td>
<td valign="top">Not available in Mixed mode  </td>
<td valign="top">User accounts, computer accounts, global groups, and universal groups from any domain  </td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>Domain local and global groups can be converted to universal groups. A successful conversion requires that Active Directory services is operating in Native mode and the domain local or global group does not contain other group members of the same scope. For instance, a global group containing another global group cannot be converted to a universal group.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
Distribution groups running in Mixed mode follow the same membership rules as security groups running in Native mode.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p><b>Group Nesting</b></p>

<p>Adding groups to other groups (referred to as nesting groups) can reduce the number of times permissions need to be assigned. You should create a hierarchy of groups based on the business needs of the members. Windows 2000 allows for unlimited levels of nesting in Native mode.</p>

<p>For example, you can create a group for each region in your organization and then add managers from each region into their own group. You can then add each regional group to another group called Worldwide Managers. When all managers in the network need access to a resource, assign permissions to the Worldwide Managers group. Because the Worldwide Managers group contains all members of the regional groups through nesting, all managers in the network can access the required resource. This strategy allows for easy hierarchical assignment of permissions and, at the same time, enables decentralized tracking of group membership.</p>

<p>When adding groups to other groups, try to minimize levels of nesting. Nesting reduces the number of times you assign permissions. However, tracking permissions becomes more complex with multiple levels of nesting. One level of nesting is the most effective to use because it reduces the number of times you need to assign permissions and allows you to track permissions easily.</p>

<p>In addition, you should document group membership to keep track of permission assignments. Consider a scenario in which one administrator adds temporary employees to a group created for employees assigned to a project. Not knowing there are temporary employees in the project group, another administrator adds the project group to a group that has access to confidential company information. The temporary employees now have access to confidential company information, which is not acceptable.</p>

<p>Effectively nesting groups in a multiple domain environment will reduce network traffic between domains and simplify administration in a domain tree. To efficiently use nesting, you need to understand the membership rules of groups.</p>

<p>When nesting groups, consider which groups initiate less cross-domain replication. For example, Windows 2000 replicates only a global group and not its membership list. In addition, you need to consider the Domain Operation mode of your domain tree:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>In Mixed mode, only one type of nesting is available; global groups from any domain can be members of domain local groups. Universal groups do not exist in Mixed mode.</li></p>

<p><li>In Native mode, all the group membership rules are available and Windows 2000 permits multiple levels of nesting.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Group Strategies</b></p>

<p>To use groups effectively, you need to determine how you will use groups and which types of groups you will use in certain situations.</p>

<p><b>Using Global and Domain Local Groups</b></p>

<p>Global and domain local group implementation guidelines are identical to the group strategy recommendations for a Windows NT 3.<i>x</i> or 4.0 domain. When you plan to use global and domain local groups, consider the following guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Identify users with common job responsibilities, and add the user accounts to a global group. For example, in an accounting department, add user accounts for all accountants to a global group called Accounting.</li></p>

<p><li>Identify what resources or group of resources, such as related files, users need access to, and then create a domain local group for that resource. For example, if you have a number of color printers in your company, create a domain local group called Color Printers.</li></p>

<p><li>Identify all global groups that share the same access needs for resources, and make them members of the appropriate domain local group. For example, add the global groups Accounting, Sales, and Management to the domain local group Color Printers.</li></p>

<p><li>Assign the required permissions to the domain local group. For example, assign the necessary permissions to use color printers to the Color Printers group.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Figure 7.9 illustrates the strategy for using global and domain local groups: place user accounts into global groups, create a domain local group for a group of resources to be shared in common, place the global groups into the domain local group, and then assign permissions to the domain local group. This strategy gives you the most flexibility for growth and reduces permissions assignments.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 7.9</b> <i>Planning a group strategy</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>In addition, placing user accounts in domain local groups and assigning permissions to the domain local groups does not allow you to assign permissions for resources outside of the domain. This strategy reduces the flexibility when your network grows.</p>

<p>Despite the advantage of using this strategy, placing user accounts in global groups and assigning permissions to the global groups can complicate administration when you are using multiple domains. If global groups from multiple domains require the same permissions, you have to assign permissions for each global group.</p>

<p><b>Using Universal Groups</b></p>

<p>Universal groups is a new feature in Windows 2000. When you plan to use universal groups, consider the following guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Use universal groups to give users access to resources that are located in more than one domain. Unlike domain local groups, you can assign permissions to universal groups for resources in any domain in your network. For example, if executives need access to printers throughout your network, you can create a universal group for this purpose and assign it permissions for using printers on print servers in all domains.</li></p>

<p><li>Use universal groups only when their membership is static. In a domain tree, universal groups can cause excessive network traffic between domain controllers whenever you change membership for the universal group, because changes to the membership of universal groups might be replicated to a large number of domain controllers.</li></p>

<p><li>Add global groups from several domains to a universal group, and then assign permissions for access to a resource to the universal group. This allows you to use a universal group in the same way as domain local groups to assign permissions for resources. However, unlike a domain local group, you can assign permissions to a universal group to give users access to a resource that is located in a domain other than where the group was created.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="331"><h2>Implementing Groups</h2></A>
<p>After you assess user needs and have a group plan in place, you are ready to implement your groups. Before you implement your group strategy, consider the following guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Determine the required group scope based on how you want to use the group. For example, use global groups to group user accounts. Use domain local groups or universal groups to assign permissions to a resource. Assign global groups to domain local groups and universal groups.</li></p>

<p><li>Avoid adding users to universal groups since adding and removing users from universal groups will increase replication traffic.</li></p>

<p><li>Determine if you have the necessary permissions to create a group in the appropriate domain. Members of the Administrators group or the Account Operators group in a domain, by default, have the necessary permissions to create groups. An administrator can give a user the permission to create groups in the domain or in a single OU.</li></p>

<p><li>Determine the name of the group. Make the name intuitive, especially if administrators from other domains search for it in Active Directory services. If there are parallel groups in multiple domains, make sure that the names are also parallel. For example, if there is a group for managers in each domain, these groups should use a similar naming scheme, such as Managers USA and Managers Australia.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Creating Groups</b></p>

<p>Use the Active Directory Users And Computers snap-in to create and delete groups. When you create groups, create them in the Users OU or in an OU that you have created specifically for groups. As your organization grows and changes, you might discover there are groups that you no longer need. Be sure that you delete groups when you no longer need them. This will help you maintain security so that you do not accidentally assign permissions for accessing resources to groups that you no longer need.</p>

<p>To create a group, start the Active Directory Users And Computers snap-in and select the Users OU. From the Action menu, point to New, and then
click Group to open the New Object - Group dialog box (Figure 7.8). The following table describes the information you need to provide in the New Object - Group dialog box.</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Option  </th>
<th>Description  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Group Name  </td>
<td valign="top">The name of the new group. The name must be unique in the domain where you create the group.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Group Name (preWindows 2000)  </td>
<td valign="top">The down-level name of the group. This is filled in automatically for you based on the name you type in.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Group Scope  </td>
<td valign="top">The group scope. Click Domain Local, Global, or Universal. Note that the Universal group scope is grayed out unless the Distribution group type is selected or you are running in
native mode.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Group Type  </td>
<td valign="top">The type of group. Click Distribution or Security.  </td></tr>
</table></p>


<A NAME="332"><h3>Administering Groups</h3></A>
<p>You can administer a group by using the Active Directory Users And
Computers snap-in. The snap-in allows you to perform a number of administrative tasks, including adding members to a group, changing the group scope, or deleting a group.</p>

<p><b>Adding Members to a Group</b></p>

<p>After you create a group, you add members. Members of groups can include user accounts, contacts, other groups, and computers. You can add a computer to a group to give one computer access to a shared resource on another computer, for example, for remote backup.</p>

<p>To add members to a group, double-click the appropriate group. In the Properties dialog box, click the Members tab, and then click Add. The Select Users, Contacts, Or Computers dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7.10.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
If your domain is in Mixed mode, you will not always be able to add groups to your new group, depending on the group scope of the group you are creating.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>In the Look In drop-down list box, you can select a domain from which to display user accounts, contacts, computers, and groups, or you can select Entire Directory to view user accounts and groups from anywhere in the Active Directory store. Now select the user account or group that you want to add, and then click Add.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
If there are multiple user accounts or groups that you want to add, you can repeat the process of selecting them one at a time and then click Add, or you can hold down the Shift or Ctrl key to select multiple user accounts or groups all at once. The Shift key allows you to select a consecutive range of accounts, while the Ctrl key allows you to pick some accounts and skip others. Click Add after you have selected all the accounts you wish to add.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>Clicking Add lists the accounts you have selected in the Name box. Once you review the accounts to make sure they are the accounts you wish to add to the group, click OK to add the members.</p>

<p><b>Changing the Group Scope</b></p>

<p>As your network changes, you might need to change a group scope. For example, you might want to change an existing domain local group to a universal group when you need to allow users to gain access to resources in other domains. You change the scope of a group on the General tab of the Properties dialog box for the group.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
You can change the scope of a group only in Native-mode domains. Changing a group scope is not allowed in Mixed-mode domains. In addition, Windows 2000 does not permit changing the scope of a universal group because all other groups have more restrictive membership and scope than universal groups.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>You can make the following changes to a group scope:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Change a global group to a universal group</b> You can do this only if the global group is not a member of another global group.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Change a domain local group to a universal group</b> You can do this only if the domain local group you are converting does not contain another domain local group.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Deleting a Group</b></p>

<p>Each group you create has a unique, nonreusable identifier, called the security ID (SID). Windows 2000 uses the SID to identify the group and the permissions that are assigned to it. When you delete a group, Windows 2000 does not use the SID again, even if you create a new group with the same name as the group you deleted. Therefore, you cannot restore access to resources by re-creating the group.</p>

<p>When you delete a group, you delete only the group and remove the permissions and rights that are associated with it. Deleting a group does not delete the user accounts that are members of the group. To delete a group, right-click the group, and then click Delete.</p>

<A NAME="333"><h2>Implementing Local Groups</h2></A>
<p>A local group can contain user accounts on a computer and can be assigned to resources on that computer. Use local groups to assign permissions to resources residing on the computer on which the local group is created. Windows 2000 creates local groups in the local security database. There are two types of local groups: domain and non-domain.</p>

<p>Following are some guidelines for using local groups:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Domain local groups are created in the Active Directory store and are used by all domain controllers within the domain. A domain local group can be assigned to any resource running on domain controllers in the domain.</li></p>

<p><li>Non-domain local groups are created on stand-alone servers, member servers, and computers running Windows 2000 Professional. However, these local groups can be used only on the computer where the local group is created. Therefore, do not use non-domain local groups on computers that are part of a domain. Using non-domain local groups prevents you from centralizing group administration. Non-domain local groups do not appear in the Active Directory store. They must be managed separately for each computer.</li></p>

<p><li>You can assign permissions to non-domain local groups for access only to the resources on the computer where you create the local groups.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Non-domain local groups can contain local user accounts from the computer where you create the local groups. In addition, non-domain local groups cannot be a member of any other group.</p>

<A NAME="334"><h3>Creating Local Groups</h3></A>
<p>Use the Computer Management snap-in to create non-domain local groups. You create local groups in the Groups folder (Figure 7.11). To create a local group, expand Local Users And Groups in the console tree and select Groups. From the Action menu, click New Group. Enter a name and description for the group.</p>

<p>You can add members to a local group while you create the group or after you create the local group.</p>

<A NAME="335"><h2>Built-In Groups</h2></A>
<p>Windows 2000 has four categories of built-in groups: global, domain local, local, and system. Built-in groups have a predetermined set of user rights or group membership. Windows 2000 creates these groups for you so that you don't have to create groups and assign rights and permissions for commonly used functions.</p>

<A NAME="336"><h3>Built-In Global Groups</h3></A>
<p>Windows 2000 creates built-in global groups to group common types of user accounts. By default, Windows 2000 automatically adds members to some built-in global groups. You can add user accounts to these built-in groups to provide additional users with the privileges and permissions that you assign to the built-in group.</p>

<p>When you create a domain, Windows 2000 creates built-in global groups in the Active Directory store. You assign rights by either adding the global groups to domain local groups or explicitly assigning user rights or permissions to the built-in global groups.</p>

<p>The Users OU contains the built-in global groups in a domain. The following table describes the default membership of the most commonly used built-in global groups:</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>Global group  </th>
<th>Description  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Domain Users  </td>
<td valign="top">Windows 2000 automatically adds Domain Users to the Users built-in local group. By default, the Administrator account is initially a member, and Windows 2000 automatically makes each new domain user account a member.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Domain Admins  </td>
<td valign="top">Windows 2000 automatically adds Domain Admins to the Administrators domain local group so that members of Domain Admins can perform administrative tasks on any computer anywhere in the domain. By default, the Administrator account is a member.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Domain Guests  </td>
<td valign="top">Windows 2000 automatically adds Domain Guests to the Guests domain local group. By default, the Guest account is a member and this account is disabled.  </td></tr>

<A NAME="337"><h3>Built-In Domain Local Groups</h3></A>
<p>Windows 2000 creates built-in local groups in the domain to provide users with user rights and permissions to perform tasks on domain controllers and in the Active Directory store. A built-in local group performs the same way that a domain local group functions. The only difference is that a built-in local group cannot be deleted.</p>

<p>Built-in local groups in the domain give predefined rights and permissions to user accounts when you add user accounts or global groups as members. The following table describes the most commonly used built-in local groups in the domain and the capabilities that the members have.</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">

<td valign="top">Guests  </td>
<td valign="top">Members can perform only tasks for which you have granted rights and gain access only to resources for which you have assigned permissions; members cannot make permanent changes to their desktop environment. By default, the Guest user account and the Domain Guests global group are members. Some services automatically add users to this account when they are installed. For example, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) adds anonymous user accounts to the Guests built-in group.  </td></tr>

<A NAME="338"><h3>Built-In Local Groups</h3></A>
<p>All stand-alone servers, member servers, and computers running Windows 2000 Professional have built-in local groups. Built-in local groups give rights to perform system tasks on a single computer, such as backing up and restoring files, changing the system time, and administering system resources. Windows 2000 places the built-in local groups into the Groups folder in the Computer Management snap-in. Like built-in groups in the domain, built-in non-domain local groups cannot be deleted.</p>

<p>The following table describes the capabilities that members of the most commonly used built-in local groups have:</p>

<th>Description  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Users  </td>
<td valign="top">Members can perform only tasks for which you have specifically granted rights and can gain access only to resources for which you have assigned permissions. By default, Windows 2000 adds local user accounts that you create on the computer to the Users group. When a member server or a computer running Windows 2000 Professional joins a domain, Windows 2000 adds the Domain Users global group, the Authenticated Users special group, and the INTERACTIVE special group to the local Users group.  </td></tr>

<A NAME="339"><h3>Built-In System Groups</h3></A>
<p>Built-in system groups, known as special groups in Windows NT, exist on
all computers running Windows 2000. System groups do not have specific memberships you can modify, but they can represent different users at different times, depending on how a user gains access to a computer or resource. You do not see system groups when you administer groups, but they are available for use when you assign rights and permissions to resources.
Windows 2000 bases system group membership on how the computer is accessed, not on who uses the computer. The following table describes the most commonly used built-in system groups.</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr> 
<th>System group  </th>
<th>Description  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Everyone  </td>
<td valign="top">Includes all users who access the computer. Be careful if you assign permissions to the Everyone group and enable the Guest account. Windows 2000 will authenticate a user who does not have a valid user account as Guest. The user automatically gets all rights and permissions you have assigned to the Everyone group.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Authenticated Users  </td>
<td valign="top">Includes all users with a valid user account on the computer or in Active Directory services. Use the Authenticated Users group instead of the Everyone group to prevent anonymous access to a resource.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Creator Owner  </td>
<td valign="top">Includes the user account for the user who created or took ownership of a resource. If a member of the Administrators group creates a resource, the Administrators group is the owner of the resource.  </td></tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Interactive  </td>
<td valign="top">Includes the user account for the user who is logged on at the computer. Members of the Interactive group gain access to resources on the computer at which they are physically located. They log on and gain access to resources by &quot;interacting&quot; with the computer.  </td></tr>

<A NAME="341"><h3>Exercise 5: Creating Groups</h3></A>
<p>In this exercise, you create a security global group. You then add members to the group. To add members to the group, you add two user accounts, Jane Doe and John Smith, that you created previously. Next you create a domain local group which you use to assign permissions to gain access to the sales reports. Finally, you provide access to the sales reports for the members of the security global group by adding the security global group to the domain local group. Complete this exercise on Server01.</p>

<p><li><b>Procedure 1: Creating a global group, adding members, and organizing user accounts</b></li></p>

<p>In this procedure, you create a security global group, add members to the group, and then move a user from one OU to another.</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Verify that the Active Directory Users And Computers snap-in is opened and has the focus.</li></p>

<p><li>In the console tree, click the Sales OU.</li></p>

<p>In the details pane, the Jane Doe user account appears.</p>

<p><li>Click the Action menu, point to New, and then click Group.</li></p>


<p>The New Object - Group dialog box appears.</p>

<p>Notice that the Universal group scope is available when the Security group type is selected. This is available because you are running Active Directory services in Native mode.</p>


<p><li>Verify that the Global radio button is selected and that the Security radio button is selected.</li></p>

<p><li>Type <b>Sales</b> in the Group Name text box, and then click OK.</li></p>

<p>The group appears in the details pane of the Sales OU.</p>

<p><li>In the details pane, double-click Sales.</li></p>

<p>The Sales Properties dialog box displays the properties of the group.</p>

<p><li>Click the Members tab.</li></p>

<p><li>Click Add.</li></p>

<p>The Select Users, Contacts, Computers, Or Groups dialog box appears and the Look In drop-down list box shows microsoft.com.</p>

<p><li>In the list, select Jane_Doe, press and hold down the Ctrl key and then click John_Smith.</li></p>

<p>Both user accounts are selected. Notice that Jane Doe is in the microsoft.com/Sales OU and John Smith is in the microsoft.com/Users OU.</p>

<p><li>Click Add.</li></p>


<p>Jane Doe and John Smith are now members of the Sales security
global group.</p>


<p><li>Click OK.</li></p>

<p><li>Click OK again to close the Sales Properties dialog box.</li></p>

<p>For organizational purposes, you have decided to move John Smith to the Sales OU.</p>

<p><li>Click on the Users OU.</li></p>

<p><li>Click the John Smith user account in the details pane.</li></p>

<p><li>Click Action and then click Move.</li></p>

<p>The Move window appears.</p>

<p><li>Click the Sales OU in the Move window, and then click OK.</li></p>

<p>The John Smith user account disappears from the details pane of the Users OU.</p>

<p><li>In the console tree, click the Sales OU.</li></p>

<p>John Smith, Jane Doe, and the Sales global security group appear in the details pane.</p>

<p><li>Double-click the Sales global group. The Sales Properties dialog box appears.</li></p>

<p><li>Click the Members tab.</li></p>

<p>Notice that the John Smith user account remains a member of the group but that the Active Directory Folder is now set to microsoft.com/Sales.</p>

<p><li>Click OK.</li></p>

<p><li>Remain in the Sales OU, and continue to the next procedure.</li></p>
</ol>

<p><li><b>Procedure 2: Creating and using a domain local group</b></li></p>


<p>In this procedure, you create a domain local group that you use to assign permissions to gain access to sales reports. Because you use the group to assign permissions, you make it a domain local group. You then add members to the group by adding the security global group you created in Procedure 1.</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Click in the details pane so that the Sales global group is no longer selected.</li></p>

<p><li>Click the Action menu, point to New, and then click Group.</li></p>

<p>The New Object - Group dialog box appears.</p>

<p><li>In the Group Name text box, enter Reports.</li></p>

<p><li>For Group type, confirm that Security is selected, and for Group Scope, click Domain Local.</li></p>

<p><li>Click OK.</li></p>

<p>The domain local group appears in the details pane of the Sales OU.</p>

<p><li>In the details pane of the Sales OU, double-click Reports.</li></p>

<p>The Reports Properties dialog box displays the properties of the group.</p>

<p><li>Click the Members tab.</li></p>

<p><li>Click Add.</li></p>

<p>The Select Users, Contacts, Computers, Or Groups dialog box appears.</p>

<p><li>Click the down arrow to the right of the Look In drop-down list box, select Entire Directory.</li></p>

<p>User accounts and groups from all domains and locations of each user account or group appear.</p>

<p><li>Above the list of user accounts, groups, and computers, click the name column.</li></p>


<p>The Name column is sorted alphabetically by name (in descending order).</p>

<p><li>Click the Name column again to sort the list in ascending order.</li></p>

<p><li>Click Sales, click Add, and then click OK.</li></p>

<p>The Sales group is now a member of the Reports domain local group.</p>

<p><li>Click OK.</li></p>

<p><li>Close the Active Directory Users And Computers snap-in.</li></p>
</ol>

<p><li><b>Procedure 3: Implementing NTFS security</b></li></p>


<p>In <a href="ch04a.htm">Chapter 4</a>, you learned about NTFS permissions. In this procedure, you will assign NTFS permissions to the local group you created in the last procedure and then you will test access to the sales folder. Complete this exercise from Server01.</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Create a folder on the C: drive named Dept.</li></p>

<p><li>Share the Dept folder as Dept, and in the Comment text box, type <b>Department share</b>.</li></p>

<p>There is no need to set permissions on the share since the Dept folder is created on an NTFS volume.</p>

<p><li>Create a subfolder below the Dept folder, and name it <b>Sales</b>.</li></p>

<p><li>Click the Sales folder.</li></p>

<p><li>Click the File menu and then click Properties.</li></p>

<p>The Sales Properties dialog box appears.</p>

<p><li>Click the Security tab.</li></p>

<p>Notice that the Everyone system group is granted full control to this folder.</p>

<p><li>Clear the Allows Inheritable Permissions From Parent To Propagate To This Object check box.</li></p>

<p>The Security message box appears instructing you on your options.</p>

<p><li>Click Remove.</li></p>

<p>The Sales Properties dialog box appears.</p>

<p><li>Click Add.</li></p>

<p>The Select Users, Computers, Or Group dialog box appears.</p>

<p><li>Select Entire Directory in the Look In drop-down list box.</li></p>

<p><li>Select the Reports domain local group, and then click Add.</li></p>

<p><li>Click OK.</li></p>

<p>In the Sales Properties dialog box, the Reports local group is granted Read &amp; Execute, List Folder Contents, and Read permissions.</p>

<p><li>Click the Write check box, and click OK.</li></p>

<p><li>Close the Dept window, and log off as Administrator.</li></p>

<p><li>Log on as Jane_Doe with a password of &quot;student&quot; and access the C:\Dept\Sales folder from My Computer.</li></p>

<p><li>Click the File menu, point to New and then click Text Document.</li></p>

<p>The New Text Document file appears in the Sales window.</p>

<p><li>Double-click the New Text Document.</li></p>

<p>New Text Document - Notepad appears.</p>

<p><li>Type a few letters, and then close Notepad.</li></p>

<p>A message box appears asking if you want to save the changes.</p>

<p><li>Click Yes.</li></p>

<p><li>Close the Sales window.</li></p>

<p><li>Log off as Jane_Doe, and then log on as Bob_Train with no password.</li></p>

<p>If you are unable to logon as Bob Train, check to see if you are logging on during a time when you configured Bob Train not to be able to log on. You configured this in an earlier exercise in this chapter.</p>

<p><li>Attempt to access the C:\Dept\Sales folder.</li></p>


<p>A Dept message box appears stating that access is denied.</p>

<p>Access is not allowed for the Bob Train user account since he is not a member of the global group Sales which was made a member of the domain local group, Reports. Notice also that local access is not allowed. This is because NTFS permissions restricts both network and local access.</p>


<p><li>Click OK and close the Dept window.</li></p>

<p><li>Log off as Bob Train.</li></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="342"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>A group is a collection of user accounts, contacts, computers, and other groups. There are two types of groups in Windows 2000: security groups and distribution groups. The Windows 2000 operating system uses only security groups, which you use to assign permissions to gain access to resources. Applications use distribution groups as lists for nonsecurity-related functions. In addition to being defined by type, a group is also defined by its scope. There are three group scopes: global, domain local, and universal. Domain local security groups are most often used to assign permissions to resources, while global groups are most often used to organize users who share similar network access requirements. Universal groups are most often used to assign permissions to related resources in multiple domains. The group scope determines the membership of the group. Membership rules consist of the members that a group can contain and the groups of which a group can be a member. When you're ready to create your
group in a domain, use the Active Directory Users And Computers snap-in. The snap-in also allows you to administer groups, which includes adding members to a group, changing the scope of a group, and deleting a group. To create a non-domain local group, use the Computer Management snap-in.</p>

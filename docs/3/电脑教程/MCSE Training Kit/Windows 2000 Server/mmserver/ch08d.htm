<A NAME="380"><h1>Lesson 3: Administering Network Printers</h1></A>
<p>In this lesson, you will learn about setting up and administering network printers. This includes managing printers and documents, using a Web browser to administer printers, setting up a printer pool, setting up priorities between printers, and troubleshooting common printing problems.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b> 

<ul>
<p><li>Access printers and assign permissions</li></p>

<p><li>Manage printers and documents</li></p>

<p><li>Use a Web browser to administer printers</li></p>

<p><li>Set up a printer pool</li></p>

<p><li>Set priorities between printers</li></p>
</ul>

<b>Estimated lesson time: 90 minutes</b> 
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="381"><h2>Accessing Printers</h2></A>
<p>You can gain access to printers for administration by using either the Printers window on the Start menu or the Find feature in the Active Directory Users And Computers snap-in. The Printers window allows you to perform all administrative tasks; however, you cannot perform some tasks from the Active Directory Users And Computers snap-in. For example, you cannot use the snap-in to take a printer offline. To take a printer offline, you must access the specific printer through the Printers window.</p>

<p>Microsoft Windows 2000 allows you to control printer usage and administration by assigning permissions through the Security tab of the printer Properties dialog box (Figure 8.8). By using printer permissions, you can control who can use a printer. You can also assign printer permissions to control who can administer a printer and the level of administration, which can include managing printers and managing documents.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/f08xx08.jpg" border="0">
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 8.8</b> <i>The default permissions assigned to a printer as seen in the HP LaserJet 5Si Properties dialog box with the Security tab active</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>For security reasons, you might need to limit user access to certain printers. You can also use printer permissions to delegate responsibilities for specific printers to users who are not administrators. Windows 2000 provides three levels of printer permissions: Print, Manage Documents, and Manage Printers, as shown in the Permissions box in Figure 8.8.</p>

<p>You can allow or deny printer permissions. As with group policy and NTFS permissions, denied permissions always override allowed permissions. For example, if you select the Everyone system group appearing in Figure 8.8 and then click the Deny check box next to Manage Documents, no one can manage documents, even if you granted this permission to another user account or group. This is because all user accounts are members of the Everyone system group.</p>

<p>By default, Windows 2000 assigns the Print permission for each printer to the Everyone system group, allowing all users to send documents to the printer. You can also assign printer permissions to users or groups. You can change the default printer permissions that Windows 2000 assigned, or those that you previously assigned, for any user or group.</p>

<A NAME="382"><h2>Managing Printers</h2></A>
<p>Managing printers includes assigning forms to paper trays and setting a separator page. In addition, you can pause, resume, and cancel all print jobs in a printer queue or a specific document if a problem occurs on a print device. If a print device is faulty or you add print devices to your network, you might need to redirect documents to a different printer. In addition, you might need to change who has ultimate administrative responsibility for printers, which involves changing ownership.</p>

<A NAME="383"><h3>Assigning Forms to Paper Trays</h3></A>
<p>If a print device has multiple trays that regularly hold different paper sizes, you can assign a form to a specific tray. A form defines a paper size. Users can then select the paper size from within their application. When the user prints a document, Windows 2000 automatically routes the print job to the paper tray that holds the correct form. Examples of forms include Legal, Letter, A4, and Executive.</p>

<p>To assign a form to a paper tray, select the printer in the Printers folder and then select Properties from the File menu. In the Properties dialog box for the printer, click the Device Settings tab as shown in Figure 8.9. From here, you can assign a form.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/f08xx09x.jpg" border="0">
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 8.9</b> <i>The Device Settings for an HP LaserJet 5Si</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>After you have set up a paper tray, users specify the paper size from within applications. Windows 2000 knows which paper tray the form is located in.</p>

<p>Note that Figure 8.9 shows some features grayed out. This is because the feature is not installed or not available on the printer. The features that appear under the Device Settings tab are determined by the device driver for the print device. For example, an HP LaserJet 5L personal laser printer has only two possible paper inputs: the automatic paper feed (called the Paper Input Bin) and the manual paper feed. Notice that in Figure 8.9, the device settings shows seven possible paper input locations and many other features not available in every print device.</p>

<A NAME="384"><h3>Setting a Separator Page</h3></A>
<p>A separator page is a file that contains print device commands. Separator pages have two functions:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>To identify and separate printed documents.</li></p>

<p><li>To switch between print modes. Some print devices can switch between print modes that take advantage of different device features. You can use separator pages to specify the correct page description language. For example, you can specify PostScript or Printer Control Language (PCL) for a print device that can switch between different print modes but cannot automatically detect which language a print job uses.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Windows 2000 includes four separator page files. They are located in the %systemroot%\System32 folder. The following table lists the file name and describes the function for each of the included separator page files:</p>

<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr><th valign="top">File name</th> <th valign="top">Function</th></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">Pcl.sep</td> 
<td valign="top">Switches the print mode to PCL for HP-series print devices and prints a page before each document</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">Pscript.sep</td> 
<td valign="top">Switches the print mode to PostScript for HP-series print devices but does not print a page before each document</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">Sysprint.sep</td> 
<td valign="top">Prints a page before each document. Compatible with PostScript print devices</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">Sysprtj.sep</td> 
<td valign="top">A version of Sysprint.sep that uses Japanese characters</td></tr>
</table>

<p>You can build your own custom separator pages by creating a .sep file that contains legal printer commands. Or you can customize the existing .sep files to meet your needs. Refer to the documentation with your printer for commands that are legal for your printer.</p>

<p>Once you have decided to use a separator page and have chosen an appropriate one, click the Advanced tab in the printer's Properties dialog box, then click the Separator Page button. From the Separator Page dialog box, you can type in the name of the separator page to use or browse for it. Once the separator page is configured, it will print at the beginning of each print job.</p>

<A NAME="385"><h3>Pausing, Resuming, and Canceling Documents</h3></A>
<p>Pausing and resuming a printer or canceling all documents on a printer might be necessary if there is a printing problem.</p>

<p>There are two places within the Printers window to pause, resume, or cancel all documents. First select the name of the print device, and then click the File menu. From there, you can either click Pause Printing or Cancel All Documents or click Open in the File menu and then select the appropriate command.</p>

<p>The following table describes the tasks you can perform when you manage printers, how to perform the tasks, and examples of situations in which you might perform these tasks:</p>

<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr><th valign="top">Task</th> <th valign="top">Action</th> <th valign="top">Example</th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">To pause printing</td>
<td valign="top">Click Pause Printing. A check mark, indicating that the printer is paused, appears next to the Pause Printing command.</td>
<td valign="top">Pause the printer if there is a problem with the printer or print device until you fix the problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">To resume printing</td>
<td valign="top">Click Pause Printing again. The check mark next to the Pause Printing command disappears, which indicates the printer is active.</td>
<td valign="top">Resume printing after you fix a problem with a printer or print device.</td>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td valign="top">To cancel all documents</td> 
<td valign="top">Click Cancel All Documents. All documents are deleted from the printer.</td>
<td valign="top">Cancel all documents to clear a print queue after old documents that no longer need to print have accumulated.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
You can also pause a printer by taking the printer offline. When you take a printer offline, documents stay in the print queue, even when the print server is shut down and then restarted. To take a printer offline, open the window for the specific printer, and on the Printer menu, click Use Printer Offline.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="386"><h3>Redirecting Documents to a Different Printer</h3></A>
<p>You can redirect documents to a different printer. For example, if a printer is connected to a faulty print device, redirect the documents so that users do not need to resubmit them. You can redirect all print jobs for a printer, but you cannot redirect specific documents. The new printer must use the same printer driver as the current printer.</p>

<p>You can redirect documents by opening the Properties dialog box for the specific printer. Select the Ports tab, and add a port.</p>

<p>If another print device is available for the current print server, you can continue to use the same printer and configure the printer to use the other print device. To configure a printer to use another local or network print device that uses the same printer driver, select the appropriate port on the print server and cancel the selection of the current port. Any currently printing documents cannot be redirected to another printer.</p>

<A NAME="387"><h3>Taking Ownership of a Printer</h3></A>
<p>By default, the user who installs the printer owns it. If that user can no longer administer the printer&#8212;for example, if the current owner leaves the company&#8212;another owner should take ownership to administer that printer.</p>

<p>The following users can take ownership of a printer:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>A user or a member of a group who has the Manage Printers permission for the printer.</li></p>

<p><li>Members of the Administrators, Print Operators, Server Operators, and Power Users groups. By default, these groups have the Manage Printers permission, which allows them to take ownership.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Taking ownership of a printer is an advanced security feature that can be accessed from the Advanced button located under the Security tab of a printer's Properties dialog box. Ownership of a printer cannot be assigned by one user to another user. However, an administrator can assign ownership to the Administrators group.</p>

<p>Auditing can be used to track who successfully and unsuccessfully attempts to take ownership of a printer. Auditing, like taking ownership, is an advanced security feature that can be accessed from the Advanced button located under the Security tab of a printer's Properties dialog box.</p>

<A NAME="388"><h2>Managing Documents</h2></A>
<p>In addition to managing printers, Windows 2000 allows you to manage documents. Managing documents includes pausing, resuming, restarting, and canceling a document if there is a printing problem. In addition, you can set who should be notified when a print job is finished, the priority level (which allows a critical document to print before other documents), and a specific time for a document to print.</p>

<A NAME="389"><h3>Pausing, Restarting, and Canceling a Document</h3></A>
<p>If there is a printing problem with a specific document, you can pause and resume printing of the document. Additionally, you can restart or cancel a document. You must have the Manage Documents permission for the appropriate printer to perform these actions. Because the creator of a document has the default permissions to manage that document, users can perform any of these actions on their own documents.</p>

<p>To manage a document, open the window for the printer and select the document. Click the Document menu, and then click the appropriate command to pause, resume, restart, or cancel a document.</p>

<p>The following table describes the tasks you might perform when you manage individual documents, how to perform the tasks, and examples of situations in which you might perform these tasks.</p>

<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr><th valign="top">Task</th> <th valign="top">Action</th> <th valign="top">Example</th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">To pause printing a document</td>
<td valign="top">Select the document for which you want to pause printing, and then click Pause. (The status changes to Paused.)</td> 
<td valign="top">Pause printing when there is a problem with the document.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">To resume printing a document</td>
<td valign="top">Select the document for which you want to resume printing, and then click Resume. (The status changes to Printing.)</td> 
<td valign="top">Resume printing after you fix a problem with a paused document.</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td valign="top">To restart printing a document</td>
<td valign="top">Select the document for which you want to restart printing, and then click Restart. Restart causes printing to start from the beginning of the document.</td> 
<td valign="top">Restart printing of a partially printed document after you fix a problem with the document or the print device.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">To cancel printing a document</td>
<td valign="top">Select the document for which you want to cancel printing, and then click Cancel. You can also cancel a document by pressing the Delete key.</td> 
<td valign="top">When a document has the wrong printer settings or is no longer needed, delete it before it prints.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<A NAME="390"><h3>Setting Notification, Priority, and Printing Time</h3></A>
<p>You can control print jobs by setting the notification, priority, and printing time. To perform these document management tasks; you must have the Manage Documents permission for the appropriate printer.</p>

<p>You set the notification, priority, and printing time for a document on the General tab of the Properties dialog box for the document. To open the Properties dialog box for a document, open the printer in the Printers folder. Select the document, and then click Properties in the Document menu.</p>

<p>The following table describes the tasks you might perform when you control print jobs, how to perform the tasks, and examples of situations in which you might perform these tasks:</p>

<table cellpadding=5 width="95%">
<tr><th valign="top">Task</th> <th valign="top">Action</th> <th valign="top">Example</th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Set a notification</td>
<td valign="top">In the Notify dialog box, type the logon name of the user who should receive the notification. By default, Windows 2000 enters the name of the user who printed the document.</td> 
<td valign="top">Change the print notification when someone other than the user who printed the document needs to retrieve it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Change a document priority</td>
<td valign="top">Move the Priority slider to the priority you want. The highest priority is 99, and the lowest is 1.</td>
<td valign="top">Change a priority so that a critical document prints before the other documents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Schedule print times</td>
<td valign="top">To restrict print times, click Only From in the Schedule section, and then set the hours between which you want the document to print.</td>
<td valign="top">Set the print time for a large document so that it will print during off hours, such as late at night.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<A NAME="391"><h2>Administering Printers from a Web Browser</h2></A>
<p>Windows 2000 enables you to manage printers from any computer running a Web browser, regardless of whether the computer is running Windows 2000 or has the correct printer driver installed. With any of the more common Internet browsers executing on any type of client platform, users can view Web pages that display the status of a Windows 2000 print server and its connected printers. All management tasks you perform with Windows 2000 management tools are the same when you use a Web browser. The difference in administering with a Web browser is the interface, which is a Web-based interface. For a Windows 2000 Server print server to support Web pages, the computer on which the printer resides must have Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) installed. For a Windows 2000 Professional print server to support Web pages, the computer must be configured with the Microsoft Peer Web Server (PWS).</p>

<p>When IIS is installed, a Printers virtual directory is created under the Default Web site as shown in Figure 8.10. This virtual directory points to the %systemroot%\web\printers folder.</p>

<!--caption--><b>Figure 8.10</b> <i>The Virtual Directoy tab of the Printers Properties dialog box</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<A NAME="392"><h3>Using a Web Browser to Manage Printers</h3></A>
<p>Using a Web browser to manage printers has several advantages:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>It allows you to administer printers from any computer running a Web browser, regardless of whether the computer is running Windows 2000 or has the correct printer driver installed.</li></p>

<p><li>It allows you to customize the interface. For example, you can create your own Web page containing a floor plan with the locations of the printers and the links to the printers.</li></p>

<p><li>It provides a summary page listing the status of all printers on a print server.</li></p>

<p><li>It can report real-time print device data, such as whether the print device is in power saving mode, if the printer driver makes such information available. This information is not available from the Printers window.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="393"><h3>Accessing Printers Using a Web Browser</h3></A>
<p>If you want to gain access to all printers on a print server by using a
Web browser, open the Web browser and use the following address:
<i>http://</i>&lt;<i>print_server</i>&gt;<i>/printers</i>.</p>

<p>If you want to gain access to a specific printer without first viewing a list of all printers, use <i>http://</i>&lt;<i>print_server</i>&gt;/&lt;<i>share</i> &gt;. Figure 8.11 shows the Web page that appears when accessing the Printer1 share on Server01. Notice that after typing <i>http://Server01/printer1</i>, the address appearing in the address field is redirected via active server pages (ASP) to <i>http://server01/printers/ipp_0004.asp?eprinter=Printer1&amp;view=q&amp;page=1139</i>.</p>

</p>

<A NAME="394"><h2>Setting Up a Printer Pool</h2></A>
<p>A printer pool is one printer that is connected to multiple print devices through multiple ports on a print server. The print devices can be local or network print devices. Print devices should be identical; however, you can use print devices that are not identical but use the same printer driver. Figure 8.12 shows a printer pool to three print devices.</p>

<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('f08xx12gx.htm')"> <img src="images/f08xx12g.JPG" border=0 ALT = "Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 8.12</b> <i>Printing to a printer pool containing three print devices</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>When you create a printer pool, users can print documents without having to find out which print device is available&#8212;the printer checks for an available port. Printer pooling is configured from the Ports tab of the printer's Properties dialog box. Once there, select or create the ports containing print devices that will be part of the pool and then check the Enable Printer Pooling check box at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
When you set up a printer pool, place the print devices in the same physical area so that users can easily locate their documents. If you don't place the physical devices in the same area, the downside is that users won't know exactly where their print jobs have printed. The upside to this approach is that users will get additional exercise.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>A printer pool has the following advantages:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>In a network with a high volume of printing, it decreases the time that documents wait on the print server.</li></p>

<p><li>It simplifies administration because you can administer multiple print devices from a single printer.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Before you create a printer pool, make sure that you connect the print devices to the print server or to the network.</p>

<A NAME="395"><h2>Setting Priorities Between Printers</h2></A>
<p>Setting priorities between printers makes it possible to set priorities between groups of documents that all print to the same print device. Multiple printers pointing to the same print device allows users to send critical documents to a high priority printer and noncritical documents to a lower priority printer. The critical documents always print first.</p>

<p>To set priorities between printers, point two or more printers to the same print device&#8212;that is, the same port. The port can be either a physical port on the print server or a port that points to a network print device. Set a different priority for each printer that is connected to the print device, and then have different groups of users print to different printers, or have users send different types of documents to different printers.</p>

<A NAME="396"><h2>Troubleshooting Common Printing Problems</h2></A>
<p>When you detect a printing problem, always verify that the print device is plugged in, powered on, and connected to the print server. For a network print device, verify there is a network connection between the print device and the print server.</p>

<p>To determine the cause of a problem, first try printing from a different program to verify the problem is with the printer and not with the program. If the problem is with the printer, ask the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Can other users print normally to this printer and print device?</li></p>

<p><li>Does the print server use the correct printer driver for the print device?</li></p>

<p><li>Is the print server operational and is there enough disk space for spooling?</li></p>

<p><li>Does the client computer have the correct printer driver?</li></p>

<p><li>Is the Print Spooler service and Remote Procedure Call (RPC) service running on the print server?</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Print Server Properties</b></p>

<p>If you suspect there is a problem with the print server, you can access the properties of the print server from the Printers window. Once there, click the File menu and choose Server Properties. From the Print Server Properties dialog box, you can configure forms, port settings, installed printer drivers, and advanced properties such as the spool folder.</p>

<p>By default, the spool folder points to %systemroot%\System32\spool\
PRINTERS. For a high-volume print server, consider moving the spool folder to a partition other than the boot partition. If the boot partition fills to capacity with print jobs, printing will stop and, more importantly, the operating system will become unstable.</p>

<A NAME="397"><h3>Reviewing Common Printing Problems</h3></A>

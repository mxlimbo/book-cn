<A NAME="789"><h1>Lesson 5: Task Manager</h1></A>
<p>Windows Task Manager provides summary information about computer performance as well as about programs and processes running on the computer. By using Task Manager, you can end programs or processes, start programs, and view a dynamic display of your computer's performance.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b> 

<ul>
<p><li>Use Task Manager to manage applications and tasks</li></p>

<p><li>Use Task Manager to view computer performance</li></p>
</ul>

<b>Estimated lesson time: 20 minutes</b> 
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="790"><h2>Overview of Task Manager</h2></A>
<p>Task Manager provides information about programs and processes running on your computer. It also displays the most commonly used performance measures for processes.</p>

<p>You can use Task Manager to monitor key indicators of your computer's performance. You can quickly see the status of programs that are running and end programs that have stopped responding. You can also assess the activity of running processes by viewing many critical data points, and you can see graphs and data on CPU and memory usage.</p>

<p>To open Task Manager, right-click an empty space on the taskbar and then click Task Manager. You can also open Task Manager by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Delete and then clicking the Task Manager button. The Task Manager interface contains three tabs: Applications, Processes, and Performance. You can change the display options for each tab by selecting the option you want from the View menu. Many of the View menu options are specific to the selected tab.</p>

<p>To update Task Manager data, click Refresh Now on the View menu. You can also change the frequency at which the data is automatically updated. On the View menu, click Update Speed and then click the option that you want. To temporarily freeze the data displayed by Task Manager, click Update Speed on the View menu and then click Paused.</p>

<A NAME="791"><h2>Applications Tab</h2></A>
<p>The Applications tab shows the status of the programs running on your computer (Figure 13.17). On this tab, you can start a new program (New Task button), end a program (End Task button), or switch to another program (Switch To button).</p>

</p>

<p>Using Task Manager to start a program is identical to using the Run command on the Start menu. If a program stops responding, press Ctrl+Alt+Delete to start Task Manager, select the program that is not responding, and then click End Task. Any data entered or changes made that were not saved will be lost.</p>

<A NAME="792"><h2>Processes Tab</h2></A>
<p>The Processes tab shows information about the processes running on your computer (Figure 13.18). For example, you can display information on CPU and memory usage, page faults, handle count, and a number of other parameters.</p>

<p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 13.18</b> <i>Processes tab of Task Manager</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>On the Processes tab, you can sort the list of processes and display other process counters. For a description of each type of counter that you can monitor, see Task Manager Help. To see the available process counters, click the Processes tab and then choose Select Columns from the View menu.</p>

<p>You can also end a process on the Processes tab. However, be careful when ending a process. If you end an application, you will lose unsaved data. If you end a system service, some part of the system might not function properly.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
Task Manager does not allow you to end a process that is critical to the operation of Windows 2000. Utilities on the Windows 2000 Resource Kit will allow you to end critical processes. However, this procedure is likely to cause operating system instability.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>You can end a process plus all processes directly or indirectly created by it. Right-click the process you want to end, and then click End Process Tree. For example, if you end the process tree for an e-mail program such as Microsoft Outlook 98, you will also end related processes such as mapisp32.exe and the MAPI spooler.</p>

<p>The Processes tab also allows you to assign a process to a processor by using the Set Affinity command. However, this command is available only on multiprocessor computers. Using the Set Affinity command limits the execution of the process to the selected processors and could decrease overall performance. In addition, the Process tab allows you to change the priority of a running program. Changing the priority of a process can make it run faster or slower, depending on whether you raise or lower the priority, and it can also adversely affect the performance of other processes. If you have installed a debugger, the debug command can be launched directly from the context menu of a running process appearing under the Processes tab.</p>

<A NAME="793"><h2>Performance Tab</h2></A>
<p>The Performance tab displays a dynamic overview of your computer's performance (Figure 13.19). This view includes graphs for CPU and memory usage; totals for the number of handles, threads, and processes running on the computer; and totals, in kilobytes, for physical, kernel, and commit memory.</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 13.19</b> <i>Performance tab of Task Manager</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>If you select the Show Kernel Times option from the View menu, a red line is added to the CPU Usage graph and to the CPU Usage History graph. The red lines indicate the amount of CPU resources consumed by kernel operations.</p>

<A NAME="794"><h2>Lesson Summary</h2></A>
<p>Task Manager provides information about programs and processes running on your computer. It also displays the most commonly used performance measures for processes. The Task Manager interface contains three tabs: Applications, Processes, and Performance. The Applications tab shows the status of the programs running on your computer. The Processes tab shows information about the processes running on your computer. The Performance tab displays a dynamic overview of your computer's performance.</p>

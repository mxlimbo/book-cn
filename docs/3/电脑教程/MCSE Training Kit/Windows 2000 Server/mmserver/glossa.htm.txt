A simple, inexpensive, flexible network architecture designed for workgroup-sized LANs, ArcNet runs on coaxial, twisted-pair, and fiber-optic cable and supports up to 255 nodes. ArcNet technology predates IEEE Project 802 standards but loosely maps to the 802.4 document. <i>See also</i> <a href="#393"> Project 802</a>.</p>

<p><a name="33"><b>ARP</b></a>
<i>See</i> <a href="#14">Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)</a>.</p>

<p><a name="34"><b>ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network)</b></a>
Acronym for the Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. A pioneering wide area network (WAN), ARPANET was designed to facilitate the exchange of information between universities and other research organizations. ARPANET, which became operational in the 1960s, is the network from which the Internet evolved.</p>

<p><a name="34a"><b>ASCII (American Standard Code for Information
Interchange)</b></a> A coding scheme that assigns numeric values to letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and certain other characters. By standardizing the values used for these characters, ASCII enables computers and computer programs to exchange information.</p>

<p><a name="35"><b>Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL)</b></a>

A recent modem technology that converts existing twisted-pair telephone lines into access paths for multimedia and high-speed data communications. These new connections can transmit more than 8 Mbps to the subscriber and up to 1 Mbps from the subscriber. ADSL is recognized as a physical layer transmission protocol for unshielded twisted-pair media.</p>

<p><a name="36"><b>asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)</b></a>
An advanced implementation of packet switching that provides high-speed data transmission rates to send fixed-size cells over broadband LANs or WANs. Cells are 53 bytes&#8212;48 bytes of data with five additional bytes of address. ATM accommodates voice, data, fax, real-time video, CD-quality audio, imaging, and multimegabit data transmission. ATM uses switches as multiplexers to permit several computers to put data on a network simultaneously. Most commercial ATM boards transmit data at about 155 Mbps, but theoretically a rate of 1.2 gigabits per second is possible.</p>

<p><a name="37"><b>asynchronous transmission</b></a>
A form of data transmission in which information is sent one character at a time, with variable time intervals between characters. Asynchronous transmission does not rely on a shared timer that allows the sending and receiving units to separate characters by specific time periods. Therefore, each transmitted character consists of a number of data bits (that compose the character itself), preceded by a start bit and ending in an optional parity bit followed by a 1-, 1.5-, or 2-stop bit.</p>

<p><a name="38"><b>ATM</b></a>
<i>See</i> <a href="#36">asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)</a>.</p>

<p><a name="39"><b>attachment unit interface (AUI)</b></a>
The connector used with standard Ethernet that often includes a cable running off the main, or backbone, coaxial cable. Also known as a DIX connector.</p>

<p><a name="40"><b>attenuation</b></a>
The weakening or degrading (distorting) of a transmitted signal as it travels farther from its point of origin. This could be a digital signal on a cable or the reduction in amplitude of an electrical signal, without the appreciable modification of the waveform. Attenuation is usually measured in decibels. Attenuation of a signal transmitted over a long cable is corrected by a repeater, which amplifies and cleans up an incoming signal before sending it farther along the cable.</p>

<p><a name="41"><b>auditing</b></a>
A process that tracks network activities by user accounts and a routine element of network security. Auditing can produce records of list users who have accessed&#8212;or attempted to access&#8212; specific resources; help administrators identify unauthorized activity; and track activities such as logon attempts, connection and disconnection from designated resources, changes made to files and directories, server events and modifications, password changes, and logon parameter changes.</p>

<p><a name="42"><b>AUI</b></a>
<i>See</i> <a href="#39">attachment unit interface (AUI)</a>.</p>

<p><a name="47"><b>backup</b></a>
A duplicate copy of a program, a disk, or data, made to secure valuable files from loss.</p>

<p><a name="48"><b>backup domain controller (BDC)</b></a>
In a Windows NT Server domain, a computer that receives a copy of the domain's security policy and domain database and authenticates network logons. It provides a backup if the primary domain controller (PDC) becomes unavailable. A domain is not required to have a BDC, but it is recommended to have a BDC to back up the PDC. <i>See also</i> <a href="#154">domain</a>, <a href="#155"> domain controller</a>, <a href="#389">primary domain controller</a>.</p>

<p><a name="49"><b>bandwidth</b></a>
In communications, the difference between the highest and lowest frequencies in a given range. For example, a telephone accommodates a bandwidth of 3000 Hz, or the difference between the lowest (300 Hz) and highest (3300 Hz) frequencies it can carry. In computer networks, greater bandwidth indicates faster or greater data-transfer capability.</p>

<p><a name="50"><b>barrel connector</b></a>
A component that can connect two pieces of cable to make a longer piece of cable.</p>

<p><a name="51"><b>baseband</b></a>
A system used to transmit the encoded signals over cable. Baseband uses digital signaling over a single frequency. Signals flow in the form of discrete pulses of electricity or light. With baseband transmission, the entire communication-channel capacity is used to transmit a single data signal.</p>

<p><a name="52"><b>base I/O port</b></a>
Specifies a channel through which information is transferred between a computer's hardware, such as the network interface card (NIC), and its CPU.</p>

<p><a name="53"><b>base memory address</b></a>
Defines the address of the location in a computer's memory (RAM) that is used by the NIC. This setting is sometimes called the RAM start address.</p>

<p><a name="54"><b>basic input/output system (BIOS)</b></a>
On PC-compatible computers, the set of essential software routines that test hardware at startup, start the operating system, and support the transfer of data among hardware devices. The BIOS is stored in read-only memory (ROM) so that it can be executed when the computer is turned on. Although critical to performance, the BIOS is usually invisible to computer users.</p>

<p><a name="55"><b>baud</b></a>
A measure of data-transmission speed named after the French engineer and telegrapher Jean-Maurice-Emile Baudot. It is a measure of the speed of oscillation of the sound wave on which a bit of data is carried over telephone lines. Because baud was originally used to measure the transmission speed of telegraph equipment, the term sometimes refers to the data-transmission speed of a modem. However, current modems can send at a speed higher than one bit per oscillation, so baud is being replaced by the more accurate bps (bits per second) as a measure of modem speed.</p>

<p><a name="56"><b>baud rate</b></a>
Refers to the speed at which a modem can transmit data. Often confused with bps (the number of bits per second transmitted), baud rate actually measures the number of events, or signal changes, that occur in one second. Because one event can actually encode more than one bit in high-speed digital communication, baud rate and bps are not always synonymous, and the latter is the more accurate term to apply to modems. For example, the 9600-baud modem that encodes four-bits per event actually operates at 2400 baud, but transmits at 9600 bps (2400 events times 4 bits per event), and thus should be called a 9600-bps modem.</p>

<p><a name="57"><b>BBS</b></a>
<i>See</i> <a href="#83">bulletin board system (BBS)</a>.</p>

<p><a name="58"><b>BDC</b></a>
<i>See</i> <a href="#48">backup domain controller (BDC)</a>.</p>

<p><a name="59"><b>beaconing</b></a>
The process of signaling computers on a ring system that token passing has been interrupted by a serious error. All computers in an FDDI or Token Ring network are responsible for monitoring the token-passing process. To isolate serious failures in the ring, FDDI and Token Ring use beaconing in which a computer that detects a fault sends a signal, called a beacon, onto the network. The computer continues to send the beacon until it notices a beacon from its upstream neighbor. This process continues until the only computer sending a beacon is the one directly downstream of the failure. When the beaconing computer finally receives its own beacon, it assumes the problem has been fixed and regenerates a token.</p>

<p><a name="60"><b>bind</b></a>
To associate two pieces of information with one another.</p>

<p><a name="61"><b>binding</b></a>
A process that establishes the communication channel between a protocol driver and a NIC driver.</p>

<i>See</i> <a href="#76">broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (BISDN)</a>.</p>

<p><a name="64"><b>bisync (binary synchronous communications protocol)</b></a>
A communications protocol developed by IBM. Bisync transmissions are encoded in either ASCII or EBCDIC. Messages can be of any length and are sent in units called frames, optionally preceded by a message header. Because bisync uses synchronous transmission, in which message elements are separated by a specific time interval, each frame is preceded and followed by special characters that enable the sending and receiving machines to synchronize their clocks.</p>

<p><a name="65"><b>bit</b></a>
Short for binary digit: either 1 or 0 in the binary number system. In processing and storage, a bit is the smallest unit of information handled by a computer. It is represented physically by an element such as a single pulse sent through a circuit or small spot on a magnetic disk capable of storing either a 1 or 0. Eight bits make a byte.</p>

<p><a name="66"><b>bits per second (bps)</b></a>
A measure of the speed at which a device can transfer data. <i>See also</i> <a href="#56"> baud rate</a>.</p>

<p><a name="67"><b>bit time</b></a>
The time it takes for each station to receive and store a bit.</p>

<p><a name="68"><b>BNC cable connector</b></a>
A connector for coaxial cable that locks when one connector is insert-ed into another and is rotated 90 degrees.</p>

<p><a name="69"><b>BNC components</b></a>
A family of components that include the BNC cable connector, BNC T connector, BNC barrel connector, and the BNC terminator. The origin of the acronym &quot;BNC&quot; is unclear; names ascribed to these letters range from &quot;British Naval Connector&quot; to &quot;Bayonet Neill-Councelman.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="70"><b>boot-sector virus</b></a>
A type of virus that resides in the first sector of a floppy disk or hard drive. When the computer is booted, the virus executes. In this common method of transmitting viruses from one floppy disk to another, the virus replicates itself onto the new drive each time a new disk is inserted and accessed.</p>

<p><a name="71"><b>bottleneck</b></a>
A device or program that significantly degrades network performance. Poor network performance results when a device uses noticeably more CPU time than it should, consumes too much of a resource, or lacks the capacity to handle the load. Potential bottlenecks can be found in the CPU, memory, NIC, and other components.</p>

<p><a name="72"><b>bounce</b></a>
<i>See</i> <a href="#467">signal bounce</a>.</p>

<i>See</i> <a href="#66">bits per second (bps)</a>.</p>

<p><a name="74"><b>bridge</b></a>
A device used to join two LANs. It allows stations on either network to access resources on the other. Bridges can be used to increase the length or number of nodes for a network. The bridge makes connections at the data-link layer of the OSI reference model.</p>

<p><a name="75"><b>bridged network</b></a>
A network that is connected by bridges.</p>

<p><a name="76"><b>Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (BISDN)</b></a>
A consultative committee for the CCITT that recommends definitions for voice, data, and video in the megabit/gigabit range. BISDN is also a single ISDN network that can handle voice, data, and video services. BISDN works with an optical cable transport network called Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) and an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switching service. SMDS (Switched Multimegabit Data Services) is a BISDN service that offers high bandwidth to WANs. <i>See also</i> <a href="#504">Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)</a>, <a href="#36"> asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)</a>, <a href="#498">Switched Multimegabit Data Services (SMDS)</a>.</p>

<p><a name="77"><b>broadband network</b></a>
A type of LAN on which transmissions travel as analog (radio-frequency) signals over separate inbound and outbound channels. Devices on a broadband network are connected by coaxial or fiber-optic cable, and signals flow across the physical medium in the form of electromagnetic or optical waves. A broadband system uses a large portion of the electromagnetic spectrum with a range of frequencies from 50 Mbps to 600 Mbps. These networks can simultaneously accommodate television, voice, data, and other services over multiple transmission channels.</p>

<p><a name="78"><b>broadcast</b></a>
A transmission sent simultaneously to more than one recipient. In communication and on networks, a broadcast message is one distributed to all stations or computers on the network.</p>

<p><a name="79"><b>broadcast storm</b></a>
An event that occurs when there are so many broadcast messages on the network that they approach or surpass the capacity of the network bandwidth. This can happen when one computer on the network transmits a flood of frames saturating the network with traffic so it can no longer carry messages from any other computer. Such a broadcast storm can shut down a network.</p>

<p><a name="80"><b>brouter</b></a>
A network component that combines the best qualities of a bridge and a router. A brouter can act as a router for one protocol and as a bridge for all the others. Brouters can route selected routable protocols, bridge nonroutable protocols, and deliver more cost-effective and manageable internetworking than separate bridges and routers. A brouter is a good choice in an environment that mixes several homogeneous LAN segments with two different segments.</p>

<p><a name="81"><b>buffer</b></a>
A reserved portion of RAM in which data is held temporarily, pending an opportunity to complete its transfer to or from a storage device or another location in memory.</p>

<p><a name="82"><b>built-in groups</b></a>
One of four kinds of group accounts used by Microsoft Windows NT and Windows NT Server. Built-in groups, as the name implies, are included with the network operating system. Built-in groups have been granted useful collections of rights and built-in abilities. In most cases, a built-in group provides all the capabilities needed by a particular user. For example, if a domain user account belongs to the built-in Administrators group, logging on with that account gives a user administrative capabilities over the domain and the servers in the domain. <i>See also</i> <a href="#558"> user account</a>.</p>

<p><a name="83"><b>bulletin board system (BBS)</b></a>
A computer system equipped with one or more modems or other means of network access that serves as an information and message-passing center for remote users. Many software and hardware companies run proprietary BBSs for customers that include sales information, technical support, and software upgrades and patches.</p>

<p><a name="84"><b>bus</b></a>
Parallel wires or cabling that connect components in a computer.</p>

<p><a name="85"><b>bus topology</b></a>
A topology that connects each computer, or station, to a single cable. At each end of the cable is a terminating resistor, or terminator. A transmission is passed back and forth along the cable, past the stations and between the two terminators, carrying a message from one end of the network to the other. As the message passes each station, the station checks the message's destination address. If the address in the message matches the station's address, the station receives the message. If the addresses do not match, the bus carries the message to the next station, and so on.</p>

<p><a name="86"><b>byte</b></a>
A unit of information consisting of 8 bits. In computer processing or storage, a byte is equivalent to a single character, such as a letter, numeral, or punctuation mark. Because a byte represents only a small amount of information, amounts of computer memory are usually given in kilobytes (1024 bytes or 2 raised to the 10th power), megabytes (1,048,576 bytes or 2 raised to the 20th power), gigabytes (1024 megabytes), terabytes (1024 gigabytes), petabytes (1024 terabytes), or exabytes (1024 petabytes).</p>

<p><a name="88"><b>cable categories</b></a>
The three major groups of cabling that connect the majority of networks: coaxial, twisted-pair (unshielded twisted-pair and shielded twisted-pair), and fiber-optic cabling.</p>

<p><a name="89"><b>cable testers</b></a>
<i>See</i> <a href="#16">advanced cable testers</a>.</p>

<p><a name="90"><b>cache</b></a>
A special memory subsystem or part of RAM in which frequently used data values are duplicated for quick access. A memory cache stores the contents of frequently accessed RAM locations and the addresses where these data items are stored. When the processor references an address in memory, the cache checks to see whether it holds that address. If it does hold the address, the data is returned to the processor; if it does not, regular memory access occurs. A cache is useful when RAM accesses are slow as compared to the microprocessor speed.</p>

<p><a name="91"><b>carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) access method</b></a>
An access method by which each computer signals its intent to transmit before it actually transmits data, thus avoiding possible transmission collisions. <i>See also</i> <a href="#08"> access method</a>.</p>

<p><a name="92"><b>carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method</b></a>

An access method generally used with bus topologies. Using CSMA/CD, a station &quot;listens&quot; to the physical medium to determine whether another station is currently transmitting a data frame. If no other station is transmitting, the station sends its data. A station &quot;listens&quot; to the medium by testing the medium for the presence of a carrier, a specific level of voltage or light&#8212;thus the term carrier-sense. The multiple access indicates that there are multiple stations attempting to access or put data on the cable at the same time. The collision detection indicates that the stations are also listening for collisions. If two stations attempt to transmit at the same time and a collision occurs, the stations must wait a random period of time before attempting to transmit. <i>See also</i> <a href="#08"> access method</a>.</p>

<p><a name="312"><b>multitasking</b></a>
A mode of operation offered by an operating system in which a computer works on more than one task at a time. There are two primary types of multitasking: preemptive and nonpreemptive. In preemptive multitasking, the operating system can take control of the processor without the task's cooperation. In nonpreemptive multitasking, the processor is never taken from a task. The task itself decides when to give up the processor. A true multitasking operating system can run as many tasks as it has processors. When there are more tasks than processors, the computer must &quot;time slice&quot; so that the available processors devote a certain amount of time to one task and then move on to the next task, alternating between tasks until all the tasks are completed.</p>

<p><a name="415"><b>Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC)</b></a>
A type of microprocessor design that focuses on rapid and efficient processing of a relatively small set of instructions. RISC design is based on the premise that most of the instructions that a computer decodes and executes are simple. As a result, RISC architecture limits the number of instructions that are built into the microprocessor, but optimizes each so it can be carried out very rapidly, usually within a single clock cycle. RISC chips execute simple instructions faster than microprocessors designed to handle a much wider array of instructions. They are, however, slower than general-purpose CISC (complex instruction set computing) chips when executing complex instructions, which must be broken down into many machine instructions before they can be carried out by RISC microprocessors.</p>

<p><a name="502"><b>synchronous</b></a>
A form of communication that relies on a timing scheme coordinated between two devices to separate groups of bits and transmit them in blocks called frames. Special characters are used to begin the synchronization and check its accuracy periodically. Because the bits are sent and received in a timed, controlled (synchronized) fashion, start and stop bits are not required. Transmission stops at the end of one transmission and starts again with a new one. It is a start/stop approach, and more efficient than asynchronous transmission. If an error occurs, the synchronous error detection and correction scheme implements a retransmission. However, because more sophisticated technology and equipment is required to transmit synchronously, it is more expensive than asynchronous transmission.</p>

<p><a name="542"><b>trunk</b></a>
A single cable, also called a backbone, or segment.</p>

<p><a name="543"><b>trust relationship</b></a>
Trust relationships are links between domains that enable pass-through authentication, in which a user has only one user account in one domain, yet can access the entire network. User accounts and global groups defined in a trusted domain can be given rights and resource permissions in a trusting domain even though those accounts do not exist in the trusting domain's database. A trusting domain honors the logon authentication of a trusted domain.</p>

<p><a name="550"><b>uninterruptible power supply (UPS)</b></a>
A device connected between a computer or another piece of electronic equipment and a power source, such as an electrical outlet. The UPS ensures that the electrical flow to the computer is not interrupted because of a blackout and, in most cases, protects the computer against potentially damaging events such as power surges and brownouts. Different UPS models offer different levels of protection. All UPS units are equipped with a battery and loss-of-power sensor. If the sensor detects a loss of power, it immediately switches over to the battery so that users have time to save their work and shut off the computer. Most higher-end models have features such as power filtering, sophisticated surge protection, and a serial port so that an operating system capable of communicating with a UPS (such as Windows NT) can work with the UPS to facilitate automatic system shutdown.</p>

<p><a name="551"><b>universal asynchronous receiver transmitter (UART)</b></a>
A module, usually composed of a single integrated circuit, that contains both the receiving and transmitting circuits required for asynchronous serial communication. Two computers, each equipped with a UART, can communicate over a simple wire connection. The operation of the sending and receiving units are not synchronized by a common clock signal, so the data stream itself must contain information about when packets of information (usually bytes) begin and end. This information about the beginning and ending of a packet is provided by the start and stop bits in the data stream. A UART is the most common type of circuit used in personal-computer modems.</p>

<p><a name="552"><b>Universal Naming Convention (UNC)</b></a>
The standard used for a full Windows 2000 name of a resource on a network. It conforms to the \\server\share syntax, where servername is the name of the server and sharename is the name of the shared resource. UNC names of directories or files can also include the directory path under the share name, with the following syntax:\\server\share\directory\filename.</p>

<p><a name="553"><b>Universal Serial Bus (USB)</b></a>
A serial bus with a data transfer rate of 12 megabits per second (Mbps) for connecting peripherals to a microcomputer. USB can connect up to 127 peripheral devices to the system through a single, general-purpose port. This is accomplished by daisy chaining peripherals together. USB is designed to support the ability to automatically add and configure new devices and the ability to add such devices without having to shut down and restart the system.</p>

<p><a name="554"><b>unshielded twisted-pair (UTP)</b></a>
cable A cable with wires that are twisted around each other with a minimum number of twists per foot. The twists reduce signal interference between the wires. The more twists per foot, the greater the reduction in interference (crosstalk). This cable is similar to shielded twisted-pair (STP) cable, but lacks the insulation or shielding found in STP cable.</p>

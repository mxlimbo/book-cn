<A NAME="52"><h1>Lesson 3: Windows 2000 Directory Services</h1></A>
<p>A <i>directory</i> is a stored collection of information about objects that are all related to one another in some way. You can compare a network directory to a telephone directory, which stores the names, addresses and phone numbers of individuals and businesses. The telephone directory is a collection of attributes (names and addresses) that can be used as search properties to locate information about objects (phone numbers) that are stored in the directory. In much the same way, a <i>directory service</i> uniquely identifies users and resources on a network and provides a way to organize and access those users and resources.</p>

</ul>

<b>Estimated lesson time: 45 minutes</b>

</p>

<A NAME="53"><h2>Introduction to Directory Services</h2></A>
<p>In a distributed computing system or a public computer network such as the Internet, many objects are necessary to support that system, such as users, file servers, printers, fax servers, applications, and databases. Users want to easily and efficiently locate and use these objects. Administrators want to manage how these objects are used. If all the information needed to use and manage these objects is stored in a centralized location, the process of locating and managing these resources can be vastly simplified. This is when a directory service becomes useful.</p>

<p>The terms directory and directory service refer to the directories found in public and private networks. A directory is a database of network objects that can be referenced in many different ways. It stores information related to the network resources to facilitate locating and managing these resources. A directory service differs from a directory in that it is both the <i>source</i> of the directory information and the <i>services</i> making the information available to the users.</p>

<p>A directory service provides the means to organize and simplify access to resources of a networked computer system. It makes it possible to find an object based on one or more of its attributes. For example, administrators may not know the exact name of an object, but chances are they know one or more of the attributes of that object. With a directory service, they can query the directory to get a list of objects that match the known attributes. For instance, they could query the directory for all color printer objects that are associated with the third floor attribute (or maybe a location attribute that has been set to &quot;third floor&quot;).</p>

<p>You can use a directory service to perform a number of functions:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Enforce security to protect the objects in its database from outside intruders or from internal users who do not have permission to access those objects</li></p>

<p><li>Replicate a directory to other computers in the network to make it available to more users and make it resistant to failure</li></p>

<p><li>Partition a directory into multiple stores that are located on different computers across the network. This makes more space available to the directory as a whole and allows the storage of a large numbers of objects</li></p>
</ul>

<p>A directory service is both an administration tool and an end-user tool. The larger a network becomes, the more resources there are to manage. As the number of resource objects in a network grows, the more necessary the directory service becomes.</p>

<A NAME="54"><h2>Workgroups and Domains</h2></A>
<p>As stated earlier, a directory service provides a way to organize and simplify access to network resources. However, to facilitate that access, Windows 2000 supports two types of networks: workgroups and domains.</p>

<A NAME="55"><h3>Windows 2000 Workgroups</h3></A>
<p>A <i>workgroup</i> is a logical grouping of networked computers that share resources, such as files and printers. A domain is a logical grouping of network computers that share a central directory database that contains user accounts and security information for the domain. A workgroup is sometimes referred to as a peer-to-peer network because all computers in the workgroup can share resources as equals, without a dedicated server, as shown in Figure 1.3. Each Windows 2000 Server computer and Windows 2000 Professional computer in the workgroup maintains a local security database, which contains a list of user accounts and resource security information for that computer.</p>

<p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 1.3</b> <i>A Windows 2000 workgroup</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>Because each computer in the workgroup maintains a local security database, the administration of user accounts and resource security is decentralized. A user must have a user account on each computer that the user needs to access. Any changes to user accounts, such as changing a password or adding a new account, must be made on each computer. If you forget to add a new user account to one of the computers, the new user will not be able to log on to that computer and will not be able to access resources on it.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 workgroups provide the following advantages:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>A workgroup does not require a computer running Windows 2000 Server to hold centralized security information.</li></p>

<p><li>A workgroup is simple to design and implement; it does not require the extensive planning and administration that a domain requires.</li></p>

<p><li>A workgroup is convenient for a limited number of computers in close proximity, although a workgroup becomes impractical in environments with more than 10 computers.</li></p>

<p><li>A workgroup is well suited to small groups of technical users who do not require central administration.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
In a workgroup, a computer running Windows 2000 Server is called a stand-alone server.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="56"><h3>Windows 2000 Domains</h3></A>
<p>A <i>Windows 2000 domain</i> is a logical grouping of network computers that share a central directory database. A directory database contains user accounts and security information for the domain. In Windows 2000, the directory database is known as the directory and is the database portion of Active Directory services, which is the Windows 2000 directory service. In a domain, the directory resides on computers that are configured as domain controllers (Figure 1.4). A <i>domain controller</i> is a server that manages all security-related user/domain interactions and centralizes administration.</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
In Windowsç‡¦T domains, domain controllers are either backup domain controllers (BDCs) or primary domain controllers (PDCs). In Windows 2000 domains, there is only one type of domain controller. All domain controllers are peers.</blockquote></div>
</p>

</p><p>
<!--caption--><b>Figure 1.4</b> <i>A Windows 2000 domain</i><!--/caption-->
</p>

<p>A domain does not refer to a single location or a specific type of network configuration. The computers in a domain can share physical proximity on a small local area network (LAN) or can be located in different corners of the world, communicating over various kinds of connections, including analog connections, Integrated Services Digital Networks (ISDNs), or Digital Subscriber Lines (DSLs). Domains are discussed in more detail in the following section, &quot;<A HREF="ch01d.htm#57">Windows 2000 Active Directory Services</A>.&quot;</p>

<p>Windows 2000 domains provide the following advantages:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>A domain provides centralized administration because all user information is stored centrally.</li></p>

<p><li>A domain provides a single logon process for users to gain access to network resources, such as file, print, and application resources for which they have permissions. A user can log on to one computer and access resources on another computer in the network as long as that user has appropriate permissions to the resource.</li></p>

<p><li>A domain provides scalability so that you can create very large networks.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="57"><h2>Windows 2000 Active Directory Services</h2></A>
<p>Active Directory services is the directory service included in Windows 2000. Active Directory services provides a single point of network management, allowing you to add, remove, and relocate users and resources easily.</p>

<p>Active Directory services includes the directory, which stores information about network resources, as well as all the services that make the information available and useful. The resources stored in the directory, such as user data, printers, servers, databases, groups, computers, and security policies, are known as objects.</p>

<A NAME="58"><h3>Active Directory Features</h3></A>
<p>Active Directory services organizes resources hierarchically in domains. A <i>domain</i> is a logical grouping of servers and other network resources under a single domain name. The domain is the basic unit of replication and security in a Windows 2000 network.</p>

<p>Each domain includes one or more domain controllers. A <i>domain controller</i> is a Windows 2000 Server computer that stores a complete replica of the domain directory. To simplify administration, all domain controllers in Active Directory services are peers, so you can make changes to any domain controller and the updates are replicated to all other domain controllers in the domain.</p>

<p><b>Scalability</b></p>

<p>In Active Directory services, the directory stores information by using <i>partitions</i>, which are logical dividers that organize the directory into sections and permit storage of a large number of objects. Therefore, the directory can expand as an organization grows, allowing you to scale from a small installation with a few hundred objects to a large installation with millions of objects.</p>

<p><b>Open Standards Support</b></p>

<p>Active Directory services integrates the Internet concept of a namespace with Windows NT directory services. This integration allows you to unify and manage the multiple namespaces that now exist in the heterogeneous software and hardware environments of corporate networks. Active Directory services uses the Domain Name System (DNS) for its name system and can exchange information with any application or directory that uses Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). Active Directory services also shares information with other directory services that support LDAP versions 2 and 3, such as Novell Directory Services (NDS).</p>

<p><b>The Domain Name System (DNS)</b></p>

<p>Because Active Directory services uses DNS as its domain naming and location service, Windows 2000 domain names are also DNS names. Windows 2000 Server uses dynamic DNS, which enables client computers with dynamically assigned addresses to register directly with the DNS server and update the DNS table dynamically. Dynamic DNS can eliminate the need for other Internet naming services, such as Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS).</p>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <hr>
For Active Directory services and associated client software to function correctly, you must have installed and configured the DNS service.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p><b>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)</b></p>

<p>Active Directory services further embraces Internet standards by directly supporting LDAP. LDAP is an Internet standard (RFC

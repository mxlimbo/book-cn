The Win32 Driver Model (WDM) provides a common set of drivers that work in Windows&#160;98 and future versions of Windows&#160;NT. WDM makes it easier and more cost effective for hardware developers to create device drivers for their products, because they can now develop one device driver that will function in multiple operating systems. This lesson presents an overview of WDM and describes WDM architecture.

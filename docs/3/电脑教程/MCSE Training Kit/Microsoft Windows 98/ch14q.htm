<A NAME="636"><H2>Printing to NetWare Print Servers</H2></A><P>
You can submit print jobs from your Windows&#160;98 computer to a NetWare print server. To do this, you set up a printer using either the Add Printer Wizard or Point and Print. 
<P>
You can install a NetWare printer though the Add Printer Wizard or simply by dragging the printer icon from Windows Explorer to your desktop. You must specify the location and name of the required driver unless the NetWare server is configured for Point and Print.
<P>
<A NAME="637"><H3>Point and Print</H3></A><P>
With Point and Print enabled, you can install a network printer locally without user intervention. Point and Print occurs automatically when connecting to a Windows&#160;98 print server, or to a Windows&#160;NT 4.0 print server that is sharing the proper drivers. In order to use Point and Print with a NetWare server, however, you must add the following information to the server's bindery:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Printer name and configuration
<P>
<LI>Names of the printer driver files
<P>
<LI>Location of the printer driver files
</UL>
<P>
You can add this information to your NetWare server's bindery through Windows explorer.
<P>

<B>Note</B>
<P>
Point and Print works with bindery or bindery emulation only.

If you want to configure a printer for a NetWare print queue to support Point and Print installation, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Log on as supervisor or equivalent.
<P>
<LI>	Open <B>Network Neighborhood</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Right-click a print queue on the server and click <B>Properties</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Click the <B>Point and Print Setup </B>tab.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>Enable Point and Print</B>.
<P>
<LI>	In the <B>Path from which clients can copy drivers for the printer </B>box, type <B>\\</B><I>netware_server</I><B>\sys\public\</B><I>printer_folder</I> and then click <B>Set Printer Model</B>.
<P>
The <B>Select Device</B> dialog box appears.
<P>
<LI>	From the list of manufacturers, select the manufacturer of your printer.
<P>
<LI>	From the list of models, select the model of your printer<B>, </B>and then click <B>OK</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>OK again</B>.
<P>
The <B>NDS Administration Dialog </B>box appears. Windows&#160;98 prompts you with the following message: 
<P>
<B>If this task has not been done on the current NDS tree, it will modify the NDS schema database. If so, you must have administrator rights for the [Root] object to continue. Do you want to continue?</B>
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>OK</B>.
</OL>
<P>
After this process is complete, users can install the NetWare printer with minimal user input.
<P>
<A NAME="638"><H3>Configuring NetWare Printers</H3></A><P>
When you install a NetWare printer on your Windows&#160;98 computer, the printer's <B>Properties</B> dialog box displays an additional tab for <B>Capture Settings</B>, from which you can configure:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Form feeds
<P>
<LI>Banner pages
<P>
<LI>The number of copies to print
<P>
<LI>Additional properties for MS-DOS-based programs

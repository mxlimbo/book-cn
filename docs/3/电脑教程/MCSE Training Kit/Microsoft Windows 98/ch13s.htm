<A NAME="601"><H2>Explicit vs. Implicit Permissions</H2></A><P>
In Windows&#160;98 you can assign two types of user-level permissions: explicit and implicit. <I>Explicit</I> permissions are specifically granted to a user or group at some point in the shared folder hierarchy. <I>Implicit</I> permissions are inherited from the explicit permissions assigned to a parent folder. Figure 13.11 illustrates the difference between implicit and explicit permissions.

<P>
In a shared folder hierarchy, explicit permissions apply to all folders below the folder to which the permissions were assigned, unless different explicit permissions are assigned farther down the hierarchy. In this case, the new explicit permissions apply from that point downward through the hierarchy. This is unlike Windows&#160;NT, in which folder permissions cannot grant permissions not already granted through the share.
<P>
If you want to change permissions on a parent folder, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Right-click on the shared resource and select <B>Sharing</B>.
<P>
<LI>	In the <B>Change Security</B> dialog box, choose one of the following options:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Apply these changes to inside folders</B>: changes all explicit permissions applied to folders within this folder to match the permissions set at this folder.
<P>
<LI><B>Do not change any inside folders</B>: leaves unchanged all explicit permissions applied to folders within this folder.
<P>
<LI><B>Display each folder name individually</B>: prompts you to change the explicit permissions on each subfolder that has explicit permissions currently assigned.
</UL>
</OL>
<P>
You can change the permissions on a subfolder of a shared folder without sharing the subfolder. You can also create a separate share for a subfolder.

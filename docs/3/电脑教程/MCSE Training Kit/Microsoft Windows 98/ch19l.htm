<A NAME="849"><H2>Using the Windows Report Tool</H2></A><P>
The Windows Report Tool is an Internet-based bug reporting tool that is installed with Windows&#160;98. If you experience a problem with Windows&#160;98, you can use the Windows Report Tool (Winrep.exe), to compile information about your computer, which you can then send to Microsoft support engineers. You start Windows Report from the <B>Tools</B> menu of the System Information Utility.
<P>
When you run the Windows Report Tool, it prompts you for the following information:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A description of the problem.
<P>
<LI>The results you expect once the problem has been addressed.
<P>
<LI>Steps to reproduce the problem.
</UL>
<P>
The Windows Report Tool then creates a Microsoft System Information (*.nfo) file with your current system information, and collects other system files, including log and configuration files. The Windows Report Tool compresses these files into a cabinet (*.cab) file and prompts you to save it in C:\Windows\Helpdesk\Winrep. This *.cab file can be used by support engineers to help diagnose and resolve the problem. If you are discussing the problem with Microsoft Technical Support, they may ask you to send this file to Microsoft for further investigation.
<P>
If you cannot start Windows&#160;98, you can use an MS-DOS-based tool, Dosrep.exe, to collect system files and compress them into a *.cab file.

Dosrep.exe will work only with modems, and may not recognize ISDN adapters.

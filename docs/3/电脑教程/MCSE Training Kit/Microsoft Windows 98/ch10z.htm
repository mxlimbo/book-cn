You can customize the operation of System File Checker through the <B>Settings</B> button in the <B>System File Checker</B> dialog box. The <B>System File Checker Settings</B> window has the following tabs and options:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Settings.</B> Configure backup and log file options.
<P>
<LI><B>Search Criteria.</B> Specify the files and folders to scan. You can also limit the scan to files with a specific extension if you know the type of file that has been corrupted, but are unsure of exactly which file has been corrupted. This reduces the amount of time that the scan takes.
<P>
<LI><B>Advanced. </B>Choose a different verification data file to use, create a new verification data file, or restore the original Default.sfc. You may want to create a verification file for each type of file. Then, if you suspect that a particular file type has been corrupted, you can load the appropriate verification file.

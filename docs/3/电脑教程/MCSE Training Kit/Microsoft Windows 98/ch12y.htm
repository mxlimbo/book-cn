<A NAME="568"><H1>Summary</H1></A><P>
The following information summarizes the key points in this chapter:
<P>
<A NAME="569"><H3>Installing and Configuring Network Components</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>To use Windows&#160;98 networking features, you must first give your computer a unique name that other computers on the network will recognize, install the hardware and software that enables your computer to connect to the network, and configure the protocol that your computer uses to communicate with other computers on the network.
<P>
<LI>Windows&#160;98 supports a wide range of network types, including Ethernet, Token Ring, Attached Resource Computer network (ArcNet), Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), wireless technologies (including infrared), and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).
<P>
<LI>The Windows&#160;98 implementation of TCP/IP includes the standard suite of TCP/IP protocols, including Internet Protocol (IP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="570"><H3>Sharing Windows&#160;98 Resources</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>You must have Client for Microsoft Networks installed in order to enable file and printer sharing. Client for Microsoft Networks is a 32-bit, protected-mode network client for Windows&#160;98 that provides network functionality for Microsoft operating systems,
<P>
<LI>To share resources after you have configured network connectivity, you must install file and printer sharing for Microsoft Networks.
<P>
<LI>To install and configure a network printer, you follow many of the same steps that are required to set up a local printer. The primary difference is that you identify a network path instead of a local port for the networked printer.
<P>
<LI>By default, the Browse Master in a Windows&#160;98 workgroup will be the first computer that has File and Print Sharing enabled to initialize in that workgroup. However, you can also configure a Windows&#160;98 computer manually as the Browse Master.

If you frequently visit Web sites, you can add them to your Favorites list. You can also subscribe to a Web page so that Internet Explorer automatically checks for updates.
<P>
You can choose to have Windows&#160;98 notify you of an update to a page or you can choose to download the page so you can read it offline. You can also control how often a subscription updates, and whether or not you will be notified through e-mail. In addition, you can schedule updates to occur automatically or manually.

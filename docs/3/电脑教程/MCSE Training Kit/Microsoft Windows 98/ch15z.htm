<A NAME="683"><H1>Summary</H1></A><P>
The following information summarizes the key points in this chapter:
<P>
<A NAME="684"><H3>Identifying a User Profile</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>User profiles contain configuration settings. These settings establish the user's environment when the user logs on so that each user can maintain a customized configuration.
<P>
<LI>Local user profiles exist only on the user's computer and control settings for that specific user and computer. Use local profiles when multiple users share a single computer.
<P>
<LI>Roaming user profiles are downloaded from a network server to any computer to which the user logs on. Use roaming profiles when individual users log on to different computers.
<P>
<LI>Mandatory profiles are roaming profiles that do not update when a user logs off a computer. To change a mandatory profile, you must change the User.man file on the server.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="685"><H3>Enabling User Profiles</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>User profiles can be enabled either with the Passwords icon or the Users icon in Control Panel.
<P>
<LI>Advantages to using the Users icon include the ability to create user profiles without logging on under each user's name, the number of options available through the Add User Wizard, and the ability to determine settings for each user name, rather than for all user profiles.
<P>
<LI>Use the Passwords icon in Control Panel to disable user profiles.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="686"><H3>Loading and Updating User Profiles</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>When a user logs on to a standalone computer, the local profile loads from the registry to the computer. When the user logs off, the profile is saved in the registry.
<P>
<LI>When a user logs on to a computer connected to a network, the roaming profile loads from the server to the computer. When the user logs off, the profile is saved to both the server and the local registry.
<P>
<LI>Each time a user logs on, Windows&#160;98 checks for a local user profile. If none exists, the user is prompted to create a new one. If the user opts not to create a new user profile, Windows&#160;98 uses the default profile.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="687"><H3>Configuring User Profiles on a Network</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>The location of profiles varies depending on the type of network you are using.
<P>
<LI>On Windows&#160;NT networks, the profiles are located in the home folder. On Novell NetWare networks, the profile is located in the SYS:\MAIL\<I>&lt;user_id&gt; </I>directory.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="688"><H3>Troubleshooting User Profiles</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>When troubleshooting user profiles, make certain that applications are using the registry rather than .INI files.
<P>
<LI>Components and applications point to by shortcuts in the user's profile need to be installed on each computer to which the user logs on.
<P>
<LI>User profiles must be configured for the correct operating system.
<P>
<LI>For users who log on to computers with different Primary Network Logon settings, profiles must be synchronized manually in order to be available across the enterprise.

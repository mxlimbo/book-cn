Problems with Dial-Up Networking typically originate with your modem or connection. For resolving problems with modems, you can use the modemlog.txt file, or run the Modem Diagnostics Program. For problems with your connection, you can use the Ppplog.txt file.
<P>
When troubleshooting PPTP connections, consider disabling PPTP filtering. When troubleshooting Multilink connections, make sure they are operating at the same speed as other connections in simultaneous use.

Here are some recommendations for using Windows&#160;98 with the Internet and intranets:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Use the RSAC ratings in Internet Explorer's Content Advisor to help control access to Internet content. Remember, however, that if the Web site containing the questionable content does not use the RSAC ratings, enabling Content Ratings will not prevent users from viewing the objectionable Web site.
<P>
<LI>Use the Content Advisor in Internet Explorer to restrict access to unrated sites. Remember, however, that this may keep users from accessing legitimate sites they need to do their work.
<P>
<LI>Use Personal Web Server for small intranets and as a staging server to test your Web pages. However, if you are hosting an FTP site or if security is an issue on your Web server, you need to upgrade to Internet Information Server.

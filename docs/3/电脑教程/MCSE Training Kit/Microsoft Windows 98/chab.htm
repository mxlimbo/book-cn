<A NAME="905"><H1>Choosing the Best Windows Platform from a Corporate Perspective</H1></A><P>
This appendix provides information to help you choose the best Windows platform for your organization.
<P>
<A NAME="906"><H1>Executive Summary</H1></A><P>
The goal of this appendix is to help business customers find the <I>best</I> combination of Microsoft Windows operating systems and hardware platforms&#151;today and for the future. To do this, we outline deployment guidelines for a variety of situations and then provide supporting information to describe how we arrived at these recommendations. Of course, every business situation is unique and systems should be thoroughly tested before deploying. Also, if you have a deployment plan in progress, we recommend staying the course.
<P>
Microsoft's most important recommendation is to move to 32-bit Windows-based applications. These applications offer greater reliability, faster performance, lower cost of ownership, better user productivity, and increased security than older 16-bit Windows-based applications. These applications are also poised to take full advantage of new hardware and operating system innovations.
<P>
For choosing the best Windows operating system, Microsoft's strategy is to provide customers with a full range of innovative and high quality products. Each operating system offers complementary features, price points, and system requirements. Software and hardware are also designed to be manageable, lowering the total cost of ownership. That said, Microsoft believes that when businesses have a choice, they are better suited over the long term moving to Windows&#160;NT Workstation 5.0. With increased reliability, security, and performance, we believe Microsoft Windows&#160;NT Workstation 5.0 will become the premier desktop operating system for business.
<P>
<A NAME="907"><H2>Windows 32-bit Operating Systems</H2></A><P>
Microsoft Windows&#160;95 is the easiest path to a 32-bit desktop operating system with the broadest hardware and application compatibility and lowest system requirements. Windows&#160;98&#151;an evolutionary upgrade to Windows&#160;95&#151;continues to be the easiest path to a 32-bit desktop and makes computing easier, more reliable, faster, and fully integrated with the Internet.
<P>
Microsoft Windows&#160;NT Workstation 4.0 is the most powerful 32-bit desktop operating system with a focus on reliability, manageability, security, networking, and performance. Windows&#160;NT Workstation 5.0&#151;a major upgrade to all versions of Windows&#151;will be the premier 32-bit desktop operating system for businesses.
<P>
<A NAME="908"><H2>Windows-based Hardware Platforms</H2></A><P>
Windows-based Terminals, expected to ship in 1998, are a new super-thin Windows family client device. They are compelling Windows-based replacements for &quot;dumb&quot; terminals. In addition, Windows&#160;NT &quot;Hydra&quot; software can be used to deliver 32-bit applications to legacy or remote desktops until hardware and applications can be upgraded to run on new Net PCs or PCs.
<P>
PCs are ideal for almost any computing situation&#151;from sub-notebook portables to advanced 3-D graphics workstations. They are extremely powerful, flexible, and expandable devices. Network PCs are a new type of simple, easy to manage Windows-based PC for the corporate environment. They are ideal for IT managers who want to deploy local processing, local storage, and familiar user environment but not the full flexibility of a traditional Windows-based PC.
<P>
For businesses purchasing new systems or upgrading Windows&#160;95 and Windows&#160;3.<I>x</I>-based systems, Microsoft makes the following deployment recommendations. Details for arriving at these recommendations are provided later in this appendix.

<P>
<IMG SRC="FBXX01.JPG" width=360 height=278 BORDER=0> 
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Are 32-bit Windows, 16-bit Windows and MS-DOS-based applications supported in Windows&#160;NT Workstation 4.0?</B> Although they share the Win32 API, security and performance optimizations require some architectural differences between Windows&#160;NT and Windows&#160;95. Windows&#160;95 and Windows&#160;98 offer the broadest support for running mixed application environments, including MS-DOS, 16-bit Windows and 32-bit Windows. Windows&#160;NT Workstation is optimized to run 32-bit Windows-based applications, but also supports many leading 16-bit Windows-based and MS-DOS-based productivity applications. A list of compatible 16-bit Windows and MS-DOS-based applications is available at   <A HREF="http://microsoft.com/windows/platform/info/16bit.htm" TARGET="_blank">http://microsoft.com/windows/platform/info/16bit.htm</A> For software compatibility questions, talk with the application developer or see Microsoft's listing of retail applications that have received the &quot;Designed for Windows&quot; logo certification, available from

<LI><B>Are all hardware components and peripherals supported in Windows&#160;NT Workstation 4.0?</B>  For security and other optimizations, Windows&#160;95 and Windows&#160;NT Workstation 4.0 support different device driver models.  In general, Windows&#160;95 was designed to support a broader range of devices and peripherals than Windows&#160;NT. To check hardware compatibility, Microsoft offers a comprehensive listing at  In Windows&#160;98 and Windows&#160;NT 5.0, shared Windows Driver Model and Advanced Configuration and Power Interface features eliminate many differences among drivers, power management, and Plug and Play capabilities.
<P>
<LI><B>Is data and network security a primary business requirement?</B>  Although many customers run Windows&#160;NT Workstation without having a strong security requirement, Microsoft recommends Windows&#160;NT Workstation 4.0 for maintaining highly secure environments.  For example, on Windows&#160;NT every user must be authenticated on a system before gaining access to information. With Windows&#160;NT you can also enable discretionary access to resources all the way to individual files.

<A NAME="916"><H1>Choosing the Best Hardware Platform</H1></A><P>
Windows-based hardware is available from hundreds of PC manufacturers in thousands of configurations, making it possible to find the right hardware at the best possible price point. In the next few months, most PCs will fall into three general categories:
<P>
<A NAME="917"><H3>Windows-based Terminals (WBT).</H3></A><P>
Windows-based Terminals are a new &quot;super-thin client&quot; device for the Windows family product line. Designed to work specifically with Windows&#160;NT Server &quot;Hydra,&quot; Windows-based Terminals provide a compelling Windows-based replacement for traditional &quot;dumb&quot; terminals. Windows-based Terminals help reduce TCO by creating a nearly 100% centrally managed environment.  In addition, Windows&#160;NT &quot;Hydra&quot; can be used by corporations to deliver 32-bit Windows applications to legacy or remote desktop devices until systems and applications can be upgraded to run on PCs or Net PCs.  While Windows&#160;NT &quot;Hydra&quot; provides a strong solution for upgrading legacy systems, it requires an appropriate investment in server and networking infrastructure to support these additional clients. Prices for new Windows-based Terminals will start at under $500. 
<P>
<A NAME="918"><H3>Net PCs</H3></A><P>
Net PCs are a new type of simple, easy-to-manage Windows-based PC for the corporate environment.  They are ideal for IT managers who want to deploy local processing, local storage, and a familiar user environment but not the full flexibility of a traditional Windows-based PC. With the availability of Windows&#160;NT Server 5.0, Net PCs include the necessary hardware components that allow Windows&#160;NT Workstation 5.0 to be automatically installed and configured over the network, including during off-hour periods.  You can add software applications and hardware components to Net PCs, but such installations need to be done by an authorized administrator or with permissions. Prices start at under $1,000.
<P>
<A NAME="919"><H3>PCs (including mobile PCs and PC workstations)</H3></A><P>
PCs are ideal for almost any computing situation&#151;from sub-notebook portables to advanced 3-D graphics workstations. PCs generally ship a full range of devices including CD-ROM, floppy drive, I/O ports, audio and video capabilities. PCs provide expandability and flexibility to meet virtually every business need. Using Microsoft's Zero Administration Initiative for Windows features, PCs can be managed centrally with the right configurations. Prices range from about $1,000 to $4,000.
<P>
<A NAME="920"><H1>Flexibility and Expandability</H1></A><P>
Once you have identified business needs, application software, supporting hardware requirements, and the operating system, choosing the best Windows-based hardware platform requires aligning two criteria: how much flexibility do administrators want for changing systems <I>and</I> how closely do administrators want to manage these systems. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="FBXX03.JPG" width=360 height=173 BORDER=0> 
<P>
How much flexibility<I> </I>and expandability do you need to deploy to users? The best way to segment users is to identify how much flexibility<I> </I>and<I> </I>expandability they need to successfully do their jobs. For example, someone who uses one or two applications rarely upgrades software and never upgrades hardware does not need a flexible and expandable environment. This is typical of &quot;task-oriented&quot; users. On the other hand, someone who needs to continually use different applications and upgrades hardware frequently needs more flexibility.   This is typical of &quot;knowledge-oriented&quot; users.
<P>
How closely can we manage systems while still enabling users to reach full productivity?<I> </I>In general, centralized management leads to lower total cost of ownership. However, in no environment should the desire to centrally manage systems be more important than giving users the right tools for their jobs.

Maintaining and troubleshooting a network environment can be difficult. In a stand-alone environment, you must update drivers for a single computer, and any problems you encounter are limited to that computer. In a networking environment, the task of updating drivers across the network increases your workload significantly. In addition, problems that occur can affect several computers or workgroups.
<P>
Several of the Windows&#160;98 tools that work in a stand-alone environment also offer assistance in a networking environment. Windows&#160;98 also provides a number of Web-based resources for troubleshooting and downloading drivers. In addition, the Windows&#160;98 Troubleshooters in the Help file include troubleshooting dialogs for networking problems.
<P>
Windows&#160;98 also includes two other utilities&#151;Registry Editor and System Monitor&#151;which offer assistance in troubleshooting remote computers.

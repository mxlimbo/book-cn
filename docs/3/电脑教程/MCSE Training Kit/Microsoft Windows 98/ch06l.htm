<A NAME="267"><H2>Configuring Virtual Memory</H2></A><P>
With virtual memory, Windows&#160;98 keeps some information in RAM while it <I>swaps</I>, or temporarily moves, other information to a virtual memory <I>swap file</I>, also called a <I>paging file.</I> When that information is required again, Windows&#160;98 reads it back into RAM and, if necessary, swaps other information to the swap file. The resulting benefit is that you can run more programs at one time than the computer's RAM would otherwise allow.
<P>
<A NAME="268"><H3>Setting Swap File Size</H3></A><P>
If you use the default swap file settings, Windows&#160;98 creates a temporary swap file on the boot partition. Windows&#160;98 creates a permanent swap file if you set a minimum file size. The total amount of virtual memory is the sum of your computer's RAM plus the unused disk space. If you set the maximum swap file size in the <B>Virtual Memory </B>dialog box (see Figure 6.4) to the amount of unused space currently on a drive, Windows&#160;98 increases the swap file beyond that size if more disk space becomes available. If you want to impose a fixed limit on the swap file size, the limit you choose must be less than the current maximum available space.

If you want to change virtual memory settings:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Double-click the <B>System</B> icon in Control Panel, click the <B>Performance</B> tab, and then click <B>Virtual Memory</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Select <B>Let me specify my own virtual memory settings</B>.

<A NAME="269"><H3>Optimizing Swap File Settings</H3></A><P>
Although the system defaults usually provide the best performance, you can adjust the swap file parameters. For example, on a computer with multiple hard disk drives, you may want to override the default location of the Windows&#160;98 swap file. Place the swap file on the drive with the best performance. If a user normally loads all software from the same drive in a computer that has multiple drives, performance may be improved by placing the swap file on the least used drive.
<P>
<A NAME="270"><H3>MapCache</H3></A><P>
MapCache is a feature in Windows&#160;98 that improves application performance through more efficient memory management.
<P>
Windows&#160;98 uses physical memory by dividing it into two parts: the disk cache, which is memory allocated for holding information read from the disk, and the virtual machine manager, which is memory allocated to run applications. Because of this structure, it is possible for Windows&#160;98 to keep two copies of some data in physical memory, which reduces the memory available to run applications.
<P>
MapCache is a performance feature that keeps a copy of many pages of memory in one place rather than in two places. This means that more memory is available to run applications.
<P>
MapCache only works with executable files (.exe, .dll, and so forth) that have been <I>aligned </I>on 4K boundaries. This means that the file on the hard disk is restructured into 4K sections. All binary files included with Windows&#160;98 are prealigned.

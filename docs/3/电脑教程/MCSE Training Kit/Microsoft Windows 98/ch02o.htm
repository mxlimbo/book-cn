<A NAME="100"><H2>Phase 5&#151;Setting Up Hardware and Finalizing Settings</H2></A><P>
In Windows&#160;98 Setup, hardware detection and hardware driver setup take place after the first restart. After hardware detection and driver setup, the Setup program finalizes system settings.
<P>

You will be asked for date, time zone, and printer information during this phase in order to allow Setup to configure your system. If you installed Windows&#160;98 from MS-DOS or into a new directory, Setup will detect both legacy and Plug and Play devices. This is different from what Setup does when you start it from Windows&#160;95, where only Plug and Play devices are detected.
<P>

When hardware setup is complete, Setup performs the following tasks:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Modifies registry and other system configuration files
<P>
<LI>Configures Control Panel
<P>
<LI>Configures <B>Start</B> menu
<P>
<LI>Initializes Windows Help
<P>
<LI>Configures MS-DOS programs
</UL>
<P>
When these steps are completed, Setup restarts your computer.

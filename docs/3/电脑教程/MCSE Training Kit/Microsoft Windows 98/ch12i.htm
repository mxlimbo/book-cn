Windows&#160;98 includes a diagnostic program for viewing your TCP/IP configuration (see Figure 12.7). This utility enables you to see not only your IP address but also your subnet mask and other information that could be critical to your setup.

If you want to view your TCP/IP configuration, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Click <B>Start</B>, then <B>Run</B> and type <B>winipcfg</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>OK </B>to display the<B> IP Configuration </B>dialog box.
<P>
<LI>	To view additional information about your TCP/IP configuration, click<B> More Info</B>.
</OL>
<P>
This diagnostic program displays current TCP/IP configuration values, including your IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway. Additional information is also available, including DHCP and WINS configuration. You can also release a DHCP-provided IP address, and renew a lease on an existing DHCP-provided address.

<P>
DHCP assigned IP addresses are dynamic; that is, the DHCP server assigns (leases) IP addresses from a finite pool of available addresses, for limited amounts of time. Releasing an IP address before the lease has expired makes the address available for assignment to other computers.

<A NAME="680"><H1>Lesson 5: Troubleshooting User Profiles</H1></A><P>
A number of issues can arise when using user profiles. Configuring certain applications can effect multiple users, differences between Windows&#160;98 and Windows&#160;NT profiles can cause conflicts, and shortcuts can become invalid. This lesson addresses these problems and provides solutions.

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Changes to application configuration affect all users rather than just a specific user.</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Applications that store their configuration in an .INI file rather than in the registry are not compatible with user profiles. Changes to the configuration for this type of program are computer-specific rather than user-specific.</TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP">Desktop shortcuts work on some computers, but not on others.</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Desktop shortcuts to local programs, as well as wallpaper and other user profile settings, require the installation of those components on the computer where the user logs on. If the components are not installed on the computer, the shortcut in the profile still appears on the desktop, but the program the shortcut refers to cannot run.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">User profiles that were created on a computer running Windows&#160;98 are not available on a computer running Windows&#160;NT Workstation.</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Although Windows&#160;NT Workstation and Windows&#160;98 both support roaming profiles, Windows&#160;NT profiles and Windows&#160;98 profiles have incompatible formats.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">In a mixed Windows&#160;NT/NetWare environment, user profiles do not download to all Windows&#160;98 clients.</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">The server type in the Primary Network Logon setting determines the type of network server searched for a user profile. If, for example, a user logs on at a client setup to log on to a Windows&#160;NT domain, the profile downloads from and saves to the authenticating domain controller. If the user then logs on to a client configured for a NetWare server, the profile downloads from and saves to the logon server. For users who log on to computers with different Primary Network Logon settings, profiles must be synchronized manually in order to be available across the enterprise.</TD>

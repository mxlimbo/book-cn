<A NAME="753"><H2>Overview of Internetworking and Intranetworking</H2></A><P>
In recent years, technology has advanced sufficiently to enable virtually all computers to be connected together in a worldwide network called the Internet. The Internet is a massive collection of public and proprietary computer networks using the TCP/IP protocol to connect millions of computers, people, software programs, databases, and files spread around the world and interacting continuously.
<P>
<A NAME="754"><H3>Identifying Network Access Points</H3></A><P>
The Internet is formed by regional commercial networks connected to each other by high-speed data lines such as T1 and T3. Each network site, called a Network Access Point (NAP), has agreed to provide services such as computers, data storage space, and communications equipment, as well as support of the Point&#150;to-Point (PPP) and Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) protocols.
<P>
NAPs are also referred to as regional NAPs. Each regional NAP is connected to two or more regional NAPs over a <I>backbone</I>, the high-speed communication links that connect Internet sites. The multiple connections allow one or more regional NAPs to drop out of service temporarily without affecting the rest of the Internet.
<P>
<A NAME="755"><H3>Identifying Internet Service Providers</H3></A><P>
With the advent of Internet protocols, modems, and Web browsers, anyone can gain access to the Internet. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are organizations that provide users with Internet access. ISPs can be anything from small, local operations to a large commercial online service. ISPs should have high-speed data connections to a regional NAP.
<P>
<A NAME="756"><H3>Connecting Users to the Internet</H3></A><P>
Most individual users and small businesses connect to the Internet using an ISP. After connecting, each user's computer (or host computer) has an IP address. Users can connect through the ISP in two different ways: point-to-point, which is a dedicated line or address into the Internet, or by dialing into the ISP over phone lines.
<P>
<A NAME="757"><H3>Defining the World Wide Web</H3></A><P>
The World Wide Web, also called the Web, consists of the total set of interlinked hypertext documents residing on Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) servers throughout the Internet. Documents on the Web, called pages or Web pages, are written in hypertext markup language (HTML).
<P>
<A NAME="758"><H3>An Intranet</H3></A><P>
An intranet is an internal corporate or organizational network that uses Internet technologies to let employees browse and share electronic information. An intranet is a private version of the Internet's World Wide Web, but it's available only to people inside the organization. An intranet is a popular and inexpensive way for organizations to share information internally.
<P>
An intranet site requires the same software and hardware as an Internet site, except for the connections to an ISP. An intranet that connects to the external Internet usually has a security system, such as a proxy server, that limits access to and from the external source.

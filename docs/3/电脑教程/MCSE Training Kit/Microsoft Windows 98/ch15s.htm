<A NAME="676"><H2>On a Windows&#160;NT Network</H2></A><P>
A Windows&#160;NT network stores user profiles in each user's home folder. During logon to a Windows&#160;NT domain, Windows&#160;98 connects to the home folder and begins the following comparison and download process:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>If both a server-based profile and local profile exist, a mandatory server-based profile loads to the computer. If the server-based profile is not mandatory, the most recent profile loads to the computer.
<P>
<LI>If only a server-based profile exists, it downloads from the server to the computer to create a local user profile.
<P>
<LI>If only a local-based profile exists, it loads to the computer and saves to the network server when the user logs off.
<P>
<LI>When the user logs off, the local profile replaces the server-based profile, unless the server-based profile is mandatory.

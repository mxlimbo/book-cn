Windows Update (see Figure 19.2) is a Web-based resource site for updating operating software and device drivers and for getting technical support answers. When you install Windows&#160;98, the installation program places a shortcut to the Windows Update page at <A HREF="http://update.microsoft.com" TARGET="_blank">http://update.microsoft.com</A> on the <B>Start </B>and <B>Settings</B> menus.

<P>

Windows Update is implemented through the use of ActiveX controls, which are installed the first time you connect to the Windows Update page. This page appears only if you have a browser that supports ActiveX controls.
<P>
The Update resource works by:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Reviewing the device drivers and system software on your computer.
<P>
<LI>Comparing that information to a master database.
<P>
<LI>Recommending and installing updates specific to your computer.
</UL>
<P>
The Windows Update site provides a link to Technical Support, also called Support Online (see Figure 19.3). Here you can search through technical support articles for a particular topic or search through a glossary of terms. Windows Update Technical Support is also available through Windows online help by opening <B>Help</B> and clicking the <B>Web</B> <B>Help</B> button.

<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Click <B>Start</B>, then <B>Help</B>, and then click the <B>Web Help</B> button.

The system administrator may want to restrict access to Windows Update in order to maintain control of the drivers and system files installed on users' computers. Windows&#160;98 system policies include the option to either disable the Windows Update shortcut or reroute the shortcut to an alternative URL.

You can also update device drivers from a floppy disk using Device Manager, which is located in the System icon in Control Panel. In addition, The Update Device Driver Wizard in Device Manager can search Windows Update.

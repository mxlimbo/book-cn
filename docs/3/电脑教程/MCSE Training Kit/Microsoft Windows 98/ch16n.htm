In general, when troubleshooting system policy problems, you should verify the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The related registry key is correct in the policy template (.adm) file.
<P>
<LI>The related policy is set properly in the policy (.pol) file.
<P>
<LI>The related application actually uses the registry key being changed.
<P>
<LI>The policy file is located in the correct network location, and the network location is accessible from the computer running Windows&#160;98.
<P>
<LI>For group policies, the user name, group name, and computer name are correct, and the user is a member of the specified group.
</UL>
<P>
The following table presents some common troubleshooting scenarios:

<TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>Cause/Solution</B></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">You cannot create or edit system policy for groups.</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Group policy support is not available by default for computers running Windows&#160;98. Add Group Policy through the Add/Remove Programs icon in Control Panel.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Group policies are not processed by all client computers.</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Group policy support (Grouppol.dll) must be installed on a computer running Windows&#160;98 not only to create group policies, but also to process them. Group policy support is not installed by default with System Policy Editor. Add group policy support through the Add/Remove Programs icon of Control Panel.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">User policies are downloaded for Windows&#160;98 users, or for Windows&#160;NT users, but not for both.</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Although computers running Windows&#160;98 and Windows NT both support system policy files created with System Policy Editor, the policy files are not named the same and are not interoperable. If a user uses a computer running Windows&#160;98 and a computer running Windows&#160;NT, create a user policy in both system policy files (Config.pol and Ntconfig.pol).</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">User policies restrict access to Control Panel options, but the icons still appear in Control Panel.</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">System policies can restrict access to Control Panel options, but they cannot remove the icons. In order to remove the icons from Control Panel, modify the <B>[don't load]</B> section of Control.ini.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">The wallpaper assigned in the system policy file does not appear on all client computers.</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Some system policy settings require components to be installed locally on the computer where the policy is applied. If, in this example, the wallpaper bitmap is not present on a computer, the policy setting for wallpaper cannot be applied.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Downloading system policies is very slow.</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Although there is no limit to the number of individual users, groups, or computers that can be added to a policy file, delays may occur if too many users log on at the same time. Enable load balancing to better balance network resources.</TD>

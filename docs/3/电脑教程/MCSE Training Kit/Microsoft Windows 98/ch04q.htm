<A NAME="202"><H2>Troubleshooting USB Devices</H2></A><P>
Because of the nature of USB devices, resource settings cannot interfere and cause a USB device to function improperly or fail. The following steps should resolve most problems involving a USB device:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Check the host controller <I>firmware</I> revision by viewing the host controller's properties in Device Manager. (Firmware refers to software routines stored in read-only memory). The General tab lists the hardware version of the host controller. A version number of 000 indicates that the controller is using the A-1 stepping chip, which is not supported. Contact the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for an upgraded host controller.
<P>
<LI>If only one device is failing, try the device in another USB port. If the device works, the original port may have failed. If the device does not work in the new port, consider replacing the device.
<P>
<LI>Plug the device directly into the host controller, bypassing any hubs. If the device is bus powered, it may draw too much power to function when plugged into a hub.
<P>
<LI>If the configuration includes cascading hubs (one hub plugged into another hub), make sure that USB supports the configuration according to the following guidelines:
<P>
<UL><LI>A bus-powered hub cannot be plugged into another bus-powered hub.
<P>
<LI>Bus-powered hubs can support no more than four downstream ports.
<P>
<LI>Bus-powered hubs cannot support any bus-powered device that draws more than 100 milliamps.
<P>
<LI>Hub cascade depth cannot exceed five tiers.
</UL>
<P>
<LI>Remove the USB host controller from Device Manager and restart your computer. This allows the entire bus to be redetected and reinstalled.

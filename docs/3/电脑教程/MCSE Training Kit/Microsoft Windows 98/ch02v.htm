The steps that occur during the Setting up hardware phase depend on whether you are installing in the same folder as Windows&#160;95, or to a different folder or newly formatted hard disk.

When you install Windows&#160;98 into a new directory or newly formatted hard disk, Setup performs full detection of both Plug and Play and legacy devices after the first restart.
<P>
If you install Windows&#160;98 in the same folder as Windows&#160;95, Setup enumerates Plug and Play devices. Setup then initiates registry verification for legacy devices. If a legacy device cannot be verified, Setup launches full hardware detection.

<A NAME="117"><H3>Finalizing Settings</H3></A><P>
If you installed Windows&#160;98 on a newly formatted hard disk or to a new directory, you are prompted to choose your time zone. Then Setup completes finalizing your System Settings. When these steps are completed, Windows&#160;98 restarts your computer.

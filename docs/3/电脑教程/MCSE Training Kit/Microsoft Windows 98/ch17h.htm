<A NAME="763"><H2>Connecting to Internet Resources</H2></A><P>
To connect to a site on the Internet, you must know its address. Every resource on the Internet has its own unique location identifier, or Uniform Resource Locator (URL) (see Figure 17.2). A URL is an Internet <I>address</I>. This address helps users identify the source of any information on the Internet. When you know the URL, you can use it for immediate access to that resource without browsing through directories or using keyword searches.

<P>
URLs follow a specific syntax that includes how users can gain access to the site, the name of the computer that contains the site, and locators that provide more specific information about the site.
<P>
The first part of the URL indicates the access method or protocol used by that server. For example, all Web sites must have a URL that begins with HTTP. HTTP is specified because that is the protocol for accessing the Web.
<P>
The second part of the URL is the computer's fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, <I>http://www.microsoft.com</I> is the locator for the Microsoft World Wide Web (WWW) site. The <I>www</I> indicates the host name of the computer that is providing the service (www is typically used as a host name for computers that are acting as Web servers), <I>Microsoft</I> is the subdomain name, and <I>.com</I> indicates that this is in the Internet's U.S. commercial domain.
<P>
Other locators may follow the host name. These names identify a more specific resource within the site. For example, <I>http://www.microsoft.com/default.asp</I> identifies a specific page within the Microsoft site.

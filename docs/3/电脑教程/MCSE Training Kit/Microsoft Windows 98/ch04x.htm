<A NAME="211"><H2>Overview of Multiple Display Support</H2></A><P>
Multiple display in Windows&#160;98 supports several graphics adapters running as many as nine monitors at the same time. Figure 4.5 illustrates some of the practical applications for multiple display support.

<P>
Potential uses for multiple display support include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Business
<P>
You can view e-mail on one monitor and reports and customer information on another monitor.
<P>
<LI>Desktop publishing
<P>
You can work with text on one monitor and illustrations on another monitor.
<P>
<LI>Presentation graphics
<P>
You can project one version of the graphic for clients and privately view another version with presentation notes.
<P>
<LI>Games
<P>
Multiple display support allows several views and status information simultaneously on separate monitors.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="212"><H3>The Multiple Display Support Desktop</H3></A><P>
Multiple display support modifies the desktop so that it can span several monitors regardless of their size or position. You can set the resolution and color depth for each display separately. To achieve this, Windows&#160;98 developers added application-programming interfaces (APIs) to the Microsoft Win32 API set to allow any application to take advantage of multiple display support functionality. Most applications do not need to be modified to run in a Windows&#160;98 multiple display support environment.
<P>
Multiple display uses the concept of primary and secondary displays. All applications running in a window may be on any display. In addition, the taskbar and desktop icons may be moved to any display. However, full screen MS-DOS applications will only run on the primary display.

<A NAME="81"><H2>Preventing Software Conflicts During Setup</H2></A><P>
Before you install Windows&#160;98, you must disable software that may cause problems during Setup. Software that may disrupt Setup includes anti-virus software and memory managers.
<P>
<A NAME="82"><H3>Disabling Anti-Virus Software</H3></A><P>
Windows&#160;98 Setup makes changes to the boot sector of all hard disks in the computer. Because virus protection software is designed to prevent changes to the boot sector, it often can cause Setup to fail. Therefore, be sure that automatic anti-virus protection software and BIOS-level anti-virus protection are disabled.
<P>
<A NAME="83"><H3>Disabling Memory Managers</H3></A><P>
When you install Windows&#160;98 from MS-DOS or Windows 3.1<I>x</I>, you should remove these memory managers from your Config.sys file:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>EMM386 (only if using highscan option)
<P>
<LI>QEMM
<P>
<LI>386MAX
</UL>

<P>
If Setup detects conflicting software, it provides instructions for correcting the problem. If Setup presents an error message that states that Setup has failed, restart your computer and Setup will resume automatically.

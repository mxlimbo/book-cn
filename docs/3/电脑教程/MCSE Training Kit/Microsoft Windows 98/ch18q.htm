<A NAME="822"><H2>Configuring Scripting for Modem Connections</H2></A><P>
A script is a text file consisting of commands. Windows&#160;98 supports the use of scripts to configure modem connections except for ISDN or Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) connections. If your ISP requires you to log in manually, you can write a login script to automate the process.
<P>
Windows&#160;98 provides four sample scripts you can use as starting points. You can find sample scripts in the C:\Program Files\Accessories folder.
<P>
Windows&#160;98 also provides a file explaining how to write and modify login scripts. This file is named Script.doc and is in your C:\Windows folder.
<P>
Some ISPs also provide scripts you can use to log in to their computers. Contact your ISP for more information.

Microsoft does not support login scripts you create. Also, Microsoft does not support modifications to the four sample scripts.

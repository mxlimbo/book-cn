The three most common methods of installing Windows&#160;98 on networked computers are CD-ROM installation, push installation, and pull installation. You should install from CD-ROM if you are installing Windows&#160;98 on fewer than five computers, or if a computer's configuration varies considerably from the standard Setup in a department.
<P>
Perform a push installation if you are installing Windows&#160;98 on more than five computers. A push installation sends an automated setup of Windows&#160;98 from a network server to the client workstation. The network administrator initiates the push installation, which is forced on the target computers.
<P>
Another alternative when installing Windows&#160;98 on more than five computers is to perform a pull installation. In a pull installation, Windows source files reside on a server, and users can download them and perform installation at their convenience. You can also use a batch file to automate the pull installation from the server. Multiple users can perform pull installations at the same time. Whether you select push or pull installations depends on the degree of control you want over the installation process.

<A NAME="834"><H1>Summary</H1></A><P>
The following information summarizes the key points in this chapter:
<P>
<A NAME="835"><H3>Setting Up Dial-Up Networking</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>Dial-Up Networking can establish connections to a remote server, a useful feature for employees who require remote access to the network and for those who require Internet access on demand in a company not connected to the Internet.
<P>
<LI>If a modem is being used to set up Dial-Up Networking, it must be installed and configured using Control Panel. You must then configure the dial-up adapter.
<P>
<LI>To have access to ISDN service, you must install an ISDN adapter and run the ISDN Configuration Wizard, which prompts you for the Switch protocol, telephone numbers, and service profile identification (SPID) numbers. ISDN drivers from the ISDN 1.0 Accelerator Pack are not supported in Windows&#160;98.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="836"><H3>Configuring Dial-Up Networking Clients</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>Protocols are chosen based on the type of remote server to which you are connecting. The default is Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP).
<P>
<LI>Multilink Point-to-Point Protocol (MPPP) increases data transmission rates. Multilink can be configured through the Dial-Up-Networking connection properties.
<P>
<LI>A Virtual Private Network (VPN) connects a client computer to a server through an intermediary network to provide a secure connection.
<P>
<LI>Dial-Up Server provides single caller access to a Windows&#160;98 computer through Dial-Up Networking.
<P>
<LI>A Direct Cable Connection can be used to establish a direct serial, parallel or infrared connection between two Windows&#160;98 computers. If a host computer is connected to a network, the guest computer can also have access to that network.

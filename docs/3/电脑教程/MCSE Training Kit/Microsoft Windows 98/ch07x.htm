<A NAME="336"><H2>Adding a Web Site to the Active Desktop</H2></A><P>
If the Active Desktop item you add is a URL that points to a Web site, you can <I>subscribe</I> to the Web site. When you subscribe to a site, Explorer checks that site for updates. You can choose to be notified of new content or to have updated content downloaded to your computer automatically. On your desktop, an Active Desktop item appears, and Explorer adds a link to the site in your Subscriptions folder. By default, a small red mark, or <I>gleam</I>, appears with the icon in your subscriptions folder to notify you of changes to a Web site.

Here are some recommendations for implementing Windows&#160;98 system policies:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>If you do not need to assign specific policy settings to each computer, use the Default Computer system policy rather than using individual system policies for each computer. You will need to duplicate the desired Default Computer policy settings in any specific computer policies you create.
<P>
<LI>When you assign specific policy settings to users, use a single group policy for all users who share common system policy settings. This way, you will not need to configure individual policy settings for each user. Ensure that group policy support is enabled on all computers.
<P>
<LI>Because Windows&#160;98 looks for Config.pol in the default location (unless configured otherwise), you can enable user profiles on the computer without having to log on to the computer to make the change. Check the Enable User Profiles setting in the System category of the policy for that computer. The system policy enables user profiles the next time a user logs on to the computer.
<P>
<LI>Enable load balancing to decrease system policy download time.

<A NAME="119"><H1>Lesson 4: Automating Setup</H1></A><P>
You can automate Setup by using a <I>setup script</I>. A setup script is a text file that contains predefined settings for all of the options specified during Setup, and can contain instructions for installing additional software.
<P>
With a setup script, you create an automated installation template for installing Windows&#160;98 on multiple computers. It is recommended that you use a setup script if you need to conduct a standardized installation more than five times. Using a setup script allows you to perform unattended installations on multiple computers, thus reducing the cost of upgrading to Windows&#160;98.
<P>
This lesson discusses the structure of setup scripts, and how to edit scripts and generate new ones.

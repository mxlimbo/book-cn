You can use the <B>Drive Converter</B> (Cvt1.exe) that is included with Windows&#160;98 to convert an existing FAT16 partition to FAT32 (see Figure 3.5). This is a Windows-based program on the <B>System Tools</B> menu.

<B>Caution</B>
<P>
The <B>Drive Converter</B> changes the file allocation tables of any hard disk that is converted. Because virus protection software may attempt to prevent those changes, and therefore corrupt the file allocation tables, you should disable any virus protection software before you convert a hard disk to FAT32.

The <B>Drive Converter</B> does the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Launches the Drive Converter Wizard.
<P>
<LI>Lists the partitions in your computer. Partitions that are large enough to convert to FAT32 are listed with their current file system. Partitions that are too small to convert are labeled with a <I>Drive too small</I> notation. You can only convert one partition at a time.
<P>
<LI>Warns you that you will not be able to access the partition from previous versions of MS-DOS, Windows, or Windows&#160;NT.
<P>
<LI>Scans your system for applications that may be incompatible with FAT32.
<P>
The list of programs that the <B>Drive Converter</B> will search for 
is kept in the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\
CurrentControlSet\Control\SessionManager\CheckBadApps400
<P>
Only the applications whose Flags' <I>X</I> value is set to F are considered incompatible. If the Drive Converter Wizard finds any of these programs, they appear in a list. You can select an application from the list and click <B>More Info</B> to open a Help file that details the incompatibility and provides suggestions, such as contacting the vendor for an updated version.
<P>
<LI>Prompts you to back up your files.
<P>
<LI>Restarts the computer in MS-DOS mode to perform the actual conversion.

<B>Note</B>
<P>
Windows&#160;98 does not include a utility for converting a partition back to FAT16 after you convert it to FAT32.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
When the Drive Converter Wizard is done, the Disk Defragmenter utility runs. It is important that you let Disk Defragmenter run to completion after converting to FAT32. If you do not defragment the partition after you convert it to FAT32, it will result in a less efficient and slower computer than before the conversion.

<B>Caution</B>
<P>
Various BIOS manufacturers include virus checkers, which look for changes to the Master Boot Record (MBR). In addition, older anti-virus utilities may detect that the MBR has changed. Because a conversion to FAT32 changes the MBR, some virus checkers may incorrectly detect the changes to the MBR as a software virus on your system. If a virus checking utility detects an MBR change after you convert a partition to FAT32 and offers to &quot;fix&quot; it, decline this option.
<P>
The easiest solution is to uninstall virus-checking software before converting to FAT32, and then reinstall it after the conversion.

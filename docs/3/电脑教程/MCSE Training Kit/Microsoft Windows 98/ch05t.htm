<A NAME="243"><H1>Summary</H1></A><P>
The following information summarizes the key points in this chapter:
<P>
<A NAME="244"><H3>The Windows&#160;98 System Architecture Overview</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>The core components of Windows&#160;98 are the User component, Kernel component, the graphical design interface (GDI), and the user interface.
<P>
<LI>Key features of Windows&#160;98 architecture include preemptive multitasking and multithreading support, a protected-mode file system that eliminates reliance upon MS-DOS once Windows&#160;98 starts, and dynamic hardware and environment configuration.
<P>
<LI>For 16-bit applications, Windows&#160;98 uses cooperative multitasking. For 32-bit applications, Window&#160;98 uses preemptive  multitasking, in which the operating system has complete control over running applications.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="245"><H3>Windows&#160;98 Memory Management</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>Using its virtual memory functions, Windows&#160;98 can allocate more memory than the computer actually physically contains. Windows&#160;98 accomplishes this task by swapping memory between RAM and the hard disk when the amount of free RAM becomes low.
<P>
<LI>Each process is allocated a unique virtual address space that is divided into pages. Code and data are moved in pages between physical memory and the swap file on the hard disk.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="246"><H3>Virtual Machines</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>Win32- and Win16-based applications run within the System Virtual Machine. Win32-based applications each run in a separate virtual machine within the System Virtual Machine, while all Win16-based applications run together in a shared virtual machine within the System Virtual Machine.

A computer running Windows&#160;98 can connect to any computer running Windows&#160;NT and use that computer's file and print resources. To connect to a computer running Windows&#160;NT in a domain, you must log on to the domain with a valid domain user account and password, and your account must have access rights to the computer running Windows&#160;NT. To connect to a computer running Windows&#160;NT in a workgroup, you must enter a valid user name and password for the remote computer when you log on to your local Windows&#160;98 computer.
<P>
To print from a computer running Windows&#160;98 to a print server running Windows&#160;NT, the server must have Windows&#160;98-compatible print drivers. You can administer a remote Windows&#160;NT printer the same way you administer a remote Windows&#160;98 printer.
<P>
When you employ user-level access control on a Windows&#160;NT network, you must choose a security provider, which is a Windows&#160;NT domain server or a Windows&#160;NT workgroup computer that maintains the list of users and groups to which you assign resource permissions.
<P>
When you use user-level security to protect shared resources, you assign permissions to users and global groups by editing the Access Control List.

<A NAME="439"><H1>Lesson 2: Controlling and Troubleshooting the Boot Process</H1></A><P>
It is important to be able to troubleshoot the start, or <I>boot</I>, process of your computer. If you are aware of what steps occur (and in what order) during the process, you will be better able to troubleshoot. For example, knowing that a portion of the process occurs before Windows&#160;98 loads may make it easier to determine that a particular problem is hardware-related rather than software-related.
<P>
Various methods of starting Windows&#160;98 provide an opportunity for you to view and control the boot process as it occurs, and to identify the commands or drivers that cause a problem with startup.
<P>
This chapter provides an overview of the boot process and also discusses several methods of troubleshooting the process.

<A NAME="693"><H2>What Are System Policies?</H2></A><P>
System policies are collections of registry settings that overwrite current user and local machine areas of the registry.
<P>
System policies are defined in a policy file (*.pol), usually named Config.pol. Windows&#160;98 applies the applicable registry settings from the file to the computer's registry.
<P>

<B>Important</B>
<P>
The system policy must be named Config.pol if it is used in the default location for a net logon download.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<P>
A policy file may contain entries for the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Default user settings
<P>
<LI>Default computer settings
<P>
<LI>Settings for specific users
<P>
<LI>Settings for defined groups
<P>
<LI>Settings for specific computers
</UL>
<P>
With system policies, you can do the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Restrict what users can do from the desktop.
<P>
<LI>Restrict access to Control Panel options.
<P>
<LI>Customize parts of the desktop.
<P>
<LI>Configure network settings.
</UL>
<P>
For example, you can preset a user's environment so that the MS-DOS prompt or unapproved applications are not available.
<P>
You <I>must </I>use the Windows&#160;98 System Policy Editor to create and modify system policies for computers running Windows&#160;98.

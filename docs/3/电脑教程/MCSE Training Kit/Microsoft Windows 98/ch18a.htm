This chapter discusses four features supported by Windows&#160;98: Dial-Up Networking (DUN), Virtual Private Networking (VPN), Dial-Up Server, and Direct Cable Connection (DCC). These features make it possible for users not directly connected to a network to work as if they were.
<P>
With Dial-Up Networking, a user can connect to remote networks, such as the Internet, over a telephone or Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) line. With Virtual Private Networking, a user can use a secure connection over an intermediary network to connect to a server on a remote network. Windows&#160;98 Dial-Up Server allows a remote user to use a Windows&#160;98 computer as a single-connection dial-up server. From a remote site, a user can connect to the server and access resources on the server. With Direct Cable Connection (DCC), a user can connect a computer running Windows&#160;98 to another computer by parallel or serial cable, and share files.

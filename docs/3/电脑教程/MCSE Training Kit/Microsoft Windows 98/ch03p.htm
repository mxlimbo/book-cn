<A NAME="148"><H2>How Windows&#160;98 Generates Long File Names</H2></A><P>
Windows&#160;98 implements long file names on FAT partitions by concatenating a series of MS-DOS-compatible directory entries into a single file name entry.
<P>
To mask these directory entries from MS-DOS, Windows&#160;98 assigns the following attributes to the entries:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Read-only
<P>
<LI>System
<P>
<LI>Hidden
<P>
<LI>Volume Label
</UL>
<P>
Because MS-DOS does not recognize this combination of attributes, it ignores these directory entries.
<P>
Windows&#160;98 supports a maximum of 255 characters in a long file name, but the entire path to the file may not exceed 260 characters.
<P>
If you open and save a file with a long file name in a program that does not support long file names, Windows&#160;98 preserves the long file name as long as you do not rename or move the file.
<P>
Windows&#160;98 preserves long file names on a network with a process called <I>tunneling</I>. Tunneling preserves long file names for files that you open and save with an application that does not recognize long file names, on both the local computer and on the network. In order to perform network tunneling, the network operating system running on the server must support long file names.

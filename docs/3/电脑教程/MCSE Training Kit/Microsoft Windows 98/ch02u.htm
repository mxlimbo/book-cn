<A NAME="110"><H2>Collecting Information About Your Computer</H2></A><P>
After the Setup Wizard loads and you accept the Licensing Agreement, you use the Choose Directory window (see Figure 2.7) to determine where Windows&#160;98 will be installed.

<P>
<A NAME="111"><H3>Choose the Install Directory</H3></A><P>
The Choose Directory window displays the following options:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Existing Windows directory, for example, C:\Windows. Selecting this option upgrades the existing version of Windows&#160;95 or Windows 3.1<I>x</I>.
<P>
<LI>If <B>Other</B> is selected, you must supply the name of the directory, and then perform a new installation of Windows&#160;98.
</UL>
<P>
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Note</B>
<P>
If you set up Windows&#160;98 on a newly formatted hard disk, the C:\<I>Existing Windows directory</I> is replaced with C:\Windows, the default directory name.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<P>
After you select the install directory, the <B>Checking Your System</B> window appears. Setup checks the hard disk for errors and initializes the system's registry database.
<P>
The <B>Preparing Directory</B> window then appears, and Setup creates the Windows&#160;98 folder structure, including all required folders under the root folder (for example, C:\Windows and C:\Program Files folder).
<P>
Setup then checks for installed components and determines if there is adequate disk space for the files.
<P>
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Note</B>
<P>
If there is not enough disk space, the Setup Wizard prompts you to create more free hard disk space and then restart Setup.

<A NAME="112"><H3>Selecting Setup Options During MS-DOS Setup</H3></A><P>
The Setup Options window (see Figure 2.8) lists four types of Setup. Each Setup type contains a specific set of components to install.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Typical installation is recommended for most computers.
<P>
<LI>Portable installation includes options useful for portable computers, such as laptops.
<P>
<LI>Compact installation does not install optional components, thus saving disk space.
<P>
<LI>Custom installation allows you to customize your installation options, and is recommended for advanced users and system administrators only.

<P>
<A NAME="113"><H3>Supplying User and Computer Information</H3></A><P>
If you are installing to a new folder or hard disk, a User Information  window prompts you to supply your user name and company name. Windows&#160;98 uses this information for various operations, and you must enter this information for Setup to continue. With a Custom installation, a dialog box prompts you to select the components you want to install. Next, a Computer Information window (see Figure 2.9) prompts you to enter the computer name, workgroup name, and computer description.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The computer name must be unique on the network, and can be up to 15 characters long with no spaces. The name can contain only alphanumeric characters and the following special characters: ! @ # $ % ^ &amp; ( ) - _ { } . ~
<P>
<LI>The workgroup name can be up to 15 characters long and uses the same naming convension as the computer name. The workgroup is used to associate groups of computers together for more efficient browsing.
<P>
<LI>The computer description can be up to 58 characters long, but it cannot contain any commas. This text appears as a comment next to the computer name when users are browsing the network, so you can use it to describe the department or location of the computer.

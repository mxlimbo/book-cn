The Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a low- to mid-speed bus that you can use for a variety of peripherals, including mouse devices, keyboards, joysticks, scanners, audio devices, and digital cameras.
<P>
USB uses a tiered topology that allows up to 127 devices to be attached to the bus simultaneously.
<P>
Because USB is fully Plug and Play compatible, you can add USB peripheral devices without having to restart the computer. Also, because USB is an external bus, users do not have to open the computer to add a device to the bus.
<P>

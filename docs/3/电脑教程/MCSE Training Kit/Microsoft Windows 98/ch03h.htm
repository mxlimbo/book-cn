Partitioning is the process of dividing the mass storage of a hard disk into isolated sections. At a minimum, a hard disk must contain one partition. When you create more than one partition on a hard disk, each partition is treated as a separate disk drive. 
<P>
A primary partition is a portion of a hard disk that you can set as the active partition, which the operating system uses to start the computer. An extended partition can contain multiple subpartitions, each treated as a logical drive. You create and delete partitions using Fdisk.exe, and you format partitions through Windows&#160;Explorer.

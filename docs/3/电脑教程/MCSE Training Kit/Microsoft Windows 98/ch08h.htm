<A NAME="348"><H2>Bi-directional Communication</H2></A><P>
With bi-directional parallel communication, the printer driver can query the printer automatically and configure it for a specific print task based on the printer's capabilities and limitations. Printers can also send status messages, such as when paper jams occur or when the printer is low on toner, to Windows&#160;98 and to applications.
<P>
To use bi-directional printing, you must have the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A bi-directional printer.
<P>
<LI>An IEEE 1284-compliant cable.
<P>
<LI>A bi-directional parallel port set to bi-directional or PS/2 mode.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="349"><H3>Extended Capabilities Port Support</H3></A><P>
Windows&#160;98 includes support for Extended Capabilities Ports (ECP) and ECP devices, which provide high-speed printing. If you have an ECP port or device, you can connect either ECP or non-ECP devices to the port. In either case, using an ECP will improve I/O (input/output) performance, which can improve printer performance. Windows&#160;98 configures ports according to their configuration in the BIOS. To ensure that your port is enabled for ECP, see the procedure that follows.

Windows&#160;98 includes Windows Report Tool (Winrep.exe), a utility used to compile and transmit information about your computer via the Internet to Microsoft support engineers.
<P>
Windows Report can be started from the Tools menu of the System Information utility. You use the Windows Report Tool, when directed by Microsoft support engineers, to record information about the problem, what you would normally expect to happen, and the steps to reproduce the problem.
<P>
The Windows Report Tool creates a Microsoft System Information (.nfo) file with your current system information, and collects other system files, including log and configuration files. These files are compressed into a .cab file that is saved in C:\Windows\helpdesk\winrep. The Windows Report Tool then sends the *.cab file, which includes your description of the problem, to Microsoft through your normal Internet connection.
<P>
If you cannot start Windows&#160;98, you can use an MS-DOS-based tool, Dosrep.exe, to collect system files and compress them into a .cab file. If you can connect to the Internet from DOS, you can submit this .cab file directly to Microsoft Technical Support. If you cannot connect to the Internet, you can save the .cab on a floppy disk and send it from a PC that is connected to the Internet.

After you install Windows&#160;98, you can convert any existing FAT16 partitions of 512&#160;MB or larger to FAT32. Before converting the file system, you should consider the following capabilities and limitations of each file system (see Figure 3.3).

<P>
FAT16 is a fast and broadly supported disk format, and supports single partitions up to 2&#160;GB. FAT32 is an enhanced version of the FAT16 file system. The major benefits of FAT32 are its support for the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Partitions up to 2 terabytes in size.
<P>
<LI>Smaller-sized clusters than FAT16 on large-capacity hard disks, resulting in more efficient use of space, sometimes by as much as 20 to 30 percent.
</UL>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Note</B>
<P>
The increase in storage efficiency depends on the size of the files on the partition. A partition that contains a large number of small files will achieve a larger increase in efficiency than a partition with a few large files.

<A NAME="138"><H3>File System Considerations</H3></A><P>
When making the decision to convert to FAT32, consider the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Do not use FAT32 on any partition that other operating systems will use, except Windows&#160;95 OSR2.
<P>
<LI>MS-DOS, Windows 3.<I>x</I>, the original release of Windows&#160;95, and Windows&#160;NT clients can read FAT32 partitions shared across a network.
<P>
<LI>If you dual boot between Windows&#160;98 and another operating system, such as Windows&#160;NT 4.<I>x</I>, the drive C partition cannot be FAT32.
<P>
<LI>You cannot compress FAT32 partitions.
<P>
<LI>Windows&#160;98 MS-DOS-mode fully supports FAT32, so you can run most MS-DOS-mode games and applications from FAT32 partitions.
<P>
<LI>Some older applications written to FAT16 specifications may not display disk space larger than 2&#160;GB. However, Windows&#160;98 provides new MS-DOS and Win32 application programming interfaces (APIs) that some applications can use to display disk space larger than 2&#160;GB.
<P>
<LI>Do not use disk utilities that do not support FAT32 after you convert a hard disk. Use of those utilities can result in data loss and may corrupt the file system on the hard disk.
</UL>
<P>
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Note</B>
<P>
The Windows&#160;98 versions of ScanDisk, Backup, and Disk Defragmenter support FAT32 drives.
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="139"><H3>Windows&#160;NT FAT Partitions</H3></A><P>
You can create FAT16 partitions as large as 4&#160;GB with Windows&#160;NT; however, Windows&#160;98 only supports FAT16 partitions as large as 2&#160;GB. If you set up a FAT16 partition that is larger than 2&#160;GB and attempt to install Windows&#160;98, the setup aborts during the Scandisk phase. If you try to skip the Scandisk phase of setup, Windows&#160;98 fails during startup.

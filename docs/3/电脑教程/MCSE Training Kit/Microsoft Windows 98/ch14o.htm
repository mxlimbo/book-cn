<A NAME="632"><H2>Mapping Network Drives</H2></A><P>
Although you do not need to map a drive in order to use resources on a NetWare server, you can use Windows Explorer to map a drive to a NetWare volume or to a directory within a volume.
<P>
If you map a drive to a NetWare volume, you must choose a drive letter to map, and must specify whether Windows&#160;98 should remap the drive each time you log on.
<P>
If you want to map a drive to a NetWare volume, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Open <B>Network Neighborhood</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Double-click on a NetWare server.
<P>
A window opens displaying the available volumes.
<P>
<LI>	Right-click one of the available volumes.
<P>
A menu appears displaying the available commands.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>Map Network Drive</B>.
<P>
The <B>Map Network Drive</B> dialog box appears.
<P>
<LI>	Select an available drive letter, and then click <B>OK</B>.
</OL>
<P>
If you map a drive to a NetWare directory while exploring or browsing the server, you must configure the same options as for mapping to a volume. You must choose a drive letter and determine whether or not to have Windows&#160;98 remap the drive when you log on again. You must also specify whether the drive letter should be mapped to the selected directory rather than to the directory's parent volume. This is equivalent to the NetWare <B>map root</B> command.
<P>
If you want to map a drive to a NetWare directory, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Open <B>Network Neighborhood</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Double-click on a NetWare server.
<P>
<LI>	Double-click one of the available volumes.
<P>
<LI>	Right-click one of the available shared folders.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>Map Network Drive</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Select an available drive letter and then click <B>OK</B>.
</OL>

You can also map a drive from the command prompt using the <B>net use</B> or <B>map</B> commands.

<A NAME="633"><H3>Using Windows Explorer to Map a Drive</H3></A><P>
When mapping a drive using Windows Explorer, you can use UNC syntax or NetWare syntax. In addition, if you are using Service for NetWare Directory Services, you can also use NDS syntax. For example, you can use either of the following to map the letter z to \\NetWareServer\sys:
<P>
net use z: \\NetWareServer\sys
<P>
map z:=NetWareServer\sys

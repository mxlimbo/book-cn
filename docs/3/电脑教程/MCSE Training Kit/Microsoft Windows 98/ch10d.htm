Troubleshooting is the process of isolating the source of a problem and fixing it. Unfortunately, attempts to fix a problem may cause other problems or make the original problem worse. For this reason, you should always have a backup of your registry and an Emergency Startup Disk you create from a working configuration before you begin troubleshooting. This lesson describes the procedures for creating an Emergency Startup Disk and backing up the registry.

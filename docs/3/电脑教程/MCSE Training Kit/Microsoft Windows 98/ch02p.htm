The Setup process is organized in five phases. In Phase 1, Preparing to Run Windows&#160;98 Setup, Setup checks for and prompts you to disable anti-virus software.
<P>
In Phase 2, Collecting information about your computer, Setup runs ScanDisk, checks the registry for corrupt files, and prepares your Windows directory. Setup also prompts you to save your existing MS-DOS and Windows system files, and prompts you to create an Emergency Startup Disk.
<P>
In Phase 3, Copying Windows&#160;98 files to your computer, Setup copies Windows&#160;98 files to your computer. 
<P>
In Phase 4, Restarting your computer, your computer is automatically restarted in order to configure system files and add Windows&#160;98-specific settings. These system files include Win.ini, System.ini, and registry files. Autoexec.bat and Config.sys are examined for TSRs and incompatible drivers.
<P>
In Phase 5, Setting up hardware and finalizing settings, Setup detects Plug and Play devices and legacy hardware. Setup finalizes settings for system configuration, Control Panel, Start menu, Windows Help, and MS-DOS programs. Finally, Setup restarts your computer.

<A NAME="93"><H2>Phase 2&#151;Collecting Information About Your Computer</H2></A><P>
After you accept the License Agreement, Setup checks your system (see Figure 2.3), and prompts you to save existing system files, select Internet channels, and create an emergency startup disk.

<A NAME="94"><H3>Checking Your System</H3></A><P>
Setup performs the following information collection tasks:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>ScanDisk runs in protected mode, checking the directory structure, file allocation table, and file system. 
<P>
In protected mode, ScanDisk does not perform a surface scan; therefore, the disk is not checked for physical errors. If ScanDisk finds any problems, Setup stops and allows you to run ScanDisk manually.
<P>
<LI>Setup checks the registry for corrupt files. 
<P>
Setup attempts to repair any corrupt files. If the repair is successful, Setup continues. If the repair is unsuccessful, you are prompted first to run Setup from MS-DOS, and then to install Windows&#160;98 in a new directory.
<P>
<LI>Setup prepares your Windows directory and verifies that your computer has enough disk space to install Windows&#160;98.
<P>
If you do not have enough disk space, the Setup Wizard prompts you to free up hard disk space and restart Setup.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="95"><H3>Saving Existing System Files</H3></A><P>
After Setup has finished checking your system, you have the option of saving your existing MS-DOS and Windows system files (see Figure 2.4). It is recommended that you select <B>Yes</B> to save your existing files in case you need to restore your Windows&#160;95 configuration when uninstalling Windows&#160;98. If you select <B>No</B>, you will not be able to uninstall Windows&#160;98. Instead, you will have to delete the Windows&#160;98 directory and reinstall the previous operating system, as well as any Windows programs.

<CAPTION><B>Figure 2.4</B> <I>Save Existing System Files dialog</I></CAPTION>
<P>
If you choose to save your existing configuration files, Setup creates the following files:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Winundo.dat
<P>
The Winundo.dat file containes all of the files necessary to restore your old system settings. This file may be as large as 75 MB.
<P>
<LI>Winundo.ini
<P>
The Winundo.ini file contains information necessary to restore the files contained in the Winundo.dat file.
</UL>
<P>        
<P>
<A NAME="96"><H3>Selecting Internet Channels</H3></A><P>
Setup prompts you to select a country for Internet Channels. The channels are tailored for various countries to provide information of popular interest for the people of that country. You do not have to live in a particular country to subscribe to that country's channels.
<P>
<A NAME="97"><H3>Emergency Startup Disk Files</H3></A><P>
Setup prompts you to create an Emergency Startup Disk (ESD). The ESD, also called the Windows&#160;98 Startup Disk, is a system disk with a collection of real-mode Windows&#160;98 commands and utilities that can assist in troubleshooting. If your hard disk will not boot up after Setup, use the ESD to restart your system. 
<P>
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Note</B>
<P>
For a list of files contained on the ESD, refer to Appendix C, &quot;<A HREF="chac.htm#922">Emergency Startup Disk Contents</A>.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<P>
The ESD can support both IDE and SCSI (Adaptec and Mylex/Buslogic) CD-ROM drives. If you use the ESD to boot the computer and choose to load the real-mode CD-ROM drivers but cannot access a compact disc in the drive, it is probable that the generic drivers supplied by Windows&#160;98 will not work with your drive or controller. If this happens, you must copy the correct drivers for your CD-ROM drive and controller to the ESD, and then edit the Config.sys file on the ESD so that it will load the drivers. Consult the documentation for your CD-ROM drive and controller to get the correct files and configuration settings.
<P>
After the files are copied, you are prompted to remove the disk and then to continue with Setup.

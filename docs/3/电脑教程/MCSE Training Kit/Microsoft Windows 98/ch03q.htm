<A NAME="149"><H2>How Windows&#160;98 Generates MS-DOS File Names</H2></A><P>
Files in Windows&#160;98 may have two file names: a long file name, and an alias, or MS-DOS name&#151;a file name that conforms to the 8.3 character naming convention.

<P>
An MS-DOS name (see Figure 3.6) consists of a basis  name, a numeric tail, and an extension.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The <I>basis name</I> consists of the first six legal characters in the long file name, changed to uppercase. Legal characters include all alphanumeric characters and certain symbols. Spaces are not legal characters.
<P>
<LI>The <I>numeric tail</I> is a tilde (~) and a number, usually 1 (if the MS-DOS name is unique), which increases incrementally to avoid conflict with an existing MS-DOS name.
<P>
<LI>The <I>extension</I> consists of the first three legal characters after the final period in the long file name (LFNs can contain multiple periods).
</UL>
<P>
For example, the LFN &quot;This is a Long File Name.document.txt&quot; has an MS-DOS name of &quot;THISIS~1.TXT&quot;. If this MS-DOS name already exists for another file, the MS-DOS name would be &quot;Thisis~2.txt&quot;
<P>
Windows&#160;98 continues to increase the numeric tail as necessary. After nine iterations, the basis name is reduced to the first five legal characters. The MS-DOS name in the above example would become &quot;THISIS~1.TXT&quot;. This is unlike Windows&#160;NT, which adds hexadecimal characters to file names after the fourth iteration.
<P>
When working at a command prompt within Windows&#160;98, you must either use the MS-DOS name or use quotation marks around the long file name. If you want to delete the above file, you would type:
<P>
<PRE>Del thisis~1.txt</PRE>
<P>
&#150; Or &#150;
<P>
<PRE>Del &quot;this is a long file name.document.txt&quot;</PRE>

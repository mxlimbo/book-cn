<A NAME="55"><H2>Other Installation Support Issues</H2></A><P>
Windows&#160;98 Setup is designed to minimize the kinds of problems that can occur during installation. These issues can include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Incompatible video drivers
<P>
<LI>Setupx.dll remaining in memory
<P>
<LI>Changing the installed components
<P>
<LI>Interrupting file copying
<P>
<LI>Virus protection software
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="56"><H3>Incompatible Video Drivers</H3></A><P>
When you install a video card for your computer, you should make sure you are using the correct driver. Using an incorrect driver could result in the inability to display the desired resolution or the correct number of colors, and could even cause the video display to distort.
<P>
<A NAME="57"><H3>Setupx.dll Remaining in Memory</H3></A><P>
Setupx.dll is the program that actually performs the Windows&#160;98 installation. When Windows&#160;98 Setup is started, it checks to see if Setup is being run from inside Windows&#160;95 or from MS-DOS. When Setup indicates that the Setup Wizard is loading, Setupx.dll has been loaded into memory.
<P>
Setupx.dll can remain in memory if Setup fails. If you try to run Setup again without first restarting the computer, Setup may fail, and you may see an error message. For this reason, if Setup fails, shut down and then restart the computer prior to running Setup again. This will ensure that a previous copy of Setupx.dll is not in memory.
<P>
<A NAME="58"><H3>Changing the Installed Components</H3></A><P>
Because Windows&#160;98 is an upgrade to Windows&#160;95, there is no way to add or remove components when you run Setup from within Windows&#160;95. If you want to change the installed components, you can add or remove them after Setup finishes by clicking <B>Add/Remove Programs</B> in Control Panel. You can change the installed components during Setup by either using a setup script or running Setup.exe from MS-DOS.
<P>
<A NAME="59"><H3>Interrupting File Copying</H3></A><P>
File copying must complete without interruption in order to ensure a successful Setup. If Setup is interrupted during the file-copying phase, Windows&#160;95 may not run when you restart your computer. This is because the Windows&#160;95 directory now contains a mixture of Windows&#160;98 and Windows&#160;95 system files.
<P>
If you want to continue Setup when Windows&#160;95 will not run, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Shut down and then restart the computer.
<P>
The computer will be able to restart only from MS-DOS at this point.
<P>
<LI>	Run Setup.exe from MS-DOS.
<P>
<LI>	When the <B>Safe Recovery</B> dialog box appears, select <B>Use Safe Recovery </B>(recommended).
</OL>
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3>Virus Protection Software</H3></A><P>
As discussed earlier in this chapter, you should disable any anti-virus software or BIOS-level anti-virus protection prior to running Setup or converting a FAT16 drive to FAT32.

Device Manager lists all of the installed devices on your computer and provides information about the status, driver, and resources for each device. The Automatic Skip Driver Agent (ASD) identifies drivers that fail to load or operations that fail at startup. ASD marks the failed device or operation to be bypassed on subsequent startups.

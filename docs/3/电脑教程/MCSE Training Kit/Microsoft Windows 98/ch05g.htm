<A NAME="226"><H2>Multitasking in Windows&#160;98</H2></A><P>
Users often need to work with multiple applications at the same time. Windows&#160;98 provides this functionality by <I>multitasking</I> applications. Windows&#160;98 uses two types of multitasking: cooperative multitasking and preemptive multitasking.
<P>
With Windows 3.1<I>x</I>, applications run concurrently through a method known as <I>cooperative multitasking</I>. Using this method, the operating system requires an application to check the message queue periodically to relinquish control of the system to other running applications. The message queue in Windows&#160;3.1<I>x</I> is a central location in the operating system where applications could receive event messages such as a mouse click or input from the keyboard. Applications that do not check the message queue will block other applications, keeping them from executing. This also prevents users from switching to other applications. For compatibility reasons, Windows&#160;98 implements cooperative multitasking for 16-bit applications.
<P>
Windows&#160;98 uses <I>preemptive multitasking</I> for Win32-based applications. This means that the operating system has complete control over running applications. To achieve this, the operating system schedules a certain amount of time for each application to execute.

IEEE 1394 is similar to USB, except that it supports devices requiring much higher bandwidth. It uses a tree topology and a daisy chain topology. The four types of IEEE 1394 components are input/output devices (such as computers or digital video cameras), splitters, bridges, and repeaters.
<P>
IEEE 1394 devices are Plug and Play compatible, so when installing an IEEE 1394 device, you do not have to restart the computer to enable the new device. Since IEEE 1394 is an external bus, you can add a device without having to open the computer.

<A NAME="1-1"><LI></A>	Your company is purchasing 12 new computers for the Human Resources and Accounting departments. The manufacturer offers Windows&#160;98 or Windows&#160;NT Workstation as a pre-installation option. These users will primarily be running spreadsheet and custom applications that have been tested to run successfully on both Windows&#160;98 and Windows&#160;NT Workstation. Payroll and accounting data in progress will be stored on the users' local computers and must be secure. Multiple users will use individual computers. Which operating system should you choose and why?
<P>
<B>Windows&#160;NT Workstation. Only Windows&#160;NT Workstation allows files on the local computer to be secured from local users.</B>

<P>
<A NAME="1-2"><LI></A>	You want to upgrade your 486/66 computer to a 32-bit operating system. You have 24 MB of RAM and a 2 GB hard drive. Which operating system would you install? Why?
<P>
<B>Windows&#160;98. Windows&#160;NT is not recommended for anything less than a Pentium.</B>
<P>
<A NAME="1-3"><LI></A>	You want to upgrade the computers in your office to a 32-bit operating system, but some of the programs you need to run are 16-bit and MS-DOS-based applications. Why might you install Windows&#160;98 instead Windows&#160;NT?
<P>
<B>Windows&#160;NT is not as backwards compatible with many older applications because they violate Windows&#160;NT security rules. Windows&#160;98 provides better support for these applications than Windows&#160;NT.</B>

<OL>
<A NAME="3-1"><LI></A>	You want to implement FAT32 partitions on several computers running Windows&#160;98 on a network. Your supervisor expresses concern, however, that users at these computers will not be able to share files and folders with users of other operating systems. How would you explain the use of FAT32 partitions on a network?
<P>
<B>FAT32 partitions can be shared on the network and accessed by Microsoft networking clients, just as FAT16 partitions and NTFS partitions (on Windows&#160;NT) can.</B>
<P>
<A NAME="3-2"><LI></A>	You install a new 4.2&#160;GB hard drive. What types and sizes of partitions can you create on a computer running Windows&#160;98?
<P>
<B>If you enable large disk support (FAT32) when you start Fdisk, you can create one 4.2&#160;GB partition. However, if you use FAT16, you must create at least two 2&#160;GB partitions.</B>
<P>
<A NAME="3-3"><LI></A>	A user in your organization dual boots Windows&#160;NT 4.0 and Windows&#160;98, and has two hard drives, C and D. Drive C contains all system files and drive D contains all applications and data. The user converts drive D with Drive Converter (FAT32), then discovers that drive is inaccessible from Windows&#160;NT. Why is the user unable to access drive D from Windows&#160;NT? What actions can the user take to make the data on drive D available on drive C?
<P>
<B>Windows&#160;NT 4.0 can not read FAT32 drives except across a network. The user can move all data and reinstall applications to drive C, or the user can back up the data on drive D, repartition it using FAT16, and reformat it. Once you convert a drive to FAT32, you cannot convert it back to FAT16.</B>
<P>
<A NAME="3-4"><LI></A>	You attempt to save a file called C:\Report.doc on a FAT16 partition and receive an &quot;Insufficient disk space&quot; error. Windows Explorer reports 350&#160;MB of unused disk space. Why are you encountering this error message, and what should you do to solve the problem?
<P>
<B>The root folder of a FAT16 partition is limited to 512 directory entries, and long file names deplete these directory entries rapidly. When all 512 entries are in use, you are unable to create any more files or folders at the root of the drive. You can, however, continue to create files and folders within top-level folders, or within subfolders. You should save your file in a folder or subfolder, and then consolidate your top-level files and folders.</B>
<P>
<A NAME="3-5"><LI></A>	What is the maximum number of characters you can use in a long file name?
<P>
<B>Windows&#160;98 supports a maximum of 255 characters in a long file name.</B>
<P>
<A NAME="3-6"><LI></A>	You compress your only hard drive, but you want to test a file on an uncompressed drive before you share the file with users who have uncompressed drives. How can you create uncompressed space on your hard drive to test this file?
<P>
<B>You can use the Adjust Free Space option on the Drive menu of the DriveSpace</B>&#160;<B>3 utility. Increase the free space in the uncompressed host drive, save the file to the host drive, and test it there. After you test it, you can return the free space to the compressed drive.</B>

<A NAME="4-1"><LI></A>	What was WDM designed to do?
<P>
<B>WDM was designed to provide a common set of I/O services and binary-compatible device drivers for both Windows&#160;NT and Windows&#160;98 operating systems.</B>
<P>
<A NAME="4-2"><LI></A>	What are the USB components, and what part does each component play in USB topology?
<P>
<B><I>USB host.</I> The host, either built into the motherboard or installed as an adapter card in the computer, controls all of the traffic on the bus and also functions as a hub.
<P>
<I>USB hub.</I> The hub provides a point to attach devices to the bus. Hubs are also responsible for detecting devices that are being attached or detached from the bus and for providing power management services for devices that are attached to it. Hubs are either bus-powered&#151;meaning that they draw power directly from the bus&#151;or externally powered. A bus-powered hub cannot be connected to another bus-powered hub. Devices that draw more than 100 milliamps of power cannot be connected to a bus-powered hub.
<P>
<I>USB device.</I> These are the I/O devices that are attached to the bus. USB devices may also function as hubs. For example, a USB monitor may have ports for attaching a USB keyboard and mouse. In this case, the monitor would be both a USB device as well as a USB hub. USB devices can either draw their power from the bus or be externally powered.</B>
<P>
<A NAME="4-3"><LI></A>	Which devices participate in the device power management scheme as part of the OnNow computer platform?
<P>
<B>All devices participate in the device power management scheme, whether originally installed in the computer or added later by the user.</B>
<P>
<A NAME="4-4"><LI></A>	What are the IEEE 1394 components, and what part does each component play in the IEEE 1394 topology?
<P>
<B>The four types of IEEE 1394 components include:
<P>
<I>IEEE device.</I> An input/output device that is attached to the bus. IEEE 1394 devices have two or more IEEE 1394 connectors, which allow devices to be daisy-chained together.
<P>
<I>IEEE 1394 splitter.</I> A splitter allows considerable flexibility in designing and implementing IEEE 1394 topology by providing extra IEEE 1394 ports.
<P>
<I>IEEE 1394 bridge.</I> A bridge isolates data traffic within a specific area of the bus.
<P>
<I>IEEE 1394 repeater.</I> A repeater extends the distance between devices by retransmitting data signals across the bus.</B>
<P>
<A NAME="4-5"><LI></A>	How does multiple display support modify the desktop?
<P>
<B>Multiple display support modifies the desktop so that it can span several monitors regardless of their size or position.</B>

<P>
<A NAME="5-3"><LI></A>	When would Windows&#160;98 use cooperative multitasking?
<P>
<B>Windows&#160;98 implements cooperative multitasking for 16-bit applications.</B>
<P>
<A NAME="5-4"><LI></A>	What is the total amount of virtual address spaces allocated to a process?
<P>
<B>Each process created is allocated a total of 4&#160;GB of virtual memory addresses. 2&#160;GB are allocated to the operating system, the other 2&#160;GB are private to the process.</B>

Later, you upgrade the computer from Windows&#160;95 to Windows&#160;98, and the new applications are not working. What could be causing this problem? What can you do to resolve it?
<P>
<B>The applications might be newer than Windows&#160;98. When they were installed, they replaced some Windows system files. Later, when you upgraded to Windows&#160;98, VCM replaced the newer files with the older Windows&#160;98 files. Use VCM to restore the newer versions of the system files.</B>

<A NAME="10-3"><LI></A>	When you turn on your computer, Windows&#160;98 reaches the Logo screen and does not go any further. What is the first step you can take in troubleshooting this problem?

Restart the computer and hold down the CTRL key to bring up the Startup Menu, then choose Safe Mode. If Windows&#160;98 boots successfully using Safe Mode, the problem is probably related to a network driver, disk driver, video driver, or third-party VxD.</B>

<A NAME="15-1"><LI></A>	Your network consists of Windows&#160;98-based clients and Windows&#160;NT Server-based servers. Users typically log on to the network on their own computers, but occasionally on other computers as well. You want to implement roaming user profiles on your Windows&#160;98-based network clients so that your users can download their desktop settings to any computer. However, your supervisor questions the possibility of many support calls from users who lose their desktop shortcuts and settings if the Windows&#160;NT-based profile server is unavailable. How would you explain the effects of an unavailable server on roaming user profiles?
<P>
<B>Windows&#160;98 creates a local user profile on each computer to which a user logs on, and updates the profile each time a user log off from that computer. If a user logs on to a computer, and Windows&#160;98 cannot connect to the user's home folder, Windows&#160;98 loads the local user profile. Users will probably not notice any differences on their own computers unless they had made changes during their last logon. However, at other computers, a user's settings may be outdated or completely unavailable, depending on when the user had most recently  logged on to that computer.</B>
<P>
<A NAME="15-2"><LI></A>	Your company uses roaming user profiles. Three interns in your company share a common account for logging on to the network. One intern complains to you that sometimes the profile settings are saved, and other times they aren't. What is causing this problem, and how would you solve it?
<P>
<B>The interns are sharing a common user profile because they are using the same account. The intern who complained probably logged off, and then had settings overwritten when another intern logged off. To fix the problem, assign each user an individual account.</B>
<P>
<A NAME="15-3"><LI></A>	You want a specific user profile to be mandatory, but you cannot find an option in Control Panel where you can configure this. How should you do this?
<P>
<B>After you create the user profile, rename User.dat to User.man</B>
<P>
<A NAME="15-4"><LI></A>	You are troubleshooting a problem with a user's roaming user profile. The configuration settings and changes save and load successfully when she logs on to her own computer. They also save and load successfully when she logs on to someone else's computer. When she returns to her own computer, however, the changes she made at the other computer are not present in her user profile. What might be the problem?
<P>
<B>Check the system clock on the user's computer. If the system clock on the user's computer is ahead of the system clock on the server that contains her user profile, the server profile may not load. When Windows&#160;98 locates the server-based profile, it compares the date/time stamp to that of the locally cached profile. The most recent profile then loads. In this case, the local user profile might be more recent than the server-based profile. If so, you can solve this problem by synchronizing the user's system clock with the server's clock.</B>
<P>
<A NAME="15-5"><LI></A>	Your users are able to download their desktop shortcuts from the NetWare server that contains their profile, but not their Start menu shortcuts. You verify that the computers running Windows&#160;98 are configured correctly. What is causing the problem, and how can you solve it?

<B>The NetWare server does not support long filenames. Desktop shortcuts save in the desktop folder, which complies with the 8.3 naming convention. Start menu is not an 8.3 name, however, so the server cannot download the contents of that folder. To solve the problem, add long file name support to the NetWare server.</B>

<B>The wallpaper file is not present on the other computers. A user profile setting which refers to a file or component that is not installed on a computer will not be available on that computer.</B>

<A NAME="16-1"><LI></A>	You frequently install new programs on your servers and occasionally change the location of these programs. You would like to minimize support calls by providing and updating desktop and Start menu shortcuts to these programs, while preventing users from deleting or modifying them. You also would like to prevent users from changing display and other settings that might cause problems with the programs. Would you choose to implement this with mandatory user profiles or system policies? Explain your reasons.
<P>
<B>There are several advantages and disadvantages to both approaches:
<P>
Mandatory user profiles may be a simpler method. However, the primary advantage of profiles may also be a disadvantage: Users will not be able to change <I>any</I> settings at all. This might be the desired approach, especially if you believe your programs may be affected by unforeseen configuration changes. In contrast, system policies used with nonmandatory user profiles can be used to restrict only specific problem areas. This method allows users to modify the aspects of their environment that you consider safe.
<P>
Another consideration: with mandatory user profiles, users can change their configuration settings temporarily and customize their environments without fear of causing permanent damage. System policy settings generally prevent users from making any changes to controlled settings.
<P>
Also consider administration: Installing a new program on a server requires you to copy the shortcut to each user's profile folder. With system policies, you may be able to avoid repetitive steps if you are using the Default User policy to assign settings, or reduce repetitive steps if you are using group policies. If you are using individual user policies, however, administration can actually take longer, because using System Policy Editor is more complex than simply copying a shortcut.</B>
<P>
<A NAME="16-2"><LI></A>	While editing the system policy for Default Computer in System Policy Editor, you think that you may have unintentionally made a change to an option. Unfortunately, you can not remember whether the previous default for this option was enabled or disabled. What can you do to make sure that a change does not take effect?
<P>
<B>Click the box next to the option until the box is shaded. Shaded boxes indicate no changes will be made.</B>
<P>
<A NAME="16-3"><LI></A>	You delegate the task of implementing system policies to another network administrator. He implements user policies, but is hesitant to implement computer policies because he is concerned about possible conflicts between the two types of policies. Is this a valid concern? Why or why not?
<P>
<B>This is <I>not</I> a valid concern with a properly defined template such as the templates supplied with Windows&#160;98 and Windows&#160;NT. These templates completely separate user and computer settings. Because they are applied to separate registry subtrees (user policies to HKEY_CURRENT_USER, and computer policies to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE), there will be no conflicts.</B>
<P>
<A NAME="16-4"><LI></A>	Your Windows&#160;NT domain contains the user accounts of your 2,000 Windows&#160;98 users. You implement system policies, but you are not satisfied with the slow performance when downloading the policy file during shift changes. How can you speed up this process?
<P>
<B>Enable load balancing on your Windows&#160;98 clients, and configure directory replication on your Windows&#160;NT Server domain controllers for the Config.pol file.</B>
<P>
<A NAME="16-5"><LI></A>	You create group policies using System Policy Editor, and you save the Config.pol file on your Windows&#160;NT-based security provider. You soon discover that while some computers implement the group policies, others don't. However, the computers that do not process the group policies implement the Default User policy. What is probably causing the problem?
<P>
<B>Group policies are not enabled on the computers that are not implementing the group policy settings. Install group policy support through the Add/Remove Programs icon in Control Panel.</B>

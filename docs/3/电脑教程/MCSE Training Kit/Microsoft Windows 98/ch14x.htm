Here are some recommendations to keep in mind when you are using a computer running Windows&#160;98 that is connected to a Novell NetWare network:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>If you need frequent access to a particular share on a server, map a drive letter to that share point.
<P>
<LI>Remember that the NetWare World account allows access only to users who have an account on the security provider. This differs from File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks, which does allow access to unknown users through The World account.
<P>
<LI>If you want your Windows&#160;98 computer to appear on the Active NetWare Server list, then you must install File and printer sharing for NetWare Networks and enable SAP advertising.
</UL>

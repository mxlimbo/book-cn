<A NAME="231"><H1>Lesson 2: Windows&#160;98 Memory Management</H1></A><P>
In MS-DOS and Windows&#160;3.1<I>x</I>, all processes share a single address space. This means that any process can read from or write to memory belonging to any other process, including the operating system. Windows&#160;98 uses a demand-paged virtual memory system. This system is based on a flat, linear address space, accessed using 32-bit addresses. When a thread in a process is running, it can only access memory that belongs to its process. The memory that belongs to other processes is hidden from the running thread. This lesson provides an overview of virtual memory and memory paging.

<A NAME="673"><H2>Updating Local and Roaming Profiles</H2></A><P>
When a user logs off or shuts down the computer, the registry and desktop settings update the local profile and, if it exists, the server-based user profile.
<P>
If the user logs on to more than one computer at the same time, the last computer the user logs off has its profile saved to the server. The computer that was logged off first will not have its profile saved because Windows&#160;98 will not merge profile changes from multiple computers.
<P>

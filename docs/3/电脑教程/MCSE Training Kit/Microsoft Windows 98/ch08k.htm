Windows&#160;98 implements printing using a 32-bit print subsystem that includes a multithread, preemptive spooler architecture. Subsystem components include the graphical device interface, raw or EMF files, the print spooler, and the print processor.
<P>
Some printers support bi-directional parallel communications, in which the printer driver can query the printer automatically and configure it based on the printer's capabilities and limitations.
<P>
Deferred printing enables you to store a print job on your computer's local hard disk. You can print the document later without opening the application.

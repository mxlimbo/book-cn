<A NAME="760"><H3>ActiveX Controls</H3></A><P>
ActiveX is a technology that enables software components to interact with each other in a networked environment, regardless of the language in which they were created. ActiveX controls are software components that provide a user interface. With ActiveX controls, your Web site can include multimedia effects, interactive objects, and sophisticated applications that create a user experience comparable to those of high-quality CD-ROM titles.
<P>

With Internet Explorer 4.0, you can also do the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Restrict access to certain sites based on standard ratings.

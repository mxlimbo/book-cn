You configure Windows&#160;98 to log on to a Windows&#160;NT domain through Client for Microsoft Networks (see Figure 13.4).

To configure your computer to log on to a Windows&#160;NT domain, follow these steps:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	In Control Panel, double-click <B>Network</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Select <B>Client for Microsoft Networks</B> and click <B>Properties</B>.
<P>
<LI>	In the<B> Client for Microsoft Networks Properties </B>dialog box, select the <B>Log on to Windows&#160;NT domain</B> check box, and type the name of your domain in the Windows&#160;NT domain box.
<P>
<LI>	You can then select whether to use <B>Quick Logon</B> or <B>Logon and restore network connections</B>.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Select <B>Quick logon</B> to log on to the network without reconnecting any previously used network drives until you attempt to use them (this makes the logon process faster).
<P>
<LI>Select <B>Logon and restore network connections </B>to have Windows&#160;98 attempt to restore all network connections during the logon process. This slows down the logon process but it also lets you know when you log on whether or not network resources are available.
</UL>
</OL>
<P>

Before you continue with the lesson, run the <B>Chap13.exe</B> animation located in the <B>Animations</B> folder on the Supplemental Course Materials CD-ROM that accompanies this book. This animation demonstrates how to configure your computer to log on to a Windows&#160;NT domain.
<P>
<A NAME="583"><H3>The Logon Process</H3></A><P>
When you start a computer running Windows&#160;98, a logon prompt appears before you can access the desktop. Whether you are prompted for the local Windows&#160;98 password or your domain password depends on the <B>Primary Network Logon</B> setting you have designated using the Network icon of Control Panel.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Windows Logon</B> prompts you for your username and password for the local computer. This information is stored in a Password List (.pwl) file located in the C:\Windows folder. After the desktop appears, if you attempt to access a network resource, your local username and password are sent to the remote server.
<P>
<LI><B>Client for Microsoft Networks</B> prompts you for your domain name, domain username, and domain password. This information is stored on the domain controllers in your Windows&#160;NT domain. If your domain username and password match your local username and password, your desktop appears after you log on to the domain. Otherwise, the local <B>Windows Logon</B> dialog box appears, prompting you for your local username and password.
<P>
<LI><B>Microsoft Family Logon </B>prompts you to choose your user name from a list of names stored on the computer. After you click your user name, you can enter your password. You are not prompted for a domain name; however, if the computer is configured to log on to a domain, and your domain username and password do not match, you are prompted for a Microsoft Network logon.
</UL>
<P>
To use Microsoft Family Logon, you must have user profiles enabled. To log on to a network using Microsoft Family Logon, you must have network client software, such as Client for Microsoft Networks, installed.
<P>
<A NAME="584"><H3>Logon Scripts</H3></A><P>
You can use the <B>User Manager for Domains</B> tool on Windows&#160;NT Server to assign a logon script to a Windows&#160;98 user. A <I>logon script</I> is a batch file that runs automatically when a user logs on, before the desktop is displayed. Typical logon scripts will include commands to customize a user's computer, such as setting the time or connecting network drives.
<P>
When a Windows&#160;98 user logs on to a Windows&#160;NT domain, the user's logon script (if one is assigned) is downloaded from the netlogon share on the authenticating domain controller. Lmscript.exe and Lmscript.pif, which are located in the C:\Windows\System folder, generate the process that executes the logon script.

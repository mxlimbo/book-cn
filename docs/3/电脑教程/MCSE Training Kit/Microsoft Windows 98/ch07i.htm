<A NAME="316"><H3>Single Explorer</H3></A><P>
Consolidating Explorer into a single utility streamlines access to information, making it easier and quicker to find and retrieve data. Simple and Consistent Browsing are important features of the single Explorer.
<P>
You can browse a local hard disk or a network in the same way that you browse the World Wide Web. Navigation functions, such as <B>Back</B>, <B>Forward</B>, and single-click navigation, used in Web browsers, appear throughout the entire user interface. The single Explorer provides the ability to view multiple types of content in any folder, whether the content consists of files, folders, or HTML. With Explorer, you can view folders as Web pages.
<P>
<A NAME="317"><H4>Transparent Browser Access</H4></A><P>
While you are looking at the contents of your hard disk, you can go to a Web page with a single click, without starting a new application. Because all content can be viewed in the same window, another click returns you to your local content. You can then move between local content and Web pages without having to start a Web browser.
<P>
<A NAME="318"><H4>Context-sensitive Menus and Toolbars</H4></A><P>
The user interface detects the type of information presented, whether it is HTML or local files and folders, and automatically adjusts the toolbar to the type of information. For example, Edit, Search, and Print replace features such as Delete and Properties.  The Address bar also supports both Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and paths, such as C:\Windows.
<P>
<A NAME="319"><H4>Seamless Browsing in Global Favorites</H4> </A><P>
With new Global Favorites, you can keep track of any folders, files, or servers along with your favorite Web sites, so that you can seamlessly move between local content and Web content.

<P>
After you physically install a modem on your computer, you can use either the Modems icon in Control Panel or the Make New Connection Wizard in the Dial-Up-Networking folder to install the modem software.
<P>
If you want to install and configure a modem, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	In <B>Control Panel</B>, double-click the <B>Modems </B>icon.
<P>
The Install New Modem Wizard starts.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>Next </B>to instruct Windows&#160;98 to detect your modem automatically.
<P>
Windows&#160;98 detects your modem and installs the appropriate drivers.
<P>
-Or-
<P>
Select <B>Don't detect my modem; I will select it from a list</B>, and then click <B>Next</B>.
<P>
Windows&#160;98 prompts you for the Manufacturer, Model, and COM port for your modem. Windows&#160;98 then installs the appropriate drivers.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>Finish</B>.
<P>
The <B>Location Information </B>dialog box opens.
<P>
<LI>	Enter your country and area code information. If applicable, enter the number dialed to access an outside line. Select either tone or pulse.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>Finish</B>.
<P>
<LI>	To configure the modem, double-click the <B>Modems</B> icon in Control Panel. The <B>Properties</B> dialog box appears.
<P>
<LI>	From the <B>General </B>tab, select the modem you want and click <B>Properties </B>(see&#160;Figure 18.2).
<P>
<LI>	You can change the port, modem speed, and other configuration information.
</OL>

<B>Note</B>
<P>
Although you can also change modem properties from within a Win32 application, any changes that you make from that application will affect that application only. To make global changes, use Control Panel.

<A NAME="802"><H3>Configuring Modems</H3></A><P>
The default properties work for most modem connections. You should consult your modem documentation before changing any of the default properties. For some modems, you cannot modify all settings; if an option appears grayed out, your modem does not support the feature controlled by that option.
<P>
<A NAME="803"><H3>Configuring the Dial-Up Adapter</H3></A><P>
When you use a modem for Dial-Up Networking, a dial-up adapter appears in the list of installed network components in the Network option of Control Panel.
<P>
The dial-up adapter is a network adapter driver that interfaces with the Windows&#160;98 communications device driver. The dial-up adapter driver shields the network components from the fact that communication is through a modem rather than through a network adapter.

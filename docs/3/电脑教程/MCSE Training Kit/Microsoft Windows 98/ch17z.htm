<A NAME="793"><H3>Using Personal Web Server in Small Networks</H3></A><P>
Microsoft designed Personal Web Server for small-scale, peer-to-peer networks, or for a corporate intranet. Personal Web Server has a connection limit of 10 users. It is optimized for interactive workstation use and does not have the system requirements of a full Web server, such as Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS).
<P>
IIS supports an unlimited number of users, offers complete security of your web site, and also includes a file transfer protocol (FTP) service. Note, however, that IIS runs only on a Windows&#160;NT 4.0 Server.

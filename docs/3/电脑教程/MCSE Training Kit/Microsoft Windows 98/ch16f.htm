<A NAME="694"><H2>How Do System Policies Work?</H2></A><P>
The settings in a system policy apply to a computer's registry when the user logs on to the network. The registry is a database of software and hardware configuration settings. The registry also reflects the contents of System.dat, which contains computer-specific configuration settings, and User.dat, which contains user-specific configuration settings. Figure 16.1 illustrates system policy implementation.

When the user logs on, Windows&#160;98 checks the user's configuration information for the location of the policy file. By default, Windows&#160;98 attempts to download computer and user policies from the Netlogon directory on a Windows&#160;NT server or the Public directory on a NetWare server. You can override this default location in a policy file setting.
<P>
Windows&#160;98 downloads the policies and copies the information into the registry in the following sequence:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	If user profiles are enabled, Windows&#160;98 checks for a user policy file that matches the user name. If it finds one, Windows&#160;98 applies the user-specific policy. (You must enable user profiles to apply a user policy file).
<P>
<LI>	If Windows&#160;98 does not find a user policy file, it applies the Default User system policy settings. (The Default User policy file contains settings you choose to apply to all users who do not have a specific user policy).
<P>
<LI>	If support for group policies is installed on the computer, then Windows&#160;98 checks whether the user is a member of any defined groups. If so, Windows&#160;98 downloads any assigned group policies starting with the lowest priority group and ending with the highest priority group.
<P>
Windows&#160;98 processes group policies for all groups the user belongs to, applying the group with the highest priority last so that the settings in that group's policy file supersede those in lower priority groups. When you create group policies in System Policy Editor, you arrange the groups in the priority order you want.
<P>
Windows&#160;98 does not process group policies if there is a user policy file for that specific user.
<P>
<LI>	Windows&#160;98 checks for a computer policy file to match the computer name. If one exists, Windows&#160;98 applies the computer-specific policies to the registry.
<P>
<LI>	If a policy file for that computer name does not exist, Windows&#160;98 applies the default computer policies.
</OL>
<P>
System policy entries change registry settings as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Desktop settings modify the Hkey_Current_User key in the registry, which defines the contents of User.dat. You define policy settings that affect User.dat for a specific user, a group, or for the default user.
<P>
<LI>Network access settings modify the Hkey_Local_Machine key in the registry, which defines the contents of System.dat. You define policy settings that affect System.dat for a specific computer or for the default computer.
</UL>

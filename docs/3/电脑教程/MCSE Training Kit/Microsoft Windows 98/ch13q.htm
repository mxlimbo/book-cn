<A NAME="596"><H2>Editing an Access Control List</H2></A><P>
When you employ user-level security to protect shared resources, the users and global groups that are permitted to access the shared resource appear on the Access Control List (ACL).
<P>
<A NAME="597"><H3>Editing the Access Control List</H3></A><P>
You can add and/or remove users and groups from the ACL by clicking the <B>Add</B> and <B>Remove</B> buttons.

<P>
If you want to view and edit the Access Control List, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Right-click the shared resource.
<P>
<LI>	On the <B>Sharing</B> tab, click <B>Add</B>.
<P>
The <B>Add Users</B> dialog box displays a list of global groups and users available on your security provider.
<P>
<LI>	If your security provider is a Windows&#160;NT domain server, you can also assign permissions to users in trusted domains, by selecting the users' domains in the <B>Obtain list from</B> list (see Figure 13.9).
</OL>
<P>
<A NAME="598"><H3>User vs. Group Permissions</H3></A><P>
If the ACL grants permissions to both a user and a group to which the user belongs, the user permissions override the group permissions. This is unlike Windows&#160;NT, in which user and group permissions are cumulative. In general, you should assign permissions to groups rather than to users, and then assign users to the appropriate groups.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Important</B>
<P>
To create groups or to assign users to groups you must be a Windows&#160;NT Domain Administrator.

<P>
<A NAME="599"><H3>The World Account</H3></A><P>
If you do not want to specify individual users and groups on a low-security share, you can enable public access by granting permission to <B>The World</B>. <B>The World</B> account grants access to any valid user on the security provider. If the security provider's guest account is enabled, then <B>The World</B> account grants access to users outside the domain as well.

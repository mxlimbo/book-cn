<A NAME="497"><H2>Installing Additional Components During Setup</H2></A><P>
You can add additional services during installation; for example, you can add Remote Registry service so that you can enable remote administration automatically. Use the INF Installer Tool to add components during setup. INF Installer is on the Windows&#160;98 CD-ROM in the \tools\reskit\infinst folder. 
<P>
In Windows&#160;98, additional software components typically include a <I>setup information file</I> (*.inf file) that scripts the installation procedure for that component. INF Installer also edits the custom.inf file that batch.exe creates, so that custom.inf includes directions to install the new component(s).
<P>
If you are integrating an application, INF Installer adds an entry to the [Optional Components] section of custom.inf. If you are adding a network service, INF Installer modifies the Services entry in the [Network] section in custom.inf.
<P>
If you want to add a Hardware component to the setup.exe script:
<P>
<OL>

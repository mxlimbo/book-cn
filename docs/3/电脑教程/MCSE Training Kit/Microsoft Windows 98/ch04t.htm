<A NAME="205"><H2>IEEE 1394 Topology</H2></A><P>
IEEE 1394 uses a tree topology and a daisy chain topology (see Figure 4.4). Maximum distance between devices is 4.5 meters with a maximum of 16 hops between devices.

<A NAME="206"><H3>The IEEE 1394 Components</H3></A><P>
The four types of IEEE 1394 components include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Device
<P>
An input/output device (such as a computer, digital video recorder, or digital video camera) is attached to the bus. IEEE 1394 devices have two or more IEEE 1394 connectors that allow devices to be daisy-chained together.
<P>
<LI>Splitter
<P>
A splitter allows considerable flexibility in designing and implementing IEEE 1394 topology by providing extra IEEE 1394 ports.
<P>
<LI>Bridge
<P>
A bridge isolates data traffic within a specific area of the bus in much the same way as an Ethernet bridge.
<P>
<LI>Repeater
<P>
A repeater extends the distance between devices by retransmitting data signals across the bus in much the same way as an Ethernet repeater.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="207"><H3>Data Transfer Rates</H3></A><P>
IEEE 1394 currently supports the following bus speeds: 100 Mbps, 200 Mbps, and 400 Mbps. 800 Mbps transfer rates are currently in development. The IEEE 1394 specification accommodates different transfer rates simultaneously on the same bus. Like USB, IEEE 1394 supports both asynchronous and isochronous communication across the bus.

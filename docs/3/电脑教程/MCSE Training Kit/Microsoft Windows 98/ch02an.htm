<A NAME="69"><H1>Summary</H1></A><P>
The following information summarizes the key points in this chapter.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3>Preparing for Installation</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>Before installing Windows&#160;98 you should determine if your computer meets at least minimum requirements, such as processor, memory, and free disk space.
<P>
<LI>It is important to disable any software that can cause conflicts during Setup, such as anti-virus software and memory managers.
<P>
<LI>Windows&#160;98 can be dual booted with Windows&#160;NT or Windows&#160;3.1/MS-DOS, but not Windows&#160;95.
<P>
<LI>You can install Windows&#160;98 by upgrading an existing Windows&#160;95 or MS-DOS operating system. You also can install Windows&#160;98 on a newly formatted hard disk or to a new folder.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="71"><H3>Upgrading from Windows&#160;95</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>The Setup process is organized in five phases. In Phase 1&#151;Preparing to run Windows&#160;98 Setup, Setup checks for anti-virus software and prompts you to disable it in case any is found.
<P>
<LI>In Phase 2&#151;Collecting information about your computer, Setup runs ScanDisk, checks the registry for corrupt files, and prepares your Windows directory. Setup also prompts you to save your existing MS-DOS and Windows system files, and prompts you to create an Emergency Startup Disk.
<P>
<LI>In Phase 3&#151;Copying Windows&#160;98 files to your computer, Setup copies Windows&#160;98 files to your computer. No user input is required during the file-copying phase.
<P>
<LI>In Phase 4&#151;Restarting your computer, your computer is automatically restarted. Win.ini, System.ini, and registry files are edited to add Windows&#160;98-specific settings. Autoexec.bat and Config.sys are examined for TSRs and incompatible drivers.
<P>
<LI>In Phase 5&#151;Setting up hardware and finalizing settings, Setup detects Plug and Play devices and legacy hardware. Setup finalizes settings for system configuration, Control Panel, <B>Start</B> menu, Windows Help, and MS-DOS programs. Finally, Setup restarts your computer.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="72"><H3>Installing from MS-DOS</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>When you install Windows&#160;98 from MS-DOS, Setup follows the same five phases as upgrading from Windows, but some additional steps are added to the process.
<P>
<LI>In Phase 1&#151;Real-Mode ScanDisk runs and the Mini.cab file is copied.
<P>
<LI>In Phase 2&#151;you must choose the Install Directory, select Setup options, and supply user and computer information.
<P>
<LI>In Phase 4&#151;legacy hardware is detected.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="73"><H3>Automating Setup</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>Setup can be automated by using a setup script. A setup script is a text file that contains predefined settings for all of the options specified during Setup, and can contain instructions for installing additional hardware.
<P>
<LI>You can generate a script by installing Windows&#160;98 to a newly formatted hard disk and using a text editor to copy the [Setup] and [Optional Components] sections from the Setuplog.txt file, located in the root directory of the C drive. You also can edit scripts from previous Windows installs.
<P>
<LI>To run a Setup with a script, specify the path to the script file on the command line.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="74"><H3>Troubleshooting with Windows&#160;98 Setup</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>Failures can occur during installation of Windows&#160;98, and Setup uses different procedures to recover from a Setup failure, depending on the point where the failure occurs in the Setup process.
<P>
<LI>If failure occurs before the initial restart, you must turn your computer off and on and start Setup again.
<P>
<LI>If failure occurs during hardware detection, you must turn your computer off and on, and then use the Device Manager to determine which of your hardware components were detected.
<P>
<LI>Other installation support issues involve incompatible video drivers, extraneous copies of Setupx.dll remaining in memory, adding or removing installed components, interrupting file copying, and not disabling virus protection software.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="75"><H3>Uninstalling Windows&#160;98</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>It is possible to uninstall Windows&#160;98 and return your computer to its previous Windows&#160;95 configuration if you have clicked <B>Yes (recommended)</B> on the Save System Files screen during Setup, not compressed your system or boot partition after installing Windows&#160;98, and not converted any hard disks to FAT32.

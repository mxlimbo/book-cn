<A NAME="535"><H2>Troubleshooting TCP/IP</H2></A><P>
If you are having trouble connecting to your network or communicating with other computers, either on your network or on the Internet, there are two troubleshooting utilities you can use to test your TCP/IP configuration: the <B>ping </B>command or the <B>tracert</B> command.
<P>
<A NAME="536"><H3>Troubleshooting a Connection Using Ping</H3></A><P>
The <B>ping</B> command verifies a connection to a remote host by sending four (by default) ICMP echo packets to the host and listening for echo reply packets. The <B>ping </B>command waits for up to one second for each packet sent and prints the number of packets transmitted and received.
<P>
To test a connection, you can use the <B>ping</B> command with the following options:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>An IP address
<P>
<LI>A host name
<P>
<LI>A computer name
</UL>
<P>
If a <B>ping</B> to a remote host fails, try to ping your default gateway. If that also fails, either your default gateway is unavailable or your computer has an improperly configured IP address and/or subnet mask.
<P>
Three <B>ping</B> commands you can use are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>ping</B> <I>remote_gateway_IP_address </I>
<P>
<LI><B>ping</B> <I>remote_host_name</I>
<P>
<LI><B>ping</B> <B>localhost</B>
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="537"><H4>Localhost</H4></A><P>
You can verify that TCP/IP has initialized on your computer by typing<B> ping localhost</B>. Localhost is a reserved host name that maps to a reserved IP address (127.0.0.1) that represents your computer. When you type <B>ping localhost</B>, the messages are local to your computer; no packets are sent to the network.
<P>
If pinging localhost is successful, you receive four replies from IP address 127.0.0.1. If the <B>ping</B> command is unsuccessful you will receive a message that says localhost is unknown. If this happens, verify that you installed TCP/IP, and that you restarted the computer after the installation.
<P>
<A NAME="538"><H3>Troubleshooting a Connection Using Tracert</H3></A><P>
If you can ping your default gateway but not a remote host, try the <B>tracert</B> (trace route) command. The <B>tracert</B> command displays the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) and IP address of each gateway along the route to a remote host. The <B>tracert</B> commands you can use are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>tracert</B> <I>target_name</I>
<P>
<LI><B>tracert</B> <I>IP address</I>
</UL>
<P>
Document the information that the <B>tracert</B> command returns when the remote host is available. Later, if the remote host is not available, you can compare the information returned by <B>tracert</B> at that time to the original <B>tracert</B> report and determine which gateway is unavailable.
<P>

<B>Note</B>
<P>
If your organization uses a proxy server for access to the Internet, you may not be able to use <B>ping</B> or <B>tracert</B> for hosts outside of your intranet.

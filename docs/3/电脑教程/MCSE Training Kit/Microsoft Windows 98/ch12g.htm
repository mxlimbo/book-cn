<A NAME="518"><H2>Installing Network Protocols</H2></A><P>
In order for two computers to communicate on a network, they must use a common network protocol.
<P>
If you want to install a network protocol, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Open <B>Control Panel</B> and double-click the <B>Network</B> icon.
<P>
<LI>	On the <B>Configuration</B> tab click <B>Add</B>.
<P>
<LI>	In the <B>Select Network Component Type</B> dialog box, select <B>Protocol</B> and click <B>Add</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Select the <B>Manufacturer</B> and <B>Network Protocol</B> you want to add and click <B>OK </B>(see Figure 12.3).
</OL>

<P>
Windows&#160;98 can accommodate multiple protocols on a single computer including:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>NetBIOS Enhanced User Interface (NetBEUI)
<P>
<LI>Internetwork Packet Exchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange (IPX/SPX)
<P>
<LI>Microsoft Data-link Control (DLC)
<P>
<LI>Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
<P>
<LI>Fast Infrared Protocol
</UL>
<P>
<P>
In addition, Windows&#160;98 supports Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) using software components that are installed as protocols.
<P>
<A NAME="519"><H3>NetBEUI</H3></A><P>
NetBIOS Enhanced User Interface (NetBEUI) is a fast protocol often used in small networks. Because it does not support routing, NetBEUI is not appropriate for large networks. However, NetBEUI is easy to administer because it has no required configuration. For this reason, it is a good choice for small networks that do not use routers.
<P>
<A NAME="520"><H3>IPX/SPX-compatible Protocol</H3></A><P>
The Internetwork Packet Exchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange (IPX/SPX)-compatible protocol is a routable protocol primarily used in a Novell NetWare environment. Because IPX/SPX is not as fast or as universal as TCP/IP, another routable protocol, IPX/SPX is not recommended for use in a non-NetWare environment.
<P>
<A NAME="521"><H3>DLC</H3></A><P>
Microsoft Data-link Control (DLC) is used primarily to communicate with various IBM mainframe and AS/400 computers using the same network adapter architecture. You also can use DLC to print to printers connected directly to the network instead of to a port on a computer acting as a print server.
<P>
Although you can install DLC on a Windows&#160;98 computer, you cannot use it to communicate with other Windows&#160;98 computers.
<P>
Windows&#160;98 includes both 32-bit and 16-bit DLC drivers. If possible, you should use the 32-bit driver for increased performance and stability.
<P>
<A NAME="522"><H3>TCP/IP</H3></A><P>
The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) protocol suite is a set of standard protocols and utilities most often associated with the Internet. It is fully routable and is often used as a basis for wide area networks (WANs).
<P>
<A NAME="523"><H3>Fast Infrared Protocol</H3></A><P>
Fast infrared protocol can give a computer wireless LAN access. This protocol supports devices with a <I>throughput</I> of up to 4 Megabits per second (Mbps). Throughput is a measure of the data transfer rate through a typically complex communications system or of the data processing rate in a computer system.
<P>
<A NAME="524"><H3>ATM </H3></A><P>
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is a high-speed network technology capable of transmitting data, voice, and video traffic in real time using fixed-length packets transmitted over reserved network bandwidth.
<P>
ATM is a connection-based protocol and therefore must establish a connection before transmitting any data. Three components&#151;ATM Call Manager, ATM Emulated LAN, and ATM LAN Emulation Client&#151;provide a bridge between connectionless protocols such as TCP/IP and IPX and ATM, enabling them to function transparently over ATM networks.
<P>
<A NAME="525"><H4>ATM Call Manager</H4></A><P>
This level establishes the connection (initiates the call) and communicates with the switch (hardware that is analogous to a hub in an Ethernet environment). This level also is called the User Network Interface (UNI). Both the call manager and switch must conform to the same UNI specification, which in Windows&#160;98 is UNI 3.1.
<P>
<A NAME="526"><H4>ATM LAN Emulation Client</H4></A><P>
This core component of the ATM topology facilitates communication between the ATM driver and NDIS. Windows&#160;98 supports LAN Emulation (LANE) Client 1.0 specification, to which the switch also must conform.
<P>
<A NAME="527"><H4>ATM Emulated LAN</H4></A><P>
This layer is used to set up Virtual local area networks (LANs)&#151;VLANs. You can set up bridges to other network segments or partition part of the ATM network to form a smaller segment. For example, on a 10-machine, ATM-only network, you can set up a VLAN to include only five machines. You can then set up the Emulated LAN (ELAN) client to use only the machines listed in the VLAN.

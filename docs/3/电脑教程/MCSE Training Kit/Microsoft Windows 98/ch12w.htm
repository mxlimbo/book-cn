On a Microsoft network, you must have Client for Microsoft Networks installed in order to enable file and printer sharing. Client for Microsoft Networks is a 32-bit, protected-mode network client for Windows&#160;98 that provides network functionality for Microsoft operating systems.
<P>
After you have configured network connectivity, you can share resources among the Windows&#160;98 computers on your network by installing file and printer sharing for Microsoft Networks.
<P>
To install and configure a network printer, you follow many of the same steps that are required to set up a local printer. The primary difference is that you identify a network path instead of a local port for the networked printer.
<P>
By default, the Browse Master in a Windows&#160;98 workgroup will be the first computer that has File and Print Sharing enabled to initialize in that workgroup. However, you can also configure a Windows&#160;98 computer manually as the Browse Master.

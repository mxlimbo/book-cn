The OnNow initiative includes overall system power management, which encompasses BIOS support, specifications for peripheral devices, and design of applications that allow the system to go into a low power state.

<P>
The power management features in Windows&#160;98 will function with the legacy BIOS, but the legacy BIOS must implement the power management control.

<P>
Peripherals also participate in the overall power management structure. The operating system works with Win32 Driver Model (WDM) to control power management of individual devices. Peripheral devices must be constructed to specifications such as those for USB, IEEE 1394, and Human Input Devices in order for them to work in the OnNow structure.
<P>
In general, current applications assume that the computer is always turned on. When these applications are inactive, they can inadvertently keep the system from entering a lower power state. Also, applications that assume that the computer is always on may stop responding when the computer wakes up.
<P>
Although the operating system will perform most of the work for OnNow, applications must be designed for power management and Plug and Play to make the entire process appear seamless.

<A NAME="409"><H2>Using Dr. Watson</H2></A><P>
A General Protection Fault (GPF) is a computer condition that causes a Windows application to stop working. GPFs most commonly occur when an application tries to use memory assigned to another application.
<P>
Dr. Watson collects detailed information about the state of your system when a GPF occurs (see Figure 10.8). Dr. Watson intercepts the software fault, identifies the software that faulted, and offers a detailed description of the cause.

<P>
Dr. Watson stores the information it collects in a log file. The <B>Details</B> button in the dialog box that appears when a GPF occurs displays the same information on screen.
<P>

<B>Note</B>
<P>
You can enter information in the Dr. Watson dialog box about what you were doing when the problem occurred. Be sure to enter detailed information about the problem, such as the applications and processes that were running when the GPF occurred, to help technical support troubleshoot the problem.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<P>
This information is used by technical support engineers to troubleshoot GPFs. If you cannot determine the cause of persistent GPFs, you should generate a Dr. Watson log file and send it to technical support. By examining the log file, technical support may be able to help you determine the cause of the problem. 
<P>
If you want to start Dr. Watson, perform the following step:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Click Start, Run, and type drwatson.exe.
<P>
The Dr. Watson icon appears in the status bar portion of the taskbar. This indicates that Dr. Watson is monitoring the system for GPFs.
</OL>
<P>
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Note</B>
<P>
Dr. Watson must be running in order to capture information about any GPFs that occur.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<P>
When a GPF occurs, Dr. Watson generates a log file named Watson<I>xx</I>.wlg (where <I>xx</I> is a number). By default, Dr. Watson log files are saved to the C:\Windows\Drwatson folder.
<P>
The Dr. Watson <B>File</B> menu includes a <B>Save</B> option you can use to produce a log file manually. This is helpful in situations when you can reproduce the problem. In this situation, you would start Dr. Watson, save the snapshot of your system in a log file, reproduce the problem, and then save the log that results. Send both logs to technical support to give them a before and after view of your system.
<P>
You can customize the following options in Dr. Watson on the <B>View</B> menu through the <B>Options </B>button.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Log Files</B> configures the number of log entries to save, and designates the folder where they will be saved.
<P>
<LI><B>Disassembly</B> configures the number of CPU instructions and stack frames that are reported in the log file. Only configure these options if technical support requests a change in the setting.
<P>
<LI><B>View</B> sets the display to <B>Standard View</B> or <B>Advanced View </B>when you run Dr. Watson (see Figure 10.9).

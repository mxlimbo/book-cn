<A NAME="477"><H2>Using System File Checker</H2></A><P>
Troubleshooting system file problems can be a difficult task. Error messages that are generated due to missing or corrupt system files may be misleading and may not describe the problem properly.
<P>
System file problems can occur in several ways. For example, system file problems occur when:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Applications overwrite vital operating system files.
<P>
<LI>Users inadvertently delete vital files.
<P>
<LI>Disk errors corrupt system files.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="478"><H3>System File Checker</H3></A><P>
System File Checker facilitates troubleshooting and solving system file problems. System File Checker scans operating system files looking for incorrect version numbers, file corruption, and missing files. If any of these problems are identified, System File Checker prompts you to restore the original files.
<P>
If you want to use System File Checker, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Click <B>Start</B> and point to <B>Programs, Accessories, System Tools</B>, and then click <B>System Information</B>.
<P>
<LI>	On the <B>Tools </B>menu, click <B>System File Checker</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>Scan for altered files</B>, and then click <B>Start</B>.
<P>
</OL>
The <B>System File Checker</B> scans the system using a file called Default.sfc.
<P>
The Default.sfc file contains the following information about each system file:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Cyclical Redundancy Check (CRC)</I>. Windows&#160;98 adds a checksum to a file entry when it writes a file to disk. This data is used to see if the files have changed. For example, the sum of all binary ones and zeros in a file equals a specific number. If a CRC is performed on the file and the sum does not equal the checksum associated with the file, then the System File Checker determines that the file has changed.
<P>
When System File Checker detects a difference between the information in the Default.sfc and the file on the disk, a message box appears. If all the verification data matches except for the CRC<I>,</I> the message states that there are differences in the contents of the file and recommends that you restore the file.
<P>
<LI><I>Date, time, size, and version information (if applicable)</I>. If System File Checker determines a change in date, time, size, or version, then the <B>File Changed</B> dialog box appears and displays the information for each changed file.
</UL>
<P>
The following table describes the options that you can choose to update the file or the Default.sfc when System File Checker determines that a file changed.

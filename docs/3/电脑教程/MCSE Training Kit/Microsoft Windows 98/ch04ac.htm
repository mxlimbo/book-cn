Here are some recommendations for supporting Windows&#160;98 hardware:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Although in some cases Windows&#160;95 and Windows&#160;NT can share a single network adapter driver; this is due to each platform's mutual support of Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) and should not be confused with the Win32 Driver Model.
<P>
<LI>Windows&#160;98 power management features will work with a legacy BIOS, but the legacy BIOS must implement the power management control.
<P>
<LI>When using USBs, if the configuration includes cascading hubs (one hub plugged into another hub), make sure that USB supports the configuration according to the following guidelines:
<P>
<UL><LI>A bus-powered hub cannot be plugged into another bus-powered hub.
<P>
<LI>Bus-powered hubs can support no more than four downstream ports.
<P>
<LI>Bus-powered hubs cannot support any bus-powered device that draws more than 100 milliamps.
<P>
<LI>Hub cascade depth cannot exceed five tiers.
</UL>
<P>
<LI>When configuring your Windows&#160;98 computer for multiple displays, you must check that all display adapters meet specific hardware requirements.
<P>
<LI>When using multiple displays, the system BIOS picks the primary VGA display based on the PCI slot order, unless the BIOS offers an option for picking which device is to be treated as the VGA device. When using docking units, you cannot stop the VGA device.

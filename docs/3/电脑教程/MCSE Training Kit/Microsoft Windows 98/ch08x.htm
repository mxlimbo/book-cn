Here are some recommendations for installing, configuring, and managing local printers:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>When a printer is working correctly, make a record of the configuration settings. That way, if the printer is uninstalled, you can reinstall and reconfigure the printer quickly.
<P>
<LI>Create shortcuts for your printers on your desktop by dragging their icons from the Printers folder to the desktop. You can use this feature to print files quickly by dragging them to the printer shortcut.
<P>
<LI>If you have a printer that can print in two different formats (such as PCL and PostScript), use the Add Printer Wizard to set up the printer as two printers with different configurations and icons.
<P>
<LI>If you are preparing documents to be printed by an outside printing service, install a printer with a driver for the printing service's printer, and configure the printer to print to File.
<P>
<LI>Determine if your computer has an ECP and if your printer is an ECP device. If so, configure them appropriately to enable high-speed printing.

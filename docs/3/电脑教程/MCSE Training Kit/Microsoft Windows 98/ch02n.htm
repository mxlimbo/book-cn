<A NAME="99"><H2>Phase 4&#151;Restarting Your Computer</H2></A><P>
After the Windows&#160;98 files are copied to your computer, you are prompted to restart the computer. If you do not click <B>Restart</B> <B>Now</B>, Setup restarts your computer automatically after 15 seconds. After the computer restarts, the following real-mode Setup steps occur:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Win.ini, System.ini, and registry files are modified to add Windows&#160;98-specific settings.
<P>
<LI>	If the Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files exist, they are examined for incompatible device drivers and Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) programs as specified by entries in Setupc.inf located in the C:\Windows\Inf folder. A REM statement is added to any line in these files that contains a reference to an incompatible or unnecessary entry.
</OL>

<B>Note</B>
<P>
If you determine that any of your programs or hardware components do not run correctly after setting up Windows&#160;98, and the programs require specific entries in either the Config.sys or the Autoexec.bat file, you can restore them by deleting the REM on the specific command line. It is possible that restoring these files or commands may interfere with Windows&#160;98 functionality. In this case, contact the hardware or software manufacturer for a Windows&#160;98-compatible version.

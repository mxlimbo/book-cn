OnNow is a power management feature in Windows&#160;98 that allows the system to be turned on quickly through the use of power management techniques. The computer appears to be off when not in use but responds to wake-up events, such as a telephone ringing, or software that tells the computer to &quot;wake up&quot; at a specified time.
<P>
System requirements for OnNow include Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI). Peripherals must meet ACPI specifications, and applications must support power management and be Plug and Play-compatible.
<P>
To configure OnNow, use the Power Management icon in the Control Panel.

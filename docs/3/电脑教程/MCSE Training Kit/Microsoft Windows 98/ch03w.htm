DriveSpace&#160;3 is a Windows&#160;98 utility that can compress a FAT16 partition or floppy disk. DriveSpace&#160;3 cannot compress FAT32 partitions.
<P>
DriveSpace&#160;3 works by replacing duplicate data strings with tokens that take up less space than the duplicate data. DriveSpace&#160;3 also uses the sector as its allocation unit rather than the cluster, resulting in much less wasted space for small files.
<P>
There are four methods of compression, each posing different tradeoffs between speed and compression ratio. The four different methods are No Compression, Standard Compression, HiPack, and UltraPack.
<P>
DriveSpace&#160;3 enables you to create an empty compressed drive out of free space existing on a partition or compress a drive that already contains data.

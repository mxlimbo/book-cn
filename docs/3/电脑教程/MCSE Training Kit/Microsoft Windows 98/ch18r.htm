<A NAME="823"><H2>Configuring Multilink Connections</H2></A><P>
Windows&#160;98 Dial-Up Networking supports the Multilink Point-to-Point Protocol (MPPP). Multilink increases data transmission rates by combining multiple physical links into a logical bundle that increases bandwidth. Dial-Up Networking with Multilink can combine the following connection types on both clients and servers:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Analog modem connections
<P>
<LI>ISDN connections
<P>
<LI>Mixed analog and digital connections
</UL>
<P>
A client with an ISDN adapter and with access to both 64 Kbps B channels can use Multilink to establish a single 128 Kbps connection to a Multilink server. This speeds access to the Internet or to an intranet and reduces the time required for remote connection, which can reduce the cost of remote access. Both the Dial-Up Networking client and the server must have Multilink enabled.
<P>
To configure Multilink in Windows&#160;98, you must modify the properties of a Dial-Up Networking connection. If you want to configure Multilink, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	In the <B>Dial-Up Networking </B>folder, right click the connection for which you want to configure Multilink, then click <B>Properties</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Click the <B>Multilink</B> tab.
<P>
<LI>	Select <B>Use additional devices</B>, and then click <B>Add</B>.
<P>
<LI>	In the <B>Edit Extra Device</B> dialog box, select the additional device and enter the telephone number of the server that this device will use.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>OK</B>, and then click <B>OK </B>again.
</OL>

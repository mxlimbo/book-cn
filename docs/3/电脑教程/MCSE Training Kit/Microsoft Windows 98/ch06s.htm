You can add or remove Windows&#160;98 components at any time with the <B>Windows Setup</B> tab of the <B>Add/Remove Programs Properties</B> sheet (see Figure 6.9), which you access by through the <B>Add/Remove Programs</B> icon in Control Panel. The list of components displays checks in the boxes of installed components. If a checked box is shaded, it means that only some of the available components in that category are installed.

<P>
You can select some or all components from each category to add or remove. You need the original Windows&#160;98 compact disc or network-shared installation files to add components. You may have to restart your computer following the installation, depending on the software added. Shortcuts to the added or removed items are automatically updated on your <B>Start</B> menu.

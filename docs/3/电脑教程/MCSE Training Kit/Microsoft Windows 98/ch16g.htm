<A NAME="696"><H2>Why Use System Policies?</H2></A><P>
As a support professional, you have numerous methods available to help you manage the computers for which you are responsible. For example, to control the registry of a local or remote computer with Windows&#160;98, you could choose to use system policies and the System Policy Editor, or the Registry Editor, or mandatory user profiles.
<P>
<A NAME="697"><H3>System Policy Editor or Registry Editor?</H3></A><P>
Both System Policy Editor and Registry Editor allow you to gain access to a remote computer's registry. System Policy Editor provides access to a subset of keys, while Registry Editor provides access to the entire registry.
<P>
System Policy Editor has two modes: Policy Mode, which you use to edit policies that will apply when the user logs on to the network, and Registry Mode, which you use to edit the registry of a local or remote computer directly.
<P>
Unlike Registry Editor, however, changes you make to the registry with System Policy Editor while in Registry Mode do not take effect until you save the changes and close System Policy Editor.
<P>
<A NAME="698"><H3>System Policies or Mandatory User Profiles?</H3></A><P>
You can use either mandatory user profiles or system policies to establish user settings. The two features differ in the following ways:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>System policies can establish user-specific and computer-specific settings. Mandatory user profiles can establish only user-specific settings.
<P>
<LI>You selectively determine a subset of user settings to control with system policies, and each user controls the remaining settings. Mandatory user profiles always control every user-specific setting.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="699"><H3>Should You Implement System Policies?</H3></A><P>
Your individual circumstances will determine whether it is necessary for you to control the configurations for multiple computers, and, if so, to what extent and with which method. When making your decision, consider the system configurations you want to enforce, the individuals who can administer system policies, and how you can simplify your management of network groups with system policies.
<P>
<A NAME="700"><H3>Enforce System Configuration</H3></A><P>
You can restrict what users are allowed to do from the desktop and what they are allowed to configure using Control Panel. Also, you can use system policies to configure network settings centrally, such as the network client configuration options and the ability to install or configure File and Print Sharing services. Finally, you can use policies to customize certain parts of the desktop, such as Network Neighborhood or the Programs folder.
<P>
<A NAME="701"><H3>Limit System Policy Authority</H3></A><P>
You can use System Policy Editor to change many common registry settings for an individual computer, either local or remote. You can use these settings in a system policy file to change registry values on multiple computers. Because of the complexity and importance of registry settings, you should ensure that the authority to create and apply system policies is limited to the network system administrator and other designated individuals who have the technical competence to manage system policies.
<P>
<A NAME="702"><H3>Apply to Network Groups</H3></A><P>
You can use group policies to define a set of Windows&#160;98 system policies for Windows&#160;98 users in groups as defined on a NetWare or Windows&#160;NT network. Group policies make management on the corporate network easier, by making use of the current administrative organization of users.

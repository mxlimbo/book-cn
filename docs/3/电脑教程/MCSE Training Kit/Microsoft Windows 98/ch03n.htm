FAT16 and FAT32 are two file systems supported by Windows&#160;98. FAT32 offers some advantages over FAT16, including support for partitions up to 2 terabytes, and support for smaller-sized clusters, resulting in a more efficient use of disk space. FAT32, however, does not support file compression and may not be compatible with older disk utilities.
<P>
You can use FDISK (included with Windows&#160;98) to create either FAT16 or FAT32 partitions. You can use the Drive Converter (FAT32) Wizard to convert a FAT16 partition to a FAT32 partition.

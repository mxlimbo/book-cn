You can configure your software environment by adding or removing components and applications with the Add/Remove Programs Properties sheet. The Windows Setup tab allows you to add and remove components, while the Install/Uninstall tab allows you to add and remove applications.
<P>
When you remove programs with <B>Add/Remove</B>, their entries in the registry are marked as deleted. Once a day upon startup, Microsoft Registry Checker scans and backs up the registry. If Registry Checker contains 500K or more of keys marked as deleted, it will optimize the registry the next time you start your computer.

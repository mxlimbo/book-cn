From here you can search through technical support articles for a particular topic or search through a glossary of terms. Windows Update Technical Support is also available through the Windows Help toolbar or through a Windows&#160;98 Troubleshooter.
<P>
Troubleshooters are interactive help files that ask particular questions about problems you are experiencing. If a Troubleshooter cannot solve your problem, it directs you to the Support Online site where you can research the problem more thoroughly. Troubleshooters are available in Windows Help on the Contents tab under Troubleshooting.

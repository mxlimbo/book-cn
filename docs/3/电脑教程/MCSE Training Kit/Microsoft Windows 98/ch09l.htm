In order to record the disk access patterns of programs during their startup, Windows&#160;98 uses a process called Task Monitor. Task Monitor automatically monitors programs you use and records their disk access patterns during their start. These records, called log files, are stored in the C:\Windows\Applog directory. In addition to access patterns, Task Monitor also records the number of times you use programs. Usage information enables Disk Defragmenter to favor more frequently used programs in optimizing the disk.
<P>
The format of the log file name is <I>application</I>.<I>lgn</I>, where <I>application</I> is the name of the application and <I>n</I> is the drive letter where the application resides. For example, the log file for Microsoft Word on drive C would be Word.lgc.

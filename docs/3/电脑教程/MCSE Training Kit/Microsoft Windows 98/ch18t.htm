Dial-Up Server provides single caller access to a Windows&#160;98 computer through Dial-Up Networking. You must use either the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) or Asynchronous NetBEUI protocol and connect from a computer running one of the following operating systems:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Windows&#160;98
<P>
<LI>Windows&#160;NT
<P>
<LI>Windows&#160;95
<P>
<LI>Windows for Workgroups
<P>
<LI>Workgroup Add-on for MS-DOS
<P>
<LI>LAN Manager
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="828"><H3>Installing and Configuring a Dial-Up Server</H3></A><P>
Although Windows&#160;98 automatically installs dial-up networking along with other communications tools when you set up the operating system, you must install Dial-Up Server manually (see Figure 18.11).

<P>
If you want to set up a Dial-Up Server, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	In <B>Control Panel</B>, double-click <B>Add/Remove Programs</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Click the <B>Windows Setup</B> tab.
<P>
<LI>	Select <B>Communications</B>, and then click <B>Details</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Click the <B>Dial-Up Server</B> listing to select it and click <B>OK</B>.
<P>
After you install Dial-Up Server, you can configure it by choosing <B>Dial-Up Server</B> from the <B>Connections</B> menu of the <B>Dial-Up Networking</B> folder.
<P>
<LI>	From the <B>Dial-Up Networking</B> folder, open the <B>Connections</B> menu and select <B>Dial-Up Server</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Choose one of the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>No caller access.
<P>
<LI>Allow caller access. If you choose this option, click <B>Change Password</B> to create or change a password for the connection.
</UL>
<P>
<LI>	If desired, add a comment.
<P>
<LI>	To check or change the server type, click <B>Server Type</B>.
<P>
On the <B>Server Type</B> tab, you can specify Type of Dial-Up Server, either PPP or Asynchronous NetBEUI (Windows for Workgroups and Windows&#160;NT 3.1) manually. Selecting <B>Default</B> allows the client and server to negotiate a protocol, attempting PPP first, then NetBEUI. PPP supports both NetBEUI and IPX/SPX-compatible protocols.
<P>
<LI>	You can also choose to enable software compression and require an encrypted password.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>OK</B>, and then click <B>OK</B> again.
</OL>

<B>Note</B>
<P>
Windows&#160;98 Dial-Up Server does not support TCP/IP. To host remote connections to your intranet, use a Windows&#160;NT Remote Access Service (RAS) server.

<P>
<A NAME="829"><H3>Securing a Dial-Up Server</H3></A><P>
The type of security available for Dial-Up Networking depends on the type of access control used on the computer that has Dial-Up Server enabled.
<P>
On a computer with share-level access control, you can assign a password to Dial-Up Server. Any user who knows the password for the server will be able to connect to it.
<P>
If you are connected to a Windows&#160;NT domain controller or to a NetWare server that authenticates requests, you can use user-level access control. You can assign remote access permissions to specific users. The user must enter a user name and password as defined on your computer's security provider in order to establish the connection.
<P>
With both share-level and user-access controls, you can require encrypted passwords from clients. Encrypted password authentication uses the Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP). A <I>handshake</I> is a series of signals acknowledging that communication or the transfer of information can take place between computers or other devices. With CHAP, the server uses a handshake to verify the identity of the client without sending the password across the link.
<P>
<A NAME="830"><H4>A CHAP Logon</H4></A><P>
In a CHAP logon process, the server sends a random challenge message to the client. The client encrypts the challenge using its password as the encryption key and returns the challenge to the server. The server then compares the returned value with the sent value; a match means the remote user entered the correct user name and password combination and is allowed to log on. Because the challenge message changes each time a user logs on, and because the password itself is never sent over the link, CHAP is a safe method of user authentication.

<B>Tip</B>
<P>
Windows&#160;98 Dial-Up Server does not support Multilink. Users who want Multilink capabilities for their dial-up servers must use Windows&#160;NT 4.0.

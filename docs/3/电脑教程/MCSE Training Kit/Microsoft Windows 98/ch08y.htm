The following information summarizes the key points in this chapter:
<P>
<A NAME="371"><H3>The Windows&#160;98 Print Subsystem</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>Windows&#160;98 implements printing using a 32-bit print subsystem that includes a multithread, preemptive spooler architecture. Subsystem components include the graphical device interface, raw or EMF files, the print spooler, and the print processor.
<P>
<LI>Some printers support bi-directional parallel communications, in which the printer driver can query the printer automatically and configure it based on the printer's capabilities and limitations.
<P>
<LI>Deferred printing enables you to store a print job on your computer's local hard disk. You can print the document later without opening the application.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="372"><H3>Installing a Local Printer</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>There are two ways to install local printers in Windows&#160;98: automatically through Plug and Play detection, or by using the Add Printer Wizard.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="373"><H3>Configuring and Managing  a Local Printer</H3></A><P>

<A NAME="804"><H2>Installing and Configuring ISDN Adapters</H2></A><P>
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a high-speed digital service capable of transmitting voice, video, audio, and data over a single line.
<P>
ISDN is built on two main types of communications channels: a B channel, which carries data, and a D channel, which carries control information (see Figure 18.3). For example, a Basic Rate Interface (BRI) connection uses two B channels, which transmit at 64 kilobits per second (Kbps) and one D channel, which transmits at 16 Kbps. This enables you to conduct a voice conversation over one channel and use another device, such as a computer or fax machine, to send or receive data over the other channel.

<P>
If you have access to ISDN service, you can set up Dial-Up Networking to use ISDN. To configure ISDN in Windows&#160;98, you must install an ISDN adapter and run the ISDN Configuration Wizard.
<P>
<A NAME="805"><H3>Installing an ISDN Adapter</H3></A><P>
If your adapter is Plug and Play-compatible, Windows&#160;98 will detect your ISDN adapter, and automatically install the required support. You can install a non-Plug and Play ISDN adapter using the Add New Hardware Wizard, and use the manufacturer's driver disk, if necessary. You can also install the ISDN adapter as a Network component.

<P>
If you want to install an ISDN adapter using Network Properties, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	In <B>Control Panel</B>, double-click <B>Network</B>.
<P>
<LI>	On the <B>Configuration</B> tab of the <B>Network </B>dialog box, click <B>Add</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Select <B>Adapter</B>, and then click <B>Add</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Select the manufacturer and model for your ISDN adapter, and then click <B>OK </B>(see Figure 18.4).
</OL>
<P>
After you install your ISDN adapter, the ISDN Configuration Wizard starts automatically. It will then prompt you for the following information, which is available from your ISDN provider:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Switch protocol
<P>
<LI>Telephone numbers and Service Profile Identification (SPID) numbers
</UL>
<P>
ISDN uses a Service Profile Identifier (SPID) to identify the wide range of devices and telephone numbers the ISDN line accommodates. SPIDs are optional. If the ISDN provider determines that a SPID is required, the provider assigns one or more SPIDs to each application on the ISDN line.
<P>
ISDN drivers from the ISDN 1.0 Accelerator Pack are <I>not</I> supported in Windows&#160;98. Contact your ISDN adapter's manufacturer if you require updated drivers.

<B>Important</B>
<P>
Many vendors bundle the ISDN 1.1 (or 1.0) Accelerator Pack with drivers for Windows&#160;95, rather than Windows&#160;98. The vendor installation may overwrite some of the Windows&#160;98 system files and cause the system to malfunction. If this occurs, remove all Dial-Up Networking components, restart your computer, and then reinstall all components <I>except</I> your ISDN adapter.

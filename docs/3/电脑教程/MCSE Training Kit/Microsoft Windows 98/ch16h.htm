<A NAME="703"><H2>How Do You Implement System Policies?</H2></A><P>
In order to implement system policies successfully with Windows&#160;98, you will need to plan your approach, install your tools, create a policy file, and load the policy file in the proper location.
<P>
<A NAME="704"><H3>Plan Your Approach</H3></A><P>
Before deciding to implement system policies, you should consider the following issues:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>What types of restrictions and settings would you like to define and manage centrally? For example, do you want to limit access to the MS-DOS prompt and other applications, or to Control Panel options, or do you want to implement a standard desktop for all users?
<P>
<LI>Do you want to use one set of standard settings for all users and computers, or do you want to customize settings by groups of users? Also, do you want to maintain individual settings for users and computers? Typically, you customize settings by groups, where the majority of users are in groups (such as Accounting, Marketing, and so on) and a small group of individuals (such as administrators) have special privileges. If you want to apply group policies, you must install group policy support.
<P>
<LI>Do you want user system policies? If so, you must enable user profiles on the computers running Windows&#160;98, and ensure those computers use 32-bit, protected-mode network clients.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="705"><H3>Install the Necessary Files</H3></A><P>
You must use System Policy Editor to create system policies. System Policy Editor (Poledit.exe) is an administrative tool included on the Windows&#160;98 installation disk in the \tools\reskit\netadmin\poledit folder. It does not install automatically during Windows&#160;98 setup. You must install it through the Add/Remove Programs icon in Control Panel. You will learn the procedure for installing the System Policy Editor later in this chapter.
<P>
You must install group policy support (Grouppol.dll) on each computer that you use to create group policies and on each computer to which those policies will apply. You can install group policy support with a custom Windows&#160;98 installation or through the <B>System Tools </B>category of components on the <B>Windows Setup </B>tab.
<P>
<A NAME="706"><H3>Create a Policy File</H3></A><P>
Use System Policy Editor to create a new policy file. Add users, groups, and computers as appropriate. If you are going to use the policy file on a network in the default location, you must name the file Config.pol. If you plan to set a manual path for the policy file, you can use any 8.3 filename with a *.pol extension.
<P>
<A NAME="707"><H3>Establish Policy Locations</H3></A><P>
The path Windows&#160;98 searches for system policy files depends on the primary network logon setting of the computer. System policies for a computer on a Novell NetWare network must be saved in a different location than system policies for a computer on a Windows&#160;NT domain. You may want to apply a system policy file to a computer that is in a stand-alone configuration. The location for each of these configurations is explained later in this chapter.

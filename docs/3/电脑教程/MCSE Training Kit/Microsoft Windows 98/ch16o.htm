System Policy Editor enables you to establish computer configurations for users, groups, and computers by selecting registry settings that will overwrite previous settings.
<P>
A user system policy applies registry settings when a specific user logs on. Group policies make it possible to add specific restrictions to Windows&#160;NT Directory Services (NTDS) global groups or NetWare groups. Computer policies define settings for a default computer or for specifically named computers. The default computer settings apply when a user logs on to a computer that does not have individual policies assigned.
<P>
System Policy Editor displays a template of a policy file as a graphical list of the settings you can control, with check boxes you mark to indicate whether that setting should be included in the policy or removed from the policy.

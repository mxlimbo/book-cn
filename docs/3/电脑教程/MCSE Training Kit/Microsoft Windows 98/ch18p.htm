<A NAME="820"><H2>Configuring Server Types and Protocols</H2></A><P>
To configure a Dial-Up Networking client, you choose the server type and protocol for the system into which you are dialing You can also configure advanced options that determine how you log on to the network, whether you use compression for data transmissions, and whether you require encrypted passwords. In addition, you can configure TCP/IP settings for each connection (see&#160;Figure&#160;18.8).

<P>
If you want to configure Dial-Up Networking server types and protocols, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	From the <B>Dial-Up Networking</B> folder, right-click the connection you want to configure, and click <B>Properties</B>.
<P>
<LI>	On the <B>Server Types</B> tab, select the server type you want from the drop-down list box.
<P>
<LI>	Configure the <B>Advanced options</B> settings (see the table below for a definition of these settings).
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>TCP/IP Settings</B> to configure these settings.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>OK</B>.

<A NAME="821"><H3>TCP/IP Settings</H3></A><P>
If you are using the TCP/IP protocol, you can configure TCP/IP settings for each connection. You can configure the following options:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Specify an IP Address</B>: By default, your Windows&#160;98 DUN client will receive a <B>Server-assigned IP address</B>. Windows&#160;NT Remote Access Service (RAS) servers can assign addresses, or they can relay the address request to a DHCP server. As an option, you can <B>specify an IP address</B>, which will always be used for that connection.
<P>
<LI><B>Specify Name Server Addresses</B>: By default, your Windows&#160;98 DUN client will receive <B>Server-assigned name server addresses</B>. Windows&#160;NT RAS servers can assign name server addresses by obtaining the information from a DHCP server. Optionally, you may choose to <B>Specify name server addresses</B>, up to two each for DNS and WINS.
</UL>
<P>
You can also configure two optional parameters:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Use IP header compression</B>: Improves performance by enabling negotiation and support of IP header compression. This option is enabled by default.
<P>
<LI><B>Use default gateway on remote network</B>: Temporarily (as long as the connection is active) configures the RAS server as your client's default gateway, rather than the one configured in the <B>Network</B> option of Control Panel.

<A NAME="387"><H2>Using Disk Cleanup</H2></A><P>
Disk Cleanup is a utility introduced in Windows&#160;98 to remove temporary and deleted files from a hard disk. Disk Cleanup automates the maintenance task of deleting excess files. You customize Disk Cleanup with a wizard that lists ways to free disk space, including emptying the Recycle bin, removing old temporary files, and emptying the Internet cache (see Figure 9.2).
<P>
Run Disk Cleanup periodically to maintain system performance, when a disk is nearly full, and before running Disk Defragmenter.

You can also use Disk Cleanup to regain disk space on any hard drive. If you want to run Disk Cleanup, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Double-click <B>My Computer</B> on the desktop.
<P>
<LI>	Right-click the <B>drive C</B> icon.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>Properties</B> to see the <B>(C:)</B> <B>Properties </B>dialog box.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>Disk Cleanup</B>. 
<P>
Disk Cleanup calculates the space that can be freed, and then the <B>Disk Cleanup for (C:)</B> dialog box appears.
</OL>
<P>
The <B>Disk Cleanup</B> dialog box has three tabs, <B>Disk Cleanup</B>, <B>More Options</B>, and <B>Settings</B>. The <B>Disk Cleanup</B> tab shows the following information:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The total disk space that can be freed on the identified disk drive.
<P>
<LI><I>Files to delete</I>. A checkbox shows the following file types, and the disk space used by the files. When you select a checkbox, it marks that file type to remove from memory.

<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Windows components</I> frees disk space by removing Windows&#160;98 optional components. This starts <B>Add/Remove Programs</B> from Control Panel, with the Windows Setup tab selected.
<P>
<LI><I>Installed programs</I> frees disk space by removing programs that are infrequently used. This starts <B>Add/Remove Programs</B> from Control Panel, with the Install/Uninstall tab selected.
<P>
<LI><I>Drive Conversion (FAT32)</I> creates more space on the hard drive by converting from FAT16 to FAT32. This starts the <B>Drive Converter (FAT32) </B>wizard.
</UL>
<P>
The <B>Settings</B> tab controls whether the Disk Cleanup wizard is to appear when a user is running out of hard disk space. If active, when you copy or save a file to a hard disk and the disk has less than 3 percent of its space left, Windows&#160;98 shows a warning and starts the Disk Cleanup utility.

<A NAME="715"><H2>Using Templates for System Policies</H2></A><P>
System Policy Editor displays a template of a policy file as a graphical list of the settings you can control, with check boxes you mark to indicate whether that setting should be included in the policy or removed from the policy. Policy templates (*.adm files) determine the scope of a system policy file. The template controls which policy settings you can enable or modify.

<A NAME="716"><H3>Default Templates</H3></A><P>
When System Policy Editor starts, it loads the default policy templates (Common.adm and Windows.adm) from the C:\Windows\inf folder. You can use this template to create and modify a system policy file (see Figure 16.3), or you can open other templates through the <B>Options </B>menu in the System Policy Editor.
<P>
Several other templates are installed in the C:\Windows\inf folder, such as a policy file for controlling settings in Outlook Explorer (Oem.adm). Each template controls settings for different components of Windows&#160;98. You can also create custom templates using a text editor.

System Policy Editor opens templates in either Policy File Mode or Registry Mode. When you open a policy in Policy File Mode, you create and modify system policies for implementation on other computers. This is an indirect edit of the registry, and does not apply changes until users log on after you save the policy file and copy it to the appropriate network server locations. <B>New Policy</B> or <B>Open</B> <B>Policy</B> on the <B>File</B> menu opens a system policy in Policy File Mode.
<P>
When you open a policy in Registry Mode, you edit the registry of the local or a remote computer. This is a direct edit of the User.dat and System.dat files. Changes made to the registry with System Policy Editor do not take effect until you save the changes and close System Policy Editor.
<P>
<B>Open Registry</B> opens a system policy in Registry Mode for the local computer. <B>Connect</B> on the <B>File</B> menu opens a system policy in Registry Mode for a remote computer.

<B>Caution</B>
<P>
If a registry entry is defined in the template but not in the registry itself, System Policy Editor displays the default value from the template as if it were actually reading the value from the registry. There is no way to verify in System Policy Editor whether a value is in the registry or in the template.

<A NAME="717"><H3>Template Option States</H3></A><P>
The System Policy Editor lists the available settings from the template with check boxes for configuring each option.
<P>
<TABLE WIDTH="95%" BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="5">

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>Option State</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>Means The Option Is</B></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Box with check mark</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Selected. Implements this option in a policy, changing the state of the user's computer to conform to the policy when the user logs on. If the option was previously checked the last time the user logged on, Windows&#160;98 makes no changes.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Shaded box</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Unavailable. The setting is unchanged from the last time the user logged on, and Windows&#160;98 will make no related modifications to the system configuration. 
<P>The unavailable state ensures that Windows&#160;98 provides quick processing at system startup because it does not need to process each entry each time a user logs on.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
If a setting requires additional information, an edit control appears at the bottom of the <B>Properties</B> dialog box. For example, if you select <B>Wallpaper</B> in the <B>Desktop</B> <B>Display </B>settings, the controls to select the type of wallpaper and to set it as tiled appear.
<P>
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Caution</B>
<P>
If you set an option by selecting it, and then change your mind and clear the option, you can destroy the user's previous configuration. A cleared option removes the specified setting from the registry. If you decide not to set a particular policy option, make sure the check box is marked as &quot;Unavailable&quot; so that the configuration for that setting is unchanged.

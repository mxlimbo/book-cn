In Windows&#160;98, there are several significant enhancements to the user interface, including improvements to the Start menu, the Taskbar, and a new, single Explorer that combines the functions of Windows Explorer and Internet Explorer.
<P>
The Start menu now includes Windows Update, a web site that contains useful links such as software updates, technical support, and feedback to the Web site itself. The Settings and Find menus have also been improved.
<P>
Enhancements to the Taskbar include multiple toolbars, which can be customized by the user and placed anywhere on the desktop.
<P>
One of the most dramatic improvements to the user interface is the single Explorer, a utility that allows you to navigate between local, network, Internet, and intranet content with a single click.

You can use the Microsoft System Information utility to diagnose and solve system problems. For example, if you have display problems, use the System Information utility to determine the type of display adapter on your computer and the video device drivers that are loaded.
<P>
The System Information utility collects information from the following sources:
<P>

<P>
<LI>Config.sys
<P>
<LI>the operating system
<P>
This includes verifying which 16-bit and 32-bit dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) and software programs have been loaded.

System Information displays a brief summary of information about your computer. The left pane (see Figure 9.1) displays three categories of information: Hardware Resources, Components,  and  Software Environment.

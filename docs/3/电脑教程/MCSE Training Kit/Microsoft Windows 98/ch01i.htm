<TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>Feature </B></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>Description</B></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) 5.0</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">NDIS makes it possible for any transport protocol to communicate with any network adapter card. NDIS 5.0 adds enhancements to the existing NDIS specification, such as the ability to automatically rebind when changing network cable types and support for OnNow and ACPI.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Windows Sockets 2.0 (WinSock 2.0)</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Provides concurrent access to multiple network transports. Unlike version 1.1, which focused on TCP/IP, the new API is transport-independent.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Web-based Enterprise Management (WBEM)</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Enables management of enterprise networks using a Web browser. WBEM allows disparate networks, applications, desktops, and systems management tools to work together. WBEM enables development of tools that reduce the complexity and costs of enterprise management.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Allows the user to request a level of network bandwidth for complex data such as audio and video.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Provides high-speed, fully digital transmission of a variety of data over a single line.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">PPP Multilink Protocol</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Increases bandwidth by combining multiple physical links, such as utilizing the bandwidth of two or more modems.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) and virtual private networking (VPN)</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">PPTP can be used to create virtual private networks. In the past, connecting remote offices and users to a corporate network required either paying long distance charges or purchasing leased lines. It is now possible to use communications bandwidth on the Internet to provide this connectivity. A VPN, using a public network, provides a level of security equal to or greater than that provided by a private phone call or leased line.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Infrared Data Association (IrDA) protocol version 3.0</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Allows communication links over infrared transmissions.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Distributed File System </TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Compiles and displays network data in a single logical structure, no matter where the data is stored.</TD>

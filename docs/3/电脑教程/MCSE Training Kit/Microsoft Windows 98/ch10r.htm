The Windows&#160;98 boot process occurs in the following distinct stages: BIOS Bootstrap, Master Boot Record (MBR) and Boot Sector, Real Mode Boot, Real Mode Configuration, and Protected Mode Load.
<P>
You can control the boot process by editing the Options section of Msdos.sys in any text editor. With System Configuration Utility, you can backup and edit system files, and control and troubleshoot startup.
<P>
The Windows&#160;98 Startup menu provides a number of options to assist you in troubleshooting the boot process. For example, you can start your computer in safe mode, which loads only the mouse, keyboard, standard VGA, and other drivers that Device Manager needs to function.
<P>
On Startup, Windows&#160;98 can create a file called Bootlog.txt that records events that occur during the boot process. Use the Bootlog.txt file to diagnose driver load failures and driver initialization failures.

A virtual machine environment, from the application's perspective, looks as if it is a separate computer, complete with all of the resources available on the physical computer. Win32- and Win16-based applications run within the System Virtual Machine. Win32-based applications each run in a separate virtual machine within the System Virtual Machine, while all Win16-based applications run together in a shared virtual machine within the System Virtual Machine. Each MS-DOS-based application runs in its own virtual machine.

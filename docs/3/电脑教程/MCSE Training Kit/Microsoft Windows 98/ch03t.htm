Disk compression shrinks data to reduce the space necessary to store it. Windows&#160;98 includes the DriveSpace&#160;3 compression engine and provides support for partitions that have been compressed with the Windows&#160;95 DriveSpace compression engine.
<P>
DriveSpace&#160;3 is an enhancement to the DriveSpace compression engine that was included in Windows&#160;95. DriveSpace&#160;3 became available in Windows&#160;95 (OSR2) and Microsoft Plus! For Windows&#160;95.
<P>
This lesson provides an overview of disk compression. It also discusses how to manage and tune your compressed disks for optimum performance.

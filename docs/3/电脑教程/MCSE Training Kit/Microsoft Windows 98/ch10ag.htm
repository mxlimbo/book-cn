<A NAME="418"><H1>Summary</H1></A><P>
The following information summarizes the key points in this chapter:
<P>
<A NAME="419"><H3>Preparing for Troubleshooting</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>Windows Registry Checker is a Windows-based program that scans and backs up the following files: User.dat, System.dat, Win.ini, and System.ini. The scan occurs automatically when the system is idle, and when configuration changes are made.
<P>
<LI>Microsoft Registry Checker is an MS-DOS-based program that scans the system configuration for errors. If errors are found it restores a good copy of the User.dat, System.dat, Win.ini, and System.ini files.
<P>
<LI>An Emergency Startup Disk (ESD) is a floppy disk containing utilities you can use to start and troubleshoot a malfunctioning system. You should create an ESD during Windows&#160;98 installation. You can also create an ESD with the Add/Remove Programs icon in Control Panel.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="420"><H3>Controlling and Troubleshooting the Boot Process</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>The Windows&#160;98 boot process occurs in the following stages: BIOS Bootstrap, Master Boot Record (MBR) and Boot Sector, Real Mode Boot, Real Mode Configuration, and Protected Mode Load.
<P>
<LI>You can control the boot process by editing the Options section of Msdos.sys in any text editor. With System Configuration Utility, you can backup and edit system files, and control and troubleshoot startup.
<P>
<LI>The Windows&#160;98 Startup menu provides a number of options to assist you in troubleshooting the boot process. For example, you can start your computer in safe mode, which loads only the mouse, keyboard, standard VGA, and other drivers that Device Manager needs to function.
<P>
<LI>On Startup, Windows&#160;98 creates a file called Bootlog.txt that records events that occur during the boot process. Use the Bootlog.txt file to diagnose driver load failures and driver initialization failures.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="421"><H3>Resolving Hardware Conflicts</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>Windows&#160;98 provides the Startup and Shutdown Troubleshooter, the Hardware Conflict Troubleshooter, and Troubleshooters for networking, modem, printing, PC cards, sound, and memory.
<P>
<LI>Device Manager lists all of the installed devices on your computer and provides information about the status, driver, and resources for each device.
<P>
<LI>The Automatic Skip Driver Agent (ASD) identifies drivers that fail to load or operations that fail at startup. ASD marks the failed device or operation to be bypassed on subsequent startups.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="422"><H3>Resolving Software Problems</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>System File Checker is a Windows&#160;98 utility that verifies the integrity of your operating system files and attempts to restore corrupted files by extracting them from your original Windows&#160;98 installation source.
<P>
<LI>Version Conflict Manager saves files overwritten by newer versions of the file. During Windows&#160;98 installation, Windows&#160;98 overwrites duplicate files, even if they are newer than those of the installation source. If you experience problems with an application after Windows&#160;98 has installed an older file, you can use Version Conflict Manager to restore the newer version of the file.
<P>
<LI>A General Protection Fault (GPF) is a computer condition that causes a Windows application to stop responding. When a GPF occurs, Dr. Watson collects detailed information about the state of your system, intercepts the software faults, identifies the software that faulted, and offers a detailed description of the cause.

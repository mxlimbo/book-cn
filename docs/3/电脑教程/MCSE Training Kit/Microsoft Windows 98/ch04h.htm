<A NAME="192"><H1>Lesson 2: Using OnNow Power Management</H1></A><P>
Computers built today use more power than computers built in the early 1980s. The newer computers operate at faster speeds and include more peripherals. Prior to OnNow power management, you had to turn off the computer completely to reduce its power usage. This was inconvenient for computers that were in constant use. The OnNow design initiative is a comprehensive, system-wide approach to system and device power control. The initiative describes a computer that appears to be off, but is actually on and able to respond immediately to system requests.
<P>
This lesson presents the functions of an OnNow-enabled computer, the requirements for OnNow power management, and how power management is configured on a computer running Windows&#160;98.

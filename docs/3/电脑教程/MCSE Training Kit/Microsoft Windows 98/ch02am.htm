Here are some recommendations for installing Windows&#160;98:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Verify that your hardware meets at least minimum hardware requirements before starting installation.
<P>
<LI>Disable anti-virus protection before installation.
<P>
<LI>Always create an Emergency Startup Disk during installation of Windows&#160;98. After you've successfully installed Windows&#160;98, you should create several additional ESDs.
<P>
<LI>Consider using setup scripts to automate installation if installing on several computers. You can use portions of Setuplog.txt created during a successful installation to help create the script.
<P>
<LI>If you are upgrading from Windows&#160;95 and have sufficient disk space, choose to save your existing system files. This will enable you to restore your Windows&#160;95 configuration if you experience problems with Windows&#160;98.
<P>
<LI>If a failure occurs during Setup and before the first restart, select the Safe Recovery option when you run Setup again.
<P>
<LI>Detlog.txt, Detcrash.log, and Setuplog.txt are created during the setup process and record information about the setup process. Do not delete any of these files, particularly if you experience a Setup failure. Deleting them causes Setup to fail again at the same point.

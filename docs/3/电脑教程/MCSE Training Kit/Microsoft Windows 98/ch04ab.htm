Multiple Display Support is a Windows&#160;98 feature that supports several graphics adapters running as many as nine monitors on a single computer. Multiple display devices can be used as a single, expanded desktop. Multiple display is useful for business applications, desktop publishing, presentation graphics, and games.
<P>
To configure your computer for multiple displays, you must first install additional display adapters.
<P>
If you have installed and configured multiple displays and the secondary display has no output, make sure the correct video driver for the secondary display has been selected. If you have a problem running a program using multiple displays, try running the program on the primary display.

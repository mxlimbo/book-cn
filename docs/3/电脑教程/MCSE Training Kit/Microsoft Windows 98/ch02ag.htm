Problems may arise during various points within the Setup process. If failure occurs before the first restart, you must turn your computer off and then start Setup again. If failure occurs during hardware detection, you must turn your computer off and then use the Device Manager to determine which of your hardware components were detected.
<P>
Other installation support issues include incompatible video drivers, previous copies of Setupx.dll remaining in memory, changing installed components, interrupting file copying, and virus protection software.

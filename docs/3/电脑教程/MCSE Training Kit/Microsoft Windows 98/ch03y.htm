<A NAME="164"><H1>Summary</H1></A><P>
The following information summarizes the key points in this chapter:
<P>
<A NAME="165"><H3>Partitioning a Hard Disk</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>Partitioning is the process of dividing a hard disk into isolated sections. A hard disk must contain at least one partition.
<P>
<LI>A primary partition is a portion of a hard disk that you can set as the active partition, which the operating system uses to start the computer. An extended partition can contain multiple subpartitions, each treated as a logical drive.
<P>
<LI>Use Fdisk.exe to create and delete partitions. Use Windows Explorer to format partitions.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="166"><H3>Choosing a File System in Windows&#160;98</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>FAT16 and FAT32 are two file systems supported by Windows&#160;98. FAT32 supports partitions up to 2 terabytes and supports smaller-sized clusters, resulting in a more efficient use of disk space.
<P>
<LI>FAT32 does not support file compression and may not be compatible with older disk utilities.
<P>
<LI>Use FDISK (included with Windows&#160;98) to create either FAT16 or FAT32 partitions. Use the Drive Converter Wizard to convert a FAT16 partition to a FAT32 partition.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="167"><H3>Long File Names in Windows&#160;98</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>Windows&#160;98 supports long file names, augmenting the MS-DOS 8.3 file naming convention. File names in Windows&#160;98 can be up to 255 characters long, with the entire file path not to exceed 260 characters.
<P>
<LI>Windows&#160;98 implements long file names on FAT partitions by concatenating a series of MS-DOS-compatible directory entries into a single file name entry.
<P>
<LI>If you open and save a file with a long file name in a program that does not support long file names, Windows&#160;98 preserves the long file name as long as you do not rename or move the file. On a network, Windows&#160;98 uses a process called tunneling to preserve long file names for files that you open and save with an application that does not recognize long file names.
<P>
<LI>Files in Windows&#160;98 can have a long file name, as well as an alias, or MS-DOS name, which conforms to the 8.3 naming convention.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="168"><H3>Implementing Disk Compression</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>DriveSpace&#160;3 is a Windows&#160;98 utility that can compress a FAT16 partition or floppy disk. DriveSpace&#160;3 cannot compress FAT32 partitions.
<P>
<LI>DriveSpace&#160;3 works by replacing duplicate data strings with tokens that take up less space than the duplicate data. DriveSpace&#160;3 also uses the sector as its allocation unit rather than the cluster, resulting in much less wasted space for small files.
<P>
<LI>There are four methods of compression, each posing different tradeoffs between speed and compression ratio. The four different methods are No Compression, Standard Compression, HiPack, and UltraPack.
<P>
<LI>DriveSpace&#160;3 enables you to create an empty compressed drive out of free space existing on a partition or compress a drive that already contains data.

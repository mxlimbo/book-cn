Troubleshooting a Multilink connection is similar to troubleshooting a regular dial-up connection. However, there are two problems specific to Multilink.

<TD VALIGN="TOP">Multilink functionality is lost when connecting to a Windows&#160;NT 4.0 RAS Server with callback.</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">The Windows&#160;NT 4.0 RAS Admin utility stores a single callback number per account. Therefore, the RAS server calls only one of the devices and Multilink functionality is lost.
<p>
If the link between the client and the RAS server uses ISDN with two channels that have the same telephone number, then Multilink will work with callback.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Low connection speed and poor performance.</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Multilink was originally implemented for ISDN lines to consolidate two 64 Kbps links into a single 128 Kbps link. Multilink will also operate with other link types, including simple dial-up analog telephone lines; however, performance will degrade unless both links operate at the same speed.</TD>

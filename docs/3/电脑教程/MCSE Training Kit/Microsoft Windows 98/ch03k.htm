<A NAME="140"><H2>Setting Up a FAT32 Partition</H2></A><P>
If you decide to use the FAT32 file system, there are some initial steps you should take in preparation, such as verifying the size of the partition(s) that you want to format as FAT32. You can enable large disk support so that all new partitions that are 512&#160;MB or larger will be formatted as FAT32.
<P>
You can also convert existing FAT16 partitions to FAT32. In order to enable FAT32, you should:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Verify that your drive is 512&#160;MB or larger. You can only enable FAT32 on hard disks that are at least 512&#160;MB.
<P>
<LI>Verify that your current file system is FAT by checking the <B>Properties </B>sheet for that partition. The <B>Type</B> field indicates whether a drive is FAT or FAT32.
<P>
<LI>Make a Windows&#160;98 emergency startup disk <I>before</I> you enable FAT32.
<P>
<LI>Back up any data on your partition before you convert it.
<P>
<LI>Disable any virus protection software before you enable FAT32 or convert to FAT32. Windows&#160;98 will disable most virus protection software automatically, but cannot disable BIOS-level virus protection software.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="141"><H3>Enabling Large Disk Support</H3></A><P>
Enabling large disk support determines that all partitions you create after that selection will be formatted as FAT32. It does not affect existing FAT16 partitions.

<P>
The method you choose for setting up a FAT32 partition depends on whether you want to create new partitions or convert existing partitions (see Figure 3.4). 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Run Fdisk.exe and enable large disk support if you want all <I>new</I> partitions to be formatted as FAT32.
<P>
<LI>Use the Drive Converter (FAT32) that is included with Windows&#160;98 to convert existing partitions from FAT16 to FAT32.
</UL>
<P>
The method you choose determines the steps that you take in order to format your partition.
<P>
In the first method, you run Fdisk&#151;the version included with Windows&#160;95 (OSR2) or Windows&#160;98&#151;on a partition of at least 512&#160;MB. Fdisk prompts you to <B>enable large disk support</B>.  Any partitions you create that are at least 512&#160;MB in size will be formatted as FAT32 partitions. However, any existing partitions that are already formatted as FAT16 will remain FAT16.

<B>Tip</B>
<P>
If you have a hard disk that is not partitioned, use the Windows&#160;98 emergency startup disk to start your computer and then run Fdisk to make the entire hard disk FAT32.

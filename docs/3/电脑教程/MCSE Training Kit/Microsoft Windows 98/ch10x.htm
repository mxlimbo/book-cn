Windows&#160;98 provides several tools to help simplify resolving software conflicts. This lesson discusses the System File Checker, which scans operating system files and provides a restore file option when problems occur. The lesson also discusses the Version Conflict Manager, which saves system files that are overwritten by older versions during installations so that you can restore the newer versions without a full reinstallation of the program. Finally, the lesson discusses Dr. Watson, which monitors and resolves General Protection Faults.

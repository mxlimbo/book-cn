<A NAME="842"><H2>Troubleshooting Modem Problems</H2></A><P>
If your modem is unable to dial the dial-up connection, you can use the Modemlog.txt file and the Modem Diagnostics program to troubleshoot.
<P>
You can record a log file of all <I>AT</I> (which means <I>Attention</I>, a command line prefix) commands sent to your modem by TAPI programs and the results returned by those commands. Windows&#160;98 writes the file <I>modemname</I>.log to the C:\Windows folder. For security reasons, the file does not record specific telephone numbers or calling card numbers.
<P>
If you want to enable a modem log file, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	In <B>Control</B> <B>Panel</B>, double-click the <B>Modems</B> icon.
<P>
<LI>	On the <B>General</B> tab, click <B>Properties</B>.
<P>
<LI>	On the <B>Connection</B> tab, click <B>Advanced</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Select <B>Append to log</B> to activate this setting.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>OK</B>.
</OL>
<P>
The modem diagnostics program attempts to communicate with the selected modem to verify that the modem is connected properly and is receiving data. If the modem passes the test, one or more of the following is probably causing the problem:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The connection settings
<P>
<LI>The program used to connect the modem
<P>
<LI>The receiving modem
</UL>
<P>
If you want to run the modem diagnostics program, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Double-click the <B>Modems</B> icon.
<P>
<LI>	On the <B>Diagnostics</B> tab, click the COM port to which your modem is connected to select the modem.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>More Info</B>.
</OL>
<P>
This starts the modem diagnostics program.

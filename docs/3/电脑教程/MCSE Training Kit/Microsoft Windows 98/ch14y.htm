<A NAME="651"><H1>Summary</H1></A><P>
The following information summarizes the key points in this chapter:
<P>
<A NAME="652"><H3>Interoperating with NetWare Overview</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>Windows&#160;98 computers can log on to Novell NetWare networks, connect to file and print resources, run NetWare utilities, share resources with NetWare clients, and download user profiles and policies.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="653"><H3>Logging On to a NetWare Server</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>To log on to a NetWare server, you must first install and configure the necessary software, including internetwork packet exchange/sequenced packet exchange (IPX/SPX)-compatible Protocol and Client for NetWare Network.
<P>
<LI>If your network includes NetWare 4.<i>x</i> servers running NetWare Directory Services (NDS), you must install Service for NetWare Directory Services, which requires IPX/SPX-compatible Protocol and Client for NetWare Networks. If you do not install those components separately, Windows&#160;98 installs them automatically with Service for NetWare Directory Services.
<P>
<LI>To configure logon functions, you must choose which network will validate your logon. Some functions, such as the primary network logon and enabling logon script processing, can be set from a computer running Windows&#160;98. You can change passwords only from a NetWare server.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="654"><H3>Connecting to NetWare Servers</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>You can browse and connect to NetWare servers on your network through Windows Explorer. You can also use Windows Explorer to map a drive to a NetWare volume or to a directory within a volume. 
<P>
<LI>To submit print jobs from your Windows&#160;98 computer to a NetWare print server you set up a printer using either the Add Printer Wizard or Point and Print. Point and Print allows you to install a network printer locally without user intervention. Point and Print occurs automatically when connecting to a Windows&#160;98 print server, or to a Windows&#160;NT 4.0 print server that is sharing the proper drivers.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="655"><H3>Sharing Resources with NetWare Users</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>Windows&#160;98 users can share resources with NetWare servers and clients in the same way as in a Microsoft network but the configuration process differs, and the access control level is limited to user-level access. When you use File and printer sharing for NetWare Networks to share resources with NetWare clients, your computer appears as a NetWare server to a NetWare client.
<P>
<LI>Using File and printer sharing for NetWare Networks to share resources is similar to using File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks to share resources, except that in File and printer sharing for NetWare Networks, you must apply user-level access control. In addition, The World account allows access only to users who have an account on the security provider. This differs from File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks, which allows access to unknown users through The World account.

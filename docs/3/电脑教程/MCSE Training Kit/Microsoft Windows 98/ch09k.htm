<A NAME="385"><H2>Defragmenting a Hard Drive</H2></A><P>
As Windows&#160;98 reads applications from and writes applications to a hard disk, fragmentation occurs &#151; that is, files are stored in noncontiguous clusters. It takes much longer for the computer to read and write fragmented files than unfragmented files. 
<P>
The disk defragmentation process moves these noncontiguous clusters so that they occupy a contiguous area on the disk, thus reducing access times for these files. To improve file access time, you can defragment uncompressed drives, as well as compressed DriveSpace 3 or DoubleSpace drives.
<P>
The Windows&#160;98 Disk Defragmenter tool introduces the ability to store an application's executable file <I>and its supporting files</I> in a contiguous area of disk space. This new feature can decrease the time an application takes to start, in addition to improving its overall performance.
<P>
When an application starts, it typically reads an *.exe file and various *.dll files. However, if the application reads nonsequential portions of the *.exe and *.dll files when it starts, it must locate each portion of each file on the disk separately, increasing the time it takes the program to start. Windows&#160;98 Disk Defragmenter tries to place disk clusters in the order they are read, reducing the time it takes to start the program.
<P>
If you want to run and configure Disk Defragmenter, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Click <B>Start</B>, point to <B>Programs</B>, point to <B>Accessories</B>, point to <B>System Tools</B>, then click <B>Disk Defragmenter</B>.
<P>
<LI>	When the <B>Select Drive </B>dialog box appears, select the drive, then click <B>OK</B> to run<B> Disk Defragmenter</B> with the default settings. 
<P>
&#150; Or &#150;
<P>
Select <B>Settings</B> to change the configuration.
<P>
<LI>	Select options in the <B>Disk Defragmenter Settings </B>dialog box:
<P>
<B>When defragmenting my hard drive:</B> This section provides two configuration options:
<P>
<UL>
<B><LI>Rearrange program files so my programs start faster</B>. This option places the most frequently used program files at the front of a disk, optimizing program performance. This is selected by default.
<P>
<B><LI>Check the drive for errors. </B>In case of errors, a ScanDisk prompt appears.
</UL>
<P>
<B>I want to use these options: </B>This section determines how frequently Disk Defragmenter performs the selected tasks. Select one of the two options:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>This time only.
<P>
<LI>Every time I defragment my hard drive.
</UL>
</OL>
<P>
When you start <B>Disk Defragmenter</B>, the window displays a progress bar and a percentage complete counter. If you click the <B>Show Details</B> button, the <B>Disk Defragmenter </B>window changes to a graphical display that shows the progress of the defragmentation.

<B>Tip</B>
<P>
<B>Disk Defragmenter</B> takes longer to defragment your hard disk if you run it with details showing. For quickest performance, minimize the <B>Disk Defragmenter</B> window while the utility is running.

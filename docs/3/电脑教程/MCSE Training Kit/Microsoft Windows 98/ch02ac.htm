<A NAME="53"><H2>Recovering Before the First Restart</H2></A><P>
If the computer stops responding during Setup <I>prior</I> to the first restart, you must turn the computer off, turn it back on, and then run Setup again.
<P>
After the Setup Wizard reloads, Setup determines that a failure occurred and the Safe Recovery screen appears (see Figure 2.10).

If you click <B>Use Safe Recovery</B>, which is the recommended option, Setup examines the Setuplog.txt file to determine where the failure occurred. Setup then resumes from the point where the failure occurred.

If you do not use Safe Recovery, the Setup process will start over from the beginning.

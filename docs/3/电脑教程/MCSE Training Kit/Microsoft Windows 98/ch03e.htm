<A NAME="131"><H2>Primary and Extended Partitions</H2></A><P>
You can create one primary partition that contains your entire hard disk, or you can divide the space on the hard disk into multiple partitions. A <I>primary</I> partition is a portion of a hard disk that you can set as the active partition. The operating system uses the active partition to start the computer.
<P>
You can also partition a hard disk so that it has more than one logical drive. An <I>extended</I> partition can contain multiple subpartitions, each treated as a logical drive. You can then use these additional drives for organizing applications, data files, electronic mail, and multiple file systems. There can be only one extended partition on a hard disk, so it is important to use all the free  space available beyond the primary partitions. Free space is the portion of the hard disk that is not partitioned.

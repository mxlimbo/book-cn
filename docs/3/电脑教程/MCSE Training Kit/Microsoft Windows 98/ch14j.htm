<A NAME="623"><H2>Configuring Logon Functions</H2></A><P>
When you configure logon functions, you must choose which network will validate your logon. You can configure some functions, such as the primary network logon and enabling logon script processing from a computer running Windows&#160;98. However, you can change passwords only from a NetWare server.
<P>
If your users must have preferred servers authenticate them at system startup, configure the primary network logon to Client for NetWare Networks by performing the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	In <B>Control Panel</B>, double-click the <B>Network</B> icon.
<P>
<LI>	Select <B>Client for NetWare Networks</B> and click <B>Properties</B>.
<P>
<LI>	On the <B>General</B> tab, choose a preferred server from the drop-down box.
<P>
<LI>	Select the first network drive from the drop-down box.
<P>
<LI>	Enable logon script processing is checked by default. If you do not want to have this function enabled, click the box to clear it.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>OK</B>.
</OL>
<P>
<A NAME="624"><H3>Changing NetWare Passwords</H3></A><P>
Many NetWare commands and utilities function only when run from the command line on a mapped drive; they do not function from a universal naming convention (UNC) path.
<P>
For example, you cannot change your password on a NetWare server using Windows Explorer. You must use the NetWare <B>setpass</B> utility from a mapped drive at a command prompt in order to change your NetWare password.
<P>
<A NAME="625"><H3>Using Logon Scripts</H3></A><P>
If you enable logon script processing in the <B>Properties</B> dialog box for Client for NetWare networks, Nwlsproc.exe downloads and executes the logon script from the preferred server. The program executes all commands except those for Terminate-and-Stay-Resident (TSR) programs.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Note</B>
<P>
The logon script processor does not support NetWare 4.<i>x</i>-specific commands, and <B>map</B> or <B>capture</B> commands in the logon scripts cannot use NDS syntax.

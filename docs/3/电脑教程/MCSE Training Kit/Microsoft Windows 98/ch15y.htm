Here are some recommendations for managing user profiles:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Customize all desired settings (Start menu, desktop settings, and so forth), then enable user profiles. Those settings become the default user profile.
<P>
<LI>After creating a default user profile, you can implement mandatory profiles by saving User.dat as User.man in the network directory.
<P>
<LI>Before implementing roaming profiles, determine which settings should apply. For example, you may want each user to have a customized Start menu folder, or use as standard the default Start menu. The more settings you specify in profiles, the more space the profiles require for storage.
<P>
<LI>Make sure that there is enough drive space to store both local- and server-based user profiles. Check the size of the user profile folder locally before you copy it as a roaming or mandatory profile.
<P>
<LI>If your organization has many users per computer, or if you establish roaming profiles, do not select the setting that allows users to retain customized downloaded Web pages. Web pages are typically large and therefore greatly reduce the performance of computers and servers.
<P>
<LI>For each computer, use the same names for the directory and the hard disk drive in which you install Windows&#160;98. If you install Windows&#160;98 in C:\Windows on one computer and in C:\Win98 on another, some components of the user profile will not transfer between the two computers. This is also true if you install Windows&#160;98 on different hard disks on different computers (for example, C:\Windows on one computer and D:\Windows on another).

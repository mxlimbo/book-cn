<A NAME="768"><H2>Viewing Channel Content</H2></A><P>
A <I>channel</I> is a Web site designed to deliver content from the Internet to your computer on a regular schedule. Channels make it possible for you to remain up-to-date with the latest Web content. When you subscribe to a channel, the content appears on your desktop and is updated by the content provider periodically.
<P>
Subscribing to a channel automatically downloads information from the channel's Web site to your desktop. However, you do not have to subscribe to a channel to view the content. To view a channel's content, just click on the channel in the Channel Bar.
<P>
If you want to view the channel bar, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Right-click the desktop, and then click <B>Active Desktop</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>View As Web Page</B>.
</OL>
<P>
<A NAME="769"><H3>Subscribing to a Channel</H3></A><P>
Subscribing to a channel is similar to subscribing to any Web site. The difference is that the channel is a Web site that includes a channel definition format (CDF) file. A CDF file enables you to personalize the information you want to receive and determine how you want it delivered (see Figure 17.3).

<P>
After you subscribe to a channel, Internet Explorer 4.0 monitors and downloads only channel-specific content, regardless of the amount or organization of content in the Web site.
<P>
If you want to subscribe to a channel, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Click the <B>Subscribe</B> link or button on the channel Web page.
<P>
This runs the Channel Subscription wizard. The Channel Subscription wizard walks you through the subscription process in much the same way that you would subscribe to an ordinary Web site.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>Finish</B>.
</OL>
<P>
After you subscribe to a channel, Internet Explorer 4.0 adds the subscribed channel logo to the Channel pane in the browser and to the Channel bar on the Active Desktop.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>With the Channel pane you can view categorized links to channel topics. If channel content has been updated, notification will appear in the Channel pane.
<P>
<LI>With the Channel bar you can gain access to all subscribed channels from the Active Desktop. To open a subscribed channel, click the corresponding channel icon on the Channel bar.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="770"><H3>Downloading Channel Content</H3></A><P>
As in an ordinary Web site subscription, the channel subscription process allows you to choose between downloading updated channel content or monitoring the channel for content changes. However, Internet Explorer 4.0 treats channel content updates differently than it does content updates from regular Web sites.
<P>
If you choose to download channel content, Internet Explorer 4.0 downloads all new channel content to ensure that the latest version of every page in the channel is available.
<P>
If you do not want to download content, Internet Explorer 4.0 downloads only the updated CDF file. The new CDF file updates the channel hierarchy displayed in the Channel pane. However, the links listed in the updated Channel pane correspond to Web pages that have not been downloaded. To view the updated versions of these pages, you need to view them online or download them manually.

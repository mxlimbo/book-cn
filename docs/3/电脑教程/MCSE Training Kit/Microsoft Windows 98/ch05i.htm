The core components of Windows&#160;98 are the User component, Kernel component, the graphical device interface (GDI), and the user interface. The User component manages input from the keyboard, mouse, and other input devices. The Kernel component provides file I/O services, virtual memory management, and task scheduling. The GDI manages what appears on the screen, as well as graphics for printers and other output devices. The user interface consists of a shell based on Windows Explorer.
<P>
Windows&#160;98 is a 32-bit operating system that provides memory management and preemptive multitasking and multithreading support. It also provides a protected-mode file system that eliminates reliance upon MS-DOS once Windows&#160;98 starts. Other features include improved system-wide performance over older versions of Windows, and dynamic hardware and environment configuration.
<P>
For 16-bit applications, Windows&#160;98 uses cooperative multitasking. For 32-bit applications, Window&#160;98 uses preemptive  multitasking, in which the operating system has complete control over running applications.

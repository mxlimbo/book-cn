Here are some recommendations for configuring the Windows&#160;98 environment:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Before purchasing hardware, confirm that it is on the Windows&#160;98 Hardware Compatibility List (available from <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/" TARGET="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/</A>), and purchase Plug and Play hardware when possible.
<P>
<LI>If the hard drive you use to start Windows&#160;98 is efficient, let Windows&#160;98 manage your virtual memory settings and determine the correct swap file size. If, however, a secondary drive is larger or faster, consider choosing that drive as the location for your swap file.
<P>
<LI>If possible, use Add/Remove Programs to uninstall any programs you wish to uninstall. If the program you wish to uninstall is not listed in the <B>Install/Uninstall</B> tab, check the software's documentation for an uninstall procedure.
<P>

<LI>Treat Registry Editor as a tool to be used only for special cases. Configuration changes should be made using Control Panel or interface tools other than Registry Editor whenever possible.
<P>
<LI>If you must edit the registry directly, always make a back up first.
<P>
<LI>When your Windows&#160;98 computer is configured and working correctly, make a back up of the registry and keep it in a safe place.

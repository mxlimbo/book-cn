If you check <B>Search for new floppy disk drives each time your computer starts</B>, Windows&#160;98 directs the floppy disk driver to scan for new drives every time the system starts.
<P>
This is helpful for portable computers. Select this option if you frequently add or remove drives between Windows sessions and the drives are not recognized upon startup. Clearing this option makes startup faster.
<P>
<A NAME="275"><H3>Removable Disk Options</H3></A><P>
Selecting <B>Enable write-behind caching on all removable disk drives</B> speeds performance on any removable drives installed in your computer. Clear this box if you are experiencing problems with disk operation.

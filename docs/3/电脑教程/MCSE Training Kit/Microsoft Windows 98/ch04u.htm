<A NAME="208"><H2>Adding an IEEE 1394 Device</H2></A><P>
Because IEEE 1394 is fully Plug and Play compatible, you can add IEEE 1394 devices without having to restart the computer. Also, because IEEE 1394 is an external bus, you do not have to open the computer to add a device to the bus.
<P>
When you add a device, for instance a new video camera, to the bus, the following events occur (all of which are transparent to the user):
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	A bus initialize signal is sent across the bus, forcing all nodes into a suspended state.
<P>
<LI>	A tree identity process arbitrarily designates one node as the root and the rest of the nodes as either a parent (attached directly to the root node) or a child (not attached directly to the root node).
<P>
<LI>	Once the tree identity process is complete, a self-identity process runs, and each node selects one of 63 unique bus IDs starting with 0 (zero).
<P>
<LI>	After all of the nodes have selected a unique bus ID, the nodes are removed from the suspended state, and the bus is activated.
</OL>

<P>
The entire process of adding a device takes less than one second. If a device is added while data is being transmitted through an isochronous channel across the bus, the isochronous channel being used to transmit the data will be reallocated prior to the completion of the addition of the device. This prevents data from being lost while adding a device to the bus.

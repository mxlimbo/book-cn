Protocols are chosen based on the type of remote server to which you are connecting; the default is Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP). You must then configure the advanced options and TCP/IP setting for the connection.
<P>
Windows&#160;98 supports the Multilink Point-to-Point Protocol (MPPP) to increase data transmission rates. Multilink can be configured through the Dial-Up-Networking connection properties.
<P>
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) connects a client computer to a server through an intermediary network to provide a secure connection. The VPN uses a network as a transmission media.
<P>
Dial-Up Server provides single caller access to a Windows&#160;98 computer through Dial-Up Networking. Dial-Up Server is installed through the Control Panel with the type of security determined by the computer with Dial-Up Server enabled.
<P>
A Direct Cable Connection can be used to establish a direct serial, parallel or infrared connection between two Windows&#160;98 computers. If a host computer is connected to a network, the guest computer can also have access to that network.

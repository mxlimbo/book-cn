<A NAME="607"><H1>Summary</H1></A><P>
The following information summarizes the key points in this chapter:
<P>
<A NAME="608"><H3>Interoperating with Windows&#160;NT</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>A Windows&#160;98 computer running on a Windows&#160;NT network can log on to a domain, share resources with a computer running Windows&#160;NT, gain access to Microsoft BackOffice applications running on a Windows&#160;NT Server, and download user profiles and system policies.
<P>
<LI>The Windows&#160;98 Client for Microsoft Networks supports the Microsoft Distributed File System (DFS) for Windows&#160;NT Server, which provides a single tree structure for accessing multiple shared resources on a network.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="609"><H3>Logging on to a Windows&#160;NT Domain</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>In Windows&#160;98, you can log on to a Windows&#160;NT domain and connect to domain resources. You configure Windows&#160;98 to log on to a Windows&#160;NT domain through Client for Microsoft Networks.
<P>
<LI>To create a logon script, use the <B>User Manager for Domains</B> tool on the Windows&#160;NT Server. You can use the Passwords option in Control Panel to synchronize user passwords, which gives users the ability to use a single password to log on to both Windows&#160;98 and Windows&#160;NT.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="610"><H3>Using Windows&#160;NT Network Resources</H3></A><P>
<UL>
<LI>A computer running Windows&#160;98 can connect to any computer running Windows&#160;NT and use that computer's file and print resources.
<P>
<LI>To print from a computer running Windows&#160;98 to a print server running Windows&#160;NT, the server must have Windows&#160;98-compatible print drivers. You can administer a remote Windows&#160;NT printer the same way you administer a remote Windows&#160;98 printer.
<P>
<LI>When you employ user-level access control on a Windows&#160;NT network, you must choose a security provider. A security provider is a Windows&#160;NT domain server or a Windows&#160;NT workgroup computer that maintains the list of users and groups to which you assign resource permissions.
<P>
<LI>When you use user-level security to protect shared resources, you assign permissions to users and global groups by editing the Access Control List.

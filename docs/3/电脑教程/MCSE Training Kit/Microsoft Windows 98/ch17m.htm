You can use Microsoft NetShow for <I>streaming</I> multimedia over networks that range from low-bandwidth dial-up Internet connections to high-bandwidth LANs. Streaming enables content to be delivered to the client computer as a continuous flow of data with little wait time before content playback begins. NetShow makes it possible to deliver the following throughout an intranet and across the Internet:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Live and on-demand audio
<P>
<LI>Video
<P>
<LI>Synchronized sound and still images
</UL>
<P>
NetShow uses Active Streaming Format (ASF) file format to encapsulate multimedia data types and embedded text, and synchronizes these objects within a stream. Major multimedia authoring tool vendors are adopting this file format. The ASF file format is a media compression scheme that eliminates the need to purchase special hardware. To view a NetShow production you must use Microsoft NetShow Player, or an application that supports the NetShow ActiveX control.
<P>
A NetShow presentation starts with the <I>feed</I>, which is the content captured through any of these media:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>VCR
<P>
<LI>Video camera
<P>
<LI>Television
<P>
<LI>Digital Camera
<P>
<LI>Microphone
</UL>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>A computer running Windows&#160;NT Server 4.0
<P>
<LI>NetShow Server running NetShow Multicast Channel Manager
<P>
<LI>Internet Information Server for HTML pages (this can be a separate server)
</UL>
<P>
You can connect to the NetShow production through a wide area network, the Internet, or an intranet. You can view a NetShow production in two ways:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Using NetShow Player. By choosing this option, you can decide whether to view the content locally or remotely.
<P>
<LI>Visual Basic script or other ActiveX container application embedded in a Web page. This option enables a person who does not have NetShow Player installed to see the content.
</UL>

<A NAME="663"><H2>Types of User Profiles</H2></A><P>
Local user profiles are available only on the computer that the user is logging on to. These profiles control the settings for that specific computer and user. Use local user profiles when multiple users share a single computer running Windows&#160;98.
<P>
Roaming profiles download from a network server to any computer that the user logs on to. The settings in a roaming profile apply to any computer running a Windows&#160;98 32-bit protected mode client (such as Client for NetWare Networks or Client for Microsoft Networks). The user must log on to the network server to download the profile. The Primary Network Logon setting, configured with the Network icon in Control Panel, must match the type of network server. Roaming profiles are an appropriate solution when individual users log on to different computers.

<P>
While local user profiles include screen saver settings, roaming profiles do not. This is because the password for password-protected screen savers exists in a file list local to each computer.
<P>
When the user logs on from a machine with his local profile and the server that contains the roaming profile is unavailable, the local version of the profile loads to the computer. The local profile may not be as current as the server-based profile because it contains the settings from the user's most recent session on that computer rather than the user's most recent session on the network.

<P>
A mandatory user profile, <I>User.man</I>, is a roaming profile that does not update when a user logs off or shuts down the computer. You must change the User.man file on the server to make changes to a mandatory profile. A mandatory user profile can provide the same desktop settings on several computers, or keep users from changing their desktop settings permanently.
<P>
Mandatory user profiles protect only the server-based copy of the profile from configuration changes. By contrast, the local profile on the client computer records any configuration changes the user makes, although the local profile is overwritten by the server-based profile each time the user logs on. If the server-based mandatory profile is unavailable when a user logs on, the local profile loads. This local profile may be different from the server-based profile if the user made changes during the most recent session.

Here are some recommendations for maintaining and troubleshooting Windows&#160;98 in a network environment:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Check Windows Update weekly for new drivers and troubleshooting tips.
<P>
<LI>Use the Windows&#160;98 Troubleshooters to diagnose and solve technical problems with Windows&#160;98.
<P>
<LI>If you want to administer a remote computer using System Policy Editor, Registry Editor, or System Monitor, you must install the Microsoft Remote Registry service on both your computer and the remote computer. Although the remote computer requires user-level access control, it does not require file and printer sharing services.

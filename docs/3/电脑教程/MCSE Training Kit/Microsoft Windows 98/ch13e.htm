The Windows&#160;98 Client for Microsoft Networks supports the Microsoft Distributed File System for Windows&#160;NT Server (DFS).

<P>
DFS provides a single tree structure for accessing multiple shared resources located on different servers on a network (see Figure 13.2). The branches of the tree may contain resources from servers located throughout the network. After you connect to the root of a DFS tree, you can browse all branches of the tree, no matter where the resources actually reside.
<P>
You can view and gain access to resources through a DFS tree just as you view and access other resources on the network. When you browse a network, a DFS root appears just like a share name of a shared folder in \\servername\dfsname syntax. In addition, you can access resources from more than one location using a single DFS path.
<P>
Windows&#160;NT administrators can create a DFS tree root on any server running Windows&#160;NT Server version 4.0, provided they have installed the DFS software. The DFS software was included in Windows&#160;NT Service Pack 3 and is available for download from <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/" TARGET="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/</A>.

<P>

Windows&#160;98 DFS support is limited to server message block (SMB)-based resources. Windows&#160;98 users cannot see non-SMB resources, such as NetWare resources, in a DFS tree.

<A NAME="130"><H1>Lesson 1: Partitioning a Hard Disk</H1></A><P>
When you set up a new computer system or install a new hard disk, you must prepare the hard disk to store data by first creating one or more partitions and then formatting each partition. <I>Partitioning</I> is the process of establishing one or more isolated sections of mass storage on a hard disk. At a minimum, a hard disk must contain one partition.
<P>
You create and delete both primary and extended partitions with Fdisk, an MS-DOS utility. After you create partitions, you must format them to either the FAT16 or FAT32 file system. This lesson describes the procedures for creating, deleting, and formatting partitions.

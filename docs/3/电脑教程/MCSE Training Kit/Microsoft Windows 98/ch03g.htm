<A NAME="133"><H2>Formatting Partitions</H2></A><P>
After you create a partition, you must restart your computer and then format the partition before you can store data on it. You can format partitions through Windows Explorer by right-clicking on the drive and selecting <B>Format</B> from the drop-down menu. You can also format a drive from the command prompt using the <B>Format</B> command.

<P>
Windows&#160;Explorer offers the following types of format operations (see Figure 3.2):
<P>
<UL>
<B><LI>Quick (erase)</B>. Erases the directory table, which contains the list of files and folders on the partition, but does not actually erase all data from the partition. You can only use this option on formatted partitions.
<P>
<B><LI>Full</B>. Erases all data from the partition.
<P>
<B><LI>Copy system files only</B>. Does not format the partition, but instead copies the files that start Windows&#160;98 and creates a Windows&#160;98 boot sector on the partition.
</UL>

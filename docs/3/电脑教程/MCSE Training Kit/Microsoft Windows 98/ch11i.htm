Microsoft Batch 98 (Batch.exe) is a Windows-based program that makes it easy to create setup scripts that you can use to automate Windows&#160;98 installation (see Figure 11.1). By running Microsoft Batch 98 and selecting the options you want, you create a file in *.inf format that you can use to run Windows&#160;98 Setup with minimal user input. Microsoft Batch 98 can scan your computer's registry and store your settings in the *.inf file. This saves time if the computers for which you are writing a script must have a configuration similar to your computer.

Microsoft Batch 98 is especially useful if you must test alternate configurations and need to run Setup repeatedly. You can use Microsoft Batch 98 to define all options in a setup script.

You can create the batch file on a <I>clean</I> computer or use the selection options in Microsoft Batch 98 to delete unwanted options. A <I>clean</I> computer has only Windows&#160;98 installed, without additional software or applications.

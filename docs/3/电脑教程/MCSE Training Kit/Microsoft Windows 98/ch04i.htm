<A NAME="193"><H2>Overview of OnNow Power Management</H2></A><P>
The OnNow design initiative requires changes in the Microsoft Windows&#160;98 and Windows&#160;NT operating systems, device drivers, hardware, and applications. The initiative also relies on the changes defined in the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) Revision 1.0 specification.
<P>
The Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) specification is a set of BIOS-level instructions with which Windows&#160;98 can communicate.
<P>
ACPI defines a hardware interface that provides a standard way to integrate power management features throughout a PC system. This allows the system to automatically turn on and off standard devices, such as CD-ROM drives, network cards, hard disk drives, and printers, as well as consumer devices connected to the computer, such as VCRs, TVs, phones, and stereos. For a complete OnNow system, the BIOS must support ACPI.

<P>
The power management features in Windows&#160;98 will function with a legacy BIOS, but the BIOS must implement the power management control.

Features of an OnNow computer include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The computer is ready for use immediately when the user presses the On button.
<P>
<LI>The computer appears to be off when not in use but responds to wake-up events, which return the computer to a ready state. Wake-up events might be triggered by a device receiving input such as a telephone ringing, or by software that has requested the computer to &quot;wake up&quot; at a predetermined time.
<P>
<LI>Software adjusts its behavior when the computer's power state changes. The operating system and applications work together to enable the computer to deliver effective power management according to the user's needs. For example, inactive applications participate in shutting down the computer to conserve energy and reduce noise.
<P>
<LI>All devices participate in power management, whether they were originally installed in the computer or added later by the user. Any new device can have its power state changed as system use dictates.

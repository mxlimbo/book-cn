Here are some recommendations for performing multiple Windows&#160;98 installations:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>When installing Windows&#160;98 on multiple machines using the same configuration options, you should automate Setup using Setup scripts.
<P>
<LI>You should install Microsoft Batch 98 (Batch.exe) to simplify the creation of Setup scripts.
<P>
<LI>If you must install Windows&#160;98 more than five times, a pull installation can also make the process easier.
<P>
<LI>Although Windows&#160;98 does not include a push installation tool, the Windows&#160;NT Microsoft System Management Server can perform push installations of Windows&#160;98.
<P>
<LI>When using a batch script for a pull installation from a server, you must create a shared directory that will contain the batch file on the server and copy the Windows&#160;98 source files to that shared directory.

<A NAME="272"><H2>Optimizing CD-ROM File System Performance</H2></A><P>
The CD-ROM File System (CDFS) maintains its own internal cache in order to optimize access to the CD-ROM drive. Because CDFS uses a separate cache, the cache memory can swap to the hard disk when CD-ROM drive activity pauses. It is faster for Windows&#160;98 to read data from the cache even if it has been paged to disk because the hard disk access time is much faster than the CD-ROM drive access time. This gives applications more room to run and protects the main hard disk cache from being emptied when a large amount of data is played back.
<P>
You set the CDFS cache with the CD-ROM tab of the File Systems Properties sheet (see Figure 6.6).

If you want to set the size of the CDFS cache:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Click the <B>System</B> icon in Control Panel. Select the <B>Performance</B> tab and click <B>File System</B>. Click the <B>CD-ROM</B> tab.
<P>
<LI>	Choose the desired settings for <B>Supplemental cache size</B> and <B>Optimize access pattern for</B>.
<P>
<UL><B><LI>Supplemental cache size</B> controls how much additional memory is allocated to the CDFS cache for read-ahead caching. The supplemental cache for CDFS holds path, table, directory, and file information. The supplemental cache is allocated on a sliding scale from a minimum of 64K to a maximum of 1,238K.
<P>
<B><LI>Optimize access pattern for</B> defines the minimum and maximum CDFS cache size, based on CD-ROM speed. Select the setting that matches speed of your CD-ROM drive. The following settings are available:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>No read-ahead
<P>
<LI>Single-speed drives
<P>
<LI>Double-speed drives
<P>
<LI>Triple-speed drives
<P>
<LI>Quad-speed or higher

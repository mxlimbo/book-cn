Here are some recommendations for using a computer running Windows&#160;98 that is connected to a Windows&#160;NT network:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Decide whether security or convenience is more important when choosing which Windows&#160;98 computers will use user-level security and which will use share-level security. For instance, if users are keeping sensitive data on their local computers, user-level security will help ensure that only specific people will be able to gain access to shared resources. If, however, users keep no sensitive data on their computers and need only to share local printers, share-level security may be more convenient.
<P>
<LI>Grant either full or read-only security to shared folders to avoid conflicts with programs that cannot process the custom access rights.
<P>
<LI>Make Windows and domain passwords the same, so users have to enter only one password to gain access to both local and network resources.
<P>
<LI>When possible, share resources to groups instead of to individual users to avoid having to add individual users to an Access Control List.

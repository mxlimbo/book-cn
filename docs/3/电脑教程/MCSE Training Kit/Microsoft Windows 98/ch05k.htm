<A NAME="232"><H2>Virtual Memory</H2></A><P>
<I>Virtual memory</I> is a term that refers to the fact that the operating system can actually allocate more memory than the computer physically contains. <I>Physical</I> <I>memory</I> is the amount of RAM and free disk space on your computer. Because physical memory is limited, Windows&#160;98 allocates each process a unique virtual address space, which is a set of addresses available for the process's threads to use. This virtual address space appears to be 4&#160;GB in size; 2&#160;GB reserved for program storage and 2&#160;GB reserved for system storage.
<P>
Figure 5.1 illustrates where Windows&#160;98 system components and applications reside in virtual memory.

<P>
System and application components reside in virtual memory at various locations:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>All Kernel-mode (Ring 0) components reside in the address space above 3&#160;GB. Kernel-mode is the privileged mode of operation in which code has direct access to all hardware and all memory addresses.
<P>
<LI>The Windows&#160;98 core components and shared dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) reside in the shared address space between 2&#160;GB and 3&#160;GB. This makes them available to all applications.
<P>
<LI>Win32-based applications reside between 4&#160;MB and 2&#160;GB. Each Win32-based application has its own address space to protect it from other applications.
<P>
<LI>Real-mode device drivers and terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs reside at 640K and below.
</UL>

<A NAME="233"><H3>Windows&#160;98 Swap File</H3></A><P>
The virtual memory scheme requires memory to be <I>swapped</I> between RAM and the hard disk when the amount of free RAM becomes low. The file located on the hard disk where memory is swapped between RAM and the hard disk is called a <I>swap file</I>.
<P>
The Windows&#160;98 virtual memory swap file implementation addresses the problems and limitations imposed in Windows&#160;3.1<I>x</I>. Under Windows&#160;3.1<I>x</I>, users had to decide whether to use a temporary swap file or a permanent swap file, how much memory to allocate to the swap file, and whether to use 32-bit disk access.
<P>
The swap file implementation in Windows&#160;98 simplifies the configuration task for the user and combines the best of temporary and permanent swap files, due to improved algorithms and access methods. The swap file in Windows&#160;98 is dynamic; it can shrink or grow, based on the operations that are performed on the system. The swap file can reside on a fragmented region of the hard drive or on a compressed volume with no substantial performance penalty.
<P>
If you want to change your swap file settings in Windows&#160;98:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	From the Windows&#160;98 <B>Start</B> menu, point to <B>Settings</B>, and click <B>Control</B> <B>Panel</B>.
<P>
<LI>	In Control Panel, double-click <B>System</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Click the <B>Performance</B> tab, and then click <B>Virtual</B> <B>Memory</B>.
</OL>
<P>
On this property page, you can adjust the size, minimum and maximum settings, or let Windows&#160;98 control the size of the swap file.

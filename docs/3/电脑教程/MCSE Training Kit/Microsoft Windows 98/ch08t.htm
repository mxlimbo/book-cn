<A NAME="365"><H2>Managing a Local Printer</H2></A><P>
You can configure Windows&#160;98 to manage your printing tasks (see Figure 8.3). For example, if the designated printer is out of paper or has a paper jam, you can pause printing until you can resolve the problem. If you sent print jobs to the printer in error, you can purge them. Or perhaps you want to change the order of documents in a queue so that one document prints before another.

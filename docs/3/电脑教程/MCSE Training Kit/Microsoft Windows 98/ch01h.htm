<A NAME="40"><H2>Advanced Support for New Hardware Standards</H2></A><P>
Windows&#160;98 supports powerful new hardware technologies while at the same time maintaining the broadest support for older Windows-based applications and technologies.
<P>
Support for the newest generation of hardware makes new Windows&#160;98-based computers significantly easier to use, more productive, and easier to maintain.
<P>
The following table describes the new hardware standards implemented in Windows&#160;98.

<TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>New Hardware Standard</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>Description</B></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">OnNow</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">A power management approach that facilitates faster booting. Instead of turning the computer off, it switches to a low power &quot;sleep&quot; state that can be restored easily, so that the computer starts quickly. The result is similar to turning on a television or stereo.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Universal Serial Bus (USB) Support</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Allows multiple devices to run simultaneously on a computer, with peripheral devices such as monitors and keyboards acting as additional plug-in sites, or <I>hubs</I>.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">IEEE 1394 Serial Bus Support (<I>Firewire)</I></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Provides enhanced PC connectivity for a wide range of devices, from audio/video components to traditional PC storage devices. IEEE 1394 provides a low cost, Plug and Play-compatible expansion interface for the PC.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Supports simpler device management on new PCs and enhanced battery performance on new mobile PCs.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">DVD Support</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Supports the next generation of optical disc storage technology. DVD can store video as well as audio and computer data. DVD aims to encompass home entertainment, computers, and business information with a single digital format, eventually replacing audio CD, videotape, laserdisc, and CD-ROM.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Windows Driver Model (WDM)</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">WDM provides a common set of I/O services and binary-compatible device drivers for both Windows&#160;NT and future Windows operating systems. To help decrease the effort necessary for hardware vendors to support all Windows platforms, this driver model is based on a class/minidriver structure that provides modular, extensible architectures for device support.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Multiple Display Support</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Supports display of applications on multiple monitors. Each monitor is capable of running at a different resolution, providing users with greatly enhanced display potential.</TD>

Here are some recommendations for troubleshooting Windows&#160;98 in a stand-alone environment:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>You should create a backup of four system files (Win.ini, System.ini, Autoexec.bat, and Config.sys) before you make any changes with System Configuration Utility.
<P>
<LI>Registry Checker only creates daily registry backups upon restarting the computer, so if users do not regularly shut down their computers, their registries will not be backed up. To back up the registry automatically, create a Scheduled Task to run daily with the command line of Scanregw /autoscan. The /autoscan switch will run the backup in the background, requiring no user intervention.
<P>
<LI>If you are going to make a system change, such as installing a new software application, make a backup of your registry using Registry Checker before installing the software. Then, keep a copy of the .cab file that it creates in a different location. That way, if you need to reset your configuration after five days (and five new backups), copy the Rb00x.cab file you saved back into the C:\Windows\sysbackup folder and use Scanreg /restore to restore that registry backup.
<P>
<LI>When you are troubleshooting a user's computer, create a shortcut to the System Information utility on the desktop (C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Msinfo\Msinfo32.exe). This will allow you quicker access to all of the options on the <B>Tools</B> menu. After you are done troubleshooting, delete the shortcut.

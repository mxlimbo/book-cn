<A NAME="351"><H2>Enabling Deferred Printing</H2></A><P>
You can configure printing to defer it until a later time. With deferred printing you can store a print job on your computer's local hard disk. You can print the document later without opening the application. This function is useful in at least two situations:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>You are using a mobile computer and are working away from your docking station to which a printer is attached.
<P>
<LI>You are using a computer on a network, and the remote printer is malfunctioning or is unavailable.
</UL>
<P>
Unavailable printers appear in the Printers folder as grey icons. You can still send print jobs to the unavailable printer, and documents sent to the printer are still spooled. When the printer becomes available, the spooled documents will print.
<P>

<B>Note</B>
<P>
Deferred printing files are stored in the %windir%\spool\printers folder with .spl extensions. In the case of EMF spooling, the .spl file contains pointers to the EMF page files located in the temp folder.

<A NAME="352"><H3>Configuring Deferred Printing</H3></A><P>
Deferred printing is automatic for a laptop computer that uses a docking station. While the laptop is undocked, deferred print jobs are stored in its printer queues. After you dock the laptop, Windows&#160;98 prompts you to print the deferred print jobs.
<P>
You can also manually configure a print queue to use deferred printing by selecting the <B>Work Offline</B> option on the <B>File</B> menu in the Printers folder. When you are ready to print you must deselect the option manually before Windows&#160;98 will prompt you to print the deferred print jobs.

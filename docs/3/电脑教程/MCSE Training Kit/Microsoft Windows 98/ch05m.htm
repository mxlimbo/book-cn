With virtual memory running, Windows&#160;98 can allocate more memory than the computer actually physically contains. Windows&#160;98 accomplishes this task by swapping memory between RAM and the hard disk when the amount of free RAM becomes low. The file located on the hard disk where memory is swapped between RAM and the hard disk is called a swap file.
<P>
Each process is allocated a unique virtual address space that is divided into pages. Code and data are moved in pages from physical memory to the swap file on the hard disk. The Memory Pager maps virtual addresses from the process space to physical pages in memory.
<P>
Some MS-DOS-based applications require exclusive access to system resources in order to run. In this case, the Virtual Memory Manager creates an exclusive operating environment for the application called MS-DOS Mode.

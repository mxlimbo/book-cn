<A NAME="220"><H2>Core System Components</H2></A><P>
Similar to Windows&#160;3.1<I>x</I>, Windows&#160;98 includes a core composed of three components:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>User
<P>
<LI>Kernel
<P>
<LI>Graphical Device Interface (GDI)
<P>
<LI>User Interface
</UL>
<P>
Each of these components includes a pair of DLLs&#151;one 32-bit and one 16-bit&#151;that provide services for the applications you run. Windows&#160;98 is designed to use 32-bit code wherever it significantly improves performance without sacrificing compatibility. Windows&#160;98 retains existing 16-bit code where it is required to maintain compatibility or where 32-bit code would increase memory requirements without improving performance. All Windows&#160;98 I/O subsystems (such as networking and file systems) and device drivers are 32-bit, as are all memory management and scheduling components, including Kernel and Virtual Memory Manager.
<P>
<A NAME="221"><H3>The User Component</H3></A><P>
The User component manages input from the keyboard, mouse, and other input devices. It also manages output to the user interface such as windows, icons, and menus. In addition, it manages interaction with the sound driver, system timer, and communication ports.
<P>
<A NAME="222"><H3>The Kernel Component</H3></A><P>
The Kernel component in Windows&#160;98 provides the base operating system functionality. This includes file I/O services, virtual memory management, and task scheduling. When a user wants to start an application, the Kernel loads the .exe and .dll files for the application.
<P>
The Kernel component also provides exception handling. <I>Exceptions</I> are events that occur as a program runs and that require software outside of the normal flow of control to be run. For example, if an application generates an exception, the Kernel is able to communicate that exception to the application to perform the necessary functions to resolve the problem.
<P>
<A NAME="223"><H3>The Graphical Device Interface</H3></A><P>
The Graphical Device Interface (GDI) is the graphical system that manages what appears on the screen. It also provides graphics support for printers and other output devices. It draws graphic primitives, manipulates bitmaps, and interacts with device-independent graphics drivers.
<P>
Many functions provided by the GDI component are very complex and CPU-intensive. For this reason, Windows&#160;98 implements this code as 32-bit to improve performance.
<P>
<A NAME="224"><H3>The User Interface</H3></A><P>
In addition to its core components, Windows&#160;98 features a 32-bit user interface shell based on Windows Explorer. This shell contains several desktop tools, including Network Neighborhood. All applications can take advantage of the common controls offered by the shell, such as common dialog boxes, tree views, and list views.

<A NAME="158"><H2>Managing and Tuning Compressed Disks</H2></A><P>
DriveSpace&#160;3 can create an empty compressed drive from free space on an existing partition, or a compressed drive containing the data from an existing partition.
<P>
<A NAME="159"><H3>Compression Ratio</H3></A><P>
By default, DriveSpace&#160;3 assumes a compression ratio of 2:1. Because the largest FAT16 partition is 2&#160;GB, the default CVF size is 1&#160;GB. You can adjust the expected compression ratio in the DriveSpace&#160;3 utility based on the type of data you will store on the compressed drive. For example, Microsoft Word documents can compress to 1/16<SUP>th</SUP> of their original size. Others, such as Video for Windows files (.avi files), do not compress as well.
<P>
By decreasing the expected compression ratio, your CVF can be larger than 1&#160;GB. However, DriveSpace&#160;3 still limits the amount of data in the drive to 2&#160;GB. You can see how much a file is compressed by using the <B>Change ratio</B> command on the <B>Advanced</B> menu of DriveSpace&#160;3. You can also use the <B>dir/c</B> command at the MS-DOS command prompt.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3>CVF and the Host Drive</H3></A><P>
When you compress a drive, the CVF completely fills the host drive that is created to hold the CVF. With DriveSpace&#160;3, you can move free space from the CVF to the host drive. The host drive free space is not compressed, and files saved to it will not be compressed.
<P>
For example, if you compress drive D, DriveSpace&#160;3 creates host drive H to hold the compressed drive D. If you move 200&#160;MB free space from drive D to drive H, you can save files to drive H and those files will not be compressed. Any files you save to drive D will be compressed.

<P>
To perform this procedure you must have a compressed drive on your system; however, you may decide not to adjust free space based on your needs.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<P>
If you want to adjust free space:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Click <B>Start</B>. Point to <B>Programs, Accessories, System Tools</B>, and then click <B>DriveSpace&#160;3.</B>
<P>
<LI>	Select the compressed drive or the host drive.
<P>
<LI>	In the <B>Drive</B> menu, click <B>Adjust Free Space.</B>
<P>
A graphic display of the compressed drive and host drive shows the size of the drives and the amount of free space on each.
<P>
You move free space between the compressed drive and host drive with a slider bar at the bottom of the window. When you move the slider, the graphic display shows the changes.
<P>
<LI>	Move the slider to adjust the free space between the compressed drive and host drive. Click <B>OK.</B>

<A NAME="161"><H3>Compression Agent</H3></A><P>
Compression Agent (Cmpagent.exe) is a DriveSpace&#160;3 utility on the <B>System</B> <B>Tools</B> menu with which you can choose:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Whether specified files should be in UltraPack format, and whether to downgrade a file from UltraPack format. If you require maximum system performance, remember that files compressed in UltraPack format are much slower to decompress. For slower computers, consider using Compression Agent with Scheduled Tasks to compress files during idle time rather than when you save files.
<P>
<LI>Whether individual files, folders, or file types should be compressed, and if so, with what method.
<P>
<LI>Whether to use compression for the rest of your files and, if so, which type.
</UL>
<P>
With Compression Agent, you can write files to a compressed drive without compressing them. When you start Compression Agent, it evaluates the files on the drive and compresses only the types of files you specified, using the type of compression you specified.

Compression Agent is compatible only with DriveSpace&#160;3 compressed drives.

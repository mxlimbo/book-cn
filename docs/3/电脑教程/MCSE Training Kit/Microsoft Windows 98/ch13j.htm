Your local Windows password and your Windows&#160;NT domain password are maintained separately. However, if your computer is configured so that you log on to a Windows&#160;NT domain when you log on to Windows&#160;98, you can keep your local Windows password and your domain password synchronized. You can then use the same password for both Windows&#160;98 and the domain. Use the Passwords option in Control Panel to implement, change, and synchronize user passwords (see Figure 13.5).

The Passwords Properties sheet offers two options for changing passwords.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Change Windows Passwords</B>&#151;you can set your Windows password, and synchronize it with other resource passwords such as the screen saver password.
<P>
<LI><B>Change Other Passwords</B>&#151;you can change your password for specific resources, such as for a Windows&#160;NT domain.
</UL>
<P>
When you change your Windows password, you can also choose from a list of other system component program passwords that have this feature enabled. If you select any of these other options, Windows&#160;98 will change the system password and will also communicate with the selected programs to change those passwords. The same password will be applied to each selected program.

<P>
You can synchronize passwords only for programs specifically written to take advantage of Control Panel Passwords; Windows&#160;98 does not automatically change all passwords; for example, a password for a Web site may not take advantage of this feature.

Here are some recommendations for using Dial-Up Networking efficiently:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>If you have a mobile computer, create dialing locations for all frequently used sites. Remember to choose the appropriate location before creating the Dial-Up Networking connection.
<P>
<LI>If you move your Windows&#160;98 computer from one location to another, make sure you edit the default dialing location so that Windows&#160;98 dials correctly. If you do not, Windows&#160;98 may treat long distance numbers as local and vice versa.
<P>
<LI>If you travel frequently, investigate using a PPTP connection instead of a direct RAS connection to your corporation. PPTP is secure, and it is less expensive if you can obtain a local dial-up ISP number.
<P>
<LI>Before investing money in additional modems, confirm that your ISP or your RAS supports Multilink. Both the client and server must support Multilink for it to work correctly.

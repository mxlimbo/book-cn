Windows&#160;98 users can share resources with NetWare servers and clients in the same way as in a Microsoft network but the configuration process differs, and the access control level is limited to user-level access. When you use File and printer sharing for NetWare Networks to share resources with NetWare clients, your computer appears as a NetWare server to a NetWare client.
<P>
Using File and printer sharing for NetWare Networks to share resources is similar to using File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks to share resources, except that in File and printer sharing for NetWare Networks, you must apply user-level access control. In addition, The World account allows access only to users who have an account on the security provider. This differs from File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks, which allows access to unknown users through The World account.

After you create a system policy file, you must save it to a specific location for the network type (see Figure 16.4).

When a user logs on to a network with a computer running Windows&#160;98, the operating system searches for a policy file, depending on the primary network logon, as shown in the following table:
<P>
<TABLE WIDTH="95%" BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="5">

<B>Note</B>
<P>
For group policies on a Novell NetWare network, at least one NetWare 4.1 server on the network must be running in bindery emulation mode. The group and all users in the group must be in bindery context for the server.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<P>
On large networks where many users can log on and attempt to download the same policy file within a short period of time, there is a potential for poor network performance. Windows&#160;98 system policies offer two methods for managing this network traffic: <I>load balancing</I> and <I>manual update</I>.
<P>
<A NAME="720"><H3>Load Balancing System Policies</H3></A><P>
On a Windows&#160;NT network, users download the system policy from the Primary Domain Controller. To avoid a network slowdown on a Windows&#160;NT network, you can enable load balancing. Policies then can download from the logon server, which can be a backup domain controller rather than the Primary Domain Controller.
<P>
If you use load balancing, be sure that you maintain the policy file on all domain controllers in the domain. You can automate this process with the Windows&#160;NT Directory Replicator service.
<P>
If you want to enable load balancing, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	In System Policy Editor, open the \\<I>computer_name</I>\Windows&#160;98 Network\Update\Remote Update policy.
<P>
<LI>	Select the <B>Load balance</B> setting.
</OL>
<P>
<A NAME="721"><H3>Using Manual Update with System Policies</H3></A><P>
On NetWare networks, Windows&#160;NT networks, or in a stand-alone configuration, you can use the <B>Manual Update</B> option in the Remote Update policy to specify the location and name of the system policy file. <B>Manual Update</B> distributes the administration of system policies by applying different policy files to groups of users.
<P>
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Note</B>
<P>
The word <I>manual</I> in <B>Manual Update</B> refers to a defined location of the policy file other than the default location. The update still occurs when the user logs on, but Windows&#160;98 searches for the file and path in the <B>Manual Update</B> setting, rather than the default location. When you use the <B>Manual Update</B> option, you can give the system policy file any 8.3 filename with the extension *.pol.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<P>
Although you can copy policy files to servers other than domain controllers and preferred servers with <B>Manual Update</B>, be sure to keep the original Config.pol file in the default location. New clients search the default location the first time they log on to the network. Subsequently, when the user logs on, Windows&#160;98 uses the path and file name in the <B>Manual Update</B> setting.
<P>
<A NAME="722"><H3>System Policies in a stand-alone Configuration</H3></A><P>
You can also create policies for a stand-alone computer with the <B>Manual Update</B> option by directing Windows&#160;98 to look in a local path for a policy file. This is useful when multiple users are using a stand-alone computer.
<P>
If you want to use system policies on a stand-alone computer, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	In <B>System Policy Editor</B>, click <B>Open Registry</B> on the <B>File</B> menu.
<P>
<LI>	Double-click the <B>Local Computer</B> icon, then the <B>Windows&#160;98 Network</B> icon, and then double-click the <B>Update</B> icon.
<P>
<LI>	Select the <B>Remote Update</B> check box, and then click <B>Manual</B> in the Update Mode box. In the Path box, type the path and file name for your system policy file. You can place this file in any folder on the hard disk. Click <B>OK</B>.
<P>
<LI>	On the <B>File</B> menu, click <B>Save</B>.
<P>
<LI>	On the <B>File</B> menu, click <B>New Policy</B>. Select the system policy settings you want to use.
<P>
<LI>	On the <B>File</B> menu, click <B>Save As</B>. Save the file with the name and path you used in step 3.
<P>
<LI>	Exit <B>System Policy Editor</B>, and then restart Windows&#160;98.
</OL>

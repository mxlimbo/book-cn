<A NAME="806"><H2>Configuring a Dialing Location</H2></A><P>
The Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI) within the Windows&#160;98 operating system makes it possible for you to configure telephone-dialing properties centrally for the entire system. For example, you can create dialing locations that define the dialing requirements for your physical location, including the area code, dialing prefix, and calling card information (see&#160;Figure&#160;18.5).

<P>
Applications for which you can use dialing locations include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The Microsoft Network (MSN)
<P>
<LI>Outlook Express
<P>
<LI>HyperTerminal
<P>
<LI>Dial-Up Networking
</UL>
<P>
You might create two locations on a notebook computer:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>&quot;Home&quot; with an area code of 503, and disabled call waiting.
<P>
<LI>&quot;Office&quot; with an area code of 206, and with a &quot;9,&quot; required to access an outside line.
</UL>
<P>
Then, when using the computer at home, you can use the &quot;Home&quot; location, and when using the computer at work, you can use the &quot;Office&quot; location.
<P>
If you want to configure a dialing location, perform the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	In <B>Control Panel</B>, double-click the <B>Telephony</B> icon.
<P>
<LI>	On the <B>My Locations</B> tab, click <B>New</B> to open a new location.
<P>
<LI>	Type the name, country, and area code for your new location.
<P>
<LI>	Enter any needed information about outside line access, call waiting, or dialing method.
<P>
<LI>	If you are calling using a calling card, click <B>Calling Card</B> to enter information about your calling card, then click <B>OK</B>.
<P>
<LI>	Click <B>OK</B>.
</OL>
<P>
A file called Telephon.ini in the C:\Windows folder stores dialing properties; they are not stored in the Registry.

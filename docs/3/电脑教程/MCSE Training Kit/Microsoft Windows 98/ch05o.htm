<A NAME="238"><H2>Overview of Virtual Machines</H2></A><P>
The virtual machine environment, from the application's perspective, looks as if it is a separate computer, complete with all of the resources available on the physical computer that an application needs to run.
<P>
MS-DOS-based applications in a virtual machine run in virtual 8086 mode (also called V86 mode). In V86 mode, applications run as if they were running on an Intel 8086, or compatible microprocessor. V86 mode provides the resources that real-mode applications are designed to use. This means an MS-DOS-based application in a virtual machine will run successfully without modification. V86 mode also permits execution of protected-mode applications in a virtual machine.
<P>
Each virtual machine has its own address space, I/O port space, and interrupt-vector table. Virtual machines provide memory protection, virtual memory, and privilege checking. A virtual machine cannot read or write to memory addresses that have not been mapped into its address space. They also cannot manipulate I/O ports to which it has not been allowed access.

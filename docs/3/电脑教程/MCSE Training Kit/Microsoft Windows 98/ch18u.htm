<P>
Direct Cable Connection establishes a two-computer network including a host computer and guest computer. If the host computer is connected to a network, the guest computer can also have access to that network. To share resources over Direct Cable Connection, you install Direct Cable Connection and share folders and printers in the same way you would with other local or remote network users.
<P>
Direct Cable Connection supports the following cable types:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Serial null-modem standard (RS-232) cable.
<P>
<LI>Standard, Extended Capabilities Port (ECP), or Universal Cable Module (UCM) parallel cables.
</UL>

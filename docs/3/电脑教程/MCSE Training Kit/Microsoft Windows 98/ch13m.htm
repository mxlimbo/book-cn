<A NAME="589"><H1>Lesson 3: Using Windows&#160;NT Network Resources</H1></A><P>
Windows&#160;98 can connect to and share resources with computers running Windows&#160;NT. This lesson discusses the issues involved with sharing resources with computers running Windows&#160;NT and with other users.
<P>
When you share resources on a Windows&#160;NT network, you can take advantage of the greater security that user-level access control provides. The Access Control List (ACL) determines which users have access to network resources. You can edit the ACL to expand or limit permissions for users.
<P>
User-level access control also allows you to assign permissions, such as read only or full access, to shared files. You assign permissions explicitly or implicitly. For example, you can assign full access to a folder, which means that a user has full access to any subfolders within the parent folder. You can change that implicit permission by assigning an explicit permission to one of the subfolders.

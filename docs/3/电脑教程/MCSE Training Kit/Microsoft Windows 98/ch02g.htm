<A NAME="84"><H2>Dual Booting Windows&#160;98</H2></A><P>
In some cases you may want to have the option of running more than one operating system on your computer. This process is known as <I>dual booting</I>.
<P>
<A NAME="85"><H3>Dual Booting Windows&#160;98 and Windows&#160;NT</H3></A><P>
Dual booting Windows&#160;98 and Windows&#160;NT is not recommended because Windows&#160;98 cannot access Windows&#160;NT File System (NTFS) partitions, and Windows&#160;NT cannot access the FAT32 file system. 
<P>
If you require a dual-boot configuration with Windows&#160;98 and Windows&#160;NT, then you must adhere to the following guidelines:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Install your programs in each operating system. 
<P>
In order to run applications in both operating systems, you must install each application in both Windows&#160;98 and Windows&#160;NT. Any application written exclusively for one operating system can only be installed in the operating system for which it was written.
<P>
<LI>Windows&#160;NT must be set up and configured to dual boot <I>before</I> you set up Windows&#160;98.
<P>
<LI>Windows&#160;98 must be installed in a directory other than the Windows&#160;NT directory.
<P>
<LI>The C drive must be a FAT16 partition with enough free space for the Windows&#160;98 startup files.
<P>
Windows&#160;98 can be installed on any drive that has enough free space and is a FAT partition, but the startup files are always installed on the C drive.
<P>
<LI>To install Windows&#160;98, select Windows&#160;95 from the <B>Boot Loader Operating System Selection</B> menu that appears at system startup. If Windows&#160;95 does not appear on the menu but MS-DOS does, select MS-DOS.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="86"><H3>Dual Booting Windows&#160;98 With Other Operating Systems</H3></A><P>
You can dual boot Windows&#160;98 with MS-DOS 5.0 or later, using the f4 boot-to-previous-operating-system feature, if drive C is FAT16. You cannot dual boot Windows&#160;98 and Windows&#160;95 because they use the same boot files (Io.sys, Command.com, and Msdos.sys).

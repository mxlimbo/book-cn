When Windows&#160;98 is installed, shortcuts to the Windows Update page at <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com" TARGET="_blank">www.microsoft.com</A> are created on the Start  and Settings menus. The first time you visit Windows Update (see Figure 9.5), you are prompted to register as a Windows&#160;98 user. During the registration process, information is gathered so that you can use the Update Wizard to update your drivers and system files.

You can still update device drivers from a floppy disk using Device Manager. The Update Device Driver Wizard in Device Manager can also search Windows Update.

Update Wizard is a link on the Windows Update page which reviews device drivers and system software on your computer, compares those findings with a master database on the Web, then recommends and installs updates specific to your computer. This link provides a single location for installing updated drivers and other system updates.
<P>
Windows Update is implemented through the use of ActiveX controls, which are installed the first time you connect to the Windows Update page. This page appears only if you have a browser that supports ActiveX controls.
<P>
Once these controls are installed, they automatically compare the device drivers installed on your computer with a database of updated drivers on the server. If any drivers found on the server are newer than those on your computer, a list of these new drivers appears. Selecting a specific driver loads a Web page that performs the installation procedure.
<P>
The Windows Update controls will also compare your Windows&#160;98 system file versions to a database of updated system files, as they become available.

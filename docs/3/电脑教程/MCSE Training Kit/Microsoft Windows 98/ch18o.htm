<A NAME="814"><H2>Defining Server Types and Protocols</H2></A><P>
After you create a Dial-Up Networking connection, you can choose different protocols based on the type of remote server to which you are connecting. The default protocol is Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), which is the protocol designed for Internet connections and most other types of connections (see Figure 18.7). Although PPP works with the majority of dial-up connections, if you connect to a server that does not use PPP, you must change the protocol to match that server type.

Windows&#160;98 Dial-Up Networking clients can connect to several types of servers, depending upon the connection protocol used. Connection protocols control the transmission of data over Dial-Up Networking connections. A Windows&#160;98 dial-up client can use the server types and connection protocols shown in the following table.

<P>
The type of connection protocol you choose depends on the server to which you are connecting. Some connection protocols support a subset of the common network protocols. For example, PPP allows you to connect to a network server or a computer running Windows&#160;98 with TCP/IP, IPX/SPX-compatible, or NetBEUI network protocols.
<P>
<A NAME="816"><H3>Point to Point Protocol</H3></A><P>
The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is an Internet-standard line protocol that encapsulates network transport protocols (such as NetBEUI and TCP/IP) across serial links. PPP is the fastest, most secure, and most robust communication protocol supported by Windows&#160;98. Windows&#160;98 dial-up clients can use PPP to connect to any remote access server using PPP, including Windows&#160;NT Server version 3.51 or later.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Note</B>
<P>
PPP is the default protocol for Microsoft Dial-Up Networking.

<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="817"><H3>Serial Line Internet Protocol and Compressed SLIP</H3></A><P>
The Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) is used to connect to UNIX servers. SLIP predates PPP, and therefore is not as fast, robust, or secure as PPP. SLIP does not support IP header compression, performs no error correction or detection, and sends passwords across the line as clear-text. Also, a remote DHCP server cannot assign your client an address over the SLIP protocol; you must configure the IP address manually.
<P>
There are two types of SLIP accounts: uncompressed SLIP and compressed SLIP (CSLIP). You set what type of SLIP account you have for each connection you create in Dial-Up Networking.
<P>
<A NAME="818"><H3>Novell NetWare Connect</H3></A><P>
NetWare Connect 1.0 and 1.1 is a proprietary connection protocol. It enables a computer running Windows&#160;98 to connect directly to a NetWare Connect 1.0 or 1.1 server and, if running a NetWare-compatible network client, to connect to NetWare servers. NetWare Connect 2.0 supports PPP.
<P>
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Tip</B>
<P>
If your computer running Windows&#160;98 is connected to a NetWare server on the local network, you cannot log on to a NetWare server over the dial-up adapter. Attempting to do so results in a dialog box that requests you to log off of the local NetWare server before proceeding.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="819"><H3>Windows&#160;NT 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups (Asynchronous NetBEUI)</H3></A><P>
Asynchronous NetBEUI connects computers running Windows&#160;98 to remote access servers running Windows&#160;NT Server 3.1 LAN Manager, or Windows for Workgroups 3.11. Windows&#160;NT Server 3.5 and later also support Asynchronous NetBEUI. The remote access server must also be running NetBEUI.

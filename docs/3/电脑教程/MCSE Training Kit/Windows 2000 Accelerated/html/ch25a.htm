<h2><a name="1764">About This Chapter</a></h2>


<p>Two of the top requirements for a business operating system are high reliability and availability. In the context of an operating system, <i>reliability</i> refers to how consistently a server runs applications and services, while <i>availability</i> refers to the amount of time a system can be used. Reliability is increased by reducing the potential causes of system failure. Availability is increased by addressing the causes of downtime. In other words, reliable and available systems resist failure and are easy to restart after they have been shut down. This chapter focuses on planning on preventing a disaster and implementing disaster protection. In addition, the chapter reviews several approaches to disaster recovery to assist you should your system fail.</p>

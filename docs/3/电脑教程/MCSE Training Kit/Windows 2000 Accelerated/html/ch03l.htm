<h1><a name="363">Lesson 11: Managing Documents</a></h1>


<p>In addition to managing printers, Windows 2000 allows you to manage individual documents. Managing documents includes pausing, resuming, restarting, and canceling a document if a printing problem occurs. In addition, you can set someone to notify when a print job is finished, set the priority to allow a critical document to print before other documents, and set a specific time for a document to print.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Pause, resume, restart, and cancel the printing of a document</li>

<li>Set a notification, priority, and printing time</li>

<li>Delete a document from the print queue</li>
</ul>



<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 20 minutes</b></p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="364">Pausing, Restarting, and Canceling a Document</a></h2>


<p>If a printing problem occurs with a specific document, you can pause and resume printing of the document.You can also restart or cancel printing of a document. You must have the Manage Documents permission for the appropriate printer to perform these actions. Because the creator of a document has the default permissions to manage that document, users can perform any of these actions on their own documents.</p>

<p>To manage a document, right-click the printing device for the document and click Open. Select the appropriate document(s), click the Document menu, and then click the appropriate command to pause, resume, start from the beginning, or cancel a document.</p>

<h2><a name="365">Setting Notification, Priority, and Printing Time</a></h2>


<p>You can control print jobs by setting the notification, priority, and printing time. To perform these document management tasks, you must have the Manage Documents permission for the appropriate printer.</p>

<p>You set the notification, priority, and printing time for a document on the General tab of the Properties dialog box for the document, as shown in Figure 3.27. To open the Properties dialog box for one or more documents, first select the documents in the printer's window, click the Document menu, and then click Properties.</p>

<p>Table 3.17 describes the tasks that you might perform when you control print jobs, how to perform the tasks, and examples of situations in which you might perform these tasks.</p>

<h2><a name="366">Practice: Managing Documents</a></h2>

<p>In this practice, you manage documents by printing a document, setting a notification for a document, changing the priority for a document, and then canceling a document.</p>

<h2><a name="367">Lesson Summary</a></h2>


<p>In this lesson, you learned that managing documents includes pausing, resuming, restarting, and canceling a document; setting who is notified when a print job is finished; setting the document priority to allow a critical document to print before other documents; and setting a specific time for a document to print. You must have the Manage Documents permission for the appropriate printer to perform these actions. The creator of a document has the default permissions to manage that document, so users can perform any of these actions on their own documents.</p>

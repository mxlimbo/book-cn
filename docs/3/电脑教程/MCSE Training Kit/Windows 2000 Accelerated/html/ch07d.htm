<h1><a name="542">Lesson 3: Configuring Account Policies</a></h1>


<p>In <a href="ch04a.htm">Chapter 4</a>, &quot;Managing User Accounts,&quot; you learned about assigning user account passwords and how to unlock an account that was locked by the system. In this lesson, you learn how to improve the security of users' passwords and how to control when the system locks out a user account.</p>

<hr />
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Configure Account Policies</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 35 minutes</b></p>

<h2><a name="543">Configuring Password Policy</a></h2>


<p>Password Policy allows you to improve security on your computer by controlling how passwords are created and managed. You can specify the maximum length of time a password can be used before the user must change it. Changing passwords decreases the chances of an unauthorized person breaking into your computer. If a hacker has discovered a user account and password combination for your computer, forcing users to change their passwords regularly will cause the user account and password combination to fail and lock the hacker out of the system.</p>

<p>Other settings are available in Password Policy that you can use to improve your computer's security. For example, you can specify a minimum password length. The longer the password, the more difficult it is to discover. You can also maintain a history of the passwords used and block users from reusing their most recently used passwords. This prevents a user from having only a few passwords and alternating between them.</p>

<p>You can configure Password Policy on a computer running Windows 2000 Professional by using Group Policy or Local Security Policy.</p>

<p><b>Follow these steps to configure Password Policy using Group Policy:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Use the MMC to create a custom console, add the Group Policy snap-in, and save it with the name Group Policy.</li>

<li>Expand Local Computer Policy. Then, under Computer Configuration, expand Windows Settings, expand Security Settings, expand Account Policies, and then click on Password Policy.</li>

<li>Select the setting you want to configure, and then, on the Action menu, click Security.</li>
</ol>

<p>The console displays the current Password Policy settings in the details pane, as shown in Figure 7.4.</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Setting</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Enforce Password History</td><td>The value you enter in this setting indicates the number of passwords to be kept in a password history.<p>A value of 0 indicates that no password history is being kept. This is the default.</p>
<p>You can set the value from 0 to 24, indicating the number of passwords to be kept in password history. This value indicates the number of new passwords that a user must access before he or she can reuse an old password.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>Maximum Password Age</td><td>The value you enter in this setting is the number of days a user 
can access a password before he or she is required to change it.<p>A value of 0 indicates that the password will not expire.</p><p>The default value is 42 days. You can set the range of values from 0 to 999 days.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>Minimum Password Age</td><td>The value you enter in this setting is the number of days a user 
must keep a password before he or she can change it.<p>A value of 0 indicates that the password can be changed immediately. This is the default. If you are enforcing password history, you should not set this value to 0.</p>
<p>You can set the range of values from 0 to 999 days. This value indicates how long the user must wait before changing his or her password again. Use this value to prevent a user who was forced by the system to change his or her password from immediately changing it back to the old password.</p><p>The minimum password age must be less than the maximum password age.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>Minimum Password Length</td><td>The value you enter in this setting is the minimum number of characters required in a password. The value can range from 0 up to 14 characters inclusive.<p>A value of 0 indicates that no password is required. This is the default value.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td>Passwords Must Meet Complexity Requirements</td><td>The options are Enabled or Disabled.<p>The default is Disabled.</p><p>If enabled, all passwords must meet or exceed the specified minimum password length; must comply with the password history settings; must contain capitals, numerals or punctuation; and cannot contain the user's account or full name.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td>Store Password Using Reversible Encryption For All Users In The Domain</td><td>The options are Enabled or Disabled. The default is Disabled. This enables Windows 2000 to store a reversibly encrypted password for all users in the domain&#8212;for example to be used with the Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP). This option is only applicable if your computer running Windows 2000 Professional is in a domain.</td></tr>

<p>By carefully planning and configuring your Password Policy options, you can improve the security of your computer by decreasing the chances of an unauthorized user gaining access to it.</p>

<h2><a name="544">Configuring Account Lockout Policy</a></h2>


<p>The Account Lockout Policy settings also allow you to improve the security on your computer. If no account lockout policy is in place, an unauthorized user can repeatedly try to break into your computer. If, however, you have set an account lockout policy, the system will lock out the user account under the conditions you specify in Account Lockout Policy.</p>

<p>You access Account Lockout Policy using either the Group Policy snap-in or the Local Security Settings window, just as you did to configure Password Policy. The Group Policy console displaying the current Account Lockout Policy settings in the details pane is shown in Figure 7.6.</p>

<h2><a name="549">Lesson Summary</a></h2>


<p>In this lesson, you learned that the Windows 2000 Local Security Settings window allows you to improve the security on your computer by making it more difficult for an unauthorized user to gain access to it. Using the Password Policy settings is one method you can use to improve the security on your computer. Setting Password Policy allows you to manage the passwords used on your computer. For example, Password Policy includes settings that allow you to force users to change their passwords regularly and to control the minimum length of a password.</p>

<p>You also learned about using another method of improving security on your computer: Account Lockout Policy. If no Account Lockout Policy settings are in place, an unauthorized user can repeatedly try to break into your computer. Using Account Lockout Policy, you can determine how many invalid logon attempts must be made before a user account is locked out of the computer. Account Lockout Policy also allows you to determine how long the account will be locked out; you can even set Account Lockout Policy to require that an administrator manually unlock the user account. In the practice portion of the lesson, you set and tested various account settings.</p>

<h1><a name="29">Conventions</a></h1>

<p>The following conventions are used throughout this book.</p>

<h3><a name="30">Notational Conventions</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>Characters or commands that you type appear in <b>bold</b>
type.</li>

<li><i>Italic</i> in syntax statements indicates placeholders for
variable information. <i>Italic</i> is also used for book titles.</li>

<li>Names of files and folders appear in Title Caps, except when you
are to type them directly. Unless otherwise indicated, you can use all
lowercase letters when you type a filename in a dialog box or at a
command prompt.</li>

<li>Filename extensions appear in all lowercase.</li>

<li>Acronyms appear in all uppercase.</li>

<li><code>Monospace</code> type represents code samples, examples of screen text,
or entries that you might type at a command prompt or in initialization
files.</li>

<li>Square brackets [ ] are used in syntax statements to enclose
optional items. For example, [<i>filename</i>] in command syntax
indicates that you can choose to type a filename with the command. Type
only the information within the brackets, not the brackets
themselves.</li>

<li>Braces { } are used in syntax statements to enclose required
items. Type only the information within the braces, not the braces
themselves.</li>

<li>Icons represent specific sections in the book as follows:</li>
</ul>

<tr>
<td><img src="images/cdrom.jpg" /></td>
<td>A file contained on the CD-ROM. Some files are needed to complete a
hands-on practice. The purpose of the file and its location are
described in the accompanying text.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="images/multi.jpg" /></td>
<td>A multimedia presentation. You will find the applicable multimedia
presentation on the course compact disc.</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="images/practice.jpg" /></td>

yourself an opportunity to use the skills being presented in the
lesson.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="images/quest.jpg" /></td>
<td>Chapter review questions. These questions at the end of each chapter
allow you to test what you have learned in the lessons. You will find
the answers to the review questions in the Questions and Answers
section at the end of the book.</td>
</tr>

<h3><a name="31">Keyboard Conventions</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>A plus sign (+) between two key names means that you must press
those keys at the same time. For example, &quot;Press Alt+Tab&quot;
means that you hold down Alt while you press Tab.</li>

<li>A comma ( , ) between two or more key names means that you must
press each of the keys consecutively, not together. For example,
&quot;Press Alt, F, X&quot; means that you press and release each key
in sequence. &quot;Press Alt+W, L&quot; means that you first press Alt
and W together, and then release them and press L.</li>

<li>You can choose menu commands with the keyboard. Press the Alt key
to activate the menu bar, and then sequentially press the keys that
correspond to the highlighted or underlined letter of the menu name and
the command name. For some commands, you can also press a key
combination listed on the menu.</li>

<li>You can select or clear check boxes or option buttons in dialog
boxes with the keyboard. Press the Alt key, and then press the key that
corresponds to the underlined letter of the option name. Or you can
press Tab until the option is highlighted, and then press the spacebar
to select or clear the check box or option button.</li>

<li>You can cancel the display of a dialog box by pressing the Esc
key.</li>
</ul>

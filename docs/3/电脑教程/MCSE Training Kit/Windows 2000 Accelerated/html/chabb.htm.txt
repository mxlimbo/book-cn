<h1><a name="1971">Lesson 1: Overview of Services for UNIX</a></h1>


<p>To connect a computer running Windows 2000 Professional to UNIX computers, you need protocols and services that allow the two networking systems to communicate with each other. Windows 2000 Professional uses the Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol for file and print services. CIFS is an enhanced version of the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. UNIX, however, uses the Network File System (NFS) protocol for file services and, for print services, uses Line Printer (LPR)/Line Printer Daemon (LPD) or personal computer network file system daemon (PCNFSD).</p>

<p>Services for UNIX 2.0 implements a subset of Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network protocols that enables interoperability of Windows 2000 Professional and UNIX. Services for UNIX 2.0 provides a set of additional features to Windows NT and Windows 2000 that allow for greater interoperability with existing UNIX servers in the enterprise.</p>

<p>Services for UNIX 2.0 is made up of multiple components that allow you to interoperate Windows 2000 Professional and UNIX in the way that best fits your environment.</p>

<p>To use Services for UNIX 2.0, you need:</p>

<ul>
<li>A computer with 60 megabytes (MB) of available hard disk space and 16 MB of RAM running on top of the recommended configuration of Windows 2000 Professional, Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Advanced Server, Windows NT Workstation

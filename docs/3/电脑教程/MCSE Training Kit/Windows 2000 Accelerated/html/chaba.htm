<h2><a name="1969">About This Chapter</a></h2>


<p>Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX (SFU) version 1.0 was introduced in 1999 and quickly became a significant tool in the arsenal of those trying to make Windows NT and UNIX coexist on the same network. With the introduction of version 2.0 of Services for UNIX, Microsoft has taken a huge leap forward, adding new features and significantly enhancing the features from the initial version, while providing seamless integration into both Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4 networks.</p>

<p>This chapter provides you with an overview of SFU and how to install and configure SFU version 2.0.</p>

<h1><a name="1627">Managing Microsoft Windows 2000 Terminal Services</a></h1>


<h2><a name="1628">About This Chapter</a></h2>


<p>Microsoft Windows 2000 Terminal Services allows client computers to access Windows 2000 and the latest Windows applications from a central server. This shared method of using the operating system and applications means that client computers can be smaller and less expensive than those used with previous operating systems.</p>

<p>This chapter describes Terminal Services, what tools are included with the feature, and how to install Terminal Services. An important aspect of Terminal Services is managing the appropriate software licensing. The chapter explains the various Terminal Services licensing components. The chapter ends with a discussion on deploying Terminal Services to client computers.</p>

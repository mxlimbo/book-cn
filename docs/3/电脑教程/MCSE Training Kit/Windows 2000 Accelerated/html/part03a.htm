<h1><a name="2087">Active Directory Directory Service </a></h1>


<p>Part 3 contains most of the information that relates to the Windows 2000 Active Directory portion of the 70-240 exam. This includes installing and configuring, managing network protocols, configuring desktops, and maintaining security. The chapters in this part primarily use Windows 2000 Server during the various hands-on practices and exercises. However, much of the information presented here is also applicable to Windows 2000 Professional.</p>

<p>Active Directory is the directory service included in Windows 2000 Server. It stores information about objects on a network and makes this information available to users and network administrators. Active Directory gives network users access to permitted resources anywhere on the network using a single logon process. It provides network administrators with an intuitive hierarchical view of the network and a single point of administration for all network objects.</p>

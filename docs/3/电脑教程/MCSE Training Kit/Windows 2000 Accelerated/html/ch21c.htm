<h2><a name="1554">Understanding Auditing</a></h2>


<p><i>Auditing</i> in Microsoft Windows 2000 is the process of tracking both user activities and Windows 2000 activities, which are called <i>events,</i> on a computer. Through auditing, you can specify which events are written to the security log. For example, the security log can maintain a record of valid and invalid logon attempts and events relating to creating, opening, or deleting files or other objects. An audit entry in the security log contains the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>The action that was performed</li>

<li>The user who performed the action</li>

<li>The success or failure of the event and when the event occurred</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="1555">Using an Audit Policy</a></h2>


<p>An <i>audit policy</i> defines the categories of events that Windows 2000 records in the security log on each computer. The security log allows you to track the events that you specify.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 writes events to the security log on the computer where the event occurs. For example, any time someone tries to log on to the domain using a domain user account and the logon attempt fails, Windows 2000 writes an event to the security log on the domain controller. The event is recorded on the domain controller rather than on the computer at which the logon attempt was made because it is the domain controller that attempted to and could not authenticate the logon attempt.</p>

<p>You can set up an audit policy for a computer to do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Track the success and failure of events, such as logon attempts by users, an attempt by a particular user to read a specific file, changes to a user account or to group memberships, and changes to your security settings</li>

<li>Eliminate or minimize the risk of unauthorized use of resources</li>
</ul>

<p>You use Event Viewer to view events that Windows 2000 has recorded in the security log. You can also archive log files to track trends over time&#8212;for example, to determine the use of printers or files or to verify attempts at unauthorized use of resources.</p>

<h2><a name="1556">Audit Policy Guidelines</a></h2>


<p>When you plan an audit policy you must determine on which computers to set up auditing. Auditing is turned off by default. As you are determining which computers to audit, you must also plan the events to audit on each computer. Windows 2000 records audited events on each computer separately.</p>

<p>After you have determined the events to audit, you must determine whether to audit the success of events, failure of events, or both. Tracking successful events can tell you how often Windows 2000 or users gain access to specific files, printers, or other objects. You can use this information for resource planning. Tracking failed events can alert you to possible security breaches. For example, if you notice several failed logon attempts by a certain user account, especially if these attempts are occurring outside normal business hours, you can assume that an unauthorized person is attempting to break into your system.</p>

<p>Other guidelines in determining your audit policy include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Determine if you need to track trends of system usage.</b> If so, plan to archive event logs. Archiving these logs allows you to view how usage changes over time and to plan to increase system resources before they become a problem.</li>

<li><b>Review security logs frequently.</b> You should set a schedule and regularly review security logs because configuring auditing alone does not alert you to security breaches.</li>

<li><b>Define an audit policy that is useful and manageable.</b> Always audit sensitive and confidential data. Audit only those events that provide you with meaningful information about your network environment. This minimizes use of server resources and makes essential information easier to locate. Auditing too many types of events can create excess overhead for Windows 2000.</li>

<li><b>Audit resource access by the Everyone group instead of the Users group.</b> This ensures that you audit anyone who can connect to the network, not just the users for whom you create user accounts in the domain. You should also audit resource access failures by the Everyone group.</li>

<li><b>Audit all administrative tasks by the administrative groups.</b> This ensures that you audit any additions or changes made by administrators.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="1557">Configuring Auditing</a></h2>


<p>You implement an audit policy based on the role of the computer in the Windows 2000 network. Auditing is configured differently for the following types of computers running Windows 2000:</p>

<ul>
<li>For member or standalone servers, or computers running Windows 2000 Professional, an audit policy is set for each individual computer. To audit events that occur on a local computer, you configure a local group policy for that computer, which applies to that computer only.</li>

<li>For domain controllers, an audit policy is set for all domain controllers in the domain. To audit events that occur on domain controllers, you configure the audit policy in a nonlocal GPO for the domain, which applies to all domain controllers and is accessible through the Domain Controllers OU.</li>
</ul>

<p>The event categories on a domain controller are identical to those on a computer that is not a domain controller.</p>

<h3><a name="1558">Auditing Requirements</a></h3>


<p>The requirements to set up and administer auditing are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>You must have the Manage Auditing And Security Log user right for the computer where you want to configure an audit policy or review an audit log. By default, Windows 2000 grants these rights to the Administrators group.</li>

<li>The files and folders to be audited must be on NT file system (NTFS) volumes.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="1559">Setting Up Auditing</a></h3>


<p>Setting up auditing is a two-part process:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Set the audit policy.</b> The audit policy enables auditing of objects but does not activate auditing of specific objects.</li>
<li><b>Enable auditing of specific resources.</b> You specify the specific events to audit for files, folders, printers, and Active Directory objects. Windows 2000 then tracks and logs the specified events.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="1560">Setting Up an Audit Policy</a></h2>


<p>The first step in implementing an audit GPO is selecting the categories of events that Windows 2000 audits. For each event category that you can audit, the configuration settings indicate whether to track successful or failed attempts. You set audit policies in the Group Policy snap-in. The security log is limited in size. Select the events to be audited carefully and consider the amount of disk space you are willing to devote to the security log. Table 21.1 describes the event categories that Windows 2000 can audit.</p>

<p><b>Table 21.1</b> <i>Types of Events Audited by Windows 2000</i></p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Event Category</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>Account logon</td>
<td>A domain controller received a request to validate a user account.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Account management</td>
<td>An administrator created, changed, or deleted a user account or group. A user account was renamed, disabled, or enabled, or a password was set or changed.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Directory service access</td>
<td>A user gained access to an Active Directory object. You must configure specific Active Directory objects for auditing to log this type of event.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Logon events</td>
<td>A user logged on or logged off, or a user made or canceled a network connection to the computer.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Object access</td>
<td>A user gained access to a file, folder, or printer. You must configure specific files, folders, or printers for auditing. Directory service access is auditing a user's access to specific Active Directory objects. Object access is auditing a user's access to files, folders, and printers.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Policy change</td>
<td>A change was made to the user security options, user rights, or audit policies.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Privilege use</td>
<td>A user exercised a right, such as changing the system time (this does not include rights that are related to logging on and logging off).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Process tracking</td>
<td>A program performed an action. This information is generally useful only for programmers who want to track details of program execution.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>System events</td>
<td>A user restarted or shut down the computer, or an event occurred that affects Windows 2000 security or the security log (for example, the audit log is full and Windows 2000 discards entries).</td>

<p><b>Follow these steps to set an audit policy for a domain controller:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Open Active Directory Users and Computers.</li>

<li>In the console tree, right-click Domain Controllers, and then click Properties.</li>

<li>In the Group Policy tab, click the policy in which you want set the audit policy, and then click Edit.</li>

<li>In the Group Policy snap-in, in the console tree, click Computer Configuration, double-click Windows Settings, double-click Security Settings, double-click Local Policies, and then double-click Audit Policy.

<p>The console displays the current audit policy settings in the details pane, as shown in Figure 21.2.</p>

<li>In the Template Security Policy Setting dialog box (see Figure 21.3), click Define These Policy Settings In The Template, and then click one or both:

<ul>
<li>Success, to audit successful attempts for the event category</li>

<li>Failure, to audit failed attempts for the event category</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Click OK.</li>

<li>Because the changes that you make to your computer's audit policy take effect only when the policy is propagated (applied) to your computer, do one of the following to initiate policy propagation:

<ul>
<li>Type <b>secedit /refreshpolicy machine_policy</b> at the command prompt, and then press Enter.</li>

<li>Restart your computer.</li>

<li>Wait for automatic policy propagation, which occurs at regular, con-figurable intervals. By default, policy propagation occurs every 8 hours.</li>

<h2><a name="1561">Auditing Access to Files and Folders</a></h2>


<p>If security breaches are an issue for your organization, you can set up auditing for files and folders on NTFS partitions. To audit user access to files and folders, you must first set the Audit Object Access event category, which includes files and folders, in the audit policy.</p>

<p>Once you have set Audit Object Access in your audit policy, you enable auditing for specific files and folders and specify which types of access to audit (by users or groups).</p>

<p><b>Follow these steps to set up auditing for specific files and folders:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>In Windows Explorer, right-click the file or folder you want to audit, and then click Properties.</li>

<li>In the Security tab in the Properties dialog box for a file or folder, click Advanced.</li>

<li>In the Access Control Settings For dialog box for the file or folder, in the Auditing tab, click Add, select the users and groups for whom you want to audit file and folder access, and then click OK.</li>

<h2><a name="1562">Auditing Access to Active Directory Objects</a></h2>


<p>As with auditing file and folder access, to audit Active Directory object access you must configure an audit policy and then set auditing for specific objects, such as users, computers, OUs, or groups, by specifying which types of access and access by which users to audit. You audit Active Directory objects to track access to Active Directory objects, such as changing the properties on a user account. To enable auditing of user access to Active Directory objects, set the Audit Directory Service Access event category in the audit policy.</p>

<p><b>Follow these steps to set up auditing for specific Active Directory objects:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>In Active Directory Users and Computers, click View, and then click Advanced Features.</li>

<li>Select the object that you want to audit, click Properties on the Action menu, click the Security tab, and then click the Advanced button.</li>

<h2><a name="1563">Auditing Access to Printers</a></h2>


<p>Audit access to printers to track access to sensitive printers. To audit access to printers, set the Audit Object Access event category in your audit policy, which includes printers.

<h2><a name="1565">Practice: Auditing Resources and Events</a></h2>


<p>In this practice you plan a domain audit policy. You then set up an audit policy for a domain controller by enabling auditing of certain events. You set up auditing of a file, a printer, and an Active Directory object.</p>

<h3><a name="1566">Exercise 1: Planning a Domain Audit Policy</a></h3>


<p>In this exercise you plan an audit policy for your server. You need to determine the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Which types of events to audit</li>

<li>Whether to audit the success or failure of an event, or both</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the following criteria to make your decisions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Record unsuccessful attempts to gain access to the network.</li>

<li>Record unauthorized access to the files that make up the Customer database.</li>

<li>For billing purposes, track color printer usage.</li>

<li>Track whenever someone tries to tamper with the server hardware.</li>

<li>Keep a record of actions that an administrator performs to track unauthorized changes.</li>

<li>Track backup procedures to prevent data theft.</li>

<li>Track unauthorized access to sensitive Active Directory objects.</li>
</ul>

<p>Record your decisions to audit successful events, failed events, or both for the actions listed in Table 21.7.</p>

<h2><a name="1571">Lesson Summary</a></h2>


<p>In this lesson you learned how to set up an audit policy. The first step in implementing an audit policy is selecting the event categories that Windows 2000 audits. For each event that you can audit, the configuration settings indicate whether to track successful or failed attempts.</p>

<p>For member or standalone servers, or computers running Windows 2000 Professional, an audit policy is set for each individual computer. To audit events that occur on a local computer, you configure a local group policy for that computer, which applies to that computer only.</p>

<p>For domain controllers, an audit policy is set for all domain controllers in the domain. To audit events that occur on domain controllers, you configure a nonlocal group policy for the domain, which applies to all domain controllers.</p>

<p>In the practice portion of this lesson you planned a domain audit policy; set up an audit policy for a domain controller; and set up auditing of a file, a printer, and an Active Directory object.</p>

<h1>About This Electronic Book</h1>

<p>This electronic book was originally created&#8212;and still may be purchased&#8212;as a print book. For simplicity, the electronic version of this book has been modified as little as possible from its original form. For instance, there may be occasional references to sample files that come with the book. These files are available with the print version, but are not provided in this electronic edition.</p>

<h2>&#8220;Expanding&#8221; Graphics</h2>

<p>Many of the graphics shown in this book are quite large. To improve the readability of the book, reduced versions of these graphics are shown in the text. To see a full-size version, click on the reduced graphic.</p>

<h2>External Links</h2>

<p>This electronic book may contain links to Web sites. We have made every effort to ensure that all hyperlinks within the text were valid at the time this electronic book was published. However, because of the nature of the World Wide Web, we cannot guarantee that all links to Web sites are still valid after the release date of the electronic book.</p>

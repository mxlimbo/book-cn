<h2><a name="156">About This Chapter</a></h2>


<p>With Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional, all aspects of installing, configuring, and managing hardware devices and their associated drivers are improved over previous versions of Windows. Plug and Play hardware is supported and non-Plug and Play devices can be easily installed and configured.</p>

<p>As the various devices are installed and configured, Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional stores this information in two locations: the registry and the directory services based on Active Directory technology. Modifications to the registry or Active Directory directory services change the configuration of the Windows 2000 environment. You use the following tools to modify the registry or Active Directory directory services:</p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft Management Console</li>

<li>Device Manager</li>

<li>Control Panel</li>

<li>Registry Editor</li>
</ul>



<p>As a Windows NT 4 professional, you should already be familiar with using the Control Panel and Registry Editor. This chapter begins with a discussion of the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) and how it is used to manage and monitor hardware. You will have the opportunity to use the MMC in the various exercises presented throughout this chapter The hardware topics discussed include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Disk management</li>

<li>Power management</li>

<li>Monitoring hardware performance</li>
</ul>



<p>The chapter concludes with an overview of using the Performance Console to monitor system performance.</p>

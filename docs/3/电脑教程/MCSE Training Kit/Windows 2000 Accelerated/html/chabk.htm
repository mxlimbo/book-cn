<h1><a name="2027">Lesson 8: Configuring Telnet and FTP Client Services</a></h1>


<p>While file and print sharing are requirements common to most network operating systems, UNIX installations often have the additional requirement of terminal access for workstations. In this way, UNIX environments bear more similarity to mainframe (S/390, AS/400) and other existing systems (VAX/VMS). In addition, in some environments where NFS is not in use, users must use File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to access files on the file system of their UNIX server.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 Professional provides both FTP and telnet clients. SFU provides a telnet client that contains more features than the Windows 2000 Telnet Client.</p>

<hr />
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Install Telnet Client</li>

<li>Install FTP client</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 10 minutes</b></p>

<h2><a name="2028">Installing and Using Telnet Client</a></h2>


<p>Windows 2000 Professional Telnet Client is automatically installed in the %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32 (Usually C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32) directory.</p>

<p>If you install SFU, the telnet client is installed as part of the Typical install and placed in %SFUDIR% (Usually C:\SFU). The Windows 2000 Telnet Client is retained in %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32.</p>

<p>If you do not need any of the other UNIX services on SFU (most notably, the NFS Client and the Windows NT Telnet Server), the Windows 2000 Professional Telnet Client is probably adequate for your needs. The SFU Telnet Client has been optimized for use in conjunction with the Windows NT Telnet Server, most notably allowing it to use NTLM authentication rather than clear text.</p>

<p><b>To use the Windows 2000 Professional Telnet Client, perform the following steps:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Click Start, and then click Run.</li>

<li>In the Open text-box, type <b>telnet</b> and then click OK.
<p>Telnet Client is displayed in a command-prompt-style window.</p>
<p>You are now ready to connect to the remote telnet server.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><b>Follow these steps to use the SFU Telnet Client:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Click Start, point to Programs, and point to Windows Services for UNIX.</li>

<li>Click Telnet Client.</li>
</ol>

<p>Telnet Client is displayed in a command-prompt-style window. You are now ready to connect to the remote telnet server.</p>

<p>There are some configuration options available for the telnet client, but the default configuration should serve most installations. For information on the configurable options, type <b>set ?</b> at the telnet prompt.</p>

<p>Because Telnet sends user credentials in clear text, which is vulnerable to packet capture, there are some security concerns. If you are using Telnet with Windows 2000 systems only, it is recommended that you use the NTLM option. This option prevents the transmission of user credentials in clear text. If you are using Telnet with UNIX systems, you should see your UNIX administrator as he or she may be using a product called Secure SHell (SSH) rather than Telnet. SSH clients are available for Windows-based systems from third-party vendors.</p>

<blockquote><div class="warning"><b>WARNING</b><hr />Under no circumstances should you use unencrypted telnet on the public Internet. This represents a significant security risk. If you need telnet access across the Internet use a VPN solution, such as L2TP, to secure the connection across the public network.</div></blockquote>

<h2><a name="2029">Installing and Using File Transport Protocol Client</a></h2>


<p>FTP has become an integral part of the Internet, along with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Microsoft has worked to make FTP access more transparent to users than ever before with Windows 2000 Professional. Windows 2000 Professional automatically installs a command-line FTP client. More importantly, FTP (as well as HTTP) are integrated into the Windows Explorer My Network Places to allow users to access FTP resources as they would access Windows, NetWare, and NFS (when using SFU) file shares. Finally, FTP support is included in Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0, allowing users to browse FTP resources.</p>

<p><b>Follow these steps to add an FTP server to My Network Places:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Double-click My Network Places on the desktop.</li>

<li>Double-click Add Network Place.</li>

<li>In the Add Network Place wizard, type the URL for the FTP site and click Next.</li>

<li>If you are going to access the FTP site as an anonymous user, leave the Log On Anonymously box checked. Otherwise, clear it, and enter your username.</li>

<li>Click Next.</li>

<li>Type a friendly, meaningful name in the Enter A Name For This Network Place text box, and then click OK.</li>
</ol>

<p>After you have completed adding the FTP site as a network place, it is present in the My Network Places pane of Windows Explorer. To connect to the FTP site, simply click the shortcut and the contents of the FTP site will be shown:</p>

<p><b>Follow these steps to connect to an FTP server using the command-line FTP client:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Click Start, then click Run.</li>

<li>In the Open text-box, type FTP and click OK. The FTP client is displayed in a command-prompt style window.
<p>You are now ready to connect to the remote FTP server.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><b>Follow these steps to connect to an FTP server using Internet Explorer:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Double-click Internet Explorer on the desktop.</li>

<li>Click on the File Menu, choose Open and enter the URL in the Open text-box, and click OK. Internet Explorer now opens the FTP site, with you logged on as &quot;Anonymous.&quot;</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="2030">Lesson Summary</a></h2>


<p>SFU provides both FTP and Telnet clients. The Telnet Client is automatically enabled when Windows 2000 Professional is installed. You enable the FTP client by using the Add Network Place wizard.</p>

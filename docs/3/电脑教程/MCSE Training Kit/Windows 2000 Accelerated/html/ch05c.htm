<h1><a name="447">Lesson 2: Configuring Inbound Connections</a></h1>


<p>In Windows 2000 Professional, all of the processes for creating network connections are consolidated in the Network Connection wizard. An inbound connection is one type of network connection that you can create using the Network Connection wizard.</p>

<hr />
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Configure inbound connections in Windows 2000</li>

<li>Configure remote access to allow incoming virtual private network (VPN) connections</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 20 minutes</b></p>
<hr />

<h2><a name="448">Allowing Inbound Dial-up Connections</a></h2>


<p>To configure and administer inbound connections on a computer running Windows 2000 Professional, you use the Network Connection wizard.</p>

<ol>
<li>To access the Network Connection wizard, click Start.</li>

<li>Point to Settings, click Network Connections.</li>

<li>Double-click Make New Connection.

<p>The Welcome to the Network Connection wizard appears.</p></li>

<li>Click Next to continue, and the Network Connection Type page appears.</li>

<li>Select Accept Incoming Connections (see Figure 5.7).</li>
</ol>

</div>
</div>


<h3><a name="449">Configuring Devices for Incoming Connections</a></h3>


<p>Once you have selected Accept Incoming Connections, click Next. The Devices For Incoming Connections page appears, so you can choose one of the available devices on your computer to accept incoming calls. If the device you select is configurable, click the Properties button to configure it. For example, if you have selected a modem, possible options to configure include port speed, compression, and the type of flow control (see Figure 5.8). The Advanced tab contains additional configurable options that might include the number of data bits, parity, and number of stop bits.</p>

<h3><a name="450">Allowing Virtual Private Connections</a></h3>


<p>When you have finished configuring the device, click OK to close the Properties dialog box and then click Next on the Devices For Incoming Connection page. The Incoming Virtual Private Connection page appears. Select the appropriate check box either to allow or not allow virtual private connections, and then click Next.</p>

<h3><a name="451">Specifying Users and Callback Options</a></h3>


<p>You must specify which users can access this inbound connection on the Allowed Users page, as shown in Figure 5.9.</p>

<div class="figure">
<a href="javascript:fullSize('F05cc09x.htm')"><img src="images/F05cc09.JPG" /></a>
<div class="caption"><b>Figure 5.9</b> <i>Specifying the users who can access this inbound connection</i>
</div>
</div>


<p>After you select a user, click Properties and click the Callback tab to set the callback options. You can select Do Not Allow Callback, Allow The Caller To Set The Callback Number, or Always Use The Following Callback Number. Enabling callback causes the remote server, in this case your computer, to disconnect from the client calling in, and then to call the client computer back.</p>

<p>By using callback, you can have the bill for the telephone call charged to your telephone number rather than to the telephone number of the user who called in. You can also use callback to increase security. If you specify the callback number, you don't have to worry about someone trying to break in. Even if an unauthorized user calls in, the system calls back at the number you specified, not the number of the unauthorized user.</p>

<h3><a name="452">Selecting Networking Components</a></h3>


<p>After you specify the callback options you can select the appropriate network components.</p>

<p>Click Next, and the Networking Components page appears. You can choose the networking components you want to enable for incoming connections. You can also install additional networking components by clicking Install.</p>

<p><b> For example, follow these steps to install NWLink IPX/SPX/NetBIOS Compatible Transport Protocol:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Click Install.</li>

<li>Select Protocol.</li>

<li>Click Add.</li>

<li>On the Select Network Protocol page, select NWLink IPX/SPX/NetBIOS Compatible Transport Protocol.</li>

<li>Insert the Windows 2000 Professional CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive,</li>

<li>Click OK.

<p>Windows 2000 installs the protocol.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>After the protocol is installed, you are returned to the Networking Components page. When you click Next, you are prompted to type a name for the connection. You should then click Finish. If you would like a shortcut to appear on your desktop, select the Add A Shortcut To My Desktop check box. Click Finish to create the connection.</p>

<h2><a name="454">Lesson Summary</a></h2>


<p>In this lesson, you learned that you configure inbound connections in Windows 2000 Professional by using the Network Connection wizard. You can choose which of the available devices on your computer to have accept incoming calls. If these devices are configurable, you can click the Properties button to configure them. You must also specify which user accounts can use inbound connections. For each user account, you can specify whether to allow callback and, if allowed, whether you or the caller should specify the callback number.</p>

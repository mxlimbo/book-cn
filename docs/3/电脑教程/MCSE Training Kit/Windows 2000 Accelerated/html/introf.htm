<h2><a name="2076">Using the Windows Security Dialog Box</a></h2>


<p>The Windows Security dialog box provides easy access to important security functions. You will need to educate your users about these functions.</p>

<p>The Windows Security dialog box displays the user account currently logged on, the domain or computer to which the user is logged on, and the date and time at which the user logged on. This information is important for users with multiple user accounts, such as an individual who has a regular user account as well as a user account with administrative privileges. You access the Windows Security dialog box by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Delete.</p>

<p>The following table describes the Windows Security dialog box buttons.</p>

<p><b>Buttons on the Windows Security Dialog Box</b></p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Button</th><th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lock Computer</td><td> Allows you to secure the computer without logging off. All programs remain running. You should lock your computer if you leave it for a short period of time. The user who locks the computer can unlock it by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Delete and entering the valid password. An administrator can also unlock a locked computer by logging off the current user; however, this is a forced logoff and data may be lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Log Off </td><td>Allows you to log off as the current user and close all running programs, but leaves Windows 2000 running.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Shut Down</td><td>Allows you to close all files, save all operating system data, and prepare the computer so that you can safely turn it off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Change Password</td><td>Allows you to change your user account password. You must know the old password to create a new one. This is the only way you can change your own password. Administrators should require users to change their passwords regularly and should set password restrictions as part of account policy</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Task Manager </td><td>Provides a list of the current programs that are running, a summary of overall CPU and memory usage, and a quick view of how each program, program component, or system process is using the CPU and memory resources. You can also use Task Manager to switch between programs and to stop a program that is not responding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cancel</td><td>Closes the Windows Security dialog box.</td>

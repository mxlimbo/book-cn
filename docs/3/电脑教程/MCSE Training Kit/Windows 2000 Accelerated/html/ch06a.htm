<h2><a name="466">About This Chapter</a></h2>


<p>While most systems perform quite well in their default configuration, in some cases changes to the basic configuration result in a more efficient system. Since every situation is unique, you need to know what type of changes you should make to increase efficiency. You do this by monitoring system performance before and after you make changes.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 Professional provides you with a variety of tools that can be used to monitor and optimize system performance. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Task Scheduler.</b> Allows you to schedule routine maintenance when the system is not being fully utilized.</li>

<li><b>Backup wizard.</b> Allows you to easily back up data on a regular basis.</li>

<li><b>Offline Folders and Files.</b> Help users keep their data synchronized.</li>

<li><b>Signed Drivers.</b> Make sure that the correct drivers used are used for a specific system configuration.</li>

<li><b>Control Sets.</b> Assist in recovering from inappropriate changes to the system configuration.</li>

<li><b>Recovery Console.</b> Allows you to recover your system if a failure occurs.</li>
</ul>

<p>This chapter discusses these features and explains how they can be used to optimize your system.</p>

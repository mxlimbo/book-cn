<p>Because this book is self-paced, you can skip some lessons and
revisit them later. But note that you must complete the procedures in
<a href="ch01a.htm">Chapter 1</a>, &quot;Installing Windows 2000 Professional,&quot; before you
can perform procedures in the other chapters. Use the following table
to find the best starting point for you:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>If you</th><th>Follow this learning Path</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Are preparing to take the Microsoft Certified Professional exam 70-240, MicrosoftWindows 2000 Accelerated Exam for MCPs Certified on Microsoft Windows NT 4.</td><td>Read the &quot;<a href="abouti.htm#61">Getting Started</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="introa.htm">Introduction</a>&quot; 
sections. Then work through Chapter 1. Work 
through the remaining chapters in any order, 
though you should complete Chapter 8 before working on chapters 9

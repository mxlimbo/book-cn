<h2><a name="1411">About This Chapter</a></h2>


<p>Maintaining consistent desktop configurations is one method of reducing the total cost of ownership (TCO) of computer systems. Consistent configurations make those systems easier to update, maintain, and troubleshoot. With Active Directory directory services installed, there are a couple of methods (listed below) you can use to maintain desktop configurations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Group Policy</li>
<li>Remote Installation Services (RIS)</li>
</ul>

<p>Administrators can use Group Policy to manage desktop configurations for groups of computers and users. Group Policy is very flexible and includes options for registry-based policy settings, security settings, application management, scripts, computer startup and shutdown, logon and logoff, and folder redirection. Microsoft Windows 2000 Server includes hundreds of <b>Group Policy</b>  settings you can configure.</p>

<p>You can use RIS to set up new client computers remotely without the need to physically visit each client workstation. Specifically, you can install an operating system (OS) on a remote boot-enabled client computer by connecting the computer to the network, starting the client computer, and logging on with a valid user account.</p>

<p>This chapter explains the use of both group policies and RIS.</p>

<p>To help you install Terminal Services for Windows 2000, additional administration tools are added to the Administrative Tools folder. These include Terminal Services Client Creator, Terminal Services Manager, Terminal Services Configuration, and Terminal Services Licensing.</p>

<hr />
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Describe the uses of the following Terminal Services administration tools:

<ul>
<li>Terminal Services Client Creator</li>

<li>Terminal Services Manager</li>

<li>Terminal Services Configuration</li>

<li>Terminal Services Licensing</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Install Terminal Services with the appropriate adminstartion tools</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 30 minutes</b></p>

Terminal Services Licensing is installed only if Application Server mode is selected or if Adminpak.msi is installed.</div></blockquote>

<h2><a name="1636">Terminal Services Client Creator</a></h2>


<p>Use this tool to create floppy disks for installing the Terminal Services Client software on Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT platforms.</p>

<h2><a name="1637">Terminal Services Manager</a></h2>


<p>With this tool, you can manage all Windows 2000 servers running Terminal Services. Administrators can view current users, servers, and processes. Additionally, administrators can send messages to specific users, use the Remote Control feature, and terminate processes. Figure 22.1 shows the Terminal Services Manager console running inside a terminal services session.</p>

<h2><a name="1638">Terminal Services Configuration</a></h2>


<p>This tool allows you to manage your Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) configuration. Modifying options in this tool are global, unless you choose to inherit information from the same options located in the user configuration. Available options include setting connection encryption, logon settings, time-outs, initial programs run on successful logon, remote control options, Windows printer mapping, LPT port mapping, clipboard mapping, and applying these options to a specific LAN adapter.</p>

<h2><a name="1639">Terminal Services Licensing</a></h2>


<p>With this tool, you store and track Windows 2000 Terminal Services client access licenses. It can be installed either during installation of Terminal Services or later. When a client logs on to Terminal Services, Terminal Services validates the client license. If a client does not have a license or requires a replacement license, Terminal Services requests one from the license server. The license server provides a license from its pool of available licenses, and Terminal Services passes the license to the client. If there are no available licenses, the license server grants a temporary license for the client. After it is granted, each client license is associated with a particular computer or terminal.</p>

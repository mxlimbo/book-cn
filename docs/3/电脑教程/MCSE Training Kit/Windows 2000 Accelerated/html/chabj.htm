<h1><a name="2023">Lesson 7: Configuring Printers</a></h1>


<p>To connect users to the high-speed printer controlled by the UNIX staging server, you need to make your Windows 2000 Professional clients work with the UNIX print server. Along with file sharing, printer sharing is a basic function of network servers. Configuring your Windows 2000 clients to access printers controlled by a UNIX server's LPD is a fairly simple process that requires no changes on the UNIX server and no more changes on the client workstation than you would make for connecting to Windows-based or Novell-based printers. Note that you can connect to UNIX printers without SFU; the component that provides this functionality is included in the Print SFU, which is part of Windows 2000 Professional itself.</p>

<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Use print devices on a UNIX Server</li>

<li>Allow UNIX clients to use print devices on a Windows 2000 Server</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 10 minutes</b></p>

<h2><a name="2024">Using Print Services for UNIX</a></h2>


<p><b>The following steps explain how to install Print Services for UNIX:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Log on as an administrator. If you log on using an account that does not have administrative privileges, you may not be able to install and configure the components.</li>

<li>Confirm that the printer driver and Print Services for UNIX are installed.</li>

<li>Click Start, point to Settings, point to Printers, point to Add Printer, and then click Next.</li>

<li>Click Local printer, clear the Automatically Detect My Printer check box, and then click Next.</li>

<li>Click Create A New Port, and then select LPR Port from under the Create A New Port Type.</li>

<li>Click Next.</li>

<li>In Name Or Address Of Server Providing LPD, type the DNS name or Internet Protocol (IP) address of the host for the printer you are adding. This is information that you will get from your UNIX administrator.</li>

<li>In Name Of Printer Or Print Queue On That Server, type the name of the printer as it is identified by the host, which is either the direct-connect printer itself or the UNIX computer. This is information that you will get from your UNIX administrator.</li>

<li>Follow the instructions on the screen to finish installing the TCP/IP printer.
<p>You have successfully installed a UNIX-based printer on your system.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="2025">Advanced Options</a></h2>


<p>Printing to UNIX servers using LPR is a fairly simple process, and there is no configuration beyond those during installation that need to be configured.</p>

<p>For environments where you want to have UNIX clients connect to Windows 2000 Server printers, you can use the Print Services for UNIX to expose your servers to UNIX clients using LPR.</p>

<blockquote><div class="note"><b>NOTE</b><hr />
Not all versions of UNIX support LPR. Be sure to confirm that LPR is available with your version of UNIX. See your UNIX vendor's documentation for details.</div></blockquote>

<p>Unlike File And Print Services For NetWare, Windows 2000 Server cannot connect to UNIX printers and then share them as Windows-based printers. If you want Windows 2000 Professional-based workstations to print to UNIX-controlled printers, you must install Print Services For UNIX on the local workstation.</p>

<p>In addition, note the LPR standard for UNIX printing lacks many of the features that Windows end users have come to expect (fine degree of job control, tray status, and so on). For these two reasons, in environments with printers controlled by UNIX servers, consider moving them to Windows 2000-based servers using Print Services For UNIX to connect your UNIX clients to the printer. This allows your Windows 2000 users and UNIX users access printers in a familiar way while allowing you to install the software only on servers. However, you should see your UNIX Administrator and discuss the issues involved with an infrastructure change of this nature.</p>

<h2><a name="2026">Lesson Summary</a></h2>


<p>Windows 2000 Profesional clients can access print devices controlled by UNIX print servers. You can configure Windows 2000 Professional to use UNIX LPD and you are not required to make any changes to the UNIX Server. This service is included with Windows 2000 Professional and you are not required to purchase SFU to access a UNIX print server.</p>

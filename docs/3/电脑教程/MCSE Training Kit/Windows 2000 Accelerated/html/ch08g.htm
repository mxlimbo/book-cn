<p>The following questions will help you determine whether you have learned enough to move on to the next chapter. If you have difficulty answering these questions, please go back and review the material in this chapter before beginning the next chapter.

<ol>
<li>If you are installing Microsoft Windows NT in a dual-boot configuration on the same computer, which file system should you choose? Why?</li>

<li>Which licensing mode should you select if users in your organization require frequent access to multiple servers? Why?</li>

<li>You are installing Windows 2000 Server on a computer that will be a member server in an existing Windows 2000 domain. You want to add the computer to the domain during installation. What information do you need, and what computers must be available on the network, before you run the Setup program?</li>

<li>You are using a CD-ROM to install Windows 2000 Server on a computer that was previously running another operating system. There is not enough space on the hard disk to run both operating systems, so you have decided to repartition the hard disk and install a clean copy of Windows 2000 Server. Name two methods for repartitioning the hard disk.</li>

<li>You are installing Windows 2000 over the network. Before you install to a client computer, what must you do?</li>

<li>A client is running Windows NT 3.5 Server and is interested in upgrading to Windows 2000. From the list of choices, choose all possible upgrade paths:

<ol type="a">
<li>Upgrade to Windows NT 3.51 Workstation and then to Windows 2000 Server.</li>
<li>Upgrade to Windows NT 4.0 Server and then to Windows 2000 Server.</li> 
<li>Upgrade directly to Windows 2000 Server.</li> 
<li>Run Convert.exe to modify any NTFS partitions for file system compatibility with Windows 2000, and then upgrade to Windows 2000 Server.</li> 
<li>Upgrade to Windows NT 3.51 Server and then to Windows 2000 Server.</li>
</ol></li>

<li>In your current network environment, user disk space utilization has been a major issue. Describe three services in Windows 2000 Server to help you manage this issue.</li>

<li>What is the purpose of using the /tempdrive: or /t: installation switches with Winnt32.exe or Winnt.exe, respectively?</li>

<li>You are asked to develop a strategy for rapidly installing Windows 2000 Server for one of your clients. You have assessed their environment and have determined that the following three sets of computers require Windows 2000 Server:

<ul>
<li>There are 30 unidentical computer configurations currently running Windows NT Server 4.0 that need to be upgraded to Windows 2000 Server.</li>

<li>There are 20 identical computers that need a new installation of Windows 2000 Server.</li>

<li>Remote sites will run a clean installation of Windows 2000 Server. You want to make sure that they install a standard image of Windows 2000 Server that is consistent with your local configuration of the operating system. You will provide them with hard disks that they will install in their servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the steps for your installation strategy?</p></li>

<li>What is the purpose of the $OEM$ folder and the subfolders created beneath it by Setup Manager?</li>

<h1><a name="1185">Lesson 1: Installing Active Directory</a></h1>


<p>This lesson presents information on installing and removing Active Directory including using the Active Directory Installation Wizard. The lesson also discusses the database and shared system volume that Active Directory creates during installation and setting up Domain Name System (DNS) for Active Directory. Finally, the lesson discusses domain modes.</p>

<hr />
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Install Active Directory</li>

<li>Remove Active Directory from a domain controller</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 25 minutes</b></p>
<hr />

<h2><a name="1186">The Active Directory Installation Wizard</a></h2>


<p>The Active Directory Installation Wizard can perform the following tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add a domain controller to an existing domain</li>

<li>Create the first domain controller of a new domain</li>

<li>Create a new child domain</li>

<li>Create a new domain tree</li>

<li>Install a DNS server</li>

<li>Create the database and database log files</li>

<li>Create the shared system volume</li>

<li>Remove Active Directory services from a domain controller</li>
</ul>

<p>To launch the Active Directory Installation Wizard, run Configure Your Server on the Administrative Tools menu of the Start menu, or run dcpromo from the command prompt. These two methods run the Active Directory Installation Wizard on a standalone server and help you through the process of installing Active Directory on the computer and creating a new domain controller.</p>

<p>As you install Active Directory, you can choose whether to add the new domain controller to an existing domain or create the first domain controller for a new domain.</p>

<h3><a name="1187">Adding a Domain Controller to an Existing Domain</a></h3>


<p>If you choose to add a domain controller to an existing domain, you create a peer domain controller. You create peer domain controllers for redundancy and to reduce the load on the existing domain controllers.</p>

<h3><a name="1188">Creating the First Domain Controller for a New Domain</a></h3>


<p>If you choose to create the first domain controller for a new domain, you create a new domain. You create domains on your network to partition your information, which enables you to scale Active Directory to meet the needs of your organization. When you create a new domain, you can create a new child domain or a new tree. Table 17.1 describes creating a new child domain and creating a new domain tree.</p>

<p><b>Table 17.1</b> <i>Creating New Domains</i></p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Creating a new domain</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>New child domain</td>
<td>When you create a child domain, the new domain is a child domain in an existing domain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>New domain tree</td>
<td>When you create a new tree, the new domain is not part of an existing domain. You can create a new tree in an existing forest, or you can create a new forest.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2><a name="1189">Configuring DNS for Active Directory</a></h2>


<p>Active Directory uses DNS as its location service, enabling computers to find the location of domain controllers. To find a domain controller in a particular domain, a client queries DNS for resource records that provide the names and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) servers for the domain. LDAP is the protocol used to query and update Active Directory, and all domain controllers run the LDAP service. You cannot install Active Directory without having DNS on your network, because Active Directory uses DNS as its location service. However, you can install DNS separately without Active Directory.</p>

<p>You can configure your Windows 2000 DNS server automatically using the Active Directory Installation Wizard. Unless you are using a DNS server other than Windows 2000 or you want to perform a special configuration, you do not need to manually configure DNS to support Active Directory. However, if you want to set up a configuration other than the default configuration that the Active Directory Installation Wizard sets up, you can manually configure DNS using the DNS console.</p>

<h2><a name="1190">The Database and Shared System Volume</a></h2>


<p>Installing Active Directory creates the database and database log files, as well as the shared system volume. Table 17.2 describes these files.</p>

<p><b>Table 17.2</b> <i>Types of Files Created by Installing Active Directory directory services</i></p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Type of file created</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Database and database log files</td>
<td>The database is the directory for the new domain. The default location for the database and database log files is <i>systemroot</i>\Ntds, where <i>systemroot</i> is the Windows 2000 directory. For best performance, place the database and the log file on separate hard disks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Shared system volume</td>
<td>The shared system volume is a folder structure that exists on all Windows 2000 domain controllers. It stores scripts and some of the group policy objects for both the current domain and the enterprise. The default location for the shared system volume is <i>systemroot</i>\Sysvol. The shared system volume must be located on a partition or volume formatted with Microsoft Windows NT file system (NTFS) 5.0.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Replication of the shared system volume occurs on the same schedule as replication of Active Directory. As a result, you may not notice file replication to or from the newly created system volume until two replication periods have elapsed (typically, 10 minutes). This is because the first file replication period updates the configuration of other system volumes so that they are aware of the newly created system volume.</p>

<h2><a name="1191">Domain Modes</a></h2>


<p>There are two domain modes: Mixed mode and Native mode.</p>

<h3><a name="1192">Mixed Mode</a></h3>


<p>When you first install or upgrade a domain controller to Windows 2000 Server, the domain controller is set to run in <i>Mixed mode.</i> Mixed mode allows the domain controller to interact with any domain controllers in the domain that are running previous versions of Windows NT.</p>

<h3><a name="1193">Native Mode</a></h3>


<p>When all the domain controllers in the domain run Windows 2000 Server, and you do not plan to add any more pre&#8212;Windows 2000 domain controllers to the domain, you can switch the domain from mixed mode to <i>Native mode.</i></p>

<p>During the conversion from Mixed mode to Native mode, the following changes take place:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support for pre&#8212;Windows 2000 replication ceases. Because pre&#8212;Windows 2000 replication is gone, you can no longer have any domain controllers in your domain that are not running Windows 2000 Server.</li>

<li>You can no longer add new pre&#8212;Windows 2000 domain controllers to the domain.</li>

<li>The server that served as the primary domain controller (PDC) during migration is no longer the domain master, and all domain controllers begin acting as peers.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><div class="note"><b>NOTE</b><hr />The change from Mixed mode to Native mode is one way only; you cannot change from Native mode to Mixed mode.</div></blockquote>

<p><b> Follow these steps to change the domain mode to Native mode:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click Active Directory Users and Computers.</li>

<li>Right-click the domain and then click Properties.</li>

<li>On the General tab, click Change Mode.</li>

<li>In the Active Directory message box, click Yes, and then click OK.</li>

<li>Restart your computer.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="1194">Removing Active Directory Services from a Domain Controller</a></h2>


<p>Running dcpromo from the Run dialog box on an existing domain controller allows you to remove Active Directory from the domain controller, thus demoting it to a member server. If the domain controller is the last domain controller in the domain, it becomes a standalone server. If you remove Active Directory from all domain controllers in a domain, you also delete the directory database for the domain, and the domain no longer exists. Computers joined to this domain can no longer log on to the domain or use domain services.</p>

<p><b> Follow these steps to remove Active Directory from a domain controller:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Log on as Administrator.</li>

<li>Click Start, click Run, and then type <b>dcpromo</b> in the Open box and click OK.

<p>The Active Directory Installation Wizard appears.</p></li>

<li>Click Next on the Welcome To The Active Directory Installation Wizard page.</li>

<li>If the server is the last domain controller in the domain, select the check box, and then click Next.</li>

<li>Enter a user name and password with Enterprise Administrator privileges for the domain, and then click Next.</li>

<li>Enter and confirm the password to be assigned to the server Administrator account, and then click Next.</li>

<li>Click Next on the Summary page.</li>

<li>Click Finish to complete the removal of Active Directory from the computer.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="images/practice.jpg" /></p>
<h2><a name="1195">Practice: Installing Active Directory</a></h2>


<p>In this practice you install Active Directory on your standalone server, which makes the server a domain controller of a new domain. In Exercise 1 you use the DCPROMO program and Active Directory Installation Wizard to install Active Directory. In Exercise 2 you view the domain you have created. In Exercise 3 you are introduced to the Active Directory Users and Computers console. In Exercise 4 you confirm that the DNS service is working.</p>

<h2><a name="1200">Lesson Summary</a></h2>


<p>In this lesson you learned about installing Active Directory, including running Windows 2000 Configure Your Server to start the Active Directory Installation Wizard. You can also go to a command prompt and type dcpromo to launch the Active Directory Installation Wizard. You can use the Active Directory Installation Wizard to add a domain controller to an existing domain, to create the first domain controller of a new domain, to create a new child domain, and to create a new domain tree. You also learned how the Active Directory Installation Wizard can be used to remove Active Directory from a domain controller.</p>

<p>In this lesson you also learned about the Active Directory database, which
is the directory for the new domain, and the database log files. The default location for the database and database log files is <i>systemroot</i>\NTDS. You also learned about the shared system volume that Active Directory creates during installation. The shared system volume is a folder structure that exists on all Windows 2000 domain controllers. It stores scripts and some of the group policy objects for both the current domain and the enterprise. The default location for the shared system volume is <i>systemroot</i>\SYSVOL.</p>

<p>You learned how Active Directory uses DNS as its location service, enabling computers to find the location of domain controllers. You cannot install Active Directory without having DNS on your network, because Active Directory uses DNS as its location service. You can configure your Windows 2000 DNS server automatically by using the Active Directory Installation wizard. Unless you are using a DNS server other than Windows 2000 or you want to perform a special configuration, you do not need to configure DNS manually to support Active Directory.</p>

<p>You also learned about Mixed and Native domain modes. Mixed mode allows compatibility with previous versions of Windows NT. Native mode is only used when all domain controllers in the domain are running Windows 2000 Server.</p>

<p>In the practice portion of this lesson, you used the Active Directory Installation wizard to install Active Directory on your computer, to promote your computer to a domain controller, and to create a domain. You then viewed your domain using My Network Places and the Active Directory Users And Computers console. Finally, you used the DNS console to confirm that your DNS service is working.</p>

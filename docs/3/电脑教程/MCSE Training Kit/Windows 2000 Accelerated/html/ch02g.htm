<h1><a name="199">Lesson 6: Using Consoles</a></h1>


<p>This lesson explains how to create, use, and modify consoles. This lesson also explains how to use consoles for remote administration.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Create and use consoles</li>

<li>Create custom consoles for remote administration</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 40 minutes</b></p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="200">Creating Consoles</a></h2>


<p>You can create your own custom consoles by combining multiple preconfigured snap-ins with third-party snap-ins, which are provided by independent software vendors (ISVs) to perform related tasks. You can then do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Save the custom consoles so you can use them again.</li>

<li>Distribute the custom consoles to other administrators.</li>

<li>Use the custom consoles from any computer to centralize and unify administrative tasks.</li>
</ul>



<p>Creating custom consoles allows you to combine snap-ins that you use to perform common administrative tasks. When you have created a custom console, you don't have to switch between different programs because all of the snap-ins that you need to perform your job are located in that one console. You start MMC with an empty console.</p>

<p><b>Follow these steps to start the MMC:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Click the Start button.</li>

<li>Click Run.</li>

<li>Type <b>mmc</b> in the Open box, and then click OK.

<p>A console window titled Console1 opens; it contains a window titled Console Root. This is an empty console that is ready for you to customize. Use the Console menu to create, open, save, and customize a console. The following table describes the different commands on the Console menu.</p>
<p><b>Console Menu Commands</b></p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Command </th><th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>New</td><td>To create a new custom console</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Open</td><td>To open and use a saved console</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Save or Save As</td><td> To save the console and use it later</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Add/Remove Snap-In</td><td>To add or remove one or more snap-ins and their 
 associated extensions to or from a console</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Options</td><td>To configure the console mode and create a custom console</td>
</tr>
</table>
</li>

<li>Close the MMC window.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="201">Using Consoles for Remote Administration</a></h2>


<p>When you create custom consoles, you can set up a snap-in for remote administration. Remote administration allows you to perform administrative tasks from any location. For example, you can use a computer running Windows 2000 Professional to perform administrative tasks on a computer running Windows 2000 Server. You can't use all snap-ins for remote administration; the design of each snap-in dictates whether you can use it for remote administration.</p>

<p>To perform remote administration, you can use snap-ins from computers running either Windows 2000 Professional or Windows 2000 Server. You must use specific snap-ins that are designed for remote administration. If the snap-in is available for remote administration, Windows 2000 prompts you to choose the target computer to administer.</p>

<h2><a name="206">Lesson Summary</a></h2>


<p>In this lesson, you learned how to create custom consoles to perform a unique set of administrative tasks. Once you create customized consoles, you can access them by using the Run command on the Start menu.</p>

<p>In the practice portion of this lesson, you created two customized consoles. The first console contained the Computer Management snap-in. You added the Event Viewer snap-in to the console. You used the Event Viewer snap-in to determine when your computer was last started. The second custom console you created contained the Computer Management snap-in. After you created the second customized console, you learned how to restrict the functionality of a console by removing two of the extensions normally available with the Computer Management snap-in.</p>

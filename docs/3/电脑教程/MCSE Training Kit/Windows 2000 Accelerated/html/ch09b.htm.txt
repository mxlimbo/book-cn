<h1><a name="666">Lesson 1: Basic Concepts of IP Routing</a></h1>


<p>Routing is the process of choosing a path over which to send packets, which is a primary function of the internet protocol (IP). A router (commonly referred to as a gateway) is a device that forwards packets from one physical network to another. When a router receives a packet, the network adapter forwards the datagrams to the IP layer. IP examines the destination address on the datagram and then compares it to an IP routing table. A decision is then made as to where the packet is to be forwarded. This lesson explains basic IP routing concepts.</p>

<h2><a name="667">Overview of Routing</a></h2>


<p>A router helps local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs) to achieve interoperability and connectivity, and can link LANs that have different network topologies, such as Ethernet and Token Ring. Each packet sent over a LAN has a packet header that contains source and destination address fields. Routers match packet headers to a LAN segment and choose the best path for the packet, optimizing network performance. As each route is found, the packet is sent to the next router, called a <i>hop</i>, until finally delivered to the destination host. If a route is not found, an error message is sent to the source host. For example, if a packet is sent from Computer A to Computer C, as illustrated in Figure 9.1, the best route uses only one hop. If Router 1 is the default router for Computer A, the packet will be rerouted through Router 2. Computer A will be notified of the better route by which to send packets to Computer C.</p>

<p>To make routing decisions, the IP layer consults a routing table that is stored in memory, as illustrated in Figure 9.2.</p>

</div>

<p>A routing table contains entries with the IP addresses of router interfaces to other networks that it can communicate with. A routing table is a series of entries, called <i>routes</i>, that contain information about where the network IDs of the internetwork are located. A routing table in a computer that is running Windows 2000 is built automatically, based on its TCP/IP configuration. You can view a routing table by typing <b>route print</b> at a command prompt, as illustrated in Figure 9.3.</p>

<blockquote><div class="note"><b>NOTE</b><hr />
The routing table is not exclusive to a router. A host also has a routing table that is used to determine the optimal route.

<h2><a name="668">Static and Dynamic IP Routing</a></h2>


<p>Routers use different processes to obtain routing information depending on whether the router performs static or dynamic IP routing. Static routing is a function of IP that limits you to fixed routing tables. Static routing requires that routing tables are built and updated manually. You use the Route command to add static entries to the routing table (see Table 9.1).</p>

<p>In this practice, you update a Windows 2000-based routing table by means of static routers.</p>

<h3><a name="670">Exercise 1: Updating a Routing Table</a></h3>


<ol>
<li>On Pro1, open a command prompt.</li>
<li>At the command prompt, type <b>route add <i>IP_ address</i> mask <i>net_mask gateway</i></b> to add a route to enable communications with a network from a host on another network.
<p>For example, to add a route to enable communications with network 10.107.24.0 from a host on network 10.107.16.0, you would type <b>route add 10.107.24.0 mask 255.255.255.0 10.107.16.2</b>, as illustrated in Figure 9.4.</p></li>
<li>At the command prompt, type <b>route print</b> to see the addition of the route in your routing table.</li>
<li>At the command prompt, type <b>route del <i>IP_address</i></b>

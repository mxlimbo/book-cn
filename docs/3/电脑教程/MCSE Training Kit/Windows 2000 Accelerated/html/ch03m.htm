<h1><a name="368">Lesson 12: Administering Printers Using a Web Browser</a></h1>


<p>Windows 2000 enables you to manage printers from any computer running a Web browser, regardless of whether the computer is running Windows 2000 or has the correct printer driver installed. You can perform the same management tasks using a Web browser as you do by using Windows 2000 management tools. The difference in administering with a Web browser is the interface, which is a Web-based interface. To gain access to a printer by using a Web browser, the print server on which the printer resides must have Internet Information Server (IIS) installed.</p>

<h2><a name="369">Understanding Web Servers</a></h2>


<p>A Web server is a computer that responds to requests from a user's browser. Shortcuts or links to a resource on a Web server from a user's computer are known as Web folders or HTTP folders. For a Web server to provide Web folders, the Web server must support one of the following protocols or extensions: the Web Extension Client (WEC) protocol, FrontPage extensions, or the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) protocol and IIS.</p>

<h2><a name="370">Using a Web Browser to Manage Printers</a></h2>


<p>The following are the advantages of using a Web browser to manage printers:</p>

<ul>
<li>It allows you to administer printers from any computer running a Web browser, regardless of whether the computer is running Windows 2000 or has the correct printer driver installed.</li>

<li>It allows you to customize the interface. For example, you can create your own Web page containing a floor plan with the locations of the printers and the links to the printers.</li>

<li>It provides a summary page listing the status of all printers on a print server.</li>

<li>It can report real-time print device data, such as whether the print device is in power-saving mode, if the printer driver makes such information available. This information isn't available from the Printers window.</li>
</ul>



<h2><a name="371">Accessing Printers Using a Web Browser</a></h2>


<p>If you want to gain access to all printers on a print server by using a Web browser, open the Web browser, and then in the Address box, type</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
http://<i>print_server_name</i>/printers
</pre>
</div>

<p>If you want to gain access to a specific printer by using a Web browser, open the Web browser, and then in the Address box, type</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
http://<i>server_name</i>/<i>printer_share_name</i>
</pre>
</div>

<h2><a name="372">Lesson Summary</a></h2>


<p>This lesson showed you one benefit of using a Web browser to administer printers: it allows you to administer printers from any computer running a Web browser, regardless of whether the computer is running Windows 2000 or has the correct printer driver installed.</p>

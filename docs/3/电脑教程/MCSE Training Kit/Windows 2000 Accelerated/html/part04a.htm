<p>Part 4 contains information that relates to the Windows 2000 Server portion of the 70-240 exam. A lot of the objectives for this portion of the exam are 
the same as objectives from the Windows 2000 Professional portion of the exam, but the information from the Windows 2000 Professional section is 
not repeated here (except where necessary for content and presentation 
flow). This part concentrates on the unique aspects of Windows 2000 Server 
with minimal repetitive information. The following chapters primarily use 
Windows 2000 Server during the various hands-on practices and exercises.</p>

<p>The unique features of Windows 2000 Server (over that of Windows 2000 Professional) discussed here include Internet services, the distributed file system (Dfs) and File Replication Service (FRS). This part also discusses monitoring and managing the network, in addition to securing the system. 
The chapter on security includes a discussion on public key technologies, 
the Kerberos protocol, and the various tools used to configure and manage Windows 2000 security.</p>

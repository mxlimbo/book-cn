<h1><a name="1976">Lesson 2: Installing Services for UNIX</a></h1>


<p>Before installing SFU, review your system and determine how you want to access data. This lesson explains the various ways UNIX can be used to access resources, what information you need to gather before installing SFU and how to install SFU.</p>

<hr />
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Determine how you want to access to work.</li>

<li>Decide which of the following components you should install:

<ul>
<li>Client for NFS</li>

<li>Server for NFS</li>

<li>Gateway for NFS</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Install SFU</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 30 minutes</b></p>

<h2><a name="1977">Preparing for Installation</a></h2>


<p>To best integrate Windows 2000 Professional and Services for UNIX 2.0 into your networking environment, you need to understand the capabilities and limitations of the components you install and configure. This includes the following areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>File access</li>

<li>Authentication</li>

<li>Account management</li>

<li>UNIX printing</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="1978">File Access</a></h2>


<p>Client for NFS, Server for NFS, and Gateway for NFS are solutions for file access between computers running Windows 2000 Professional and UNIX. Before installing Services for UNIX 2.0, you need to select the NFS component that best suits your needs.</p>

<ul>
<li>Client for NFS installed on Windows 2000 Professional allows for file access on an NFS server, generally a UNIX-based computer.</li>

<li>Server for NFS can be installed on Windows 2000 Professional, Windows 2000 Server, or Windows NT. Server for NFS allows NFS-enabled client computers, generally those running UNIX, to access files on Windows 2000 Server.</li>

<li>Gateway for NFS must be installed on Windows 2000 Server. Gateway for NFS allows clients running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT, and Windows 2000 to access UNIX files without having to install an NFS Client. Gateway for NFS enables Windows 2000 Server to act as a translator between the CIFS protocol that Windows 2000 Professional uses and the NFS protocol that UNIX uses.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="1979">Choosing Among Client for NFS, Server for NFS, or Gateway for NFS</a></h3>


<p>To help you decide which component is best suited to your networking environment, the following list details the capabilities of each of the three different NFS components.</p>

<h3><a name="1980">Client for NFS</a></h3>


<ul>
<li>Installs on each Windows 2000 Professional-based computer that needs NFS file access.</li>

<li>Provides access to NFS files on a UNIX NFS network</li>

<li>Resolves all UNIX path names to follow the universal naming convention (UNC)</li>

<li>Integrates with Server for PCNFS or Server for NIS to provide user authentication.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="1981">Server for NFS</a></h3>


<ul>
<li>Installs on either Windows 2000 Professional or Windows 2000 Server</li>

<li>Enables Windows 2000 (Professional or Server) to act as an NFS server</li>

<li>Allows users on computers running NFS client software, generally those running UNIX, to access files on Windows 2000</li>

<li>Integrates with Server for PCNFS or Server for NIS to provide user authentication</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="1982">Gateway for NFS</a></h3>


<ul>
<li>Installs on Windows 2000 Server.</li>

<li>Provides access to NFS files for computers running Windows 95 or Windows 98, Windows NT, and Windows 2000 Professional without Client for NFS installed</li>

<li>Acts as a gateway or translator between the CIFS protocol that Windows 2000 Professional uses and the NFS protocol that UNIX uses</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="1983">Account Management</a></h2>


<p>In an Network Information Service (NIS) environment, clients and servers are logically grouped together to form a domain. Each NIS domain can have specific parameters for the NIS maps that you configure. The NIS maps are databases that contain the parameters or system information. For example, host names, user names, and passwords are some of the NIS maps.</p>

<p>Server for NIS enables a Windows 2000 Server that is configured as a domain controller to act as the NIS master for a particular UNIX NIS domain. This provides you with the capability to migrate NIS maps and then centrally manage UNIX NIS domains from Windows 2000 Server. The NIS maps that you select to migrate are then migrated into Active Directory. A Windows 2000 Server that is Active Directory-enabled can then act as the NIS master for the specified UNIX domains.</p>

<h2><a name="1984">UNIX Printing</a></h2>


<p>Windows 2000 Professional provides services for printing to and from UNIX resources. There are multiple ways to implement these services.</p>

<p>One option is to configure Windows 2000 Professional with Line Printer (LPR), which sends print requests to a print queue on a UNIX host that is configured with Line Printer Daemon (LPD). LPD manages the print queue and sends the print job to the correct UNIX printer.</p>

<p>Another option is for Windows 2000 Server to act as an LPR/LPD gateway so that Windows computers without LPR/LPD services can print to a UNIX printer</p>

<p>Yet another option is to configure a UNIX computer with LPR, which sends print requests to a print queue on a Windows 2000-based computer configured with LPD. LPD manages the print queue and sends the print job to the correct printer.</p>

<h2><a name="1985">Installing Services for UNIX</a></h2>


<p>SFU is not included with Microsoft Windows 2000 Server. You need to obtain the latest version from your reseller.</p>

<p><b>Follow these steps to Install SFU:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Insert the CD into the CD-ROM Drive.
<p>If the Setup program does not invoke automatically, click Start, click Run, click Browse and find the CD-ROM drive. Locate Setup and click. Choose OK, and then choose OK again. When Setup is invoked, the Services For UNIX wizard appears.</p></li>

<li>On the Next screen, type your name, your company name, and the unlock code (found on the yellow sticker on your CD-ROM jewel case), and then click Next.</li>

<li>Read the End-User License agreement thoroughly. When you are finished, click I Accept The Terms Of The License Agreement if you accept, and then click Next.</li>

<li>On the Next screen, click Install Now to install the typical features.
<p>This is appropriate for most installations. After installation is complete, you should see a dialog box indicating that the Windows Services for UNIX setup is complete.</p></li>

<li>Click OK.
<p>At this point, you have successfully installed SFU. Refer to the Release Notes for more information on SFU.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="1986">Lesson Summary</a></h2>


<p>To get the best performance from SFU, you need to determine how users will be accessing resources. Depending on how you want access resources, you can install the appropriate components of SFU to integrate your networking environments.</p>

<p>Once you have determined how resources will be accessed, install SFU from the CD-ROM, following the instructions on the screen and configuring as appropriate for your environment.</p>

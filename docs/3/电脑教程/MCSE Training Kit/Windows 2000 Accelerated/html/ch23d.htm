<h1><a name="1718">Lesson 3: Configuring and Running Telnet Services</a></h1>


<p>In Windows 2000, Telnet provides user support for the Telnet protocol, a part of the TCP/IP suite. Telnet is a remote access protocol that you can use to log on to a remote computer, network device, or private TCP/IP network. Telnet Server and Telnet Client work together to allow users to communicate with a remote computer. In Windows 2000, Telnet Server is installed as a service, simply named Telnet. The Telnet Server allows users of a Telnet client to log on to the computer running the Telnet Server and run character-mode applications on that computer. The Telnet Server acts as a gateway through which computers running the Telnet client can communicate with each other. The Telnet client allows users to connect to a remote computer and interact with that computer through a terminal window.</p>

<hr />
<p><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Set up the Windows 2000 Telnet Server to allow a computer running the Telnet client to access it</li>

<li>Use the Telnet Client to connect to the Telnet service</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 25 minutes</b></p>
<hr />

<h2><a name="1719">Telnet Server</a></h2>


<p>Windows 2000 Telnet Server allows users of a Telnet client to connect to the computer running the Telnet Server and use command-line commands on the computer as if they were sitting in front of it. Telnet clients can connect to a server, log on to that server, and run character-mode applications. The Telnet Server also acts as a gateway for Telnet clients to communicate with each other. A computer running the Telnet Server can support a maximum of 63 Telnet client computers at any given time.</p>

<p><b>Telnet Server Connection Licensing</b></p>

<p>Two Telnet Server connection licenses are provided with each installation of Windows 2000 Server. This limits Telnet service to two connecting Telnet clients at a time. If you need additional licenses, use Telnet Server from the Windows Services for UNIX add-on pack.</p>

<p><b>Telnet Authentication</b></p>

<p>You can use your local Windows 2000 user name and password or domain account information to access the Telnet server. The security scheme is integrated into Windows 2000 security. If you do not use the NTLM authentication option, the user name and password are sent to the Telnet server as plaintext.</p>

<p>If you are using NTLM authentication, the client uses the Windows 2000 security context for authentication and the user is not prompted for a user name and password. The user name and password are encrypted.</p>

<blockquote><div class="note"><b>NOTE</b><hr />
If the User Must Change Password At Next Logon option is set for a user, the user cannot log on to the Telnet service when NTLM authentication is used. The user must log on to the server directly and change the password, and then log on through the Telnet client.</div></blockquote>

<h3><a name="1720">Starting and Stopping Telnet Server</a></h3>


<p>In a Windows 2000 Server default installation, the Telnet service is set to manual startup. You can use the Services snap-in or the Computer Management snap-in to start, stop, or configure the Telnet service for automatic startup. Figure 23.18 shows the Telnet Properties dialog box for the Telnet service.</p>

<div class="caption"><b>Figure 23.18</b> <i>Telnet Properties page showing the Startup type options for this server service</i>
</div>
</div>


<p>In the Computer Management snap-in, Telnet is a service located under the Services and Applications node. Select Services from the console tree, and then select Telnet from the list of services in the details pane.</p>

<p>You can also start or stop the Telnet service from a command prompt. To start Telnet Server, type <b>net start tlntsvr</b> or <b>net start telnet</b> at the command prompt, and then press Enter. To stop Telnet Server, type <b>net stop tlntsvr</b> or <b>net stop telnet</b> at the command prompt, and then press Enter.</p>

<h3><a name="1721">Telnet Server Admin Utility</a></h3>


<p>You can use the Telnet Server Admin utility to start, stop, or get information about Telnet Server. You can also use it to get a list of current users, terminate a user's session, or change Telnet Server registry settings.</p>

<blockquote><div class="caution"><b>CAUTION</b><hr />
Incorrectly editing the registry may severely damage your system. Before making changes to the registry, it is strongly recommended that you back up any valuable data on the computer.</div></blockquote>

<p>To open the Telnet Server Admin utility, click the Telnet Administration Tool in the Administrative Tools program group or click Start, click Run, type <b>tlntadmn</b> and then click OK. If you cannot open the Telnet Server Admin utility, you may need to install the Administration Tools pack (Adminpak.msi).</p>

<h2><a name="1723">Telnet Client</a></h2>


<p>You can use Microsoft Telnet Client to connect to a remote computer running the Telnet service or other Telnet server software. Once you have made this connection, you can communicate with the Telnet server. The type of session you conduct depends on how the Telnet software is configured. Communication, games, system administration, and local logon simulations are some typical uses of Telnet.</p>

<p>The Telnet client uses the Telnet protocol, part of the TCP/IP suite of protocols, to connect to a remote computer over a network. The Telnet client software allows a computer to connect to a remote server. You can use the Telnet client provided with Windows 2000 to connect to a remote computer, log on to the remote computer, and interact with it as if you were sitting in front of it.</p>

<p>Users of previous versions of Microsoft Telnet Client may notice a few changes in the version included with Windows 2000. The most obvious change is that Telnet Client is now a command-line application rather than a Windows application. As a command-line application, Telnet Client will seem very familiar to users of UNIX-based Telnet clients.</p>

<p>An important new feature found in Telnet Client is NTLM authentication support. Using this feature, a computer using Telnet Client can log on to a Windows 2000 computer running the Telnet service by using NTLM authentication.</p>

<blockquote><div class="note"><b>NOTE</b><hr />
Telnet session logging is not supported in Microsoft Telnet Client.</div></blockquote>

<h3><a name="1723a">Using Telnet</a></h3>

<p>To open Telnet, click Start, click Run, and then type <b>telnet</b>. You can also type <b>telnet</b> at the command prompt. To use Telnet, you must have the TCP/IP protocol installed and configured on your computer and you must have a user account established on a remote host.</p>

<p>To display help for Telnet, type <b>help</b> at the Microsoft Telnet command prompt. To connect to a site, type <b>connect &lt;<i>computer_name</i>&gt;</b> where &lt;<i>computer_name</i>&gt; is the IP address or host name of the computer running the Telnet service.</p>

<p><img src="images/practice.jpg" /></p>

<h2><a name="1724">Practice: Configuring and Connecting to the Telnet Service</a></h2>


<p>In this practice you configure the Telnet service to start on Server01. You then connect to the Telnet service from Server01 and verify the connection. Complete this practice from Server01.</p>

<h2><a name="1728">Lesson Summary</a></h2>


<p>In this lesson you learned that the Telnet service and a Telnet client work together to allow users to communicate with a remote computer. The Windows 2000 Telnet service allows users of the Microsoft Telnet Client to connect remotely to the computer and use command-line applications on the computer as if they were sitting in front of it. You can use the Services snap-in, the Computer Management snap-in, or the command prompt to start or stop the Telnet service. In addition, you can use the Telnet Server Admin utility to start, stop, or get information about the Telnet service. You can also use it to get a list of current users, terminate a user's session, or change Telnet service registry settings. Telnet Client allows you to connect to a remote computer running Telnet server software. NTLM authentication is supported when a Telnet Client connects to the Telnet service. Telnet provides user support for the Telnet protocol, a remote access protocol you can use to log on to a remote computer, network
device, or private network.</p>

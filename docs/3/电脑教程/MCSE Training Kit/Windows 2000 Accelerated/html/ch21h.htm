<tr>
<td>The most likely causes for this error are network-related.</td>
<td>Check the DNS configuration for the following: Make sure that there are no stale entries in the DNS database. Resolve local DNS servers and Internet service provider (ISP) DNS server entries. For example, the DNS settings for a local LAN network adapter points to two DNS servers: the local DNS server (possibly the same com- puter) and the DNS server of an ISP. If you try to ping your domain, a message may indicate that this is an unknown host. Even with correct local DNS entries, the ISP DNS server cannot identify your domain, so there is a difference in their databases. To resolve this error, remove the second and add the ISP DNS server <i>IPAddress</i> to the forwarders in the local DNS server.</td>

<th>Cause</th>
<th>Solution</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Any policies configured locally may be overridden by like policies specified in the domain. If your setting shows up in local policy but not in effective policy, it implies that there is a policy from the domain that is overriding your setting. Also, as group policy changes are applied periodically, it is likely that the policy changes made in the
directory have not yet been refreshed in your computer</td>
<td>Manually do a policy refresh by typing <b>secedit / refreshpolicy machine_policy</b> at the command line.</td>

<tr>
<th colspan="2">Symptom: Policies do not migrate from Windows NT 4.0 to Windows 2000</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Cause</th>
<th>Solution</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Windows NT 4.0 policies cannot be migrated to Windows 2000. In Windows NT 4.0, system policies were stored in one .pol file with group information embedded; no method is available to translate that information to the Windows 2000 Active Directory structure. Groups are handled very differently in Windows 2000.</td>
<td>Windows NT 4.0 clients accessing a Windows 2000 Server computer and Windows 2000 Professional clients accessing a Windows NT 4.0 Server computer will use the Netlogon share (the Windows NT 4.0 model). With Windows 2000 Server, when a Windows NT 4.0 client is upgraded to Windows 2000, it gets only Active Directory-based group policy settings and not Windows NT 4.0-style policies. Although Windows NT 4.0-style policies may be enabled (using a group policy setting) if the administrator chooses to do so, this practice is strongly discouraged. Windows NT 4.0-style policies are applied only during the logon process. This means that both com- puter and user settings are processed. This is not optimal behavior for the following reasons. The Windows NT 4.0-style computer settings override the group policy settings that have already been applied to the computer during startup. During the group policy settings re- fresh cycle, the group policy settings change any conflicting settings back. This creates an indeterminate state. Windows NT 4.0-style policies result in persistent settings in the registry (tattooing). Note also that Terminal Server cannot allow computer settings to be set based on a user logon.</td>

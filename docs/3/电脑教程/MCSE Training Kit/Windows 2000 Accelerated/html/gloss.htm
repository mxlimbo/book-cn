The domain controller assigned to control all updates to the schema within a forest. At any time, there can be only one schema master in the forest.</p>

<p><b><a name="206">security group</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Used to assign permissions to gain access to resources. Programs that are designed to search Active Directory directory services can also use security groups for nonsecurity-related purposes, such as retrieving user information for use in a Web application. A security group also has all the capabilities of a distribution group. Microsoft Windows 2000 uses only security groups.</p>

<p><b><a name="207">security identifier (SID)</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A unique number that identifies user, group, and computer accounts. Every account on your network is issued a unique SID when the account is first created. Internal processes in Microsoft Windows 2000 refer to an account's SID rather than the account's user or group name. If you create an account, delete it, and then create an account with the same user name, the new account will not have the rights or permissions previously granted to the old account because the accounts have different SID numbers.</p>

<p><b><a name="208">security template</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A physical representation of a security configuration; a single file where a group of security settings is stored. Locating all security settings in one place eases security administration. Each template is saved as a text-based .inf file. This allows you to copy, paste, import, or export some or all of the template attributes.</p>

<p><b><a name="209">shared resource</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Any device, data, or program that is used by more than one other device or program. For Microsoft Windows 2000, shared resources refer to any resource that is made available to network users, such as folders, files, printers, and named pipes. A shared resource can also refer to a resource on a server that is available to network users.</p>

<p><b><a name="210">snap-in</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A type of tool you can add to a console supported by Microsoft Management Console (MMC). A standalone snap-in can be added by itself; an extension snap-in can only be added to extend the function of another snap-in.</p>

<p><b><a name="211">software distribution point</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In Software Installation, a network location from which users are able to get the software that they need.</p>

<p><b><a name="212">Software Installation</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;

Software Installation works in conjunction with group policy and Active Directory directory service, establishing a Group Policy-based software management system that allows you to centrally manage the initial deployment of software, mandatory and nonmandatory upgrades, patches, quick fixes, and the removal of software.</p>

<p><b><a name="213">Start-of-Authority (SOA) resource record</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A record that indicates the starting point or original point of authority for information stored in a zone. The SOA resource record is the first resource record created when adding a new zone. It also contains several parameters used by other computers that use Domain Name System (DNS) to determine how long they will use information for the zone and how often updates are required.</p>

<p><b><a name="214">system partition</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The partition that contains the hardware-specific files needed to load Microsoft Windows 2000 (for example, Ntldr, Osloader, BOOT.INI, NTDETECT.COM). The system partition can be, but does not have to be, the same as the boot partition.</p>

<p><b><a name="215">systemroot</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The path and folder name where the Microsoft Windows 2000 system files are located. Typically, this is C:\Winnt, although you can designate a different drive or folder when you install Windows 2000. You can use the value %systemroot% to replace the actual location of the folder that contains the Windows 2000 system files. To identify your systemroot folder, click Start, click Run, and then type <b>%systemroot%</b>.</p>

<p><b><a name="216">system volume</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The volume that contains the hardware-specific files needed to load Microsoft Windows 2000. The system volume can be, but does not have to be, the same volume as the boot volume.</p>

<p><b><a name="217">SYSVOL</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A shared directory that stores the server copy of the domain's public files, which are replicated among all domain controllers in the domain.</p>

A set of Microsoft Windows 2000 domains connected together via a two-way transitive trust, sharing a common schema, configuration, and global catalog. The domains must form a contiguous hierarchical namespace such that if microsoft.com is the root of the tree, example.microsoft.com is a child of microsoft.com, another.example.microsoft.com is a child of example.microsoft.com, and so on.</p>

<p><b><a name="224">trust relationship</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A logical relationship estab-lished between domains to allow pass-through authentication, in which a trusting domain honors the logon authentications of a trusted domain. User accounts and global groups defined in a trusted domain can be given rights and permissions in a trusting domain, even though the user accounts or groups do not exist in the trusting domain's directory.</p>

<p><b><a name="225">tunnel</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;

It can also include other universal groups, global groups, and accounts from any domain in the domain tree or forest. Rights and permissions must be assigned on a per-domain basis, but can be assigned at any domain in the domain tree or forest. Universal groups can be members of domain local groups and other universal groups but cannot be members of global groups. Universal groups appear in the global catalog and should contain primarily global groups.</p>

<p><b><a name="228">universal naming convention (UNC) name</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The full Microsoft Windows 2000 name of a resource on a network. It conforms to the \\<i>servername</i>\<i>sharename</i> syntax, where servername is the name of the server and sharename is the name of the shared resource. UNC names of directories or files can also include the directory path under the share name, with the following syntax: <i>\\servername\sharename\directory\filename</i>.</p>

<p><b><a name="229">user account</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A record that consists of all the information that defines a user to Microsoft Windows 2000. This includes the user name and password required for the user to log on, the groups in which the user account has membership, and the rights and permissions the user has for using the computer and network and accessing their resources. For Windows 2000 Professional and member servers, user accounts are managed with the Local Users and Groups console. For Windows 2000 Server domain controllers, user accounts are managed with the Active Directory Users And Computers console.</p>

<p><b><a name="230">user groups</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;

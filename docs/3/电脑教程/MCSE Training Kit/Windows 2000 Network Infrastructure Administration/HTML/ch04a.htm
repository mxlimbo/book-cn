<p>Communication across a network is increasingly important in the work environment. Similar to processors or disks on your system, the behavior of the network has an impact on the operation of your computer. In this chapter, you will learn how to optimize your system's performance by analyzing network performance such as monitoring network traffic and resource utilization. Microsoft Windows 2000 provides two primary utilities for monitoring network performance: System Monitor and Network Monitor. System Monitor, installed with both Windows 2000 Professional and Windows 2000 Server, tracks resource utilization and network throughput. Network Monitor, an optional component for Windows 2000 Server, tracks network throughput in terms of captured network traffic. This chapter focuses on using Network Monitor to examine local traffic.</p>

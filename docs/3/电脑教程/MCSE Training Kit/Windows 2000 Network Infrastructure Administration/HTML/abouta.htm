<p>Welcome to the <i>MCSE Training Kit&#8212;Microsoft Windows 2000 Network 
Infrastructure Administration.</i> This book will teach you how to plan your network 
infrastructure around features supported by Windows 2000. Issues such as network protocol and services are introduced and compared based on the requirements 
of your organization. This includes using the Internetwork Packet Exchange/ 
Sequenced Packet Exchange (IPX/SPX)-compatible protocol to integrate with Novell NetWare. The primary focus of network protocols throughout this book is Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) because it is the Internet-standard protocol and is the best choice for enterprise networks. You will learn how to utilize, manage, and configure the TCP/IP protocol and use 
features such as NetBIOS, WINS, DHCP, and DNS. You will also learn how to configure, manage, and troubleshoot routing and remote access, including setting up virtual private networks (VPNs).</p>

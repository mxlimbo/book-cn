<A NAME="6"><H1>Features of This Book</H1></A>

<p>Each chapter opens with a &quot;Before You Begin&quot; section, which prepares you for completing the chapter.</p>

<p><li>The chapters are then broken into lessons. Whenever possible, lessons contain practices that give you an opportunity to use the skills being presented or to explore the part of the application being described. All practices offer 
step-by-step procedures that are identified with a bullet symbol like the one to the left of this paragraph.</li></p>

<p>The &quot;Review&quot; section at the end of the chapter allows you to test what you have learned in the chapter's lessons.</p>

<p><A HREF="chaaa.htm#637">Appendix A</A>, &quot;Questions and Answers,&quot; contains all of the book's questions and corresponding answers.</p>

<A NAME="7"><H2>Notes</H2></A>

<p>Several types of notes appear throughout the lessons.</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Notes marked <b>Tip</b> contain explanations of possible results or alternative methods.</li></p>

<p><li>Notes marked <b>Important</b> contain information that is essential to completing a task.</li></p>

<p><li>Notes marked <b>Note</b> contain supplemental information.</li></p>

<A NAME="8"><H2>Conventions</H2></A>

<p>The following conventions are used throughout this book.</p>

<A NAME="9"><H3>Notational Conventions</H3></A>

<ul>
<p><li>Characters or commands that you type appear in <b>bold lowercase</b> type.</li></p>

<p><li><i>Italic</i> in syntax statements indicates placeholders for variable information. <i>Italic</i> is also used for book titles.</li></p>

<p><li>Names of files and folders appear in Title Caps, except when you are to type them directly. Unless otherwise indicated, you can use all lowercase letters when you type a filename in a dialog box or at a command prompt.</li></p>

<p><li>Filename extensions appear in all lowercase.</li></p>

<p><li>Acronyms appear in all uppercase.</li></p>

<p><li><font face="courier">Monospace</font> type represents code samples, examples of screen text, or entries that you might type at a command prompt or in initialization files.</li></p>

<p><li>Square brackets [ ] are used in syntax statements to enclose optional items. For example, [<i>filename</i>] in command syntax indicates that you can choose to type a filename with the command. Type only the information within the brackets, not the brackets themselves.</li></p>

<p><li>Braces { } are used in syntax statements to enclose required items. Type only the information within the braces, not the braces themselves.</li></p>

<p><li>Icons represent specific sections in the book as follows:</li></p>
</ul>

<p><table cellpadding=5 width="95%"><tr>
<th>Icon</th> <th>Represents</th>

</tr></table></p>

<A NAME="10"><H3>Keyboard Conventions</H3></A>

<ul>
<p><li>A plus sign (+) between two key names means that you must press those keys at the same time. For example, &quot;Press ALT+TAB&quot; means that you hold down ALT while you press TAB.</li></p>

<p><li>A comma ( , ) between two or more key names means that you must press each of the keys consecutively, not together. For example, &quot;Press ALT, F, X&quot; means that you press and release each key in sequence. &quot;Press ALT+W, L&quot; means that you first press ALT and W together, and then release them and press L.</li></p>

<p><li>You can choose menu commands with the keyboard. Press the ALT key to activate the menu bar, and then sequentially press the keys that correspond to the highlighted or underlined letter of the menu name and the command name. For some commands, you can also press a key combination listed in the menu.</li></p>

<p><li>You can select or clear check boxes or option buttons in dialog boxes with the keyboard. Press the ALT key, and then press the key that corresponds to the underlined letter of the option name. Or you can press TAB until the option is highlighted, and then press the spacebar to select or clear the check box or option button.</li></p>

<p><li>You can cancel the display of a dialog box by pressing the ESC key.</li></p>
</ul>

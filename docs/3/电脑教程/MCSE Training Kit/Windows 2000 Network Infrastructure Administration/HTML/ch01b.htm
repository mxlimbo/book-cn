<A NAME="34"><H1>Lesson 1: Network Services Overview</H1></A>

<p>Microsoft Windows 2000 provides many network features and services that can be used by your organization to meet your business objectives. Windows 2000 includes key technologies that add value to both new and existing networks. Some technologies must be implemented on your network in order to use certain services. For example, Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) must be installed in order to implement the Windows 2000 Active Directory service.</p>

<p>This lesson introduces the following Windows 2000 network services:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Domain Name System (DNS)</li></p>

<p><li>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)</li></p>

<p><li>Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)</li></p>
</ul>



<p>You will also learn about remote networking with the Routing and Remote 
Access feature of Windows 2000 service. This includes features such as network address translators (NATs). You will also learn how security is implemented 
using Microsoft Certificate Services.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li>Explain the purpose of DNS, DHCP, and WINS</li></p>

<p><li>Describe the Routing and Remote Access Service</li></p>

<p><li>Describe the benefit of a network address translator (NAT)</li></p>

<A NAME="35"><H2>TCP/IP</H2></A>

<p>There are many networking protocols supported in Windows 2000; however, TCP/IP is the core protocol used in Windows 2000, and is the default networking protocol installed by Windows 2000 Setup. Many networking services in 
Windows 2000 use TCP/IP, and some services, such as Internet Information Server (IIS) and Active Directory, require it to be installed. TCP/IP is a routable protocol used by many wide area networks (WANs) and the Internet. Other 
protocols, such as NetBEUI (NetBIOS Enhanced User Interface), are designed only for local area networks (LANs) and thus do not support Internet connectivity. This issue is important to consider when planning your network.</p>

<A NAME="36"><H2>Domain Name System</H2></A>

<p>Although TCP/IP uses Internet Protocol (IP) to locate and connect to hosts (computers and other TCP/IP network devices), users typically prefer to use friendly names. For example, users prefer the name ftp.microsoft.com, instead of its IP address, 172.16.23.55. Domain Name System (DNS) enables you to use hierarchical, friendly names to easily locate computers and other resources on an 
IP network.</p>

<p>DNS is used on the Internet to provide a standard naming convention for locating IP-based computers. Before the implementation of DNS, a Hosts file was used to locate resources on TCP/IP networks including the Internet. Network administrators entered names and IP addresses into the Hosts file, and computers used the file for name resolution.</p>

<A NAME="37"><H2>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</H2></A>

<p>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) simplifies administrating and managing IP addresses on a TCP/IP network by automating address configuration for network clients. A DHCP server is defined as any computer running the DHCP service. Windows 2000 Server provides the DHCP Server service, which enables a computer to function as a DHCP server and configure DHCP-enabled client computers on your network. This architecture is illustrated in Figure 1.1.</p>

</p><p>
<!-- caption --><b>Figure 1.1</b> <i>The basic DHCP model</i><!-- /caption -->
</p>

<p>The DHCP Server service for Windows 2000 also provides</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Integration with the Microsoft Active Directory directory service and DNS</li></p>

<p><li>Enhanced monitoring and statistical reporting</li></p>

<p><li>Vendor-specific options and user-class support</li></p>

<p><li>Multicast address allocation</li></p>

<p><li>Rogue DHCP server detection</li></p>
</ul>



<p>Every computer on a TCP/IP-based network must have a unique IP address in order to access the network and its resources. Without DHCP, IP configuration must be done manually for new computers, computers moving from one subnet to another, and computers removed from the network. By deploying DHCP in a network, this entire process is automated and centrally managed.</p>

<p>The DHCP implementation is so closely linked to the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) and DNS that network administrators will benefit from combining all three when planning deployment. If you use DHCP servers for Microsoft network clients, you must use a name resolution service. Windows 2000 networks use the DNS service to support Active Directory, in addition to general name resolution. Networks supporting Windowsç‡¦T 4.0 and earlier clients must use WINS servers. Networks supporting a combination of Windows 2000 and 
Windows NT 4.0 clients should implement both WINS and DNS.</p>

<A NAME="38"><H2>Windows Internet Name Service</H2></A>

<p>Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) is the name resolution system used for Windows NT Server 4.0 and earlier operating systems. WINS provides a distributed database for registering and querying a computer name (which is the same as the NetBIOS name) to IP address mapping in a routed network environment. If you are administering a routed network, WINS is your best choice for NetBIOS name resolution. WINS reduces the use of local broadcasts for name resolution and allows users to easily locate systems on remote networks. In a dynamic DHCP environment, the IP addresses of the hosts can change frequently; WINS provides a way to dynamically register the changes for computer names-to-IP addresses mapping. This feature is necessary for the name-to-IP address 
resolution to work properly in a DHCP environment.</p>

<A NAME="39"><H3>Name Resolution</H3></A>

<p>Whether your network uses DNS or WINS, name resolution is an essential part of network administration. Although Windows 2000 primarily uses DNS to match host names to IP addresses, Windows 2000 still supports WINS for 
this purpose.</p>

<p>Name resolution allows you to search your network and connect to resources using names such as &quot;printer1&quot; or &quot;fileserver1&quot; rather than memorizing a host's IP 
address. Remembering IP addresses would be even more impractical when using DHCP for address assignment because the assignments can change over time. WINS is tightly integrated with DHCP services. Because of this integration, whenever the computer you named &quot;fileserver1&quot; is dynamically assigned a new IP 
address, the change is transparent. When you connect to fileserver1 from another node, you can use the name fileserver1 rather than the new IP address because WINS keeps track of the changing IP addresses associated with that name.</p>

<A NAME="40"><H2>Remote Access Overview</H2></A>

<p>With the Windows 2000 Routing and Remote Access feature, remote clients are transparently connected to the remote server, known as point-to-point remote 
access connectivity. Clients can also be transparently connected to the network to which the routing and remote access server is attached. This is known as point-to-LAN remote access connectivity. This transparent connection allows clients to dial in from remote locations and access resources as if they were physically 
attached to the network. Windows 2000 remote access provides two different types of remote access connectivity:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Dial-up remote access.</b> With dial-up remote access, a remote access client uses the telecommunications infrastructure to create a temporary physical circuit or a virtual circuit to a port on a remote access server. Once the physical or virtual circuit is created, the rest of the connection parameters can be negotiated.</li></p>



<p><li><b>Virtual private network remote access.</b> With virtual private network (VPN) remote access, a VPN client uses an IP internetwork to create a virtual point-to-point connection with a remote access server acting as the VPN server. Once the virtual point-to-point connection is created, the rest of the connection parameters can be negotiated.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="41"><H3>Elements of a Dial-Up Remote Access Connection</H3></A>

<p>The Windows 2000 Routing and Remote Access Service accepts dial-up connections and forwards packets between remote access clients and the network to which the remote access server is attached. A remote connection consists of 
a remote access client, a WAN infrastructure, and a remote access server, as 
illustrated in Figure 1.2.</p>

</p>

<A NAME="42"><H3>Remote Access Protocols</H3></A>

<p>Remote access protocols control the connection establishment and transmission of data over WAN links. The operating system and LAN protocols used on 
remote access clients and servers dictate which remote access protocol your 
clients can use.</p>

<p>There are three types of remote access protocols supported by Windows 2000 Routing and Remote Access:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is an industry-standard set of protocols providing the best security, multiprotocol support, and interoperability.</li></p>

<p><li>Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) is used by legacy remote access servers.</li></p>

<p><li>Microsoft remote access service protocol, also known as Asynchronous NetBEUI (AsyBEUI), is a remote access protocol used by legacy remote access clients running Microsoft operating systems, such as Windows NT 3.1, Windows for Workgroups, MS-DOS, and LAN Manager.</li></p>


</ol>

<p>LAN protocols are the protocols used by the remote access client to access 
resources on the network connected to the remote access server. Windows 2000 remote access supports TCP/IP, IPX, AppleTalk, and NetBEUI.</p>

<p><li><b>To configure a routing and remote access server</b></li></p>

<ol>

<A NAME="43"><H2>Network Address Translator</H2></A>

<p>There are two types of IP addresses: public and private. Public addresses are 
assigned to you by the Internet service provider (ISP) you use to connect to the Internet. For the hosts within the organization that do not require direct access to the Internet, IP addresses that do not duplicate already assigned public addresses are required. To solve this addressing problem, designers of the Internet reserved a portion of the IP address space and named this space the private address space. An IP address in the private address space is never assigned as a public address. IP addresses within the private address space are known as private addresses. 
Using private IP addresses, you can provide protection from network hacking.</p>

<p>Because the IP addresses in the private address space will never be assigned by the Internet Network Information Center (InterNIC) as public addresses, routes in the Internet routers for private addresses will never exist. Private addresses are not reachable on the Internet. Therefore, when using private IP addresses, you need some type of proxy or server to convert the private IP address range(s) on your local network to a public IP address that can be routed. Another option is to have private addresses translated into valid public addresses by a network address translator (NAT) before it is sent on the Internet. Support for network address translation to translate private and public addresses to allow the connection of small office or home office networks to the Internet is illustrated in Figure 1.4.</p>



<p>

</p><p>
<!-- caption --><b>Figure 1.4</b> <i>Connecting a small office network to the Internet</i><!-- /caption -->
</p>

<p>An NAT hides internally managed IP addresses from external networks by translating the private internal address to a public external address. This reduces IP address registration costs by letting customers use unregistered IP addresses 
internally, with translation to a small number of registered IP addresses externally. It also hides the internal network structure, reducing risks of denial of service attacks against internal systems.</p>

<A NAME="44"><H2>Certificate Services</H2></A>

<p>Designing an appropriate security system to protect your organization's confidential and proprietary information requires developing a set of appropriate solutions for specific risk scenarios. Windows 2000 provides a range of technologies from which to choose in developing your security plan. One of these technologies is Microsoft Certificate Services. You can deploy Microsoft Certificate Services to create and manage Certificate Authorities (CAs) that issue digital certificates.</p>

<p>Digital certificates are electronic credentials that certify the online identities of individuals, organizations, and computers. Certificates function similarly to identification cards, such as passports and driver's licenses. When an identification card is presented to others, they can verify the identify of its owner because the card provides the following security benefits:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>It contains personal information to help identify and trace the owner.</li></p>

<p><li>It contains the signature of the rightful owner to enable positive identification.</li></p>

<p><li>It contains the information that is required to identify and contact the issuing authority.</li></p>

<p><li>It is designed to be tamper resistant and difficult to counterfeit.</li></p>

<p><li>It is issued by an authority that can revoke the identification card at any time (for example, if the card is misused or stolen).</li></p>

<p><li>It can be checked for revocation by contacting the issuing authority.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>Digital certificates can be used in the same way to provide a variety of security functions. Some common security functions of digital certificates include the 
following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Secure e-mail</li></p>

<p><li>Secure communications between Web clients and servers</li></p>

<p><li>Code signing for executable code for distribution on public networks</li></p>

<p><li>Local network and remote access logon authentication</li></p>

<p><li>IPSec authentication</li></p>
</ul>



<p>Certificate Services provides a means for an enterprise to easily establish CAs in support of their business needs. Certificate Services includes a default policy module suitable for issuing certificates to enterprise entities such as users, 
machines, or services.</p>

<A NAME="45"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>Windows 2000 includes key technologies that add value to both new and existing TCP/IP-based networks. Although TCP/IP uses IP to locate and connect to hosts, users typically prefer to use friendly names. DNS enables you to use hierarchical, friendly names to easily locate computers and other resources on an IP network. DHCP simplifies administrating and managing IP addresses on a TCP/IP network by automating address configuration for network clients. WINS provides a distributed database for registering and querying a computer name (which is the same as the NetBIOS name) to IP address mapping in a routed network environment. With Windows 2000 Routing and Remote Access Service, clients are transparently 
connected to the remote access server. Clients can also be transparently connected to the network to which the routing and remote access server is attached.</p>

<A NAME="57"><H1>Lesson 3: Common Protocols Supported by Windows 2000</H1></A>

<p>When planning your network, consider the connectivity requirements of your 
users. Network protocols are similar to languages in the sense that languages haves different words, word patterns, and punctuation. A network protocol serves a similar role for computers attempting to communicate. The network protocol used on a network determines how packets (units of data) are configured and sent over the network cable. Consider the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b> Do network users connect to Novell NetWare servers?</b> Clients that connect to NetWare servers must use the NWLink protocol. Even if the NetWare servers are configured to use TCP/IP, Windows-based clients must use NWLink to communicate with them.</li></p>

<p><li><b> Is your network connected by routers?</b> NetBEUI is not routable. For computers across routers to communicate, they must use a routable network protocol such as TCP/IP or NWLink.</li></p>

<p><li><b> Are you connected to the Internet?</b> For clients to connect to the Internet, they must use the TCP/IP protocol.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, some features require that particular protocols be installed. If you want to implement Active Directory, use IIS, or provide clients with access to the Internet, you will need to install TCP/IP. This lesson describes the TCP/IP protocol and other protocols that you can use with Windows 2000.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote><b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li>Identify different network architectures</li></p>

<p><li>Identify various network protocols used in Windows 2000</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="58"><H2>Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol</H2></A>

<p>Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is an industry-standard suite of protocols designed for large networks. TCP/IP is routable, which means that data packets can be switched (routed to a different subnet) by use of the packet's destination address. TCP/IP's ability to be routed provides fault tolerance, which is the ability of a computer or an operating system to respond to a catastrophic event or fault, such as a power outage or a hardware failure, to 
ensure that data is not lost or corrupted. If a network failure occurs, TCP/IP packets are transported on a different route.</p>

<p>Although the original purpose of TCP/IP was to provide connection between disparate networks, TCP/IP now provides high-speed communication network links between networks. Microsoft has implemented TCP/IP as a standard network transport for Windows 2000. You will learn more about the architecture, installation, and configuration of TCP/IP in <A HREF="ch02a.htm">Chapter 2</A>, &quot;Implementing TCP/IP.&quot;</p>

<A NAME="59"><H3>Benefits of Implementing TCP/IP</H3></A>

<p>TCP/IP in Windows 2000 includes many performance improvements for high-bandwidth networks. These features are described in the following sections.</p>

<p><b>Large Window Support</b></p>

<p>The window size in TCP-based communication is the maximum number of packets that can be sent before the first packet must be acknowledged. Window size is typically fixed and established at the beginning of a session between sending and receiving hosts. With large window support, window size is dynamically recalculated and increased if a large number of packets is exchanged during a lengthy session. This increases bandwidth and allows more data packets to be in transit on the network at one time.</p>

<p><b>Selective Acknowledgments</b></p>

<p>With selective acknowledgments, the receiver can notify and request specific packets that were missing or corrupted during delivery from the sender. This 
allows networks to recover quickly from a state of temporary congestion or 
interference, because only corrupted packets are re-sent. In previous TCP/IP implementations, if a receiving host failed to receive a single TCP packet, the sender was forced to retransmit all packets transmitted following the negatively acknowledged packet. Using selective acknowledgments, fewer packets are 
re-sent, providing better network utilization and performance.</p>

<p><b>Round Trip Time Estimation</b></p>

<p>Round Trip Time (RTT) is the amount of time it takes for a round-trip communication between a sender and receiver on a TCP-based connection. RTT estimation is a technique of estimating packet transit times and adjusting for the optimum retransmission time for packets. Because performance depends on knowing how long to wait for a missing packet, improving the accuracy of RTT estimation results in better time-out values being set on each host, so that a host cannot request a packet to be retransmitted until the requisite time interval expires. Better timing improves performance over long round-trip network links, such as WANs, that span large distances (for example, continent-to-continent) or use either wireless or satellite links.</p>

<p><b>IP Security (IPSec) Support</b></p>

<p>IPSec provides the ideal platform for safeguarding intranet and Internet communications. IPSec can secure paths between two computers, two security gateways, or a host and a security gateway. Windows 2000 Server tightly integrates IPSec with system policy management to enforce encryption between systems. Customers can have encryption-secured communications managed by group policy&#8212;a safeguard that protects information sent over networks. Because IPSec is integrated into the operating system, it is easier to configure and manage than 
add-on solutions.</p>

<p>The services available and required for traffic are configured using IPSec policy. IPSec policy can be configured locally on a computer, or can be assigned through Windows 2000 Group Policy mechanisms using the Active Directory directory service, as illustrated in Figure 1.5. When using Active Directory, hosts detect policy assignment at startup, retrieve the policy, and periodically check for policy updates. The IPSec policy specifies the trust relationship among computers. The easiest trust relationship to use is the Windows 2000 domain trust based on the Kerberos version 5 protocol. Predefined IPSec policies are configured to trust computers in the same or other trusted Windows 2000 domains.</p>

</p>

<p>At the IP (network) layer, each incoming or outgoing packet is referred to as a datagram. Each IP datagram bears the source IP address of the sender and the destination IP address of the intended recipient. Each IP datagram processed at the IP layer is compared against a set of filters that are provided by the security policy, which is maintained by an administrator for a computer, user, group, or an entire domain. The IP layer can perform one of the following actions with a datagram:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Provide IPSec services to the datagram</li></p>

<p><li>Allow the datagram to pass unmodified</li></p>

<p><li>Discard the datagram</li></p>
</ul>



<p>Because IPSec typically encrypts the entire IP packet, capturing an IPSec datagram sent after the security association (SA) is established reveals very little of what is actually in the datagram. The only parts of the packet that can be parsed or read by a network sniffer such as Network Monitor are the Ethernet and IP headers. This lends greater security to IP transactions. IPSec is covered in more detail in <A HREF="ch05a.htm">Chapter 5</A>, &quot;Implementing IPSec.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Generic Quality of Service</b></p>

<p>Generic Quality of Service (GQoS) is a method by which a TCP/IP network can offer Quality of Service guarantees for multimedia applications. Generic Quality of Service allocates different bandwidths for each connection on an as-needed basis.</p>

<p>Quality of Service (QoS) allows network administrators to use their existing 
resources efficiently and to guarantee that critical applications receive high-quality service without having to expand as quickly or upgrade their networks. Deploying QoS means that network administrators can have better control over their networks, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction. The suite of QoS components included in Windows 2000 works with the different QoS mechanisms that can exist in network elements such as routers and switches. These host mechanisms give administrators an idea of which applications are in use and what their resource requirements are without having to calculate the mappings between actual users, network ports, and addresses. When the host and the network operate cooperatively, resources can be utilized easily and more knowledgeably.</p>

<p>The following QoS components are currently included with the Windows 2000 operating system:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>The Generic Quality of Service (GQoS) application programming interface (API).</b> The GQoS API is a subset of the WinSock 2 API that allows applications to invoke QoS services from the operating system without needing to understand the underlying mechanisms.</li></p>

<p><li><b>The QoS service provider.</b> This responds to requests from the GQoS API. It provides Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) signaling and QoS policy support with Kerberos. It also invokes the traffic control mechanisms.</li></p>

<p><li><b>The Admission Control Service (ACS) service and Subnet Bandwidth Manager (SBM) protocol.</b> This provides management of shared network resources over a standardized signaling protocol.</li></p>

<p><li><b>A traffic control infrastructure.</b> This infrastructure includes a packet scheduler and marker for providing traffic control over drivers and network cards that have no packet scheduling features of their own. It also marks packets for diffserv and 802.1p. Windows 2000 traffic control also includes additional mechanisms such as Integrated Services over Slow Links (ISSLOW) and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).</li></p>
</ul>



<p>Microsoft is working closely with Cisco on the delivery of qualitative QoS services, and is working along with Cisco, Extreme Networks, Intel, Sun, 3Com, and others on the continuing development of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RSVP standard.</p>

<A NAME="60"><H2>NWLink</H2></A>

<p>NWLink is a Microsoft-compatible IPX/SPX protocol for Windows 2000. NWLink is useful if there are Novell NetWare client/server programs running that use WinSock or NetBIOS over IPX/SPX protocols. WinSock is an API that allows Windows-based applications to access the transport protocols. NWLink can be run on a computer running Windows 2000 Server or Windows 2000 
Professional to access a NetWare server.</p>

<p>NWLink alone does not allow a computer running Windows 2000 to access files or printers shared on a NetWare server, or to act as a file or print server to a NetWare client. To access files or printers on a NetWare server, a redirector must be used, such as Client Service for NetWare on Windows 2000 Professional, or Gateway Service for NetWare on Microsoft Windows 2000 Server. NWLink is included with both Windows 2000 Server and Windows 2000 Professional, and installs automatically during Client Service for NetWare or Gateway Service for NetWare installation. Both Client Service for NetWare and Gateway Service for NetWare depend on the NWLink protocol. NWLink is covered in more detail in <A HREF="ch03a.htm">Chapter 3</A>, &quot;Implementing NWLink.&quot;</p>

<A NAME="61"><H3>Gateway Service for NetWare</H3></A>

<p>Gateway Service for NetWare works with NWLink to provide access to NetWare file, print, and directory services by acting as a gateway through which multiple clients can access NetWare resources. With Gateway Service for NetWare, you can connect a computer running Windows 2000 Server to NetWare bindery-based servers and Novell NDS servers. Multiple Windows-based clients can then use Gateway Service for NetWare as a common gateway to access NetWare file, print, and directory services, without requiring special client software.</p>

<p>Gateway Service for NetWare supports direct access to NetWare services from the computer running Windows 2000 Server in the same way that Client Service for NetWare supports direct access from the client computer. Additionally, Gateway Service for NetWare supports NetWare login scripts.</p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><HR>Gateway Service for NetWare is included only with Windows 2000 Server and Windows 2000 Advanced Server.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="62"><H3>Client Service for NetWare</H3></A>

<p>Similar to Gateway Service for NetWare, Client Service for NetWare works with NWLink to provide access to NetWare file, print, and directory services. However, rather than acting as a gateway for clients, Client Service for NetWare enables clients to connect directly to file and print services on NetWare bindery-based servers and NetWare servers running NDS. Client Service for NetWare also 
supports NetWare login scripts. Client Service for NetWare is included only 
with Windows 2000 Professional.</p>

<A NAME="63"><H2>NetBEUI</H2></A>

<p>NetBIOS Enhanced User Interface (NetBEUI) was originally developed as a 
protocol for small departmental LANs of 20 to 200 computers. NetBEUI is not routable because it does not have a network layer. NetBEUI is included with Windows 2000 Server and Windows 2000 Professional, and is primarily a legacy protocol to support existing workstations that have not been upgraded to 
Windows 2000.</p>

<A NAME="64"><H2>AppleTalk</H2></A>

<p>AppleTalk is a protocol suite developed by Apple Computer, Inc. for communication between Apple Macintosh computers. Windows 2000 includes support for AppleTalk, which allows Windows 2000 to function as a router and a dial-up server. Support is natively provided as a service for file sharing and printer sharing.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 supports an AppleTalk protocol stack and AppleTalk routing 
software so that the Windows 2000 server can connect to and provide routing for AppleTalk-based Macintosh networks.</p>

<A NAME="65"><H2>Data Link Control</H2></A>

<p>Data Link Control (DLC) was originally developed for IBM mainframe communications. The protocol was not designed to be a primary protocol for network use between personal computers. The other use of DLC is to print to Hewlett-Packard printers connected directly to networks. Network-attached printers use the DLC protocol because the received frames are easy to disassemble and DLC functionality can easily be coded into read-only memory (ROM). DLC's usefulness is limited because it does not directly interface with the Transport Driver Interface layer. DLC needs to be installed only on those network computers that perform these two tasks, such as a print server sending data to a network Hewlett-Packard printer. Clients sending print jobs to a network printer do not need the DLC protocol installed on their computers. Only the print server communicating directly with the printer needs the DLC protocol installed.</p>

<A NAME="66"><H2>Infrared Data Association</H2></A>

<p>Infrared Data Association (IrDA) has defined a group of short-range, high-speed, bidirectional wireless infrared protocols, generically referred to as IrDA. IrDA allows a variety of devices to communicate with each other. Cameras, printers, portable computers, desktop computers, and personal digital assistants (PDAs) can communicate with compatible devices using this technology.</p>

<A NAME="67"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>TCP/IP is an industry-standard suite of protocols designed for large networks. TCP/IP is routable, which means that data packets can be switched by use of the packet's destination address. TCP/IP's ability to be routed provides fault tolerance. Other protocols supported by Windows 2000 include</p>

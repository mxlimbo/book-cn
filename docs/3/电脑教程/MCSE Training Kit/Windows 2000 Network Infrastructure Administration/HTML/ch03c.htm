<A NAME="132"><H1>Lesson 2: Using Gateway Service for NetWare</H1></A>

<p>Gateway Service for NetWare allows a Microsoft networking client (LAN Manager, MS-DOS, Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT, or Windows 2000) to access NetWare server services through the Windows 2000 Server-based computer. In this lesson, you will learn how to install and utilize Gateway Service for NetWare.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote><b>
After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li>Install Gateway Service for NetWare</li></p>

<p><li>Enable and activate gateways in Windows 2000</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 30 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="133"><H2>Gateway Service for NetWare Overview</H2></A>

<p>With Gateway Service for NetWare, you can create a gateway through which Microsoft client computers without Novell NetWare client software can access NetWare file and print resources. You can make gateways for resources located on Novell NDS trees as well as for resources on servers with bindery security. These resources include volumes, directories, directory map objects, printers, and print queues. A user who works locally at a computer running Windows 2000 Server can use Gateway Service for NetWare to gain direct access to NetWare file and print resources, both on Novell NDS trees and on servers with bindery security. Gateway Service for NetWare depends on and works with NWLink.</p>

<A NAME="134"><H2>Understanding Gateway Service for NetWare and Gateways</H2></A>

<p>Gateway Service for NetWare acts as a bridge between the NetBIOS protocol used by the network using Windows and the NetWare Core Protocol used by the NetWare network. When a gateway is enabled, network clients running Microsoft client software can access NetWare files and printers without having to run NetWare client software locally. Figure 3.3 shows an example of a file gateway configuration.</p>

</p>

<p>For file access, the gateway server redirects one of its own drives to the NetWare volume and then shares that drive with other Microsoft clients. The file gateway uses a NetWare account on the computer running Windows 2000 Server to create a validated connection to the NetWare server. This connection appears on the computer running Windows 2000 Server as a redirected drive. When you share the redirected drive, it becomes like any other shared resource on the computer running Windows 2000 Server.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you want to create a gateway from the computer AIREDALE (running Gateway Service for NetWare) to the Novell NDS folder \\NW4\Server1\ Org_Unit.Org\Data volume on the NetWare server Nw4. When activating the gateway, you specify \\NW4\Server1\Org_Unit.Org\Data as the NetWare resource, and then you specify a share name for Microsoft clients, such as Nw_Data. Microsoft clients would then refer to this resource as \\AIREDALE\Nw_Data.</p>

<p>After the gateway connection is established, it is disconnected only if the computer running Windows 2000 Server is turned off, if the administrator disconnects the shared resource or disables the gateway, or if a network problem prevents access to the NetWare server. Logging off the computer running Windows 2000 Server does not, by itself, disconnect the gateway.</p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><HR>Because requests from Microsoft networking clients are processed through the gateway, access is slower than direct access from the client to the NetWare network. Clients who require frequent access to NetWare resources should run the NetWare client software to achieve better performance.</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="135"><H2>Installing Gateway Service for NetWare</H2></A>

<p>You have the option to install Gateway Service for NetWare when you install Windows 2000 Server, or you can install GSNW later. You must be logged on as a member of the Administrators group to install and configure Gateway Service for NetWare. If you want to install Gateway Service for NetWare after you have already installed Windows 2000 Server, perform the following steps.</p>

<p><li><b>To install Gateway Service for NetWare</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>Open the Network and Dial-Up Connections Control Panel applet.</li></p>

<p><li>Right-click a local area connection, then click Properties.</li></p>

<p><li>In the General tab, click Install.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Select Network Component Type dialog box, click Client, then click Add.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Select Network Client dialog box, click Gateway (And Client) Service For NetWare, then click OK.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>During installation of Gateway Service for NetWare, NWLink is installed if it is not already on the server. Also during installation of Gateway Service for NetWare, Client Service for NetWare is installed and the Gateway Service for NetWare icon is added to Control Panel. By default, the NetWare network is placed first in the network search order.</p>

<p><div class="caution"><blockquote><b>IMPORTANT</b><HR>Before you install Gateway Service for NetWare on a computer, 
remove any existing client software that is compatible with NetWare Core 
Protocol, including NetWare client software, from the computer.</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="136"><H3>Configuring Gateway Service for NetWare</H3></A>

<p>When you first log on after Gateway Service for NetWare is installed, you are prompted to set your default tree and context or your preferred server. The tree and context define the position of the user object for the user name you use to log on to a Novell NDS tree. A preferred server is the NetWare server to which you are automatically connected when you log on if your network does not use Novell NDS. You should set a default tree and context only in a Novell NDS 
environment; otherwise, you can set a preferred server. The Gateway Service for NetWare dialog box is illustrated in Figure 3.4.</p>

<!-- caption --><b>Figure 3.4</b> <i>Gateway Service for NetWare dialog box</i><!-- /caption -->
</p>

<p><li><b>To set a preferred server</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, then choose Gateway Service For NetWare.</li></p>

<p><li>Click Preferred Server and, in Select Preferred Server, enter the preferred server.</li></p>

<p>If you do not want to set a preferred server, click None. You are then logged on to the nearest available NetWare server, and your interaction with the NetWare network is through that server. If you do not set a preferred server, you are prompted to set one each time you log on.</p>
</ol>

<p>You can have either a default tree and context or a preferred server, but not both. (In Novell NDS environments, you set a default tree and context.) If you select a default tree and context, you can still access NetWare servers that use bindery security.</p>

<p><li><b>To set a default tree and context</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, then choose Gateway Service For NetWare.</li></p>

<p><li>Click Default Tree And Context and, in Tree And Context, type your tree and context.</li></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="137"><H2>Creating a Gateway</H2></A>

<p>Before you can create a gateway to NetWare resources, the NetWare server must have a group named NTGATEWAY and a user account with the necessary rights for the resources that you want to access. The NetWare user account you use must be a member of the NTGATEWAY group.</p>

<p>The NetWare user account you use to enable gateways can be either a Novell NDS account or a bindery account. If the server will have gateways to both Novell NDS resources and resources on servers running bindery security, the user account must be a bindery account. (This account can connect to Novell NDS resources through bindery emulation.) If you create gateways only to Novell NDS resources, the account can be a Novell NDS account.</p>

<A NAME="138"><H3>Enabling Gateways in Windows 2000</H3></A>

<p>Creating a gateway is a two-step process. First, you enable gateways on the server running Windows 2000 Server. When you enable a gateway, you must type the name and password of the user account that has access to the NetWare server and is a member of the NTGATEWAY group on that NetWare server. You need to do this only once for each server that will act as a gateway.</p>

<p><li><b>To enable a gateway on the server</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, then choose Gateway Service For NetWare.</li></p>

<p><li>Click Gateway, then select the Enable Gateway check box.</li></p>

<p><li>In Gateway Account, type the name of your gateway account.</li></p>

<p><li>In Password and Confirm Password, type the password for the gateway account.</li></p>


<p>You can now share NetWare file and printing resources over a Windows-based network.</p>
</ol>

<A NAME="139"><H3>Activating Gateways</H3></A>

<p>The second step is to activate a gateway for each volume or printer to which you want to create a gateway. When you activate a gateway, you specify the NetWare resource and a share name that Windows client users will use to connect to the resource. To activate a gateway for a volume, use the Gateway Service for NetWare Control Panel applet. To activate a gateway for a printer, use the Add Printer Wizard. If you are activating a gateway to a Novell NDS resource and the gateway user 
account is a bindery user account, specify the resource that uses the bindery context name. If you are using a Novell NDS user account and you do not plan on also creating gateways to bindery resources, specify the Novell NDS resource name.</p>

<p><li><b>To activate a gateway to a NetWare file resource</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, then choose Gateway Service For NetWare.</li></p>

<p><li>Click Gateway, then select the Enable Gateway check box.</li></p>

<p><li>Click Add, and in Share Name, type a share name that Microsoft clients will use to access the NetWare resource.</li></p>

<p><li>In Network Path, type the network path of the NetWare volume or directory you want to share.</li></p>

<p><li>In Use Drive, enter the default drive you want to use, if necessary.</li></p>

<p><li>Click Unlimited, then click OK.</li></p>

<p>You can also click Allow, enter a maximum number of concurrent users, then click OK.</p>
</ol>

<p><li><b>To activate a gateway to a NetWare printer</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>Click Start, point to Settings, then click Printers.</li></p>

<p><li>Click Add Printer, then click Next.</li></p>

<p><li>Click Network Printer, then click Next.</li></p>

<p><li>In Name, type the name of a printer in the following format: \\servername\sharename</li></p>

<p>To find the NetWare printer in Shared Printers, click Next. If necessary, double-click Novell NDS tree names and NetWare server names until you find the printer you want.</p>
</ol>

<p>Follow the remaining instructions in the Add Printer Wizard to finish connecting to the NetWare printer:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>The icon for that printer appears in the Printers folder.</li></p>

<p><li>Click the printer you just created and, on the File menu, click Properties.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Sharing tab, click Shared and, in the Shared As dialog box, type a name for the printer.</li></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="140"><H3>Security for Gateway Resources</H3></A>

<p>Security for gateway resources is provided on two levels:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>On the computer running Windows 2000 Server and acting as a gateway, you can set share-level permissions for each resource made available through the gateway.</li></p>

<p><li>On the NetWare file server, the NetWare administrator can assign trustee rights to the user account that is used for the gateway or to the NTGATEWAY group. These rights are enforced for all Microsoft client users who access the resource through the gateway. There is no auditing of gateway access.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="141"><H2>Connecting Directly to NetWare Resources</H2></A>

<p>In addition to providing gateway technology, Gateway Service for NetWare enables users working locally at a computer running Windows 2000 Server to access 
NetWare resources directly, just as Client Service for NetWare provides this service to Windows 2000 Professional users. The information in this section applies to users working locally at a computer running Windows 2000 Server who access NetWare resources directly&#8212;not to Microsoft clients who access resources through a gateway. (This information does apply to users of Client Service for NetWare on computers running Windows 2000 Professional.)</p>

<p>Novell NDS trees (as well as NetWare servers running bindery security) appear in the NetWare or Compatible Network list in Windows Explorer. You can double-click a tree name to expand it, and then double-click any container object to 
expand its contents and structure. You can connect to and assign a local drive to any volume, folder, or directory map object anywhere in the tree hierarchy (for which you have credentials). To connect to a Novell NDS printer, you can use the Add Printer Wizard, just as you would to connect to any network printer.</p>

<p>If you have a default tree and context, once you have logged on, you do not need to log on again or supply another password to access any volume in your default tree. If you access another tree, you are prompted to supply a full context (including user name) for that tree.</p>

<A NAME="142"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>Gateway Service for NetWare allows a Microsoft networking client (LAN Manager, MS-DOS, Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT, or Windows 2000) to access NetWare server services through the Windows 2000 server.</p>

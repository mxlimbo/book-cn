<A NAME="163"><H1>Lesson 1: Introducing Network Monitor</H1></A>

<p>You can use Microsoft Windows 2000 Network Monitor to view and detect problems on local area networks (LANs). For example, you can use Network Monitor to diagnose hardware and software problems when two or more computers cannot communicate. You can also copy a log of network activity into a file and then send the file to a professional network analyst or support organization. In addition, network application developers can use Network Monitor to monitor and debug network applications as they are developed.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li>Install Network Monitor</li></p>

<p><li>Describe the benefits of using Network Monitor</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 15 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="164"><H2>Understanding Network Monitor</H2></A>

<p>You can use Network Monitor to collect data sent to and from computers and then view and analyze that data. Network Monitor captures frames and packets on the data-link layer through the application layer and presents it graphically. Frames and packets are composed of many different pieces of information including</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Source and destination addresses</li></p>

<p><li>Sequencing information</li></p>

<p><li>Checksums</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Network Monitor decodes this information allowing you to analyze network traffic and troubleshoot network problems. In addition to data-link layer data, Network Monitor can also interpret some application layer data, such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and File Transfer Protocol (FTP). This data can help you troubleshoot browser and Web server interactions.</p>

<A NAME="165"><H2>Practice: Installing Network Monitor</H2></A>

<p>In order for you to capture, display, and analyze network frames, you must install Network Monitor in Windows 2000 and a network protocol called the Network Monitor driver. In this practice, you will install Network Monitor in Windows 2000 Server.</p>

<p><li><b>To install Network Monitor</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, then select Add/Remove Programs.</li></p>

<p><li>In Add/Remove Programs, click Add/Remove Windows Components.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Windows Components Wizard, highlight Management And Monitoring Tools, then click Details.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Management And Monitoring Tools window, select the Network Monitor Tools check box, as illustrated in Figure 4.1, then click OK.</li></p>

<p><li>Click Next in the Windows Components Wizard to continue. If you are prompted for additional files, insert your Windows 2000 Server disk or type a path to the location of the files on the network.</li></p>

<p><li>Click Finish to complete the setup process.</li></p>
</ol>

</p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><HR>
Network Monitor is composed of a gathering agent that collects data, and an administrative utility that displays and analyzes the data. Installing the Network Monitor Tools component in Windows 2000 automatically installs both the 
Network Monitor utility and agent.
</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="166"><H3>Network Monitor Driver</H3></A>

<p>The Network Monitor driver gathers frames from a network adapter and passes the information to the Network Monitor utility for viewing and analysis. The driver can also forward frames to a remote administrator running the version of Network Monitor included with Microsoft Systems Management Server.</p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><HR>
When you install the Network Monitor driver, the Network Segment object is added for use in System Monitor.
</blockquote></div></p>

<p>Installing the driver alone does not install the Network Monitor administrative utility. If you want to view and analyze Network Monitor data on a system, you must install the Network Monitor Tools Windows component on a computer running Windows 2000 Server.</p>

<p><li><b>To install the Network Monitor driver</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li>Open the Network and Dial-Up Connections Control Panel applet.</li></p>

<p><li>Right-click the local area connection that you want to monitor, then click Properties.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Local Area Connection Properties dialog box, click Install.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Select Network Component Type dialog box, click Protocol, then click Add.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Select Network Protocol dialog box, click Network Monitor Driver, then click OK.</li></p>

<p>If prompted for additional files, insert your Windows 2000 CD or type a path to the location of the files on a network.</p>
</ol>

<A NAME="167"><H3>Capturing Network Data</H3></A>

<p>Network Monitor uses a process called capturing to examine network frames. You can capture all network traffic to and from the local network card, or capture a specific subset of frames. You can also set Network Monitor to respond to events on your network. You will learn how to capture and analyze network data in Lesson 2.</p>

<A NAME="168"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>You can use Windows 2000 Network Monitor to view and analyze problems on your network. You can also store a log of network activity into a file and then send the file to a professional network analyst or support organization.</p>

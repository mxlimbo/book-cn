<A NAME="663"><H1>Lesson 2: Backing Up Data</H1></A>

<p>After you have planned your backup, including planning the type of backup to use and when to perform backup jobs, the next step is to prepare to back up your data. You must complete certain preliminary tasks before you can back up your data. Then you can perform the backup. Afterward, you can schedule and run 
unattended backups.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li>Back up data at a computer and over the network.</li></p>

<p><li>Schedule a backup job.</li></p>

<p><li>Set backup options for Backup Wizard.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 45 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="664"><H2>Performing Preliminary Tasks</H2></A>

<p>An important part of each backup job is performing the preliminary tasks. One task that you must do is ensure that the files that you want to back up are closed. You should notify users to close files before you begin backing up data. Backup Wizard doesn't back up files that are locked open by applications. You can use 
e-mail or the Send Console Message dialog box in the Computer Management snap-in to send administrative messages to users.</p>

<p>You can send a console message, as follows:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>  On the Start menu, point to Programs, point to Administrative tools, and click Computer Management.</li></p>

<p><li>  On the Action menu, click All Tasks, and then click Send Console Message.</li></p>

<p>The Send Console Message dialog box appears. See Figure 19.3.</p>

<p><li>  Type the desired message in the Message box. Note the recipients in the Recipients box. You can add or remove recipients.</li></p>

<p><li>  Click Send to send the message to the listed recipients.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>For more information on sending a console message, see <A HREF="ch20a.htm">Chapter 20</A>, &quot;Monitoring Access to Network Resources.&quot;</p>

<p>If you use a removable media device, make sure that the following preliminary tasks occur:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>The backup device is attached to a computer on the network and is turned on. If you are backing up to tape, you must attach the tape device to the computer on which you run Backup Wizard.</li></p>

<p>

</p><p>
<!-- caption --><b>Figure 19.3</b> <i>The Send Console Message dialog box</i><!-- /caption -->
</p>

<p><li>The media device is listed on the Windows 2000 HCL.</li></p>

<p><li>The media is loaded in the media device. For example, if you are using a tape drive, ensure that a tape is loaded in the tape drive.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="665"><H2>Selecting Files and Folders to Back Up</H2></A>

<p>After you have completed the preliminary tasks, you can perform the backup. You can use the Backup Wizard button shown in Figure 19.4 to start Backup Wizard. To start Backup Wizard, click Start, point to Accessories, point to System Tools, click Backup, and then click Backup Wizard; or you can use the Run command on the Start menu to run Ntbackup, and then click Backup Wizard. Click Next to close the Welcome tab and display the What To Back Up page.</p>

<p>The first phase is to specify what to back up by choosing one of the following options:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Back Up Everything On My Computer.</b> Backs up all files on the computer on which you are running Backup Wizard, except those files that Backup Wizard excludes by default, such as certain power management files.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Back Up Selected Files, Drives, Or Network Data.</b> Backs up selected files and folders. This includes files and folders on the computer where you run Backup Wizard and any shared file or folder on the network. When you click this option, the Backup Wizard provides a hierarchical view of the computer and the network (through My Network Places).</li></p>

<p><li><b>Only Back Up The System State Data.</b> Backs up important system components, such as the Registry and the boot files for the computer on which you are running Backup Wizard.</li></p>

<p>

</p>
</ul>

<A NAME="666"><H2>Specifying Backup Destination and Media Settings</H2></A>

<p>After you select what you want to back up, you need to provide information about backup media. Table 19.1 describes the information that you must provide on the Where To Store The Backup page.</p>

<p><b>Table 19.1</b> <i>Where To Store The Backup Page Options</i></p>
<p>
<table valign="top" cellpadding="5" width="95%">

</p>

<p>After you provide the media information, Backup Wizard displays the Completing The Backup Wizard page and you have the opportunity to do either of the 
following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Start the backup. If you click Finish, during the backup process, Backup Wizard displays status information about the backup job in the Backup Progress dialog box.</li></p>

<p><li>Specify advanced backup options. If you click Advanced, the Backup wizard allows you to select the advanced backup settings listed in Table 19.2.</li></p>

</ul>
<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><HR>When the backup process is complete, you can choose to review the backup report, which is the backup log. A <i>backup log</i> is a text file that records backup operations and is stored on the hard disk of the computer on which you are running Backup Wizard.</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="667"><H2>Specifying Advanced Backup Settings</H2></A>

<p>When you specify advanced backup settings, you are changing the default backup settings for only the current backup job. The advanced settings cover the backup media and characteristics of the backup job.</p>

<p>Depending on whether you chose to back up now or later, Backup Wizard provides you with the opportunity to do either of the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>If you chose to finish the backup process, Backup Wizard displays the Completing The Backup Wizard settings and then presents the option to finish and immediately start the backup. During the backup, the wizard displays status information about the backup job.</li></p>

<p><li>If you chose to back up later, you are shown additional dialog boxes to schedule the backup process to occur later, as described in the next section.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="668"><H2>Scheduling Backup Jobs</H2></A>

<p>Scheduling a backup job means that you can have an unattended backup job 
occur later when users aren't at work and files are closed. You can also schedule backup jobs to occur at regular intervals. To enable this, Windows 2000 integrates Backup Wizard with the Task Scheduler service.</p>

<p>You can schedule a backup, as follows:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>  Click Later on the When To Back Up page of Backup Wizard.</li></p>

<p>Task Scheduler presents the Set Account Information dialog box, prompting you for your password. The user account must have the appropriate user rights and permissions to perform backup jobs.</p>
</ol>

<p>
<div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>
If the Task Scheduler service isn't running or isn't set to start automatically, Windows 2000 displays a dialog box prompting you to start the service. Click OK, and the Set Account Information dialog box appears.
</blockquote></div>
</p>

<ol>
<p><li value="2">  Enter your password in the Password box and Confirm Password box, and then click OK.</li></p>

<p>The When To Back Up page appears. You must provide a name for the backup job, and by default, the wizard displays the present date and time for the start date.</p>

<p><li>  Type the appropriate name in the Job Name box.</li></p>

<p><li>  Click Set Schedule to set a different start date and time. This selection causes Task Scheduler to display the Schedule Job dialog box.</li></p>

<p>In the Schedule Job dialog box, you can set the date, time, and number of 
occurrences for the backup job to repeat, such as every Friday at 10:00 P.M. You can also display all of the scheduled tasks for the computer by selecting the Show Multiple Schedules check box. This helps to prevent you from scheduling multiple tasks on the same computer at the same time.</p>
</ol>

<p>You can click the Advanced button to also schedule how long the backup can 
last and for how many days, weeks, months, or years you want this schedule 
to continue.</p>

<p>After you schedule the backup job and complete Backup Wizard, Windows Backup places the backup job on the calendar on the Schedule Jobs tab in 
Windows Backup. The backup job automatically starts at the time that you 
specified.</p>

<p>In this lesson, you learned that after you have planned your backup, the next step is to prepare to back up your data. An important part of each backup job is performing the preliminary tasks. One task that you must do is ensure that the files that you want to back up are closed, because Windows Backup doesn't back up files that are locked open by applications. Next you perform the backup.</p>

<p>Then you learned that in Backup Wizard, the first phase is to specify what 
to back up. You can choose from three options: back up everything on the computer; back up selected files, drives, or network data; or back up only the system state data. After you select what you want to back up, you need to provide the target destination and the backup media or filename. Then you can finish the backup or you can specify any advanced backup options.</p>

<p>In the practice exercises, you backed up a portion of your files. Then you created and ran an unattended backup job.</p>

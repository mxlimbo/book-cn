<A NAME="275"><H1>Lesson 4: Network Bindings</H1></A>

<p><i>Network bindings</i> enable communication between network adapter card drivers, protocols, and services. Figure 7.10 shows an example of network bindings. In Figure 7.10, the workstation service is bound to each of three protocols, and each protocol is bound to at least one network adapter card. This lesson describes the function of bindings in a network and the process for configuring them.</p>

<p>The Windows 2000 network architecture uses a series of interdependent layers. The bottom layer of the network architecture ends at the network adapter card, which places information on the cable, allowing information to flow between computers.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li>Explain how to configure network bindings.</li></p>
</ul>

</p>

<A NAME="276"><H2>Binding Between Architectural Levels</H2></A>

<p><i>Binding</i> is the process of linking network components on different levels to 
enable communication between those components. A network component can 
be bound to one or more network components above or below it. The services that each component provides can be shared by all other components that are bound to it. For example, in Figure 7.10, TCP/IP is bound to both the Workstation service and the Server service.</p>

<A NAME="277"><H2>Combining Network Bindings</H2></A>

<p>Many combinations of network bindings are possible. In the example shown in Figure 7.10, all three protocols are bound to the Workstation service, but only the routable protocols, NWLink and TCP/IP, are bound to the Server service. It is possible to select which protocols are bound to the network adapter cards. Network adapter card (0) is bound to all three protocols, while network adapter card (1) is bound only to the routable protocols. To control which components are bound together, you must be a member of the Administrators group.</p>

<p>When adding network software, Windows 2000 automatically binds all dependent network components accordingly. Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) 5 provides the capability to bind multiple protocols to multiple network adapter card drivers.</p>

<A NAME="278"><H2>Configuring Network Bindings</H2></A>

<p>You can configure your network bindings by using My Network Places.</p>

<p>You can configure network bindings by following these steps:</p>

<ol>
<p><li> Right-click My Network Places, and then click Properties.</li></p>

<p><li> In the Network And Dial-Up Connections window, click Advanced, and then click Advanced Settings.</li></p>

<p><li> In the Advanced Settings dialog box, under Client For Microsoft Networks, do one of the following:</li></p>


<ul>
<p><li>To bind the protocol to the selected adapter, click to select the adapter.</li></p>

<p><li>To unbind the protocol from the selected adapter, click to clear the adapter.</li></p>
</ul>
</ol>


<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><HR>Only an experienced network administrator who is familiar with the 
requirements of the network software should attempt to change binding settings.</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="279"><H2>Specifying Binding Order</H2></A>

<p>You can also specify binding order to optimize network performance. For 
example, a computer running Windows 2000 Workstation has NetBEUI, NWLink IPX/SPX, and TCP/IP installed. However, most of the servers to which this computer connects are running only TCP/IP. Verify that the Workstation binding to TCP/IP is listed <i>before</i> the Workstation bindings for the other protocols. In this way, when a user attempts to make a connection to a server, the Workstation service first attempts to use TCP/IP to establish the connection.</p>

<p>You can follow these steps to specify binding order:</p>

<ol>
<p><li> Right-click My Network Places, and then click Properties.</li></p>

<p><li>In the Network And Dial-Up Connections window, click Advanced, and then click Advanced Settings.</li></p>

<p><li> In the Advanced Settings dialog box, under Client For Microsoft Networks, click the protocol for which you want to change the binding order.</li></p>

<p><li> Use the arrow buttons to change the binding order for protocols that are bound to a specific adapter:</li></p>


<ul>
<p><li>To move the protocol higher in the binding order, click the Up Arrow button.</li></p>


<p><li>To move the protocol lower in the binding order, click the Down Arrow button.</li></p>
</ul></ol>

</p>

<A NAME="280"><H2>Practice: Working with Network Bindings</H2></A>

<p>In this practice, you will change the binding order of the protocols bound to 
your network adapter card. Next you will unbind a protocol from your network adapter card and then bind a protocol to your network adapter card. Finally you will uninstall a network protocol.</p>

<p>After completing this practice, you will be able to</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Change the binding order of protocols.</li></p>

<p><li>Bind and unbind a protocol.</li></p>

<p><li>Remove a protocol.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="281"><H3>Exercise 1: Changing the Binding Order of a Protocol</H3></A>

<p>In this exercise, you will change the binding order of the protocols bound to your network adapter card.</p>


<p><li><b>To change the protocol binding order</b></li></p>


<ol>
<p><li> Right-click My Network Places and click Properties.</li></p>

<p><li> Maximize the Network And Dial-Up Connections window, and on the Advanced menu, click Advanced Settings.</li></p>


<p>The Advanced Settings dialog box appears.</p>

<p>What is the order of the protocols listed under Client For Microsoft Networks in the Bindings For Local Area Connection list? </p>

<p><a href="chaaa.htm#913">Answer</a></p>

<p><li> Under Client For Microsoft Networks, click NWLink IPX/SPX/NetBIOS Compatible Transport Protocol.</li></p>

<p><li> Click the downward-pointing arrow.</li></p>


<p>Notice that the order of the protocols listed under Client For Microsoft 
Networks has changed. NWLink IPX/SPX/NetBIOS Compatible Transport Protocol should now be listed below Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). If it's not, click the downward-pointing arrow again to move it below Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).</p>


<p><li> Leave the Advanced Settings dialog box open.</li></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="282"><H3>Exercise 2: Unbinding a Protocol</H3></A>

<p>In this exercise, you will unbind TCP/IP from your network adapter card, which will leave NWLink as the only protocol available to access other computers.</p>


<p><li><b>To unbind TCP/IP</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li> In the Advanced Settings dialog box, under Client For Microsoft Networks in the Bindings For Local Area Connection list, unbind Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) by clearing the check box to the left of the entry.</li></p>


<p>TCP/IP is now unbound from your network adapter card.</p>


<p><li> Click OK to close the Advanced Settings dialog box.</li></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="283"><H3>Exercise 3: Uninstalling NWLink</H3></A>

<p><li><b>To remove NWLink</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li> In the Network And Dial-Up Connections window, right-click Local Area Connection, and then click Properties.</li></p>


<p>The Local Area Connection Properties dialog box appears, displaying the adapter in use and the network components configured for this connection.</p>


<p><li> Click NWLink IPX/SPX/NetBIOS Compatible Transport Protocol, and then click Uninstall.</li></p>


<p>The Uninstall NWLink IPX/SPX/NetBIOS Compatible Transport Protocol dialog box appears.</p>


<p><li> Click Yes to continue.</li></p>


<p>Notice that NWLink IPX/SPX/NetBIOS Compatible Transport Protocol is no longer listed as an installed protocol.</p>


<p><li> Click Close.</li></p>

<p><li> Close the Network And Dial-Up Connections window.</li></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="284"><H3>Exercise 4: Binding a Protocol</H3></A>

<p>In this exercise, TCP/IP is the only protocol installed, so you will bind TCP/IP to your network adapter card.</p>


<p><li><b>To bind TCP/IP</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li> On the Advanced menu of the Network And Dial-Up Connections window, click Advanced Settings.</li></p>


<p>The Advanced Settings dialog box appears.</p>


<p><li> Under Client For Microsoft Networks, select Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) by clicking the check box to the left of the option.</li></p>

<p><li> Click OK.</li></p>


<p>TCP/IP is now bound to your network adapter card.</p>
</ol>

<A NAME="285"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>In this lesson, you learned that binding is the process of linking network components on different levels to enable communication between them. A network component can be bound to one or more network components above or below it, which allows the services that each component provides to be shared by all other components that are bound to it. When you install network software, Windows 2000 automatically binds all dependent network components accordingly. NDIS 5 provides the capability to bind multiple protocols to multiple network adapter card drivers, and you can optimize network performance by specifying the binding order.</p>

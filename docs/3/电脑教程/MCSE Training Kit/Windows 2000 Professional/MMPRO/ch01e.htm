<A NAME="39"><H1>Lesson 4: Logging On to Windows 2000</H1></A>

<p>This lesson explains the Log On To Windows dialog box that you use to log on 
to Windows 2000. It also explains how Windows 2000 authenticates a user during the logon process to verify the identity of the user. This mandatory process ensures that only valid users can gain access to resources and data on a computer or the network.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b> 

<ul>
<p><li>Identify the features of the Log On To Windows dialog box.</li></p>

<p><li>Identify how Windows 2000 authenticates a user when the user logs on to a domain or logs on locally.</li></p>
</ul>



<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 10 minutes</b> </p>
</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="40"><H2>Logging On Locally to the Computer</H2></A>

<p>To log on to a computer running Windows 2000, a user provides a user name 
and password. Windows 2000 authenticates the user during the logon process to verify the identity of the user. Only valid users can gain access to resources and data on a computer or the network. Windows 2000 authenticates users who either log on locally to the computer at which they are seated or log on to a domain.</p>

<p>A user can log on locally to either of the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>A computer that is a member of a workgroup.</li></p>

<p><li>A computer that is a member of a domain but is not a domain controller. The user selects the computer name in the Log On To box in the Enter Password dialog box.</li></p>
</ul>



<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <HR>Domain controllers don't maintain a local security database. Therefore, 
local user accounts aren't available on domain controllers, and a user can't log 
on locally to a domain controller.</blockquote></div></p>

<p>When a user starts a computer running Windows 2000 Professional, the user is prompted to enter a user name and a password in the Log On To Windows dialog box, as shown in Figure 1.3.</p>

<p>Notice that the Log On To Windows dialog box contains an Options button. 
This button is a toggle that displays or hides additional logon options. Table 1.2 describes the available options in the Log On To Windows dialog box.</p>

<A NAME="41"><H2>Windows 2000 Authentication Process</H2></A>

<p>To gain access to a computer running Windows 2000 or to any resource on that computer, a user must provide a user name and password.</p>

<p>How Windows 2000 authenticates a user varies, based on whether the user is 
logging on to a domain or logging on locally to a computer. (See Figure 1.5.)</p>

</p><p>
<!-- caption --><b>Figure 1.5</b> <i>Windows 2000 authentication process at Logon</i><!-- /caption -->
</p>

<p>When logging on locally, the steps in the authentication process are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>The user logs on by providing logon information, such as <i>user name</i> and <i>password</i>, and Windows 2000 forwards this information to the security subsystem of that local computer.</li></p>

<p><li>Windows 2000 compares the logon information with the user information that is in the local security database.</li></p>

<p>The security subsystem of the local computer contains the local security database that Windows 2000 uses to validate the logon information.</p>

<p><li>If the information matches and the user account is valid, Windows 2000 creates an access token for the user.</li></p>

<p>An <i>access token</i> is the user's identification for that local computer, and it contains the user's security settings. These security settings allow the user to gain access to the appropriate resources and to perform specific system tasks.</p>
</ol>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <HR>In addition to the logon process, any time a user makes a connection to a computer, that computer authenticates the user and returns an access token. This authentication process is invisible to the user.</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="42"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>In this lesson, you learned that when a user starts a computer running Windows 2000 Professional, the Log On To Windows dialog box appears, and the user must enter a valid user name and password to log on. You also learned about the various options available in the Log On To Windows dialog box.</p>

<p>When a user logs on, he or she can log on to the local computer; or, if the computer is a member of a domain, the user can log on to the domain. The authentication process for logging on locally and logging on to a domain is similar. However, when a user logs on locally, the local computer performs the authentication; and when a user logs on to a domain, a domain controller must perform the authentication. If the user is logging on locally, the security subsystem of the local computer contains the local security database that Windows 2000 uses to validate the logon information. If the user is logging on to a domain, a domain controller contains a copy of the Directory that Windows 2000 uses to validate the logon information.</p>

<p>In this lesson, you will learn about some common printing problems and how to troubleshoot them.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li>Describe how to troubleshoot some common printing problems.</li></p>
</ul>



<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 5 minutes</b></p>

<A NAME="463"><H2>Examining the Problem</H2></A>

<p>When you detect a printing problem, always verify that the print device is plugged in, that it is on, and that it is connected to the print server. For a network-interface print device, verify that a network connection exists between the print device and the print server.</p>

<p>To determine the cause of a problem, first try printing from a different program to verify that the problem is with the printer and not with the program. If the problem is with the printer, ask the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Can other users print normally? If so, the problem is most likely caused by insufficient permissions, lack of a network connection, or client computer complications.</li></p>

<p><li>Does the print server use the correct printer driver for the print device?</li></p>

<p><li>Is the print server operational, and is enough disk space available for spooling?</li></p>

<p><li>Does the client computer have the correct printer driver?</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="464"><H2>Reviewing Common Printing Problems</H2></A>

<p>Certain printing problems are common to most network printing environments. Table 13.6 describes some of these common printing problems, as well as some possible causes and solutions.</p>

<A NAME="465"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>In this lesson, you learned about a few basic issues to check when you have a printing problem. You were also given a list of some common printing problems and some suggested causes and solutions. In many cases, you will find that in troubleshooting a problem, you must investigate the problem as thoroughly as you can and then begin trying logical solutions until you discover one that works.</p>

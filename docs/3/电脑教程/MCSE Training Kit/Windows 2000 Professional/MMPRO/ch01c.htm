</ul>


<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b> <HR>Microsoft Windows 2000 also supports DirectX 7, which provides low-level application APIs that give access to high-performance media acceleration on Microsoft Windows-based computers.</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="30"><H3>Symmetric Multiprocessing</H3></A>

<p>Windows 2000 is a multiprocessing operating system capable of running on computers containing more than one processor. Windows 2000 Professional provides symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) system capabilities and supports two processors. It assumes that all of the processors are equal and that they all have access to the same physical memory. Therefore, Windows 2000 can run any thread on any available processor regardless of which process&#8212;user or executive&#8212;owns the thread.</p>

<p>The design of Windows 2000 also supports processor affinity, whereby a process 
or thread can specify that it is to run on a particular set of processors. As with 
earlier versions of Windows NT, Windows 2000 includes APIs that a process 
can use for processor affinity. These APIs must be defined in the application to make use of processor affinity.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 uses the same rules for scheduling on a multiprocessor system as it does on a single-processor system. Therefore, at any given time, the threads that are ready and have the highest priorities are actually running.</p>

<A NAME="31"><H3>Asymmetric Multiprocessing</H3></A>

<p>Asymmetric multiprocessing (ASMP) systems also exist, in which processors are different. They might address different physical memory spaces, or they might have other discrepancies. These operating systems run only certain processes on certain processors. For example, the kernel might always execute on a particular processor. Windows 2000 doesn't support ASMP.</p>

<A NAME="32"><H2>Enhanced File Management</H2></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Professional provides significant enhancements to file management capabilities. Features that enhance file management in Windows 2000 
Professional include the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>NTFS file system.</b> Supports file encryption and enables you to add disk space to an NTFS volume without having to restart the computer. It also supports distributed link tracking, and per-user disk quotas to monitor and limit disk space use. For more information on the NTFS file system, see <A HREF="ch02a.htm">Chapter 2</A>, &quot;Installing Windows 2000 Professional.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li><b>FAT32 file system.</b> Supports FAT32 file system for compatibility with Windows 95 Operating System Release (OSR) 2 systems and later. FAT32 is an enhanced version of the FAT file system for use on disk volumes larger than 2 GB. For more information on the FAT32 file system, see <A HREF="ch02a.htm">Chapter 2</A>, &quot;Installing Windows 2000 Professional.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li><b>Disk Defragmenter utility.</b> Rearranges files, programs, and unused space on your computer's hard disk so that programs run faster and files open more quickly. For more information on Disk Defragmenter, see <A HREF="ch18a.htm">Chapter 18</A>, &quot;Managing Data Storage.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li><b>Backup utility.</b> Helps to protect data from accidental loss because of hardware or storage media failure. The Backup utility in Windows 2000 allows you to schedule backups to occur automatically. For more information on the Backup utility, see <A HREF="ch19a.htm">Chapter 19</A>, &quot;Backing Up and Restoring Data.&quot; You can back up data to a wide variety of storage media, such as the following:</li></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Tape drives</li></p>

<p><li>External hard disks</li></p>

<p><li>Zip disks</li></p>

<p><li>Recordable CD-ROMs</li></p>

<p><li>Logical drives</li></p>
</ul>

<p><li><b>Volume mount points.</b> Allow you to connect, or mount, a local drive at any empty folder on a local NTFS-formatted volume.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="33"><H2>Enhanced Security Features</H2></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Professional is the most secure Windows desktop operating system for either a stand-alone computer or any type of public or private network. Security features and enhancements in Windows 2000 Professional include the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Kerberos 5. Supports single logon, allowing faster authentication and faster network response. Kerberos 5 is the primary security protocol for domains in Windows 2000.</li></p>

<p><li>Encrypting File System (EFS). Strengthens security by encrypting files on your hard disk so that no one can access them without using the correct password.</li></p>

<p><li>Internet Protocol Security (IPSec). Encrypts Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) traffic to secure communications within an intranet and provides the highest levels of security for VPN traffic across the Internet.</li></p>

<p><li>Smart card support. Enables portability of credentials and other private information between computers at work, home, or on the road. This eliminates the need to transmit sensitive information, such as authentication tickets and private keys, over networks.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="34"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Professional improves the capabilities of previous versions of Windows in five main areas: ease of use, simplified management, increased hardware support, enhanced file management, and enhanced security features.</p>

<p>Some of the ease-of-use improvements include enhancements to the user interface, such as a customized Start menu that presents only the programs that you use most often, and improved Log On and Shut Down dialog boxes. Windows 2000 Professional includes support for the latest laptop technologies based on APM and ACPI, and provides a Network Connection wizard and VPN support. It provides Offline Folders that allow you to copy documents stored on the network to your local computer for access when you are offline; and it provides Synchronization Manager&#8212;which compares items on the network to items that you opened or updated while working offline&#8212;and synchronizes them.</p>

<p>Printing in Windows 2000 Professional has also been improved. IPP allows 
users to print to a URL over an intranet or the Internet, view printer and job- 
related information in HTML format from any browser, and download and install printer drivers over the Internet. The Windows 2000 Add Printer wizard simplifies the process of connecting to local and network printers from within a program, and Image Color Management 2 allows you to send high-quality color documents to a printer or another computer with greater speed and reliability than ever before.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 also simplifies the process of setting up a computer. The Windows 2000 System Preparation tool allows you to create an image of a computer's hard disk so that you can use a third-party tool to duplicate the hard disk on similarly configured computers. The Setup Manager wizard guides you through the process of creating answer files for unattended installation scripts.</p>

<p>Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional now supports more than 7,000 hardware devices, such as infrared devices, scanners, digital cameras, and advanced multimedia devices. Other enhancements to hardware support include the following: an Add/Remove Hardware wizard that allows you to add, remove, troubleshoot, and upgrade computer peripherals; a Win32 Driver Model that allows device drivers written to the WDM to work in both Windows 98 and Windows 2000; enhanced Plug and Play support; power options that prevent unnecessary power drains on your system by directing power to devices as they need it; and support for DirectX 7. Windows 2000 Professional also supports symmetric multiprocessing, which means it is capable of running on computers containing more than one processor.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 Professional enhancements to file management capabilities 
include a disk defragmenter utility and an NTFS file system that supports file 
encryption, distributed link tracking, and per-user disk quotas to monitor and limit disk space use. A Backup utility allows you to back up data to a wide variety of storage media: tape drives, external hard disks, zip disks, recordable 
CD-ROMs, and logical drives.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 Professional is the most secure Windows desktop operating system for either a stand-alone computer or any type of public or private network. Security features and enhancements in Windows 2000 Professional include support for Kerberos 5; Encrypting File System, which strengthens security by encrypting files on your hard disk; and IPSec, which encrypts TCP/IP traffic and provides the highest levels of security for VPN traffic across the Internet.</p>

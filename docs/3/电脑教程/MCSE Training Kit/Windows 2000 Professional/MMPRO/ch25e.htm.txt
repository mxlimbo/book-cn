<A NAME="868"><H1>Lesson 4: Installing, Managing, and Troubleshooting Devices</H1></A>

<p>This lesson explains how to install, configure, and troubleshoot miscellaneous devices, including fax and mouse support.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li>Configure and troubleshoot a fax device.</li></p>

<p><li>Manage and troubleshoot I/O devices.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 15 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="869"><H2>Configuring and Troubleshooting Fax Support</H2></A>

<p>If you have a fax device, such as a fax modem installed, then Control Panel will have a Fax icon. You can use the Fax icon to add, monitor, and troubleshoot fax devices, including fax modems and fax printers. Double-click the Fax icon, and then select the Advanced Options tab.</p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>The Advanced Options tab appears only if you are logged on as Administrator or have administrator privileges.</blockquote></div></p>

<p>The following three selections are available on the Advanced Options page:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Open Fax Service Management Console.</b> This option allows you to view any fax devices you have installed and to change any properties for any of these devices.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Open Fax Services Management Help.</b> This option allows you to start a Help session for the Open Fax Services Management Console.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Add A Fax Printer.</b> This option allows you to install a fax printer.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="870"><H3>Using the Fax Service Management Console</H3></A>

<p>Using the Fax Service Management window, you can administer fax support on your local computer or on other computers on your network. By default, you are set up to send a fax, not to receive a fax. The functionality of the Fax Service Management console includes the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Setting up your fax devices to receive faxes</li></p>

<p><li>Changing security permissions for users</li></p>

<p><li>Changing the number of rings before a fax device answers a fax receive</li></p>

<p><li>Configuring the number of retries before a fax terminates a fax send</li></p>

<p><li>Configuring where to store sent and received faxes</li></p>
</ul>



<p>The Open Fax Services Management Help option provides online Help for the Fax Service Management console. You can use the third option, Add A Fax Printer, to install a fax printer. The newly installed fax printer is added to the Printers folder.</p>

<A NAME="871"><H3>Faxing a Document</H3></A>

<p>You can use any Windows-based application that contains a Print command to fax a document. Click File and then click Print to open the Print dialog box. Select the fax printer, and then click Print to open the Send Fax wizard. The wizard will guide you through any configuration and help you send the fax.</p>

<A NAME="872"><H3>Monitoring a Fax</H3></A>

<p>Open Fax in Control Panel and select the Status Monitor tab. Ensure that Display The Status Monitor is selected and click OK. This option displays the Fax Monitor dialog box automatically when a fax is sent or a call is received. The Fax Monitor dialog box allows you to view details of the fax being sent&#8212;for example, whether the fax is actually being sent or whether the system is still dialing and trying to establish a connection. The Fax dialog box also allows you to easily end a fax call.</p>

<A NAME="873"><H2>Managing and Troubleshooting I/O Devices</H2></A>

<p>The list of devices that you can install is too long to include in this book. However, this section includes some of the more common devices you can install as well as how they are installed, configured, and managed.</p>

<A NAME="874"><H3>Scanners and Cameras</H3></A>

<p>Most scanners and cameras are Plug and Play devices, and Windows 2000 will install them automatically when you connect them to your computer. If they aren't installed automatically when you connect your computer, or if they aren't Plug and Play compatible, use the Scanner And Camera Installation wizard. To open this wizard, double-click Scanners And Cameras in Control Panel, and then click Add.</p>

<p>To configure a scanner or a camera, double-click Scanners And Cameras in Control Panel to open the Scanners And Cameras Properties dialog box, select the appropriate device, and then click Properties. To give you a configuration example, the standard color profile for Integrated Color Management (ICM

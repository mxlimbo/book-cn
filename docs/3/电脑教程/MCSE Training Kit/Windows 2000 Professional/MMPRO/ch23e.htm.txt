<A NAME="806"><H1>Lesson 4: Upgrading Previous Versions of Windows to Windows 2000</H1></A>

<p>You can upgrade most previous versions of Windows operating systems directly to Windows 2000 to take advantage of the new features offered in the Windows 2000 Professional operating system. However, before upgrading to Windows 2000, 
ensure that the computer hardware meets the minimum Windows 2000 hardware requirements. You must also check the Hardware Compatibility List or test the computers for hardware compatibility using the Windows 2000 Compatibility tool. You want to ensure that the hardware is compatible with Windows 2000 to avoid surprises when you start the upgrade on a large number of client computers.</p>

<p>For computers running previous versions of Windows that use compatible hardware, you upgrade them directly to Windows 2000. If Windows 95 and Windows 98 client systems are using incompatible or insufficient hardware, you can still take advantage of the functionality of Active Directory directory services provided by a Windows 2000 domain. To do this, you can install the Windows 2000 Directory Service Client on these systems.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>

<ul>
<p><li>Explain how to upgrade older Windows client operating systems to Windows 2000.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 25 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="807"><H2>Identifying Client Upgrade Paths</H2></A>

<p>You can upgrade most client computers running older versions of Windows 
directly to Windows 2000. However, computers running Windows NT 3.1 or 3.5 require an additional step. Table 23.3 lists the Windows 2000 Professional 
upgrade paths for client operating systems.</p>

<A NAME="808"><H2>Identifying Hardware Requirements and Compatibility</H2></A>

<p>Before you upgrade a client computer to Windows 2000 Professional, make sure that it meets the minimum hardware requirements. Table 23.4 describes these hardware requirements.</p>

<p>Most hardware devices that functioned properly in Windows NT Workstation 4 will also function properly in Windows 2000 Professional. However, you might have to replace some third-party drivers with new drivers designed for Windows 2000. You can obtain these new drivers from the manufacturer of the specific device.</p>

<A NAME="809"><H2>Generating a Hardware Compatibility Report</H2></A>

<p>You generate a hardware and software compatibility report using the Windows 2000 Compatibility tool. This tool runs automatically during system upgrades, but Microsoft recommends that you run it before beginning the upgrade to identify any hardware and software problems. This is especially true when upgrading many computers with similar hardware, so compatibility problems can be fixed before the upgrade begins.</p>

<A NAME="810"><H3>Generating the Report</H3></A>

<p>You can generate a compatibility report using the Windows 2000 Compatibility tool in two ways:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Run Winnt32/checkupgradeonly</li></p>

<p>Using the /checkupgradeonly switch with the Winn32 command launches the first part of the Windows 2000 Setup program. Instead of running the entire setup process, it checks only for compatible hardware and software. This generates a report that you can analyze to determine which system components are Windows 2000 compatible.</p>

<p><li>Run the Chkupgrd.exe utility</li></p>

<p>This immediately generates the compatibility report. You can download this utility from <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/default.asp" TARGET="_window2">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/default.asp</A>.</p>
</ul>

<A NAME="811"><H3>Reviewing the Report</H3></A>

<p>Both Winnt32/checkupgradeonly and the Chkupgrd.exe utility generate the same report. This report appears as a text document; you can view it in the utility's window or save it as a text file.</p>

<p>The report documents the system hardware and software that is incompatible with Windows 2000. It also identifies whether you need to obtain an upgrade pack for software installed on the system, and any additional changes or modifications you must make to the system to maintain functionality in Windows 2000.</p>

<A NAME="812"><H2>Identifying Software Compatibility</H2></A>

<p>Most applications that run in either Windows NT Workstation 4 or Windows NT Workstation 3.51 will run in Windows 2000 Professional. However, some applications will be incompatible. You should remove the following software applications before you upgrade to Windows 2000 Professional:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Any third-party networking protocols and any third-party client software that doesn't have an update in the i386\Winntupg folder on the Windows 2000 CD-ROM</li></p>

<p><li>All antivirus applications and disk quota software because of the changes in the NTFS file system from version 4, which was used in Windows NT 4, and version 5, which is used in Windows 2000 Professional</li></p>

<p><li>Any custom power management software or tools because Windows 2000's support of Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) and Advanced Power Management (APM) replace these</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="813"><H2>Upgrading Compatible Windows 95 and Windows 98 Computers</H2></A>

<p>For client systems that test as compatible with Windows 2000, you run the 
Windows 2000 Setup program (winnt32.exe) to complete the upgrade process 
by completing the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<p><li> Run the winnt32.exe command.</li></p>

<p><li> Accept the license agreement.</li></p>

<p><li> If the computer you are upgrading is already a member of a domain, you must create a computer account in that domain. Windows 95 and Windows 98 clients don't require a computer account, but Windows 2000 Professional clients do.</li></p>

<p><li> You are asked to provide upgrade packs for any applications that might need them. Upgrade packs update software so it works with Windows 2000. Upgrade packs are available from the software vendor.</li></p>

<p><li> You are prompted to upgrade to NTFS. Select the upgrade if you don't plan to set up the client computer to dual boot operating systems.</li></p>

<p><li> The Windows 2000 Compatibility tool runs, generating a report. If the report shows the computer as Windows 2000 compatible, continue with the upgrade. If the report shows the computer to be incompatible with Windows 2000, terminate the upgrade process.</li></p>

<p><li> The upgrade finishes without further user intervention. After the upgrade is complete, you must enter the password for the local computer's Administrator account.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>If your computer is Windows 2000 compatible, it is now upgraded and is a member of your domain. If your computer isn't Windows 2000 compatible, you must upgrade your hardware, if possible, or you can install the Windows 2000 Directory Service Client.</p>

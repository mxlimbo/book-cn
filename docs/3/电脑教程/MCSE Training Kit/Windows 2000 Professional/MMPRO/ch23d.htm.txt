<A NAME="792"><H1>Lesson 3: Performing Remote Installations</H1></A>

<p>The most efficient method of deploying Windows 2000 Professional is to use 
remote installation. You can perform remote installations of Windows 2000 
Professional if you have a Windows 2000 Server infrastructure in place and the computers in your network support remote boot.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li>Describe how to deploy Windows 2000 using Remote Installation Services.</li></p>

<p><li>Install Remote Installation Services.</li></p>

<p><li>Create a boot floppy.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 40 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div></p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><HR>To be able to install Remote Installation Services and to create a boot floppy for network interface cards that are not equipped with a Pre-Boot Execution Environment (PXE) boot ROM, or for systems with BIOSs that don't support starting from the PXE boot ROM, you must have a computer running one 
of the Windows 2000 Server family of products. You must also have either the 
CD-ROM or access to a network source of files used to install the Server product. For more information, see the section &quot;<A HREF="ch23d.htm#795">Examining the Prerequisites</A>.&quot;</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="793"><H2>Understanding Remote Installation</H2></A>

<p><i>Remote installation</i> is the process of connecting to a server running Remote 
Installation Services, called the RIS server, and then starting an automated installation of Windows 2000 Professional on a local computer. Remote installation enables administrators to install Windows 2000 Professional on client computers throughout a network from a central location. This reduces the time administrators spend visiting all the computers in a network, thereby reducing the cost of deploying Windows 2000 Professional.</p>

<p>RIS provides the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Enables remote installation of Windows 2000 Professional.</li></p>

<p><li>Simplifies server image management by eliminating hardware-specific images and by detecting Plug and Play hardware during setup.</li></p>

<p><li>Supports recovery of the operating system and computer in the event of computer failure.</li></p>

<p><li>Retains security settings after restarting the destination computer.</li></p>

<p><li>Reduces TCO by allowing either users or technical staff to install the operating system on individual computers.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="794"><H2>Installing and Configuring Remote Installation Services</H2></A>

<p>Before beginning a rollout of Windows 2000 Professional using RIS, become 
familiar with the prerequisites for the service and install the service using the 
Remote Installation Services Setup wizard.</p>

<A NAME="795"><H3>Examining the Prerequisites</H3></A>

<p>RIS is available only on computers running one of the Windows 2000 Server family of products. The RIS server can be a domain controller or a member server. Table 23.2 lists the network services required for RIS and their RIS function. These network services don't have to be installed on the same computer as RIS, but they must be available somewhere on the network.</p>

<p><b>Table 23.2</b> <i>Network Services Required for RIS</i></p>
<p>
<table valign="top" cellpadding="5" width="95%">
<tr>
<th>Network service</th>
<th>RIS function</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">DNS Service</td>
<td valign="top">RIS relies on the DNS server for locating both the directory 
 service and client computer accounts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">DHCP Service</td>
<td valign="top">Client computers that can perform a network boot receive an 
 IP address from the DHCP server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Active Directory directory services</td>
<td valign="top">RIS relies on the directory services based on Active Directory 
 technology in Windows 2000 for locating existing client 
 computers as well as existing RIS servers.</td>

</p>

<p>Remote installation requires that RIS (included on the Windows 2000 Server 
CD-ROM) be installed on a volume that is shared over the network. This shared volume must meet the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>The shared volume can't be on the same drive that is running Windows

<A NAME="78"><H1>Lesson 3: Installing Windows 2000 over the Network</H1></A>

<p>In addition to installing from a CD-ROM, you can install Windows 2000 over the network. This lesson demonstrates the similarities and differences between installing from a CD-ROM and installing over the network. The major difference is the location of the source files needed to install Windows 2000. This lesson also lists the requirements for a network installation.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li>Identify the steps for completing a network installation of Windows 2000.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 10 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="79"><H2>Preparing for a Network Installation</H2></A>

<p>In a network installation, the Windows 2000 installation files reside in a shared location on a network file server, which is called a <i>distribution server.</i> From the computer on which you want to install Windows 2000 (the target computer), you connect to the distribution server and then run the Setup program.</p>

<p>The basic environment requirement for a network installation is shown in Figure 2.7. The pre-Setup requirements for a network installation are explained in more detail in the list that follows.</p>

<!-- caption --><b>Figure 2.7</b> <i>A network installation's basic environment</i><!-- /caption -->
</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Locate a distribution server.</b> The distribution server contains the installation files from the i386 folder on the Windows 2000 Professional CD-ROM. These files must reside in a common network location in a shared folder. This shared folder allows computers on the network to gain access to the installation files. Contact a network administrator to obtain the path to the installation files on the distribution server.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><HR>
Once you have created or located a distribution server, you can use the over-the-network installation method to concurrently install Windows 2000 on multiple computers.
</blockquote></div></p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Create a FAT partition on the target computer.</b> The target computer requires a formatted partition on which to copy the installation files. Create a 650-MB (1-GB or larger recommended) partition and format it with the FAT file system.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Install a network client.</b> A network client is software that allows the target computer to connect to the distribution server. On a computer without an operating system, you must boot from a client disk that includes a network client that enables the target computer to connect to the distribution server.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="80"><H2>Creating a Distribution Server</H2></A>

<p>A distribution server stores the distribution folder structure. The distribution folder structure contains the files necessary to install Windows 2000 Professional over the network. If you have a lot of computers on which to install Windows 2000 or if you will be doing multiple Windows 2000 installations simultaneously, create more than one set of distribution folders. Having distribution folders set up on several computers will make the file copy portion of Windows 2000 Setup faster. Even if you have several different types of hardware configurations on which to install Windows 2000, you create one set of distribution folders and use them with different answer files to install to all the different hardware types.</p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><HR>
If you are installing Windows 2000 on a computer running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT, or an earlier version of Windows 2000, the Winnt32.exe program allows you to specify up to eight locations for the distribution folders.
</blockquote></div></p>

<p>To create a distribution server, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Log on to the server as administrator or connect to the server on which you want to create a distribution file structure.</li></p>

<p><li>Create a folder on the server named W2000P.</li></p>
</ol>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><HR>
The name W2000P is for a distribution folder structure containing the source files for Windows 2000 Professional. You can use W2000S for Windows 2000 Server and W2000AS for Windows 2000 Advanced Server. If you're creating distribution folder structures on more than one server, you can name them W2000P1, W2000P2, W2000P3, W2000P4, and so on.

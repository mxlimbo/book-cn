<A NAME="158"><H1>Lesson 5: Installing Hardware Manually</H1></A>

<p>Occasionally, Windows 2000 fails to automatically detect a hardware device. When this occurs, you must manually install the hardware device. You might also have to manually install a hardware device if the device requires a specific hardware resource. You manually install these devices to ensure that they have the necessary resources.</p>

<p>To manually install hardware, you need to do the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Determine which hardware resource the hardware device requires.</li></p>

<p><li>Determine the available hardware resources.</li></p>

<p><li>Change hardware resource assignments.</li></p>
</ul>



<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li>Install hardware manually.</li></p>
</ul>



<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 10 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="159"><H2>Determining Which Hardware Resources Are Required</H2></A>

<p>When installing new hardware, you need to know which resources the hardware can use. You can reference the product documentation to determine the resources that a hardware device requires. Table 4.6 describes the resources that hardware devices use to communicate with an operating system.</p>

<p><b>Table 4.6</b> <i> Hardware Device Resources</i></p>
<p>
<table valign="top" cellpadding="5" width="95%">

<tr>
<th>Resource </th><th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Interrupts </td><td valign="top">Hardware devices use interrupts to send messages. The 
 microprocessor knows this as an interrupt request (IRQ). 
 The microprocessor uses this information to determine 
 which device needs its attention and the type of attention 
 that it needs. Windows 2000 provides 16 IRQs, numbered 0-15, which are assigned to devices; for example, 
 Windows 2000 assigns IRQ 1 to the keyboard.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Input/output (I/O) ports </td><td valign="top">I/O ports are a section of memory that a hardware device 
 uses to communicate with the operating system. When a 
 microprocessor receives an IRQ, the operating system 
 checks the I/O port address to retrieve additional information about what the hardware device wants it to do. 
 An I/O port is represented as a hexadecimal number.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Direct memory access (DMA) </td><td valign="top">DMAs are channels that allow a hardware device, such 
 as a floppy disk drive, to access memory directly, without interrupting the microprocessor. DMA channels 
 speed up access to memory. Windows 2000 has eight 
 DMA channels, numbered 0-7.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Memory </td><td valign="top">Many hardware devices, such as a network adapter card 
 (NAC), use onboard memory or reserve system memory. 
 This reserved memory is unavailable for use by other 
 devices or Windows 2000.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<A NAME="160"><H2>Determining Available Hardware Resources</H2></A>

<p>After you determine which resources a hardware device requires, you can 
look for an available resource. Device Manager provides a list of all hardware resources and their availability, as shown in Figure 4.14.</p>

<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F04tk14x.htm')"> <img src="images/F04tk14.JPG" width=404 height=285 border=0 ALT="Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!-- caption --><b>Figure 4.14</b> <i>The Device Manager window showing resources listed by connection</i><!-- /caption -->
</p>

<p>You can do the following to view the hardware resources lists</p>

<ol>
<p><li> From the System Properties dialog box, click the Hardware tab, and then click Device Manager.</li></p>

<p><li> On the View menu, click Resources By Connection.</li></p>


<p>Device Manager displays the resources that are currently in use (for example, IRQs).</p>


<p><li> To view a list of resources for another type of hardware resource, on the View menu, click the type of hardware resource that you want to see.</li></p>


<p>Once you know which hardware resources are available, you can install the hardware manually with the Add/Remove Hardware wizard.</p>
</ol>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>If you select a hardware resource during manual installation, you might need to configure the hardware device so that it can use the resource. For example, for a network adapter to use IRQ 5, you might have to set a jumper on the adapter and configure Windows 2000 so that it recognizes that the adapter now uses IRQ 5.</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="161"><H2>Changing Hardware Resource Assignments</H2></A>

<p>You might need to change hardware resource assignments. For example, a hardware device might require a specific resource presently in use by another device. You might also encounter two hardware devices requesting the same hardware resource, resulting in a conflict.</p>

<p>To change a resource setting, use the Resources tab in the device's Properties dialog box. You can do the following to access the Resources tab:</p>

<ol>
<p><li> From the Hardware tab of the System Properties dialog box, click Device Manager.</li></p>

<p><li> Expand the device list, right-click the specific device, and then click Properties.</li></p>

<p><li> In the Properties dialog box for the device, click the Resources tab.</li></p>
</ol>



<p>
<div class="tip"><blockquote>
<b>TIP</b><hr>When you change a hardware resource, print the content of Device Manager. This will provide you 
with a record of the hardware configuration. If you encounter problems, you can use the printout to 
verify the hardware resource assignments.</blockquote></div>
</p>


<p>From this point, follow the same procedures that you used to choose a hardware resource during a manual installation.</p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr>Changing the resource assignments for non-Plug and Play devices in Device Manager doesn't change the resources used by that device. You use Device Manager only to set device configuration for the operating system. To change the resources used by a non-Plug and Play device, consult the device documentation to see whether switches or jumpers must be configured on the device.</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="162"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>In this lesson, you learned about installing hardware manually. If Windows 2000 fails to automatically detect a hardware device, or if a hardware device requires 
a specific hardware resource, you might have to manually install these devices. When you manually install hardware, you must determine any resources required by that hardware device. Hardware resources include interrupts, I/O ports, and memory. You can reference the product documentation to determine any resources that a device requires. You also must determine which hardware resources are available. The Device Manager snap-in provides a list of all hardware resources and their availability.</p>

<p>You also learned that you might need to change hardware resource assignments. For example, a hardware device might require a specific resource presently in 
use by another device. You saw that to change a hardware resource, you also use Device Manager. To view or change the hardware resources used by a device, in the Device Manager snap-in, you expand the relevant device category in the right pane, right-click the specific device, and then click Properties. In the Device Properties dialog box, you click the Resources tab to view the current resources being used, and you click Change Setting to make changes to the resources in use.</p>

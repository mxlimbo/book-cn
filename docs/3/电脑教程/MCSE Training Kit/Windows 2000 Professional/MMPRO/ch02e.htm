<A NAME="87"><H2>Setup Logs</H2></A>

<p>During setup, Windows 2000 generates a number of log files. These logs contain information about the installation process that can help you resolve any problems that occur after the Setup program completes. Two of the logs are especially useful for troubleshooting: the action log and the error log.</p>

<A NAME="88"><H3>Using the Action Log</H3></A>

<p>The action log provides a description of the actions that Setup performs. These actions are recorded in chronological order, and they include such actions as copying files and creating registry entries. The action log also includes any entries that are written to the error log. The action log is stored in the file Setupact.log.</p>

<A NAME="89"><H3>Using the Error Log</H3></A>

<p>The error log contains a description of any errors that occur during setup, along with an indication of the severity of each error. If errors occur, the log viewer shows the user the error log at the end of setup. The error log is stored in the file Setuperr.log.</p>

<A NAME="90"><H3>Additional Logs</H3></A>

<p>A number of additional logs are created during setup. These logs include the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b><i>windir</i>\comsetup.log.</b> Outlines installation for Optional Component Manager and Com+ components.</li></p>

<p><li><b><i>windir</i>\mmdet.log.</b> As a detection log for multimedia devices, details port ranges for each device.</li></p>

<p><li><b><i>windir</i>\setupapi.log.</b> Logs an entry each time a line from an .INF file is implemented. If for some reason an error occurs, it will log information here to indicate the failure.</li></p>

<p><li><b><i>windir</i>\debug\NetSetup.log.</b> Logs activity for joining a domain or workgroup.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="91"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>In this lesson, you learned some common problems that you might encounter when installing Windows 2000. For example, bad media can cause installation problems, in which case you will have to get a new CD-ROM to be able to install. You might also encounter problems with your installation if your hardware isn't on the HCL. If your CD-ROM drive isn't on the HCL, you can swap it out for a supported drive or install over the network and add the driver to support the CD-ROM drive if it's available.</p>

<p>If you failed to complete your preinstallation tasks and none of the partitions have enough room to install Windows 2000, you can create a new partition from unused space on the hard disk if the space is available; you can delete some existing partitions so that you can create one large enough to install Windows 2000; or you can format an existing partition to provide enough space to install Windows 2000.</p>

<p>You also learned some tips to try in case you can't connect to the domain controller. If you can't connect to the domain controller, you can complete the installation by joining the computer to a workgroup. After you have completed the installation and determined what is preventing you from connecting to the domain controller, you can join the computer to the domain.</p>

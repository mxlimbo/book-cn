<A NAME="22"><H1>Lesson 2: Windows 2000 Professional</H1></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Professional is easier to use and manage and provides greater compatibility, file management capabilities, and security than earlier versions 
of Windows. This lesson discusses how Windows 2000 Professional improves 
the capabilities of earlier versions of Windows in these areas: ease of use, simplified management, increased hardware support, enhanced file management, and enhanced security features.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b> 

<ul>
<p><li>Identify features and enhancements in Windows 2000 Professional.</li></p>
</ul>



<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 15 minutes</b> </p>
</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="23"><H2>Ease of Use</H2></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Professional includes changes to the look and functionality of 
the desktop, windows, and the Start menu, making it easier to use than previous versions of Windows. Besides these user interface enhancements, Windows 2000 Professional also contains features that improve support for mobile users and make printing easier and more flexible.</p>

<A NAME="24"><H3>User Interface Enhancements</H3></A>

<p>The enhancements and features that improve the Windows 2000 Professional user interface include the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Customized Start menu.</b> Personalized Menus can be activated to keep track of the programs you use and to update the Programs menu so that it presents only the programs that you use most often. Applications that you use less frequently are hidden from normal view, making the Start menu easier to use. For more information on customized Start menus, see <A HREF="ch02a.htm">Chapter 2</A>, &quot;Installing Windows 2000 Professional.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li><b>Log On and Shut Down dialog boxes.</b> The Log On and Shut Down dialog boxes are easier to use with fewer, better organized choices. For more information on the Log On and Shut Down dialog boxes, see <A HREF="ch02a.htm">Chapter 2</A>, &quot;Installing Windows 2000 Professional.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li><b>Task Scheduler.</b> The enhanced Task Scheduler allows users to schedule scripts and programs to run at specific times. For more information on Task Scheduler, see <A HREF="ch03a.htm">Chapter 3</A>, &quot;Using Microsoft Management Console and Task Scheduler.&quot;</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="25"><H3>Support for Mobile Users</H3></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Professional supports the latest laptop technologies based on 
Advanced Power Management (APM) and Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI), which turns off power to the display and hard disks after a 
period of inactivity, and allows you to change or remove devices without turning off the computer. ACPI also lengthens battery life with power management and suspend or resume capabilities. For more information on APM and ACPI, see <A HREF="ch24a.htm">Chapter 24</A>, &quot;Configuring Windows 2000 for Mobile Computers.&quot;</p>

<p>Features in Windows 2000 Professional that provide support for mobile users 
include the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Network Connection Wizard.</b> Consolidates all of the processes for creating network connections. Users can now set up the following networking features from one wizard: dial-up connections to a private network or to the Internet, virtual private network (VPN) connections through the Internet to a private network, incoming calls, and direct connections to another computer. For more information on the Network Connection wizard, see <A HREF="ch21a.htm">Chapter 21</A>, &quot;Configuring Remote Access.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li><b>Virtual private network support.</b> Provides secure access to corporate networks from off-site locations by using a local Internet service provider (ISP) rather than using a long distance, dial-up connection. For more information on the VPN support, see <A HREF="ch21a.htm">Chapter 21</A>, &quot;Configuring Remote Access.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li><b>Offline Folders.</b> Allows you to copy documents that are stored on the network to your local computer, making it easier to access data when you aren't connected to the network. For more information on the Offline Folders, see <A HREF="ch24a.htm">Chapter 24</A>, &quot;Configuring Windows 2000 for Mobile Computers.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li><b>Synchronization Manager.</b> Compares items on the network to items that you opened or updated while working offline. Synchronization occurs when you log on, and any changes made offline to files and folders, Web pages, and e-mail messages are saved to the network. For more information on Synchronization Manager, see <A HREF="ch24a.htm">Chapter 24</A>, &quot;Configuring Windows 2000 for Mobile Computers.&quot;</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="26"><H3>Printing Support</H3></A>

<p>Printing in Windows 2000 Professional has been improved to assist you in providing a more flexible network of printers. Windows 2000 Professional includes the following printing features and enhancements:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Internet Printing Protocol (IPP).</b> Allows users to send documents to any printer on a Microsoft Windows 2000 network that is connected to the Internet. Internet printing enables users to do the following:</li></p>

<ul>
<p><li>Print to a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) over an intranet or the Internet.</li></p>

<p><li>View printer and job-related information in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) format from any browser.</li></p>

<p><li>Download and install printer drivers over the Internet.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><li><b>Add Printer wizard.</b> Simplifies the process of connecting to local and network printers from within a program. You no longer need to open the Printers system folder or specify driver models, printer languages, or ports when you add printers. For more information on the Add Printer wizard, see <A HREF="ch12a.htm">Chapter 12</A>, &quot;Setting Up and Configuring Network Printers.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li><b>Image Color Management (ICM) 2.</b> Allows you to send high-quality color documents to a printer or another computer with greater speed and reliability than ever before. ICM 2 is an operating system API that helps ensure that the colors you see on your monitor match those on your scanner and printer.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="27"><H2>Simplified Management</H2></A>

<p>The configuration management capabilities in Windows 2000 create a more consistent environment for the end user and help ensure that users have any data, 
applications, and operating system settings that they need.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 includes the following configuration management enhancements:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Add/Remove Programs wizard.</b> Simplifies the process of installing and removing programs. Users can install applications by pointing directly to a location on the corporate network or Internet. The user interface provides additional feedback and sort options to view installed or available applications by size, frequency of use, and time of last use.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Windows Installer service.</b> Manages application installation, modification, repairs, and removal. It provides a standard format for managing the components of a software package, and an API for managing applications and tools.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="28"><H3>Troubleshooting Tools</H3></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Professional includes diagnostic and troubleshooting tools that make it easier to support the operating system. Troubleshooting tools in Windows 2000 Professional include the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Compatibility tool.</b> Detects and warns the user about whether certain installed applications or components will cause an upgrade to fail, or whether the components won't work after an upgrade is complete. The compatibility tool can be run by using the /checkupgradeonly switch with the command to start Setup. This generates the Report System Compatibility screen that lists any items found that are incompatible with Windows 2000. For more information on the compatibility tool, see <A HREF="ch02a.htm">Chapter 2</A>, &quot;Installing Windows 2000 Professional.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li><b>Troubleshooters.</b> Included in Windows 2000 online Help as troubleshooting wizards that can be used to solve many common computer problems.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="29"><H2>Increased Hardware Support</H2></A>

<p>Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional now supports more than 7,000 hardware devices, such as infrared devices, scanners, digital cameras, and advanced 
multimedia devices that Windows NT Workstation 4 did not support. Enhancements to hardware support in Windows 2000 Professional include the following:</p>

<ul>

<p><li>Loading of appropriate drivers</li></p>

<p><li>Registration for device notification events</li></p>

<p><li>Changeable and removable devices</li></p>
</ul>

<p><li><b>Power options.</b> Prevent unnecessary power drains on your system by directing power to devices as they need it. The options available to you depend on your hardware. These options include the following:</li></p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Standby.</b> Turns off your monitor and hard disks, and your computer uses less power.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Hibernation.</b> Turns off your monitor and hard disk, saves everything in memory on disk, and turns off your computer. When you restart your computer, your desktop is restored exactly as you left it.</li></p>
</ul>
</ul>

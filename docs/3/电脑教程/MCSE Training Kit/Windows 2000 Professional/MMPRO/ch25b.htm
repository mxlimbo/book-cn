<A NAME="847"><H1>Lesson 1: Using Device Manager and System Information</H1></A>

<p>This lesson introduces Device Manager and explains how you use it to manage and troubleshoot devices. This lesson also introduces the System Information snap-in, how to use it, and how it helps you manage your system.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li>Use Device Manager to configure and troubleshoot devices.</li></p>

<p><li>Use System Information to manage devices.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 30 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="848"><H2>Introducing Device Manager</H2></A>

<p>Device Manager is one of the snap-ins located under System Tools in Computer Management. Device Manager provides you with a graphical view of the hardware installed on your computer (see Figure 25.1) and helps you manage and troubleshoot it. You use Device Manager to disable, uninstall, and update device drivers.</p>

</p><p>
<!-- caption --><b>Figure 25.1</b> <i>The Device Manager snap-in</i><!-- /caption -->
</p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><HR>Device Manager works with Plug and Play devices and legacy devices 
supported in Windows NT 4.</blockquote></div></p>

<p>Device Manager helps you to determine whether the hardware on your computer is working properly. It lists devices with problems, and each device that is flagged is displayed with the corresponding status information. Windows 2000 also provides the Hardware troubleshooter in online Help to troubleshoot hardware problems.</p>

<A NAME="849"><H2>Installing Devices</H2></A>

<p>Windows 2000 Professional supports Plug and Play hardware. For most devices that are Plug and Play compliant, as long as the appropriate driver is available and the BIOS on the computer is a Plug and Play BIOS or an ACPI BIOS, Windows 2000 automatically detects, installs, and configures the device.</p>

<p>For the occasional Plug and Play device that is not automatically detected, 
installed, and configured by Windows 2000, and for non-Plug and Play hardware that Windows 2000 doesn't identify, install, and configure, you initiate the installation of the hardware with the Add/Remove Hardware wizard. For a discussion on automatic hardware installation for Plug and Play devices and on using the Add/Remove Hardware wizard for manual hardware installation, see <A HREF="ch04a.htm">Chapter 4</A>, &quot;Using Windows Control Panel.&quot;</p>

<A NAME="850"><H2>Configuring and Troubleshooting Devices</H2></A>

<p>When you manually change device configurations, Device Manager can help you to avoid problems. Device Manager allows you to identify free resources and assign a device to that resource, disable devices to free resources, and reallocate resources used by devices to free a required resource. You must be logged on as a member of the Administrators group to change resource settings. Even if you are logged on as Administrator, if your computer is connected to a network, policy settings on the network might prevent you from changing resources.</p>

<p><div class="caution"><blockquote><b>CAUTION</b><hr>Improperly changing resource settings on devices can disable your hardware and cause your computer to no longer work.</blockquote></div></p>

<p>Windows 2000 automatically identifies Plug and Play devices and arbitrates their resource requests. However, the resource allocation among Plug and Play devices isn't permanent. If another Plug and Play device requests a resource that has already been allocated, Windows 2000 again arbitrates the requests to satisfy all resource requests.</p>

<p>You should not manually change resource settings for a Plug and Play device because Windows 2000 won't be able to arbitrate the assigned resources if requested by another Plug and Play device. In Device Manager, Plug and Play devices have a Resources tab on their Properties dialog box. To free the resource settings you manually assigned and allow Windows 2000 to again arbitrate the resources, select the Use Automatic Settings check box on the Resources tab.</p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><HR>Devices that Windows NT 4 support have fixed resource settings. These resource settings are usually defined during an upgrade from Windows NT 4 to Windows 2000 Professional, but you can also define them by using the Add New Hardware wizard in Control Panel.</blockquote></div></p>

<p>You can use Device Manager to configure or troubleshoot a device as follows:</p>

<ol>
<p><li> Right-click My Computer, and then click Manage.</li></p>

<p>The Computer Management window opens.</p>

<p><li> Under System Tools, click Device Manager.</li></p>

<p><li> In the Details pane, double-click the device type, and then double-click the device you want to configure.</li></p>

<p>The <i>Device</i> Properties dialog box appears (where <i>Device</i> is a specific device).</p>

<p>The tabs available on the Properties page for the device will vary depending on the device selected but might include some of those listed in Table 25.1.</p>

<p><li> To configure a device, choose the appropriate tab. To troubleshoot, on the General tab, click Troubleshooter.</li></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="851"><H2>Using the System Information Snap-In</H2></A>

<p>System Information is a snap-in that you can add to a custom console (by using the MMC) so that you can manage devices by collecting and viewing configuration information about your system. To use System Information, use the MMC to create a custom console and add the System Information snap-in to it (see Figure 25.2). When you add the snap-in to a custom console, you can focus it on the local machine or on a remote machine. The System Information snap-in also helps you to troubleshoot problems. For more information on creating custom consoles, see <A HREF="ch03a.htm">Chapter 3</A>, &quot;Using Microsoft Management Console and Task Scheduler.&quot;</p>

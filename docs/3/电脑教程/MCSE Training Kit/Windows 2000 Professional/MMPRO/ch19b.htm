<A NAME="648"><H1>Lesson 1: Understanding How to Back Up and Restore Data</H1></A>

<p>The efficient recovery of lost data is the goal of all backup jobs. A <i>backup job</i> is a single process of backing up data. Regularly backing up the data on server hard disks and client computer hard disks prevents data loss due to disk drive failures, power outages, virus infections, and other such incidents. If data loss occurs, and you have carefully planned and performed regular backup jobs, you can restore the lost data, whether the lost data is a single file or an entire hard disk.</p>

<A NAME="649"><H2>Introducing Windows Backup</H2></A>

<p>Windows 2000 provides the Windows 2000 Backup And Recovery Tools, 
shown in Figure 19.1, which includes the Backup Wizard, a tool that allows you to easily back up and restore data. To launch Backup, on the Start menu, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools, and then click Backup; 
or, on the Start menu, click Run, type <b>ntbackup</b> and then click OK. You can use Backup to back up data manually or to schedule unattended backup jobs regularly. You can back up data to a file or to a tape. Files can be stored on hard disks, removable disks (such as Iomega Zip and Jaz drives), and recordable compact discs and optical drives.</p>

<p>To successfully back up and restore data on a computer running Windows 2000 Professional, you must have the appropriate permissions and user rights, as 
described in the following list:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>All users can back up their own files and folders. They can also back up files for which they have the Read, Read &amp; Execute, Modify, or Full Control permission.</li></p>

<p><li>All users can restore files and folders for which they have the Write, Modify, or Full Control permission.</li></p>

<p><li>Members of the Administrators and Backup Operators groups can back up and restore all files (regardless of the assigned permissions). By default, members of these groups have the Backup Files and Directories, and the Restore Files and Directories user rights.</li></p>

</p>

</ul>

<A NAME="650"><H2>Planning Issues for Windows Backup</H2></A>

<p>You should plan your backup jobs to fit your company's needs. The primary goal for backing up data is to be able to restore that data if necessary, so any backup plan that you develop should incorporate how you restore data. You should be able to quickly and successfully restore critical lost data. No single correct backup plan exists for all networks.</p>

<p>Consider the following issues in formulating your backup plan.</p>

<A NAME="651"><H3>Determine Which Files and Folders to Back Up</H3></A>

<p>Always back up critical files and folders that your company needs to operate, such as sales and financial records, the registry for each server, and, if you are in a domain, the directory service files based on Active Directory technology.</p>

<A NAME="652"><H3>Determine How Often to Back Up</H3></A>

<p>If data is critical for company operations, back it up daily. If users create or modify reports once a week, backing up the reports weekly is sufficient. You need to back up data only as often as it changes. For example, you don't need to do daily backups on files that rarely change, such as monthly reports.</p>

<A NAME="653"><H3>Determine Which Target Media to Use for Storing Backup Data</H3></A>

<p>With Backup Wizard, you can back up to the following removable media:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Files.</b> You can store the files on a removable media device, such as an Iomega Zip drive, or on a network location, such as a file server. The file that is created contains the files and folders that you have selected to back up. The file has a .BKF extension. Users can back up their personal data to a network server. Use this only for temporary backup jobs.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Tape.</b> A less expensive medium than other removable media, a tape is more convenient for large backup jobs because of its high storage capacity. However, tapes have a limited life and can deteriorate. Be sure that you check the manufacturer's recommendations for usage.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>For information about tape rotation and archiving tapes, see Appendix D, &quot;Managing Backup Tapes.&quot;</p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><HR>If you use a removable media device to back up and restore data, be sure to verify that the device is supported on the Windows 2000 HCL.</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="654"><H3>Determine Whether to Perform Network or Local Backup Jobs</H3></A>

<p>A network backup can contain data from multiple network computers. This 
allows you to consolidate backup data from multiple computers to a single 
removable backup medium. A network backup also allows one administrator 
to back up the entire network. Whether you perform a network or local backup job depends on the data that must be backed up. For example, you can back up the registry and Active Directory directory services only at the computer where you are performing the backup.</p>

<p>If you decide to perform local backups, you must perform a local backup at each computer, including servers and client computers. You must consider several 
issues for performing local backups. First of all, you must move from computer to computer so that you can perform a backup at each computer, or you must rely on users to back up their own computers. Typically, most users fail to back up their data regularly. A second consideration with local backups is the number of removable storage media devices. If you use removable storage media devices, such as tape drives, you must have one for each computer, or you must move the tape drive from computer to computer so that you can perform a local backup on each computer.</p>

<p>You can also choose to use a combination of network and local backup jobs. 
Do this when critical data resides on client computers and servers and you don't have a removable storage media device for each computer. In this situation, users perform a local backup and store their backup files on a server. You then back up the server.</p>

<A NAME="655"><H2>Examining Backup Types</H2></A>

<p>Backup Wizard provides five types of backup that define which data is backed up, such as only files that have changed since the last backup. (See Figure 19.2.)</p>

<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F19tk02x.htm')"> <img src="images/F19tk02.JPG" width=404 height=309 border=0 ALT="Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!-- caption --><b>Figure 19.2</b> <i>Selecting the type of backup</i><!-- /caption -->
</p>

<p>Some backup types use backup <i>markers,</i> also known as archive attributes, which mark a file as having changed. When a file changes, an attribute is set on the file that indicates that the file has changed since the last backup. When you back up the file, this clears or resets the attribute.</p>

<A NAME="656"><H3>Normal</H3></A>

<p>During a <i>normal</i> backup, all selected files and folders are backed up. A normal backup doesn't rely on markers to determine which files to back up. During a normal backup, any existing marks are cleared and each file is marked as having been backed up. Normal backups speed up the restore process because the backup files are the most current and you don't need to restore multiple backup jobs.</p>

<A NAME="657"><H3>Copy</H3></A>

<p>During a <i>copy</i> backup, all selected files and folders are backed up. It neither looks for nor clears markers. If you don't want to clear markers and affect other backup types, use copy. For example, use a copy backup between a normal and an incremental backup to create an archival snapshot of network data.</p>

<A NAME="658"><H3>Incremental</H3></A>

<p>During an <i>incremental</i> backup, only selected files and folders that have a marker are backed up, and then the backup clears markers. Because an incremental backup clears markers, if you did two incremental backups in a row on a file 
and nothing changed in the file, the file would not be backed up the second time.</p>

<A NAME="659"><H3>Differential</H3></A>

<p>During a <i>differential</i> backup, only selected files and folders that have a marker are backed up, but the backup doesn't clear markers. Because a differential backup doesn't clear markers, if you did two differential backups in a row on a file and nothing changed in the file, the entire file would be backed up each time.</p>

<A NAME="660"><H3>Daily</H3></A>

<p>During a <i>daily</i> backup, all selected files and folders that have changed during 
the day are backed up. Backup Wizard neither looks for nor clears markers. 
If you want to back up all files and folders that change during the day, use a 
daily backup.</p>

<A NAME="661"><H3>Combining Backup Types</H3></A>

<p>An effective backup strategy is likely to combine different backup types. Some backup types require more time to back up data but less time to restore data. Conversely, other backup types require less time to back up data but more time to restore data. If you combine backup types, markers are critical. Incremental and differential backup types check for and rely on the markers.</p>

<p>The following are some examples of combining different backup types:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Normal and differential backups.</b> On Monday a normal backup is performed, and on Tuesday through Friday, differential backups are performed. Differential backups don't clear markers, which means that each backup includes all changes since Monday. If data becomes corrupt on Friday, you need to restore only the normal backup from Monday and the differential backup from Thursday. This strategy takes more time to back up but less time to restore.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Normal and incremental backups.</b> On Monday a normal backup is performed, and on Tuesday through Friday, incremental backups are performed. Incremental backups clear markers, which means that each backup includes only the files that changed since the previous backup. If data becomes corrupt on Friday, you need to restore the normal backup from Monday and all incremental backups, from Tuesday through Friday. This strategy takes less time to back up but more time to restore.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Normal, differential, and copy backups.</b> This strategy is the same as the first example that used normal and incremental backups, except that on Wednesday, you perform a copy backup. Copy backups include all selected files and do not clear markers or interrupt the usual backup schedule. Therefore, each differential backup includes all changes since Monday. The copy backup type done on Wednesday is not part of the Friday restore. Copy backups are helpful when you need to create a snapshot of your data.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="662"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>The efficient recovery of lost data is the goal of all backup jobs. If data loss does occur, and you have carefully planned and performed regular backup jobs, you can restore the lost data. In this lesson, you learned that Windows 2000 Professional provides the Backup Wizard that allows you to easily back up and restore data. You can use it to back up data manually or to schedule unattended backup jobs regularly. Backup Wizard provides five types of backup: normal, copy, differential, incremental, and daily. You can use one of these backup types or a combination of backup types to back up your data.</p>

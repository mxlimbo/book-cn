<p><a name="1051"></a><b>access control entry (ACE)</b> The entries on the 
access control list (ACL) that control user 
account or group access to a resource. The entry must allow the type of access that is requested (for example, Read access) for the user to gain access. If no ACE exists in the ACL, the user can't gain access to the resource or folder on an NTFS partition.</p>

<p><a name="1052"></a><b>access control list (ACL)</b> The ACL contains a list of all user accounts and groups that have been granted access for the file or folder on an NTFS partition or volume, as well as the type of access that they have been granted. When a user attempts to gain access to a resource, the ACL must contain an entry, called an access control entry (ACE),

<p><a name="1069"></a><b>asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL)</b> A 
recent modem technology that converts existing twisted-pair telephone lines into access paths for multimedia and high-speed data communications. These new connections can transmit more than 
8 Mbps to the subscriber and up to 1 Mbps from the subscriber. ADSL is recognized as a physical layer transmission protocol for unshielded twisted-pair media.</p>

<p><a name="1070"></a><b>asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)</b> An advanced implementation of packet switching that provides high-speed data transmission rates to send fixed-size cells over broadband LANs or WANs. Cells are 53 bytes&#8212;48 bytes of data with five additional bytes of address. ATM accommodates voice, data, fax, real-time video, CD-quality audio, imaging, and multimegabit data transmission. ATM uses switches as multiplexers to permit several computers to put data on a network simultaneously. Most commercial ATM boards transmit data at about 155 Mbps, but theoretically, a rate of 1.2 gigabits per second is possible.</p>

<p><a name="1071"></a><b>asynchronous transmission</b> A form of data transmission in which information is sent one character at a time, with variable time intervals between characters. Asynchronous transmission doesn't rely on a shared timer that allows the sending and receiving units to separate characters by specific time periods. Therefore, each transmitted character consists of a number of data bits (that compose the character itself), preceded by a start bit and ending in an optional parity bit followed by a 1-, 1.5-, or 2-stop bit.</p>

<p><a name="1072"></a><b>ATM</b> <i>See</i><a href="glossa.htm#1070"> asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)</a>.</p>

<p><a name="1073"></a><b>auditing</b> A process that tracks network activities by user accounts and a routine element of network security. Auditing can produce records or list users who have accessed&#8212;or attempted to 
access&#8212;specific resources; help administrators identify unauthorized activity; and track activities such as logon attempts, connection and disconnection from designated resources, changes made to files and directories, server events and modifications, password changes, and logon parameter changes.</p>

<p><a name="1074"></a><b>audit policy</b> A policy that defines the types of security events that Windows 2000 records in the security log on each computer.</p>

<p><a name="1075"></a><b>authentication</b> A verification based on user name, passwords, and time and account restrictions.</p>

<p><a name="1077"></a><b>backup</b> A duplicate copy of a program, a disk, or data, made to secure valuable files from loss.</p>

<p><a name="1078"></a><b>backup job</b> A single process of backing up data.</p>

<p><a name="1079"></a><b>Bandwidth Allocation Protocol (BAP)</b> A PPP 
control protocol that helps provide bandwidth on demand. BAP dynamically controls the use of multilinked lines and is an efficient mechanism for controlling connection costs while dynamically providing optimum bandwidth.</p>

<p><a name="1080"></a><b>BAP</b> <i>See</i><a href="glossa.htm#1079"> Bandwidth Allocation Protocol (BAP)</a>.</p>

<p><a name="1081"></a><b>base I/O port</b> A port that specifies a channel through which information is transferred between a computer's hardware, such as the network interface card (NIC), and its CPU.</p>

<p><a name="1082"></a><b>base memory address</b> A setting that defines the address of the location in a computer's memory (RAM) that is used by the NIC. This setting is sometimes called the RAM start address.</p>

<p><a name="1083"></a><b>baud</b> A measure of data-transmission speed named after the French engineer and telegrapher Jean-Maurice-Emile Baudot. It is a measure of the speed of oscillation of the sound wave on which a bit of data is carried over telephone lines. Because baud was originally used to measure the transmission speed of telegraph equipment, the term sometimes refers to the data-transmission speed of a modem. However, current modems can send at a speed higher than 1-bit per oscillation, so baud is being replaced by the more accurate bps (bits per second) as a measure of modem speed.</p>

<p><a name="1084"></a><b>baud rate</b> The speed at which a modem can transmit data. Often confused with bps (the number of bits per second transmitted), baud rate 
actually measures the number of events, or signal changes, that occur in one second. Because one event can actually encode more than one bit in high-speed digital communication, baud rate and bps are not always synonymous, and the latter is the more accurate term to apply to modems. For example, the 9600-baud modem that encodes 
4-bits per event actually operates at 2400 baud but transmits at 9600 bps (2400 events times 
4-bits per event), and thus should be called a 9600-bps modem.</p>

<p><a name="1085"></a><b>binary synchronous communications protocol (bisync)</b> A communications protocol developed by IBM. Bisync transmissions are encoded in 
either ASCII or EBCDIC. Messages can be of any length and are sent in units called frames that are optionally preceded by a message header. 
Because bisync uses synchronous transmission, in which message elements are separated by a specific time interval, each frame is preceded and followed by special characters that enable the sending and receiving machines to synchronize their clocks.</p>

<p><a name="1086"></a><b>bind</b> A term used to describe the association of two pieces of information with one another.</p>

<p><a name="1087"></a><b>binding</b> A process that establishes the communication channel between network components on different levels to enable communication between those components. For example, the binding of a protocol driver (such as TCP/IP) and a network adapter.</p>

<p><a name="1088"></a><b>bit</b> A short word for binary digit: either 1 or 0 
in the binary number system. In processing and storage, a bit is the smallest unit of information handled by a computer. It is represented physically by an element such as a single pulse sent through a circuit or a small spot on a magnetic disk capable of storing either a 1 or 0. Eight bits make a byte.</p>

<p><a name="1089"></a><b>bits per second (bps)</b> A measure of the speed at which a device can transfer data. <i>See also</i><a href="glossa.htm#1084"> baud rate</a>.</p>

<p><a name="1090"></a><b>bit time</b> The time it takes for each station to 
receive and store a bit.</p>

<p><a name="1091"></a><b>boot-sector virus</b> A type of virus that resides in the first sector of a floppy disk or hard disk. When the computer is booted, the virus executes. In this common method of transmitting viruses from one floppy disk to another, the virus replicates itself onto the new disk each time a new disk is inserted and accessed.</p>

<p><a name="1092"></a><b>bottleneck</b> A device or program that significantly degrades network performance. Poor network performance results when a device uses noticeably more CPU time than it should, consumes 
too much of a resource, or lacks the capacity to handle the load. Potential bottlenecks can be found in the CPU, memory, NIC, and other components.</p>

<p><a name="1093"></a><b>Bps</b> <i>See</i><a href="glossa.htm#1089"> bits per second (bps)</a>.</p>

<p><a name="1094"></a><b>broadcast</b> A transmission sent simultaneously to more than one recipient. In communication and on networks, a broadcast message is one distributed to all stations or computers on the network.</p>

<p><a name="1095"></a><b>broadcast storm</b> An event that occurs when so many broadcast messages are on the network that they approach or surpass the capacity of the network bandwidth. This can happen when one computer on the network transmits a flood of frames saturating the network with traffic so it can no longer carry messages from any other computer. Such a broadcast storm can shut down a network.</p>

<p><a name="1096"></a><b>buffer</b> A reserved portion of RAM in which data is held temporarily, pending an opportunity to complete its transfer to or from a storage device or another location in memory.</p>

<p><a name="1097"></a><b>built-in groups</b> One type of group account used by Microsoft Windows 2000. Built-in groups, as the name implies, are included with the network operating system. Built-in groups have been granted useful collections of rights and built-in abilities. In most cases, a built-in group provides all the capabilities needed by a particular user. For example, if a user account belongs to the built-in Administrators group, logging on with that account gives the user administrative capabilities. <i>See also</i><a href="glossa.htm#1433"> user account</a>.</p>

<p><a name="1098"></a><b>Bus</b> Parallel wires or cabling that connect components in a computer.</p>

<p><a name="1099"></a><b>Byte</b> A unit of information consisting of 8 bits. In computer processing or storage, a byte is equivalent to a single character, such as a letter, numeral, or punctuation mark. Because a byte represents only a small amount of information, amounts of computer memory are usually given in kilobytes (1,024 bytes, or 2 raised to the 10th power), megabytes (1,048,576 bytes, or 2 raised to the 20th power), gigabytes (1,024 megabytes), terabytes (1,024 gigabytes), petabytes (1,024 terabytes), or exabytes (1,024 petabytes).</p>

<A NAME="1015"><H2>C</H2></A>
<p><a name="1100"></a><b>cache</b> A special memory subsystem or part of RAM in which frequently used data values are duplicated for quick access. A memory cache stores the contents of frequently accessed RAM locations and the addresses where these data items are stored. When the processor references an address in memory, the cache checks to <i>See</i> whether it holds that address. If it does hold the address, the data is returned to the processor; if it doesn't, regular memory access occurs. A cache is useful when RAM accesses are slow as compared to the microprocessor speed.</p>

<p><a name="1101"></a><b>callback</b> A Windows 2000 feature that you can set to cause the remote server to disconnect and call back the client attempting to access the

<p><a name="1257"></a><b>modem</b> A communication device that enables a computer to transmit information over a standard telephone line. Because a computer is digital, it works with discrete electrical signals representing binary 1 and binary 0. A telephone is analog and carries a signal that can have many variations. Modems are needed to convert digital signals to analog and back. When transmitting, modems impose (modulate) a computer's digital signals onto a continuous carrier frequency on the telephone line. When receiving, modems sift out 
(demodulate) the information from the carrier and transfer it in digital form to the computer.</p>

<p><a name="1258"></a><b>multitasking</b> A mode of operation offered by an 
operating system in which a computer works 
on more than one task at a time. The two primary types of multitasking are preemptive and nonpreemptive. In preemptive multitasking, the operating system can take control of the processor without the task's cooperation. In nonpreemptive multitasking, the processor is never taken from a task. The task itself decides when to give up the processor. A true multitasking operating system can run as many tasks as it has processors. When there are more tasks than processors, the computer must &quot;time slice&quot; so that the available processors devote a certain amount of time to one task and then move on to the next task, alternating between tasks until all the tasks are completed.</p>

<p><a name="1399"></a><b>synchronous</b> A form of communication that relies on a timing scheme coordinated between two devices to separate groups of bits and transmit them in blocks called frames. Special characters are used to begin the synchronization and check its accuracy periodically. Because the bits are sent and received in a timed, controlled (synchronized) fashion, start and stop bits are not required. Transmission stops at the end of one transmission and starts again with a new one. It is a start/stop approach, and more efficient than asynchronous transmission. If an error occurs, the synchronous error detection and correction scheme implements a retransmission. However, because more sophisticated technology and equipment is required to transmit synchronously, it is more expensive than asynchronous transmission.</p>

The UPS ensures that the electrical flow to the computer is not interrupted because of a blackout and, in most cases, protects the computer against potentially damaging events such as power surges and brownouts. Different UPS models offer different levels of protection. All UPS units are equipped with a battery and loss-of-power sensor. If the sensor detects a loss of power, it immediately switches over to the battery so that users have time to save their work and shut off the computer. Most higher-end models have features such as power filtering, sophisticated surge protection, and a serial port so that an operating system capable of communicating with a UPS (such as Windows 2000) can work with the UPS to facilitate automatic system shutdown.</p>

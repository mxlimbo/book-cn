<A NAME="50"><H1>Lesson 1: Getting Started</H1></A>

<p>When you install Windows 2000 Professional, the Windows 2000 Setup program asks you to provide information about how you want to install and configure the operating system. Good preparation helps you avoid problems during and after the installation.</p>

<p><div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to</b>

<ul>
<p><li>Complete preinstallation tasks, such as identifying the hardware requirements and the required installation information you need to install Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Estimated lesson time: 30 minutes</b></p>
</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="51"><H2>Preinstallation Tasks</H2></A>

<p>Before you start the installation, complete the following preinstallation tasks:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Identify the hardware requirements to install Windows 2000 Professional, and make sure that your hardware meets these requirements.</li></p>

<p><li>Determine whether your hardware is on the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL).</li></p>

<A NAME="53"><H2>Hardware Compatibility List</H2></A>

<p>Before you install Windows 2000, verify that your hardware is on the Windows 2000 Hardware Compatibility List. Microsoft provides tested drivers for only those devices that are included on this list. Using hardware that isn't listed on the HCL might cause problems during and after installation. For a copy of the HCL, see the Hcl.txt file in the Support folder on the Windows 2000 Professional CD-ROM.</p>

<p>You will also find the most recent versions of the HCL for released operating systems on the Internet at the Microsoft Web site <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com" TARGET="_window2">(http://www.microsoft.com)</A>.</p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><HR>
Microsoft supports only those devices that are listed on the HCL. If you have hardware that isn't on this list, contact the hardware manufacturer to determine whether a manufacturer-supported Windows 2000 driver exists for the component.
</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="54"><H2>Disk Partitions</H2></A>

<p>The Windows 2000 Setup program examines the hard disk to determine its existing configuration. Setup then allows you to install Windows 2000 on an existing partition or to create a new partition on which to install Windows 2000.</p>

<A NAME="55"><H3>Creating a New Partition or Using an Existing Partition</H3></A>

<p>The Setup program gives you flexibility in how you configure the hard disk prior to installing the Windows 2000 operating system. Depending on the state of the hard disk, you can choose one of the following options during the installation:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>If the hard disk is unpartitioned, you must create and size the Windows 2000 partition.</li></p>

<p><li>If the hard disk has partitions and has enough unpartitioned disk space, you can create the Windows 2000 partition by using the unpartitioned space.</li></p>

<p><li>If the hard disk has an existing partition that is large enough, you can install Windows 2000 on that partition. Installing on an existing partition will overwrite any existing data.</li></p>

<p><li>If the hard disk has an existing partition, you can delete it to create more unpartitioned disk space to use to create the Windows 2000 partition.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="56"><H3>Configuring the Remaining Free Hard Disk Space</H3></A>

<p>Although you can use Setup to create other partitions, you should create and size only the partition on which you will install Windows 2000. After you install Windows 2000, use the Disk Management administrative tool to partition any remaining unpartitioned space on the hard disk.</p>

<A NAME="57"><H3>Sizing the Installation Partition</H3></A>

<p>Microsoft recommends that you install Windows 2000 on a 1 GB or larger partition. Although Windows 2000 requires a minimum of about 650 MB of disk space for installation, using a larger partition for installation provides flexibility in the future. Then, if required, you can install updates to Windows 2000, operating system tools, or other files that are required by Windows 2000.</p>

<A NAME="58"><H2>File Systems</H2></A>

<p>After you create the installation partition, Setup prompts you to select the file system with which to format the partition. Windows 2000 supports three file systems: Windows 2000 file system (NTFS), file allocation table (FAT), and FAT32. Figure 2.2 summarizes some of the features of these file systems.</p>

<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F02tk02x.htm')"> <img src="images/F02tk02.JPG" width=404 height=280 border=0 ALT="Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!-- caption --><b>Figure 2.2</b> <i>Summary of file systems features</i><!-- /caption -->
</p>

<A NAME="59"><H3>NTFS</H3></A>

<p>Use NTFS when the partition on which Windows 2000 will reside requires any 
of the following features:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>File- and folder-level security.</b> NTFS allows you to control access to files and folders. For additional information, see <A HREF="ch14a.htm">Chapter 14</A>, &quot;Securing Resources with NTFS Permissions.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li><b>Disk compression.</b> NTFS compresses files to store more data on the partition. For additional information, see <A HREF="ch18a.htm">Chapter 18</A>, &quot;Managing Data Storage.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li><b>Disk quotas.</b> NTFS allows you to control disk use on a per-user basis. For additional information, see <A HREF="ch18a.htm">Chapter 18</A>, &quot;Managing Data Storage.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li><b>Encryption.</b> NTFS allows you to encrypt file data on the physical hard disk. For additional information, see <A HREF="ch18a.htm">Chapter 18</A>, &quot;Managing Data Storage.&quot;</li></p>
</ul>

<p>NTFS in Windows 2000 also supports remote storage, dynamic volumes, and the mounting of volumes to folders. Windows 2000 and Windows NT are the only operating systems that can access data on a local hard disk that is formatted with NTFS.</p>

<A NAME="60"><H3>FAT and FAT32</H3></A>

<p>FAT and FAT32 allow access by, and compatibility with, other operating systems. To dual boot Windows 2000 and another operating system, format the system partition with either FAT or FAT32.</p>

<p>Setup determines whether to format the hard disk with FAT or FAT32 based on the size of the installation partition.</p>

<p>
	<table valign="top" cellpadding="5" width="95%">
	
		<tr>
			<th>Partition size</th>
			<th>Format</th>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td valign="top">Smaller than 2 GB</td>
			<td valign="top">Setup formats the partition as FAT</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td valign="top">Larger than 2 GB</td>
			<td valign="top">Setup formats the partition as FAT32</td>
		</tr>
		
	</table>
</p>

<p>FAT and FAT32 don't offer many of the features that NTFS supports&#8212;for example, file-level security. Therefore, in most situations, you should format the hard disk with NTFS. The only reason to use FAT or FAT32 is for dual booting. If you're setting up a computer for dual booting, you would have to format only the system partition as FAT or FAT32. For example, if drive C is the system partition, you could format drive C as FAT or FAT32 and format drive D as NTFS.</p>

<A NAME="61"><H2>Licensing</H2></A>

<p>In addition to the license that is required to install and run Windows 2000 Server and the license that is required to install and run an operating system on each client computer, each client connection to the server must also be licensed.</p>

<A NAME="62"><H3>Client Access License</H3></A>

<p>A Client Access License (CAL) gives client computers the right to connect to computers running Windows 2000 Server so that the client computers can connect to network services, shared folders, and print resources. When Windows 2000 Server is installed, the network administrator must choose a CAL mode: Per Seat or Per Server.</p>

<p>The following services do not require Client Access Licenses:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Anonymous or authenticated access to Windows 2000 Server with Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) version 4 or a Web-server application that provides Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) sharing of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) files.</li></p>

<p><li>Telnet and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) connections.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><HR>
If your company uses Microsoft BackOffice products, you must also have licenses for them. A Windows 2000 license doesn't cover BackOffice products.
</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="63"><H3>Per Seat Licensing</H3></A>

<p>The Per Seat licensing mode requires a separate CAL for each client computer that is used to access Windows 2000 Server for basic network services. After a client computer has a CAL, it can be used to access any computer running Windows 2000 Server on the enterprise network. Per Seat licensing is often more economical for large networks where client computers are used to connect to more than one server.</p>

<A NAME="64"><H3>Per Server Licensing</H3></A>

<p>With Per Server licensing, CALs are assigned to a particular server. Each CAL allows one connection per client computer to the server for basic network services. You must have at least as many CALs that are dedicated to the server as the maximum number of client computers that will be used to concurrently connect to that server at any time.</p>

<p>Per Server licensing is preferable for small companies that have only one computer running Windows 2000 Server. It is also useful for Internet or remote-access servers where client computers might not be licensed as Windows 2000 network client computers. In this situation, Per Server licensing allows you to specify a maximum number of concurrent server connections and reject any 
additional logon attempts.</p>

<A NAME="65"><H2>Domain or Workgroup Membership</H2></A>

<p>During installation, you must choose the type of network security group that you want the computer to join: a domain or a workgroup. (See Figure 2.3.)</p>

<A NAME="66"><H3>Joining a Domain</H3></A>

<p>During installation, you can add the computer on which you are installing Windows 2000 Professional to an existing domain. Adding a computer to a domain is referred to as <i>joining a domain.</i></p>

<p>Joining a domain during installation requires the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>A domain name.</b> Ask the domain administrator for the Domain Name System (DNS) name for the domain that you want to join. An example of a DNS-compatible domain name is microsoft.com, where <i>microsoft</i> is the name of your organization's DNS identity.</li></p>

<p>
<A HREF="javascript:fullSize('F02tk03x.htm')"> <img src="images/F02tk03.JPG" width=404 height=259 border=0 ALT="Click to view at full size."> </A>
</p><p>
<!-- caption --><b>Figure 2.3</b> <i>Domain or workgroup membership</i><!-- /caption -->
</p>

<p><li><b>A computer account.</b> Before a computer can join a domain, it must have a computer account in the domain. You can ask a domain administrator to create the computer account before installation, or, if you have administrative privileges for the domain, you can create the computer account during installation. If you create the computer account during installation, Setup prompts you for a name and password of a user account with authority to add domain computer accounts.</li></p>

<p><li><b>An available domain controller and a server running the DNS Service (called the <i>DNS server</i>).</b> At least one domain controller in the domain that you are joining and one DNS server must be online when you install a computer in the domain.</li></p>
</ul>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><HR>
You can join a domain during installation or after installation.
</blockquote></div></p>

<A NAME="67"><H3>Joining a Workgroup</H3></A>

<p>During installation, you can add the computer on which you are installing Windows 2000 Professional to an existing workgroup. Adding a computer to a workgroup is referred to as <i>joining a workgroup.</i></p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><HR>
When you install Windows 2000 Server and join a workgroup, the computer is added as a stand-alone server. A computer running Windows 2000 Server that isn't a member of a domain is called a <i>stand-alone server.</i>
</blockquote></div></p>

<p>When you join a workgroup during installation, you must assign a workgroup name to your computer. The workgroup name that you assign can be the name of an existing workgroup or the name of a new workgroup that you create during installation.</p>

<A NAME="68"><H2>Preinstallation Checklist</H2></A>

<p>The following is a preinstallation checklist that you can use to make sure you have all the necessary information available before you begin the installation process.</p>

<A NAME="69"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>This lesson identified the preinstallation tasks you must understand and complete before you install Windows 2000. The first task is to identify the hardware requirements for installing Windows 2000 Professional and to ensure that your hardware meets these requirements. You learned about the Windows 2000 hardware compatibility list and that your hardware should be on the HCL so that it's compatible with Windows 2000.</p>

<p>After you have determined that your hardware is on the HCL, you must decide how you want to partition the hard disk on which you are going to install Windows 2000. You must also determine whether you are going to format the partition as NTFS so that you can have better security and a richer feature set, or as FAT or FAT32 so that other operating systems can access the data on the installation partition.</p>

<p>In addition, you learned about Client Access Licenses (CALs) and that a CAL gives client computers&#8212;for example, a computer running Windows 2000 Professional&#8212;the right to connect to computers running Windows 2000 Server. You learned that you must select Per Seat or Per Server licensing on the server. With Per Seat licensing mode, a separate CAL is required for each client computer that accesses a Windows 2000 Server. When a client computer has a CAL, it can be used to access any computer running Windows 2000 Server on the enterprise network. With Per Server licensing, CALs are assigned to a particular server. Each CAL allows one connection per client computer to the server, and you must have at least as many CALs that are dedicated to the server as the maximum number of client computers that will be used to concurrently connect to that server at any time.</p>

<p>You also learned that during installation, your computer must join a domain or a workgroup. If your computer is the first one installed on the network, or if for some other reason no domain is available for your computer to join, you can have the computer join a workgroup and then have the computer join a domain after the installation. This lesson also provided a checklist of preinstallation tasks that you can complete to help ensure a successful installation of Windows 2000.</p>

          <td>ubject: Windows 95 Test 70-64 
            <p>Just wanted to give everyone a heads up on this one. I took multiple 
              practice tests from several different vendors including MCP, CICPrep 
              and the tests from the MCSE Training Guide for Windows 95 book published 
              by New Riders. I studied until I scored above 900 on all of them. 
            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, these tests were all geared towards the old test 
              70-63. I took the new Windows 95 test 70-64 on April 29th and only 
              scored a 743! </p>
            <p>This test pretty much blew me out of the water! Forget the braindumps 
              geared for test 70-63, they offer little if any help. I cannot say 
              that I would highly recommend any of the books out there right now 
              either. I don't think that the test would have been that hard but 
              it was almost like I studied for the wrong test. </p>
            <p>I guess the best advice I can give anyone is to have a good understanding 
              of Netware and NT and how Windows 95 operates and interconnects 
              with them. I would have to say at least one third of the test was 
              based on this. I had no questions on the registry, processor rings, 
              or booting practices. Only a few questions on plug and play and 
              memory architecture. A couple of questions on disk resources and 
              utilities. The vast majority of the rest of the test was centered 
              around 95 and connecting to and operating with NT and or Novell 
              networks. </p>
            <p>I'm not trying to scare anyone just give you the true facts. Microsoft 
              has changed a whole lot of things from the original 70-63 test. 
              They chopped off 21 questions and changed the format and functional 
              emphasis of the test as well. </p>
            <p>BE WARNED!! If you base your studying on the old 70-63 test you 
              stand a good chance of failing! </p>
            <p><br>
              Good Luck! </p>

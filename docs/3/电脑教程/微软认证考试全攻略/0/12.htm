          <td>Question 1. Under Windows NT, what command would you use if you 
            wanted to trace a packet from its source host to a destination host? 
            <p>A. TRACERT<br>
              B. ROUTE<br>
              C. NBTSTAT<br>
              D. IPCONFIG <br>
              The TRACERT utility is Microsoft's own, used to trace a packet from 
              its source ( your computer ) to a destination host ( a remote computer 
              ).</p>
            <p>Question 2. If you wanted to display all entries in the ARP cache, 
              which of the following utilities would you use? </p>
            <p>A . ARP - G<br>
              B. ARP - E<br>
              C. ARP - D<br>
              D. ARP - S<br>
              To display all entries in the ARP ( Address Resolution Protocol 
              ) cache, you would use the ARP utility with the -G or - A switch. 
              They are the same thing. To get the answer type &quot;arp /?&quot; 
              at the command prompt. <br>
              ARP ( Address Resolution Protocol ) is used to obtain hardware ( 
              MAC = Media Access Control ) addresses for communications with a 
              destination host.</p>
            <p>Question 3. You notice that the subnet mask is 0.0.0.0 on your 
              Windows NT computer while using the IPCONFIG utility at the command 
              prompt to check for IP address configuration. What does it mean 
              when the IPCONFIG utility displays a subnet mask of 0.0.0.0? </p>
            <p>A. The default gateway on your computer does not match the default 
              gateway of the network.<br>
              B. Your computer has the same subnet mask as another computer on 
              the network.<br>
              C. Your computer does not have the correct IP address class specified 
              for it.<br>
              D. Your computer has the same IP address as another computer on 
              the network. <br>
              The most likely cause in this scenario is that your computer has 
              the same IP address as another computer in the network. When this 
              happens, running IPCONFIG will yield an IP address of 0.0.0.0.</p>
            <p>Question 4. If you want to copy files from one Windows NT computer 
              to another, what TCP / IP utility would you use?</p>
            <p>A . RCP<br>
              B. REXEC<br>
              C. TELNET<br>
              D. TRACERT<br>
              The RCP ( Remote Copy ) is Microsoft's own TCP / IP utility. It 
              is used to copy files from a source Windows NT computer to a destination 
              ( remote ) Windows NT computer, or vice-versa. Type &quot;rcp /?&quot; 
              at the command prompt to get the command's full syntax.</p>
            <p>Question 5. Use the following diagram to answer this question : 
              <br>
              You are working on your Windows NT workstation, SMALLNT, and you 
              would like to communicate with another Windows NT computer, BIGNT. 
              If both computers are on the same local subnet , where does SMALLNT 
              look for the hardware address of the destination host? ( BIGNT in 
              this case )</p>
            <p>A. In its own ARP cache.<br>
              B. In the ARP cache of the destination host, BIGNT in this case.<br>
              C. If there is a DHCP server present , then in the ARP cache of 
              the DHCP server. <br>
              D. In the LMHOSTS or HOSTS file of the source computer.<br>
              The ARP protocol ( and NOT the ARP command ) is used to map IP addresses 
              to hardware addresses ( MAC addresses ). Anytime you communicate 
              with a destination host that is on the same subnet ( locally ), 
              then the hardware address of the destination host is obtained from 
              the source host's LOCAL ARP cache. In this scenario, BIGNT's hardware 
              address is obtained from SMALLNT's own ARP cache since both computers 
              are on the same network.</p>
            <p>Question 6. You have a print device connected to a server running 
              the LPD service. From your Windows NT computer, you would like to 
              obtain the status of the print device. What utility would you use 
              to achieve the task? </p>
            <p>A. LPD<br>
              B. NET USE<br>
              C. LPQ<br>
              D. GETDAEMON<br>
              The LPD ( Line Printer Daemon ) is a TCP / IP printing service. 
              A print server that has a TCP / IP print device connected to it 
              must have the LPD service installed on it. However, to obtain the 
              status of a TCP / IP print device ( or print queue as it is often 
              called in the TCP / IP circle ), you would use the LPQ command.<br>
              Type &quot;lpq /?&quot; at the command prompt to get the proper 
              syntax. Pay close attention to the &quot;-S&quot; and &quot;-P&quot; 
              switches. For the &quot;-S&quot; switch, you can specify the NAME 
              or IP address of the print server running the LPD service. <br>
              Question : Under Windows NT Server 4.0, how do you install the LPD 
              service?<br>
              Answer : Under Windows NT, the LPD service is known as &quot;Microsoft 
              TCP / IP Printing&quot; ===&gt; right-click Network Neighborhood 
              | Properties | Services tab | Add... | &quot;Microsoft TCP / IP 
              Printing&quot; service.</p>
            <p>Question 7. Let's say that you want to run a process on a remote 
              host that is using the REXEC service, what Microsoft TCP / IP utility 
              would you use? </p>
            <p>A. RCP<br>
              B. REXEC<br>
              C. TELNET<br>
              D. FTP<br>
              The REXEC ( Remote Execute ) command is Microsoft's home-grown utility 
              used to run processes on a remote computer that is also running 
              the REXEC service. Type &quot;rexec /?&quot; at the command prompt 
              to get the full syntax.</p>
            <p>Question 8. If you want to retrieve system information from a remote 
              host running the Finger service, what TCP / IP utility would you 
              use? </p>
            <p>A. REXEC<br>
              B. PING<br>
              C. RCP<br>
              D. FINGER<br>
              The FINGER utility is used to obtain system information from a remote 
              host that is using the Finger service. To get the proper syntax, 
              type &quot;finger&quot; at the command prompt.</p>
            <p>Question 9. Let's say that you want a DHCP client to give up its 
              lease with a DHCP server, what command would you use to accomplish 
              the task? </p>
            <p>A. ipconfig / endlease<br>
              B. ipconfig / release<br>
              C. route / release<br>
              D. route / endlease<br>
              The IPCONFIG / RELEASE command is used to send a DHCPRELEASE message 
              from a DHCP client to a DHCP server. The DHCPRELEASE message specifies 
              that a client wishes to give up its current lease with the DHCP 
              server. Type, &quot;ipconfig /?&quot; at the command prompt to display 
              all the switches of the utility.</p>
            <p>Question 10. You would like to see a list of NetBIOS computer names 
              that have been resolved into IP addresses on your Windows NT computer. 
              Which of the following utilities would you use? </p>
            <p>A. ARP<br>
              B. NetBIOS<br>
              C. NETSTAT<br>
              D. NBTSTAT<br>
              You can use the &quot;nbtstat&quot; utitliy to view all NetBIOS 
              computer names that have been resolved into IP addresses. To see 
              the NetBIOS local name table of your workstation, use &quot;nbtstat 
              -n.&quot;</p>

              Transcender Prep Exams for TCP/IP v4.0 <br>
              My exam was similar to the Suresh's exam: </p>
            <p>1) How a third DNS Server to function as a Backup server in an 
              environment where there are already two DNS Servers acting as Primary 
              and Secondary? CACHING-ONLY SERVER </p>
            <p>2) How can you configure the third DNS Sever which is to be configured

            <p>10) Why unnecessarily a machine is doing arp broadcast even when 
              the target machine is in the same subnet while other machines in 
              the same subnet are not? B-NODE or INVALID SUBNET MASK </p>
            <p>11) What utility for seeing the IP address-to- MAC- address resolution?

            <p>12)You have three subnets in which a single subnet is populated 
              with 10 Laptop workstations and the other two subnets with NT Workstations. 
              You want the 1st subnet to be supplied with IP addresses(of course 
              by DHCP) with a lease acqusition period of 10 days.The other two 
              subnets with 30 &amp; 40 days lease period respectively. How will 
              you configure? <br>
              BY IMPLEMENTING ONE DHCP SCOPE FOR EACH SUBNET AND SPECIFYING THE 
              LEASE PERIOD AS PART OF EACH SCOPE'S CONFIGURATION. </p>
            <p>13)Your NT Server in your office is connected via RAS connectivity 
              to the Internet ISP Server through the ISDN communcation. Now you 
              want the Windows 95 workstation users in your internel subnet to 
              get connected to the ISP. How will you do that? PPTP </p>
            <p>14)You want the Unix member workstations to print jobs at the NT 
              print server connected print device. How will you configure? INSTALL 
              TCP/IP PRITING SERVICE AND SHARE THE PRINTER. </p>
            <p>15)You want the Windows based machines to print at a UNIX-Network 
              printing device connected to a NT Print Server. </p>
            <p>How will you redirect the jobs to the net printer? LPR </p>
            <p>How will you configure the printer on the server, if the server 
              will manager the printer? INSTALL TCP/IP PRITING SERVICE, CONFIGURE 
              A LPR PORT FOR THE PRINTER AND SHARE THE PRINTER. At the client 
              only connect to the printer. </p>
            <p>16)You want to send the print jobs to a UNIX workstation from the 
              windows based machines.Which utility will you use? LPR </p>
            <p>17)You want to view the print jobs that are sent to UNIX printer 
              from a windows based Workstation.Which utility will you use? LPQ 
            </p>
            <p>18)You are configuring a IIS server on NT Server a which is going 
              to be used as a FTP Server and also a WWW Server. How will you configure 
              it for the Host record? CNAME ..... MAIL SERVER? MX </p>
            <p>19)You want to monitor the NT Workstation performance from a Unix

              Hosts. How will you configure the SNMP agent workstation? &quot;Community 
              Name&quot; and &quot;Only Accept SNMP packages from these Hosts&quot;. 
            </p>
            <p>21)When you ftp a host name using UNC you get a &quot;Bad IP address&quot; 
              message. What could be the possible reason? HOSTS FILE. </p>
            <p>22)You can ping the remote host using the IP address but not through 
              netuse \\....\... Why? WINS or LMHOSTS. </p>
            <p>23)You are not able to ping the IP address of a remote host on 
              another subnet using Netbios name but through IP address.You can 
              also ping the other hosts on that subnet using both ways.What went 
              wrong? CLIENT NOT USING WINS SERVER. </p>
            <hr>
            <p><br>
              24)You have a domain spanning across three subnets.You want the 
              clients in all the 3 subnets to be able to communicate and browse 
              each other. How will you do that? </p>
            <p>You install and configure an NT Server to be put in the middle 
              of three subnets. </p>
            <p>Required: </p>
            <p>It should be made to act as a router. <br>
              Optional: </p>
            <p>IP router and should be made to dynamically update its routing 
              table whenever routers are added and removed from the network. <br>
              That machine to be able to supply IP address to all the machines 
              belonging to the three subnets. <br>
              Also you want a NT Workstation to be sent a trap message across 
              the network. <br>
              &gt;Configure the Server to act as router. </p>
            <p>&gt;Enable IP Forwarding. </p>
            <p>&gt;Implement the DHCP Server on the NT Server. </p>
            <p>&gt;Configure RIP. </p>
            <hr>
            <p><br>
              26)You want a Workstation in Subnet A to browse and Communicate 
              with the other workstation in subnet B. But you can't even though 
              they have their own WINS Servers installed.What will you do? WINS 
              REPLICATION. </p>
            <p>27)You have Subnet A, Subnet B and Subnet C. The Workstations in 
              the subnet A&amp;B uses the WINS in the Subnet A. The Workstations 
              in Subnet C uses its own. How will you configure to have the users 
              of Subnet C and B to browse themselves freely? WINS REPLICATION. 
            </p>
            <p>28)You have two WINS servers and you want them to participate in 
              replication.The link is a 56kb Slow link.You also want the Replication 
              to take place once in a day.In the display appellete the WINS at 
              Subnet A is configured to replicate once it get 5000 entries with 
              its push partner WINS at subnet B. The WINS at Subnet B is configured 
              to replicate with its pull partner to replicate once in 24 hours. 
              Just grade it. </p>
            <p>29)You don't want to resolve host names into IP address using a 
              DNS which contains static entries in it.What will you install in 
              alliance with DNS to resolve IP address from a dynamically updated 
              DNS database? WINS and ENABLE THE DNS FOR WINS RESOLUTION. </p>
            <p>30) 157.21.36.121 UNIX Product </p>
            <p>157.51.25.110 Product developer </p>
            <p>Above is a Hosts file entry.When you say &quot;ftp product&quot; 
              you get attached to the ftp server. But when you say &quot;FTP 157.51.25.110&quot; 
              you can't reach it.Why? INVALID FTP SERVER'S IP.... You have to 
              know how the HOSTS file works..... </p>
            <p>31) How will you log on to a Domain controler which is in another 
              domain and for that what entries do you require at your Workstation's 
              lmhosts file? (PDC and BDC) #PRE #DOM </p>
            <p>32) Why a workstation is not making a broadcast even when it can't 
              resolve through other methods? P-NODE </p>
            <p><br>

            <p>I am from Tanzania, I was already an MCSE when I took this exam 
              ..I took for just ot have a feel of knowing the product and try 
              to play with louse MS psychology.... looks like MS will have to 
              change the pattern of exams soon... </p>
            <p><br>
              The following is the brain dump on the exam 70-64 Win95 taken on 
              8 Sept passed 836/100 .. quite less than expected .. </p>
            <p>Exam was easy if you knew Network and inter operating with NOvell 
              Netware and Policy . </p>
            <p><br>
              I was bombarded ( reminds of Bombing ever occured in Tanzania on 
              US Embassy... phew.. never heard of a bomb in my life before that 
              one... ) with questions on Netware and guess you need to learn how 
              to setup policy and you should have experience on the same or practice 
              alot by yourself. </p>
            <p><br>
              The question which took my off the mark were of POLICy... looks 
              like a person being caught by a POLICe got no where to run... There 
              were around 6 to 7 questions related to setting up policy on WIndows 
              Networks and Netware networks. Many questions based on Exibits of 
              large networks involving Win95, Netware, NT (don't panic.. look 
              at the question and forget the rest of the pic.) </p>
            <p><br>
              Here are some of the questions which I remember and they may have 
              appeared somewhere in the braindump... </p>
            <p>Psst... The questions are not exact but look alike.. otherwise 
              you will have no fun in appearing for exam if I write exact questions

            <p>Candy from the Candy Man </p>
            <p>I passed this exam last Friday the 13th of November, this is a 
              Adaptive test. I pass this test with a 739, required score of 570 
              to pass. I had 25 questions. I studied from the McGraw Hill TCP/IP 
              4.0 book and this site. Please know how to calculate subnetting 
              or memorize the chart. I had 2 questions on subnetting. I don't 
              remember the questions, but if you know how to calculate the subnet, 
              you should have no problems. Please know and understand the concepts 
              of the questions. I have 2 more tests to go, Good Luck. Please find 
              listed below some of the questions I had: </p>
            <p>TCP/IP 4.0 - Test 70-059 </p>
            <p>1. How a third DNS Server to function as a Backup server in an 
              environment where there are already two DNS Servers acting as Primary 
              and Secondary? </p>
            <p>--&gt;Caching-Only Server </p>
            <p>2. You want to configure a DNS server to use DNS root server on 
              the Internet to resolve DNS queries for names that are not in your 
              DNS domain. How should you do this? </p>
            <p>--&gt;By using the CACHE file that was installed by default on 
              the DNS server. </p>
            <p>3. Kevin want to set up a windows NT server computer as a static 
              multihomed router </p>
            <p>---&gt; two answer enable IP forwarding </p>
            <p>assign each IP address different subnet address. </p>
            <p>4. 187.123.34.19 product </p>
            <p>187.123.23.45 develop </p>
            <p>you can ping 187.123.34.19 , but you cannot connect \\product\netapps 
            </p>
            <p>--&gt; p-node resolution.(answer is last option) </p>
            <p>5. Using Windows NT Explorer, a Windows NT Workstation computer 
              cannot connect to a Windows NT Server computer installed on a different 
              subnet. All other computer can connect to this server. When you 
              run Network Monitor, you noticed that each time the workstation 
              attempts to connect to the sever, the workstation broadcast an ARP 
              request for the server's IP address. What is the most likely cause 
              of the problem? </p>
            <p>--&gt;The workstation is configured with an invalid subnet mask. 
            </p>
            <p>6. Kevin want to install a Windows NT server with four NIC card 
              on his TCP/IP network </p>
            <p>Required result: </p>
            <p>The server must rout TCP/IP packets </p>
            <p>Optional desired results: </p>
            <p>1) the server should dynamically update it routing tables when 
              other router are added to or removed from the network. </p>
            <p>2) the server should provide IP addresses to every client computer 
              on each subnet </p>
            <p>3) the server should send trap messages across the network to a 
              UNIX server </p>
            <p>Proposed solution: </p>
            <p>1) install win server </p>
            <p>2). install dhcp server create on scope for each subnet </p>
            <p>---&gt;The proposed solution does not produce the required result. 
            </p>
            <p>7. Where do I put DHCP Relay Agents? (choose 2) </p>
            <p>--&gt;1. on remote subnets </p>
            <p>--&gt;2. on router between subnets </p>
            <p>8. Two scenarios, where you want to enable a server to work as 
              a router. </p>
            <p>required result: routing must be possible </p>
            <p>optional results: dynamic routing enabled </p>
            <p>SNMP traps are to be sent to a SNMP - manager </p>
            <p>8a. Activate IP-forwarding </p>
            <p>1. install PPTP </p>
            <p>2. install DHCP </p>
            <p>3. ... (some services that are meaningless in this context) </p>
            <p>-&gt; produces just the required result </p>
            <p>8b. Activate IP-forwarding </p>
            <p>1. install RIP </p>
            <p>2. install DHCP </p>
            <p>3. ... (some other services but not SNMP) </p>
            <p>-&gt;produces the required result and one optional </p>
            <p>9. You have a domain spanning across three subnets. You want the 
              clients in all the 3 subnets to be able to communicate and browse 
              each other. How will you do that? </p>
            <p>You install and configure an NT Server to be put in the middle 
              of three subnets. </p>
            <p>Required: </p>
            <p>It should be made to act as a router. </p>
            <p>Optional: </p>
            <p>IP router and should be made to dynamically update its routing 
              table whenever routers are added and removed from the network. That 
              machine to be able to supply IP address to all the machines belonging 
              to the three subnets. Also you want a NT Workstation to be sent 
              a trap message across the network. </p>
            <p>Proposed Implementation I: </p>
            <p>Configure the Server to act as router. </p>
            <p>Implement PPTP so that............................ </p>
            <p>Implement the DHCP Server on the NT Server. </p>
            <p>Proposed Implementation II: </p>
            <p>Configure the Server to act as router. </p>
            <p>Enable IP routing. Configure RIP. </p>
            <p>Set the third party SNMP manager. </p>
            <p>Implement PPTP so that............................ </p>
            <p>Implement the DHCP Server on the NT Server. </p>
            <p>There are a total of 4 related scenarios with the above question. 
              please beware. </p>
            <p><br>
              10. Two cities: Dallas and Seattle. </p>
            <p>Dallas: 2 NT servers, 225 NT workstations. 1 Wins server named 
              DAL. </p>
            <p>Seattle: 10 NT servers, 1000 NT workstations. 1 Wins server named 
              SEA. </p>
            <p>Link between the two sites is a 56Kbps link. </p>
            <p>Required results: </p>
            <p>SEA's database must be replicated to the one in Dallas(DAL). </p>
            <p>Optional results: </p>
            <p>DAL's database must be replicated to SEA. </p>
            <p>The replication should occur only once a day. </p>
            <p>Solution: </p>
            <p>The following table is presented: </p>
            <p>PUSH CHANGES PULL TIME </p>
            <p>DAL 50000 </p>
            <p>SEA 24hrs </p>
            <p>--&gt;The proposed solution does not produce the required result. 
            </p>
            <p>11. on her windows nt workstation computer, jackie can connect 
              to a remote nt server by specifying the server's UNC path in windows 
              nt explorer. However, when she tries to connect via ftp 199.34.23.100 
              .she cannot connect. </p>
            <p>--- &gt;the windows nt workstation computer is denied access to 
              the FTP server's directories. </p>
            <p>I had 1 drag and drop question on the definition of the following 
              command line utilities no switches, please memorize: </p>
            <p>NBTSTAT NETSTAT TRACERT </p>
            <p>IPCONFIG NSLOOKUP ROUTE </p>
            <p>This is all what, I can remember. Good luck again, The Candyman. 
            </p>

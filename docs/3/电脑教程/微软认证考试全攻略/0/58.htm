            <p>58 Questions 90 minutes </p>
            <p>750 to Pass (you can botch 14 questions! How can you fail?) </p>
            <p>Passed last week with an 879 (Thats MCSE for me!) </p>
            <p>Anyway I took the normal strategy of Marking all the scenario (I 
              had 7 of them) questions until the end of the test and marched forward. 
              I completed the test in 52 minutes and once I got the last scenario 
              done I didn't even go back to review the questions. </p>
            <p>Sometimes you just know when you have passed and at this point 
              why try and tweak when you know you passed and the &quot;MCSE&quot; 
              is only seconds away </p>
            <p>. </p>
            <p>How I did it and what percentage each played in the success of 
              the exam: </p>
            <p>Transcender: 50% </p>
            <p>Exam Cram: 15% </p>
            <p>NT Resource: 5% </p>
            <p>Brain Dumps: 25% </p>
            <p>Hands on: 5% </p>
            <p>I charted out the subnet matrix (only class C hosts) and then when 
              I got a question concerning a Class B address I calculated the B 
              hosts real quick with the calculator (took 30 seconds and I was 
              way ahead on time) </p>
            <p>Lots of folks make this step a lot more complicated than it is. 
              If you can remember 192 - 2 - 62 everything else is a mathematical 
              progression from there. To get the amount of B Hosts just take the 
              number of C Hosts (not VALID C hosts, all C Hosts, ie. 64 not 62) 
              and multiple by 256 and subtract 2. To get number of A hosts take 
              C hosts and multiply it by 256 and 256 again and subtract 2. Simple 
              huh? </p>
            <p>Now there were no questions with regard to A class hosts so don't 
              bother with that. </p>
            <p>Also as everyone has said, no switch questions for any utilities. 
              Another thing to note, if you are stuck on not being able to figure 
              out the tough stuff like ANDing and figuring out whether two addresses 
              are on the same segment etc. Don't fret, unless you are looking 
              for a perfect score, there is maybe 1 question where this info is 
              relevant. And don't feel bad if you can't do it under pressure in 
              the real world there are IP calculators! Remember these tests are 
              more geared to your ability to implement and troubleshoot correctly 
              after all isn't that what we do the most of? </p>
            <p>Other info: This test is VERY Microsoft biased so if you know EVERYTHING 
              there is to know about TCP/IP and don't know jack about WINS you 
              will FAIL! There are more WINS questions then there are DNS questions!! 
            </p>
            <p>For those of you who use Transcender a lot, did you ever notice 
              how after you have taken a Transcender test four or five times you 
              see and check the answer without having to read the question?, well 
              I used the TCP/IP Beta Transcender and it isn't like that, I had 
              to read and struggle over the majority of the questions each time, 
              before the test I was scoring high 800s low 900s and could never 
              get a perfect score. This test is NOT harder than Networking Essentials. 
              You can pass this test with the strategies you read here and in 
              other brain dumps. Fortunately you will find that all the other 
              dumps have covered most everything on this test, the one question 
              I got that made me say &quot;What the heck?!?!&quot; was this: </p>
            <p>Which program would you use to execute a program remotely on a 
              Unix computer: </p>
            <p>A. LPQ </p>
            <p>B. LPR </p>
            <p>C. FTP </p>
            <p>D. Telnet </p>
            <p>The one you were expecting wasn't a choice was it? Well the answer 
              is D. Telnet. Thats the only on that threw me a bit. </p>
            <p>There was a ROUTE ADD question with an exhibit that was too complicated 
              to re-draw and too annoying to flip back and forth with, I skipped 
              it and came back to it, here is how to remember ROUTE ADD: </p>
            <p>ROUTE ADD &gt; with a mask of this use this Gateway </p>
            <p>Strangly I had no questions on resolution order (ie. Name cache, 
              WINS, Broadcast, LMHOSTS, HOSTS, DNS) someone said to remember the 
              phrase &quot;Can We Buy Large Hard Drives&quot; to remember the 
              order. </p>
            <p>Did have one on Netbios resolution: </p>
            <p>The question was &quot;you want WINS to resolve before Broadcast&quot; 
              which the answer is H Node. </p>
            <p>Know when you need DHCP Relay and WINS proxy and when you don't. 
            </p>
            <p>Best of luck to you and lets all get Bob to send Free CDs to everyone 
              who contributes a useful Brain Dump!!!</p>

          <td>70-063　MCSE W95 Brain Dump 
            <p><br>
              OK, OK, I know I said I wasn't going to do this because I didn't 
              want to duplicate any previous posts but so far I've got a few responses 
              from soon to be MCP/MCSE's who are interested in what I can tell 
              them, so here goes.... </p>
            <p>I was planning on not studying for a few days to rest between W95 
              and NT </p>
            <p>4 Server but I'm finding it difficult not get up in the middle 
              of the night and study.... so last night (when I promised myself 
              I'd go for a full 8 hours of sleep) when my brain said &quot;Hey, 
              what's going on, it's midnight, get up!! It's time to study!!!&quot; 
              I decided instead to do a brain dump... it's surprising what you 
              can remember in the middle of the night. </p>
            <p>The following questions were on my W95 exam that I took yesterday 
              morning (mm/dd/97), I'll try to give the answers were I can but 
              I don't guarantee them.... I didn't exactly run wild on the test 
              but I did pass with a 799. Hope this helps some.... get the transcenders 
              for W95 if you can, if not - study NETWORKING, USER PROFILES, and 
              EXCHANGE in the resource kit, know those chapters inside and out. 
              Oh ya, I can't forget </p>
            <p>I owe a lot to my good friend, Phil Smith -- who is probably the 
              smartest guy I know. Keep the faith Phil, you're destined for a 
              cell phone, the beach and doing whatever you want -- it's inevitable. 
            </p>
            <p>As for the brain dump, here it is: </p>
            <hr>
            <p><br>
              1) What protocols does DUN (dial up networking ) support? </p>
            <p>TCP/IP, IPX/SPX and NetBeui <br>
              2) Two different questions on using long filenames on a Novell Server 
            </p>
            <p>Don't remember the exact answer but you'll find it if you look 
              for &quot;Use OS2 namespace&quot; <br>
              3) A user running win95 dial up client with NetB dials into a RAS. 
              <br>
              NT server running NetB and TCP/IP. user wants to be able to access 
              a UNIX server via the NT server via TCP/IP, is this possible? </p>
            <p>Not sure if this was right but I went with server needs to run 
              TCP/IP over NetBIOS <br>
              4) Where does win32 apps reside in memory? </p>
            <p>4mb - 2gb = win32 apps <br>
              5) Setup fails during during hardware detection, what file can you 
              look at? </p>
            <p>DETLOG.TXT <br>
              6) Where are user profiles stored on a Novell server? </p>
            <p>In the users mail subdir. on the server <br>
              7) What do you need in order to change a registry key? </p>
            <p>The key, the name and the value <br>
              8) Can't remember the exact question but there was one on user vs. 
              share level </p>
            <p>9) Can't remember the exact question but had something to do with 
              where point and print info is stored on a Novell Server </p>
            <p>10) Jim and Sue share a PC that uses profiles. Both use Exchange 
              to access Compuserve. Sue can and Jim can't. Why not? </p>
            <p>Because Jim does not have Compuserve as a mail service in his Exchange 
              profile. <br>
              11) You are running a DOS app, 16 bit app and 32 bit app. You open 
              a second DOS app and it crashes, what apps can you save your info 
              from? </p>
            <p>All of the apps except the one that crashed <br>
              12) You have a Win95 desktop with a local laser printer on LPT1. 
              <br>
              You have access to a postscript printer on an NT server on the network. 
              <br>
              you run a MS DOS app in a window and configure it for the post script 
              printer. You print a 2 page document from the DOS app and 20 pages 
              print from the local printer. What do you do? </p>
            <p>Capture the post script printer to LPT2 <br>
              13) Where can you change your computer name in the network neighborhood? 
            </p>
            <p>In the identification tab under properties on network neighborhood 
              <br>
              14) You have 2 departments, SALES and ACCOUNTING. Both run Win 3.1 
              and need to be upgraded. Sales runs 16 bit and 32 bit apps as well 
              as DOS apps. ACCOUNTING runs 16 bit and 32 bit apps and need effective 
              security. What O/S would you recommend? </p>
            <p>SALES = Win95 <br>
              ACCOUNTING = WinNT (any time MS says good, effective, great, super 
              security, it's NT) <br>
              15) What file do you run to speed up your hard disk? </p>
            <p>defrag.exe <br>
              16) You are trying to save a file locally called &quot;THIS IS MY 
              FILE&quot;, it's 300 k. Windows Explorer reports 110mb free of HDD 
              space, there are 314 files in the root directory, why can't you 
              save the file? </p>
            <p>LFN's take up extra space so the 512 limit for the root dir has 
              already been reached. <br>
              17) You are running a DOS app in a window, the app is not TAPI aware. 
              You want to send a fax to a shared fax modem? </p>
            <p>Can't remember all of the answers but the correct one is. It CANT 
              be done. <br>
              18) Linda goes to a foreign country and attempts to dial into the 
              office using remote access. The modem tried to dial but she gets 
              an error message that no dial tone could be detected. Why? </p>
            <p>Set the modem to wait for dial tone before dialing <br>
              19) Jim and Sue both edit a shared document on the network. They 
              both edit the doc in their briefcase. Jim does not select &quot;update&quot; 
              but Sue does. What file gets updated? </p>
            <p>The shared file on the network <br>
              20) Why does Windows 95 print faster than Windows 3.1? </p>
            <p>Because of EMF spooling <br>
              21) You have two devices conflicting with each other, where can 
              you look to try and determine where the problem is? </p>
            <p>Device Manager <br>
              22) You have 100 users running Windows 95. They are running MS file/print 
              sharing for Netware and for MS networks. They access netware shared 
              resources. MS client for Netware is loaded at the workstations. 
              The network has Novell servers and NT servers. What type of user 
              access/server should be used (wording may not be exactly the same) 
            </p>
            <p>User level security with Novell validating <br>
              23) You access the internet via and ISP. You have no problem entering 
              in IP addresses to get to sites. But when you try to enter a domain 
              name, you are not successful. Why is this? </p>
            <p>The DNS server IP address is incorrect <br>
              24) One question was about W95 resources vs Win 3.1 resources </p>
            <p>W95 has unlimited resources <br>
              25) Question about pre-emptive multitasking and how W95 works with 
              it </p>
            <p>26) What is thunking? </p>
            <p>The process that is undertaken when a 16bit app makes a call to 
              a 32 bit app <br>
              27) What runs in ring 0? </p>
            <p>The core OS <br>
              28) What memory model do 32 bit apps fall under? </p>
            <p>Flat <br>
              29) One question asked about how to despool print jobs from W95 
              connected to a Novell server </p>
            <p>MSPSRV.EXE <br>
              30) How do you obtain DUN (dial up networking) server </p>
            <p>By installing MS Plus! <br>
              31) What can you use if WINS is not available? </p>
            <p>LMHOSTS <br>
              32) One question asked &quot;Which system out of the following 4 
              would need to be upgraded to run W95&quot; </p>
            <p>The only one listed with an EGA display <br>
              33) What are the advantages of NDIS 3.1 support? </p>
            <p>Plug and Play can be loaded dynamically <br>
              34) One question about MS-DOS app. running in MS-DOS mode displays 
              out of memory error. What can cause this? </p>
            <p>Can't remember the correct answer <br>
              35) One question about process/threads &quot;Which of the following 
              statements are true concerning processes and threads&quot; </p>
            <p>Each process contains at least one thread <br>
              36) No questions on the setup.exe or win.com switches but there 
              was one on &quot;How do you setup W95 to install from the server&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>NETSETUP.EXE </p>
            <hr>
            <p><br>
              Know the log files, remember that anything with an extension of 
              LOG is a binary log file that can't be read. So don't chose that 
              one, it will be a TXT file and you can usually find the right answer 
              based on the question (ie...Boot questions = BOOTLOG.TXT, setup 
              stalls BEFORE hardware detection = SETUPLOG.TXT, setup stalls DURING 
              hardware detection DETLOG.TXT&quot; </p>
            <p>There was a question about how to recover from setup problems and 
              3 out of the 4 possible answers had some kind of statement about 
              &quot;deleting&quot; certain files. You NEVER delete any files in 
              the middle of setup because W95 will use them to pass the point 
              where it had problems on the second, third, etc go around. The correct 
              answer was the only one that didn't mention anything about deleting 
              files. </p>
            <p>Well, that's about it.... good luck on the W95 exams... remember, 
              think POSITIVE!! Don't put it off, as Nike says &quot;Just DO IT&quot; 
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p><br>
              Now, here are my two colorful disclaimers: </p>
            <p><br>
              1) DON'T rely solely on a brain dump to study from. It's conceivable 
              that you may not get one of the same questions I listed or you may 
              get them all, the exams are pulled from a pool of questions. </p>
            <p>2) Microsoft's official take on spreading the work about what you 
              remember is &quot;NO PROBLEM&quot;. It's not like I copied down 
              questions and answers directly from the testing site. The pool of 
              questions is so big, it's possible that person A will get an entirely 
              different test than person B. </p>
            <p>If you have any other questions, please feel free to email me. 
              You can rest assured that I WILL be up between Midnight and 2 or 
              3 EST every night between now and August 4th studying for the next 
              test, as well as the weekends (guess I should get a social life) 
              -- my current plans are to use the discussion groups I've found 
              (especially this one), run through the &quot;important&quot; chapters 
              in the resource kit, hit the Transcenders pretty hard and run through 
              either Sybex's book or Mark Menasi's book, I hear both of them are 
              excellent. I've also been working with NT 4 server at my day job 
              and may also pull some articles out of Technet. I plan on putting 
              NT server on a PC at home too. Pass or not on the NT 4 server, I 
              plan putting doing another brain dump. </p>
            <p>PS - as a side note, if you can study listening to Enya, Enigma, 
              Kitaro, Yanni, Clannad or something you consider soothing and relaxing, 
              comprehending what your reading will probably come a little easier.... 
              <br>
              uh, I dont' think there are any test questions relating to that..... 
              at least not in the computer biz......</p>

            <p>Hi, I passed my win95 exam on 12/3/98. </p>
            <p>Study books I read: </p>
            <p>The supporting Windows 95 curriculum notes (5 day official Microsoft 
              course). A friend had gone on this course so I borrowed his books. 
              I read that a couple of times. While it had everything in it, I 
              found it was a bit dry and hard to read. On looking back it may 
              have been better to buy a book specific for this exam that offered 
              better explanations. </p>
            <p>QUE MCSE Windows 95 test prep. The most valuable book out of the 
              whole lot. Very good to read, It has a 1-2 page summary of each 
              mini topic followed by about a dozen practice questions. At the 
              end of every module there is a practice exam just on that module, 
              and finally at the end of the book there are 2 full practice exams. 
              This book is a must have and I wouldn't have passed with out it. 
              But I did find two errors in the 2nd practice exam, question 17 
              has a typo, and the answer for Q68 is completely wrong. </p>
            <p>Windows 95 ressource kit. I used this mainly as a reference. The 
              help file version of this was useful for doing specific searches 
              and for confirming answers in other braindumps. I read entire chapter 
              on user policies and profiles. </p>
            <p>Practice exams: </p>
            <p>MS assessment exam </p>
            <p>Demo MS PEP exams </p>
            <p>Win95cert 1.5 demo </p>
            <p>Self test software win95 (full version) </p>
            <p>Useful Websites: </p>
            <p>http://www.bnla.baynet.de/bnla01/members/robsch19/index.htm (braindump 
              heaven): </p>
            <p>I had my doubts as to how useful this site would be as it seemed 
              there were alot of wrong answers on it. But I spent my last two 
              days b4 the exam going through all the braindumps (always confirm 
              the answers !!!!!!!!!!! ) and it did give me confidence for the 
              exam. My biggest shock was that when I sat the exam that I had already 
              seen 70% of the questions in my exam in previous braindumps. </p>
            <p>So make it a priority to read through all of them, but I have to 
              say this again, you have to confirm your answers. Plus you learn/understand 
              it better when you check on the answer and it helps you identify 
              your weak areas. </p>
            <p>http://www.cramsession.com/mcse/ </p>
            <p>The summary here was very useful, as it covered nearly everything 
              in 8 pages, plus it meant I saved time as I didn't need to write 
              one myself. The heading called point and print should have been 
              labelled drag and drop printing. </p>
            <p>http://www.arrowweb.com/Echarbon/cert.html </p>
            <p>Useful links plus a short guide to the exam. </p>
            <p>Questions I can remember: </p>
            <p>Unfortunately most of the questions leaked out of my brain the 
              second I hit the End button. </p>
            <p>But In general I had lots of networking questions for NT and Novell. 
              I believe you need to have hands on experience on both these to 
              be able to pass this exam. </p>
            <p>There was also a few questions on DOS programs, configuring memory 
              settings for them, Virtual machines and memory spaces were in lots 
              of questions. </p>
            <p>I had a question about a pc with 2 network cards, one card was 
              connected to a novell network the other was connected to a different 
              subnet, I eliminated questions that had SPX routing across the network 
              cards, as win95 is not capable of doing this. </p>
            <p>One question I didn't see in other braindumps, and it was my first 
              exam question, was name three different ways in wordpad to create 
              a new folder on the desktop and save a wordpad document in it. The 
              only incorrect answer was to save as, goto the desktop and type 
              &quot;newfolder/file.doc&quot;, this will not work as it will not 
              create the newfolder directory automatically. </p>
            <p>question on what the c:\windows\system\colour directory is used 
              for. </p>
            <p>1 question on what nibble and compatibility mode is in reference 
              to plug and play parallel ports. read the resource kit on this: 
              &quot;Plug and Play parallel ports meet Compatibility and Nibble 
              mode protocols defined in IEEE P1284. Compatibility mode provides 
              a byte-wide channel from the computer to the peripheral. Nibble 
              mode provides a channel from the peripheral to the host through 
              which data is sent as 4-bit nibbles using the port,s status lines. 
              These modes provide two-way communication between the host and the 
              peripheral. Nibble mode is also used to read the device ID from 
              the peripheral for device enumeration.&quot; </p>
            <p>as mention before most of my questions were already in previous 
              braindumps so study those well. </p>
            <p>The exam is 90 minutes long, it took me 60 minutes to answer all 
              the questions. I marked questions that were difficult, and came 
              back and confirmed the answers. Once that was complete, I revisited 
              questions that required multiple answers as you are more likely 
              to get these incorrect. </p>
            <p>hope this all hopes, onto the NT server exam next. </p>

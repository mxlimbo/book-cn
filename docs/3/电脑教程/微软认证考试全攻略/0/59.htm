              　　Hi Guys, I took my second exam on Saturday morning (7/25) after 
              less than 3 hours sleep. I ran out of time to review all of my study 
              materials but I was successful w/ 879. I allowed the clock to run 
              out as I tried to review all of the marked questions. I did notice 
              several wrong answers during the 10 mins comment section - but ... 
              what can you do? I earned : Planning - 85%, Installation and Configuration 
              - 88%, Connectivity - 100%, Monitoring and Optimization - 83%, Troubleshooting 
              - 86%. I'll prepare a bit better next time. </p>
            <p><br>
              STUDY GUIDES </p>
            <p>Transcender Beta version 3.91 <br>
              MCSE TestPrep TCP/IP 1998 <br>
              The suggestions from the various BRAINDUMPS (... I thank you guys 
              so much) <br>
              The John Lambert article - &quot;Breeze Through Subnet Masking&quot;, 
              http://www.mcpmag.com/members/97mayjun/oe1body.asp <br>
              The Microsoft Official Curriculum - &quot;Internetworking with Microsoft 
              TCP/IP on Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 (Course 688) <br>
              Microsoft PEP Tests </p>
            <p>DUMP </p>
            <p>Doing the subnetting table removes a lot of the angst once you 
              are on the clock. All of those questions become no-brainers (unless 
              you get sloppy, like I do sometimes). There were approx. 6 questions. 
              I did not use the calculator. </p>
            <p><br>
              Given network address, subnets required, what is the subnet mask? 
            </p>
            <p>Given network address, subnets required, hosts required, what is 
              the subnet mask? </p>
            <p>What must you consider when deciding on a subnet mask? </p>
            <p>Know the node types: h-node, b-node and when each is used </p>
            <p>There were several of the following types - </p>
            <p>Sally runs IPCONFIG /ALL and receives the following output, cause? 
            </p>
            <p>Inability to connect (local, remote, specific server share), cause? 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              DHCP / WINS / subnet mask / IP address / NetBIOS scope / default 
              gateway / address range / DNS / LMHOSTS file / ftp / etc. </p>
            <p>Order of name resolution (computer / host)? </p>
            <p>How do you check to see if a router is working properly? </p>
            <p>What command should be used to check various conditions? </p>
            <p>There were many utility questions, (trick area - netstat vs. network 
              monitor) </p>
            <p><br>
              ipconfig, netstat, nslookup, arp, nbtstat, tracert, route, ping 
              etc. </p>
            <p>Win 95 users on LAN to access Internet - How do you set up the 
              default gateway for the RAS server? What is the default gateway 
              for the Win 95 users? </p>
            <p>What line protocol is always used to dial into a Microsoft RAS 
              (PPP)? </p>
            <p>Secure encrypted dial connection over the Internet (PPTP)? </p>
            <p>Setting up additional DNS servers for database redundancy - </p>
            <p>backup DNS server (secondary server)? </p>
            <p>load balance but avoid zone transfer (caching only server)? </p>
            <p><br>
              (I missed the no zone-transfer requirement.) </p>
            <p>Using network monitor, performance monitor, SNMP agent SW / management 
              SW - Accumulate and View, charting, plan network growth, check source 
              of heavy traffic - get the applications straight in your head. </p>
            <p>Best way to install UNIX computers into a Windows environment? 
              UNIX computer has an LPD server? NT Server as a print server in 
              a UNIX / Windows environment? Essentially using LPR utility versus 
              installing TCP/IP printing service. </p>
            <p>Multiple domains on multiple subnets, every computer needs to browse 
              every domain - entries in LMHOSTS files regarding PDCs and BDCs 
              for local and remote domains? </p>
            <p>Using #DOM:domain and #PRE in LMHOSTS file? </p>
            <p>Incorrect entries in a HOSTS file? </p>
            <p>Time when a DHCP client renews lease? </p>
            <p>Resource record type (AFSDB, CNAME, MB, MG, MINFO) for IIS? </p>
            <p>Configuring DHCP options across multiple subnets (as a global option)? 
            </p>
            <p>Configuring WINS replication - Table was given w/ configuration 
              of both servers, list of mandatory requirements, list of optional 
              requirements, list of solutions - </p>
            <p><br>
              Four questions in a row w/ various changes in the proposed solutions 
              - select the best option : mixed environment w/ UNIX, and Windows 
              clients, multiple subnets w/ router, TCP/IP protocol, DHCP, WINS, 
              DNS, must use hostnames... I followed the suggestion from an earlier 
              braindump and created a chart - Solution <br>
              Ques. 1 <br>
              Ques. 2 <br>
              Ques. 3 <br>
              Ques. 4 </p>
            <p>Req. 1 </p>
            <p>Req. 1 </p>
            <p>Opt. 1 </p>
            <p>Opt. 2 </p>
            <p>Opt. 3 </p>
            <p><br>
              This allowed me to stay focused. </p>
            <p>Also an exhibit w/ the task of updating the routing tables for 
              full connectivity. </p>
            <p>I will be studying for Server and Workstation next. Good Luck everyone!

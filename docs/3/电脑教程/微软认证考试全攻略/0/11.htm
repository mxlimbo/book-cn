          <td>Question 1. A Windows NT computer is acting as a print server in 
            your domain. There is a print device connected to the server with 
            100 Windows NT clients using it. You need to upgrade the printer for 
            the printing device. You want to do this with the least amount of 
            administrative effort. What is the best way to accomplish the task? 
            <p>A . Replicate the printer to each client by using NT's Replication 
              service.<br>
              B. Upgrade the printer on the print server. Stop the Server service 
              and restart it.<br>
              C. Upgrade the printer on the print server. Do nothing.<br>
              D. Upgrade the printer on the print server and ask each client to 
              download a copy of the new printer.</p>
            <p>Question 2. You have 2 groups, Sales and Marketing, that you need 
              to assign printing permissions to a single print device. The jobs 
              of the Marketing group are fairly small, and the jobs of the Sales 
              group are fairly large. Often, the jobs that are sent from the Sales 
              group tie up the print device for long periods of time. You would 
              like to configure your print device so that it will only handle 
              large print jobs from the Sales group or Marketing group after business 
              hours. A new print device is not in the budget. What must you do? 
            </p>
            <p>A . Create two printers, SalesJobs and MarketingJobs, on the print 
              server and share both printers. In the Only From option of the printer's 
              dialog box, set the time restriction of SalesJobs from 5 PM to 9 
              AM. Ask users of the Marketing group who have large jobs to print 
              to MarketingJobs, and users with small jobs to print to SalesJobs. 
              Ask users of the Sales group who have small jobs to print to MarketingJobs, 
              and users with large jobs to print to SalesJobs. <br>
              B. Create two printers, SalesJobs and MarketingJobs, on the print 
              server and share both printers. In the Only From option of the printer's 
              dialog box, set the time restriction of SalesJobs from 5 PM to 9 
              AM. Ask users of the Marketing group who have large jobs to print 
              to SalesJobs, and users with small jobs to print to MarketingJobs. 
              Ask users of the Sales group who have small jobs to print to MarketingJobs, 
              and users with large jobs to print to SalesJobs. <br>
              C. Create two printers, SalesJobs and MarketingJobs, on the print 
              server and share both printers. In the Printers folder, assign the 
              Priority of SalesJobs to 99 and the Priority of the MarketingJobs 
              to 1. Ask users of the Marketing group who have large jobs to print 
              to SalesJobs, and users with small jobs to print to MarketingJobs. 
              Ask users of the Sales group who have small jobs to print to MarketingJobs, 
              and users with large jobs to print to SalesJobs. <br>
              D. Create two printers, SalesJobs and MarketingJobs, on the print 
              server and share both printers. In the Printers folder, assign the 
              Priority of SalesJobs to 99 and the Priority of the MarketingJobs 
              to 1. Ask users of the Marketing group who have large jobs to print 
              to MarketingJobs, and users with small jobs to print to SalesJobs. 
              Ask users of the Sales group who have small jobs to print to MarketingJobs, 
              and users with large jobs to print to SalesJobs.</p>

              Question 3. You are working on a document in WordPerfect. When you 
              attempt to print the document, a paper jam occurs on the print device. 
              You are not successful when trying to re-submit the print job. After 
              clearing the paper jam, what should you do to re-print the document 
              from the beginning? </p>

            <p>Question 4. There is a print device on your network that is shared 
              by 50 users. Your boss, Bill Slates, has asked you to ensure that 
              any job he sends to the print device will be printed before every 
              other print job. How can you satisfy Bill Slates? </p>
            <p>A . Create another printer for Bill Slates and set the priority 
              of the printer to 99.<br>
              B. Create another printer for Bill Slates and configure the printer 
              to start printing immediately.<br>
              C. Create another printer for Bill Slates and configure the printer 
              to start printing after the last page is spooled.<br>
              D. Ask him to get a new print device with his billions and billions 
              of dollars.</p>
            <p>Question 5. True or False. When sending a job to a printing pool,

              B. DLC<br>
              C. NWLink<br>
              D. TCP / IP</p>
            <p>Question 8. There is a shared print device that is connected to 
              your Windows NT Workstation computer. One day, several users connected 
              to the print device are complaining that their jobs will not print 
              and they cannot delete the jobs. What is the best way to solve the

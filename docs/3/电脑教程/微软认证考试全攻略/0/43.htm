              Windows 95 is expected to use approximately 35-45MB additional hard 
              disk space <br>
              Optional, but recommended, equipment includes a mouse, CD-ROM drive, 
              modem, and audio card <br>
              Win95 Can be Installed from: </p>
            <p>MS-DOS version 3.2 or higher with 35-45 MB of free space <br>
              Windows 3.x <br>
              Windows for Workgroups 3.1x <br>
              Dual-boot OS/2 (with MS-DOS) <br>
              Dual-boot Windows NT (with MS-DOS) </p>
            <p><br>
              When dual booting into DOS 7.0 from Win95, the device driver that 
              is used is CONFIG.DOS not the CONFIG.SYS. </p>
            <p>Win95’s setup is divided into the following four logical phases: 
            </p>
            <p>1. Hardware Detection <br>
              2. Asking configuration questions <br>
              3. Copying component files for Windows 95 <br>
              4. Configuring the final system </p>
            <p>Another problem for plug and play is that it may cause the system 
              to crash when running Hardware Detect. </p>
            <p>If Setup fails because of a hang during the hardware detection, 
              the last entry in the Setup.log identifies where the process was 
              interrupted. To recover and resume, users simply rerun Setup. </p>
            <p>Know the Safe Recovery &amp; Setup Log Files: </p>
            <p>? BOOTLOG.TXT (describes system startup processes) </p>
            <p>? DETLOG.TXT (the hardware detection log) </p>
            <p>? NETLOG.TXT (records detected network errors) </p>
            <p>? DETCRASH.LOG if Setup fails, records detected crash </p>
            <p>? SETUPLOG.TXT (Setup tracing, is used by Safe Recovery, if errors 
              occur during the Hardware or Network detection phase) </p>
            <p>? Setup fails during hardware detection, what file cans you look 
              at? -DETCRASH.log </p>
            <p><br>
              Computers running Windows 95 can use long filenames on NetWare 3.x 
              and 4.x volumes configured to use the OS/2 name space, which emulates 
              an HPFS volume. Filenames on such NetWare volumes have a maximum 
              length of 254 characters and use an 8.3 truncation on the first 
              instance of the filename. </p>
            <p>To enable long filenames on a NetWare volume </p>
            <p>At the NetWare server console prompt, type the following lines: 
              load OS2 add name space os2 to volume sys <br>
              Then add the following line to the STARTUP.CNF file: load OS2 <br>
              Shut down the file server. Then copy the file OS2.NAM from the NetWare 
              distribution disks or compact disc to the same disk and directory 
              that contains SERVER.EXE on the NetWare file server. <br>
              Windows 95 Setup only enables long-filename support with NetWare 
              servers version 3.12 or higher. </p>
            <p>Values can be set globally using system policies. The related policy 
              name is Support Long Filenames under policies for Client for NetWare 
              Networks. </p>
            <p>The Windows 95 core components and shared DLLs reside in the shared 
              address space between 2 GB and 3 GB. This makes them available to 
              all applications. </p>
            <p>? 4MB - 2GB 32Bit apps </p>
            <p>? 2GB - 3GB 16Bit apps &amp; W95’s shared DLLs </p>
            <p>? 3GB - 4GB Ring 0 </p>
            <p><br>
              The smallest unit of measurement in a process is a thread. </p>
            <p>By default, all 16-bit apps are run in a single VDM. </p>
            <p>Plug and Play works by performing the following tasks: </p>
            <p>? Identifying installed devices </p>
            <p>? Determining device resource requirements </p>
            <p>? Creating a non-conflicting system configuration </p>
            <p>? Programming devices </p>
            <p>? Loading Plug and Play </p>
            <p>? Notifying the operating system of configuration changes </p>
            <p>When a user account is created on a NetWare server, a subdirectory 
              of the MAIL directory is created automatically for that user. </p>
            <p>Because a Mail directory is always available for each user, Windows 
              95 uses these individual directories to store user profiles. If 
              you want to use user profiles to enforce a mandatory desktop, place 
              the related USER.MAN file in the users’ MAIL directories. </p>
            <p>If you are using System Policies to enforce specific desktop or 
              system setting, the appropriate CONFIG.POL file must be stored in 
              the SYS:PUBLIC directory on each NetWare server that users use as 
              a preferred server. Windows 95 automatically downloads policies 
              from this file. </p>
            <p>If you have difficulties printing to a PostScript printer over 
              a network, it may be because banner pages are incorrectly configured 
              on the NetWare server. Unless banner pages are correctly configured 
              on the NetWare server, they will cause errors and nothing will print. 
            </p>
            <p>There is no Enable TrueType Fonts setting in Win95, since it uses 
              them by default. </p>

            <p>Recently-used documents are placed in Documents only if they were 
              spawned by a 32-bit app. Explorer counts. <br>
              You can only use hotkeys to start apps if those hotkeys are enabled 
              in the program’s Property sheet. <br>
              If you cannot print from an app, bypass spooling by printing to 
              a file, then drag that file onto the printer. <br>
              You cannot fax from a program that is not MAPI-compliant. So if 
              you cannot drag a document from that app into one that provides 
              MAPI support, you cannot fax from it. </p>
            <p>Quick View does not allow faxing, just viewing. </p>
            <p>Dial-Up client comes with Windows95. Dial-Up Server comes with 
              MS Plus. </p>
            <p>Thunking allows a 16-bit Windows-based application to load and 
              call a Win32-based DLL on Windows NT and Windows 95. </p>

            <p>Look for the PC card icon on the taskbar. <br>
              Check the PC card icon in Control Panel. <br>
              To determine whether APM is installed, check to see if a Suspend 
              Command appears on the Start menu. If not, check to see if a Power 
              icon appears in Control Panel. If there is a Power icon, APM is 
              installed. </p>
            <p>To make the Suspend command available on the Start menu, double-click

              Microsoft’s claims Win95 is made of 32-bit VxD architecture. VxD 
              means virtual device drivers, which are loaded dynamically </p>
            <p>when needed by the system. If you want to use IPX/SPX, Win95 can 
              load it automatically if you have already installed it. </p>

            <p>A subnet mask is used to mask a portion of the IP address so that 
              TCP/IP can distinguish the network ID from the host ID. TCP/IP hosts 
              communicate by using the subnet mask to determine whether the destination 
              host is located on a local or remote network. </p>

            <p>Both computers involved in Remote Administration must use the same 
              level of security (either user-level or share-level security). </p>
            <p>Remote Administration contains three components: </p>
            <p>Net Watcher <br>
              System Monitor <br>
              File System Administration <br>
              To use System Monitor, user-level security is required and the Remote 
              Registry service must be enabled on the computer being remotely 
              administered. The Net Watcher and File System Administration tools 
              do not require user-level security or that the Remote Registry service 
              be enabled. </p>
            <p><br>
              When you enable Enhanced Metafile (EMF) spooling in Windows 95, 
              your application does not wrap text around objects properly. </p>
            <p>To work around this situation change the Spool Data Format from 
              EMF to RAW. </p>
            <p>The Enhanced Metafile format allows Windows 95 to use a full 32-bit 
              GDI instruction set. When you print using the EMF spooling option, 
              Windows 95 creates an EMF that contains a complete set of instructions 
              that re-create the image as printed output. This causes control 
              of your computer to return more quickly than under previous versions 
              of Windows. </p>
            <p>MAPI Service Providers enable Microsoft Exchange users to retrieve 
              electronic mail from multiple different providers using the same 
              consistent interface. </p>
            <p>Printers which are not accessible in a given configuration will 
              be automatically set up for deferred operation when that configuration 
              is active. </p>
            <p>Select the printer that you want to defer jobs for. </p>
            <p>Choose &quot;Work Offline&quot; from the &quot;File&quot; menu. 
              The printer you selected should now be grayed out, indicating that 
              jobs for that printer will be deferred. </p>
            <p>The DriveSpace program integrates itself into the disk driver architecture 
              of Windows 95. It is able to re-map drive letters and re-route requests 
              from a physical disk drive to a logical Compressed Volume File. 
              When DriveSpace is activated, it does the following things to the 
              underlying system configuration: </p>
            <p>Drive letter &quot;C:&quot; is reassigned from the physical disk 
              to the DriveSpace compression engine. </p>
            <p>DriveSpace associates drive letter &quot;C:&quot; to a specific 
              Compressed Volume File (.CVF) on a physical disk drive. All system 
              requests for data on physical drive C: are translated to requests 
              to extract data from the CVF on a physical host drive and decompress 
              it. </p>
            <p>The underlying physical disk drive is assigned a new letter (usually 
              beginning with drive &quot;H:&quot;), which is then hidden. It is 
              possible to have a CVF take up only a portion of the free space 
              on a physical disk, or to have multiple CVFs on one physical disk 
              drive. </p>
            <p>To break the association between a file in the Briefcase and the 
              original copy of the file, select the file in the Briefcase window, 
              then choose &quot;Split from Original&quot; from the Briefcase menu. 
              With a UNC naming scheme, the Briefcase is able to address the needed 
              server and share directly, eliminating the need to manage drive 
              letter mappings. </p>
            <p>Windows 95 also adds &quot;Suspend&quot; mode support. On a power-managed 
              system, Windows 95 will deactivate and power down PCMCIA devices 
              and sockets when the machine enters Suspend mode, and re-initialize 
              all PCMCIA hardware when normal operation resumes. This helps to 
              conserve battery life. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Windows 95 will ship with built in support for three major classes 
              of servers: </p>
            <p>Point to Point Protocol (PPP). Point-to-point protocol is the emerging 
              standard for remote network access. PPP is used by many Internet 
              service providers, and is the default protocol used by Windows 95, 
              Microsoft Windows PPP enables multi-protocol routing. <br>
              A single PPP connection can carry traffic based on a variety underlying 
              network protocols. In fact, any protocol that could ordinarily be 
              sent over a physical network connection can also be routed over 
              a PPP connection. PPP accomplishes this feat by inserting itself 
              at the network driver layer. A PPP client and server can provide 
              remote access to virtually any network, whether it uses IPX, TCP/IP, 
              NetBEUI, some other protocol, or a combination of protocols. </p>
            <p><br>
              Remote Access Service protocol (RAS). RAS was the protocol used 
              by Windows NT 3.1 and Windows? for Workgroups. It is maintained 
              for compatibility with those systems. <br>
              NetWare Connect protocol. This protocol is used to connect to servers 
              based on Novell Corporation's Netware Connect product. Windows 95's 
              support provides the same functionality as Novell's MS-DOS-based 
              Netware Connect client software. </p>
            <p><br>
              Explicit Connections enable remote users to create a connection 
              to a particular network. For example, a user could choose to explicitly 
              dial a corporate network or information service, and then use the 
              resources provided by that network. </p>
            <p>Implicit Connections are automatically created by Windows 95 when 
              the user requests a network resource, Windows 95 will automatically 
              dial the remote computer in order to retrieve the requested data 
            </p>
            <p>Unlike earlier operating systems, the TAPI (Telephony Applications 
              Programming Interface) within Windows 95 takes over responsibility 
              for figuring out how to operate the telephone and modem. Rather 
              than requiring you to define a modem command string with the appropriate 
              codes, pauses, and numbers in it, TAPI combines information on where 
              you are calling, and where you are calling to, and figures out the 
              appropriate way to dial and connect the call. </p>

              as DriveSpace3, which has some advantages over version 2.0. It offers: 
            </p>
            <p>? Support for compressed drives up to 2GB where version 2.0 only 
              has support for up to 512MB </p>
            <p>? Multiple levels of compression (including none) on a single compressed 
              DriveSpace3 drive </p>
            <p>? Improvements to Adjust Free Space </p>
            <p>? A scheduling Compression Agent (see below) when a DriveSpace 
              3 drive is created </p>
            <p><br>
              DriveSpace3 offers three types of compression: </p>
            <p>UltraPack <br>
              HiPack <br>
              Standard <br>
              Troubleshooting Windows 95 Using Safe Mode </p>
            <p>Starting Windows 95 in Safe mode bypasses the current real-mode 
              configuration and loads a minimal protected-mode configuration, 
              disabling Windows 95 device drivers and using the standard VGA display 
              adapter. </p>
            <p>MS-DOS-Based Programs </p>
            <p>Your existing MS-DOS-based programs should run from Windows 95. 
              If you experience problems with an MS-DOS-based program, you can 
              set it up to run in an MS-DOS environment. </p>
            <p>Create a shortcut to the MS-DOS-based program. </p>
            <p>Right click the shortcut icon, and then select Properties. <br>
              Click the Program tab, and then click Advanced. <br>
              Make sure that the MS-DOS Mode box is checked. <br>
              If performance problems with DOS mode, Properties, Drag the Idle 
              Sensitivity slider toward Low. <br>
              In the Background area, make sure that Suspend Always is not checked. 
            </p>
            <p>Windows 95 with Microsoft Client for NetWare can experience problems 
              with NetWare 3.12 and 4.01 servers if packet burst is turned on. 
              Download the file Pburst.exe from the Novell Web site </p>
            <p>Disable long filename support in Client for NetWare. </p>
            <p>Click the Start menu, click Run, and then type Regedit. </p>
            <p>Go to HKEY_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\NWRedir 
            </p>
            <p>Create a new binary value named supportLFN with a value of 0. </p>
            <p>The Login Script Processor for the Microsoft Client for NetWare 
              should correctly process all commands in your login scripts. </p>
            <p>However, you cannot load memory-resident programs (TSRs) from these 
              scripts. </p>
            <p>You cannot install Client for NetWare Networks and Service for 
              NetWare Directory Services (NDS) during the same installation session. 
              If you do, your NDS printers will appear to be offline. </p>
            <p>Remove both Client for NetWare Networks and Service for NDS. </p>
            <p>Add Service for NDS. </p>
            <p>If your local area network is using NetWare 4.1 or later, there 
              is no need to install Client for NetWare Networks separately. When 
              you install Service for NDS, it also installs the Client for NetWare 
              Networks. </p>
            <p>When you run the 16-bit real-mode driver for your Plug and Play 
              network interface card (NIC), your Plug and Play card might appear 
              not to function. On most computers, the Plug and Play card is inactive 
              until Windows 95 enables it. 16-bit NIC drivers load before Windows 
              95 can turn on Plug and Play cards. </p>
            <p>Some 16-bit NIC drivers do not recognize Plug and Play cards (most 
              NE2000 P &amp; P). </p>
            <p>Run the Softset utility that comes with your Plug and Play card, 
              and then set the card to non-Plug and Play mode. </p>
            <p>When you upgrade to Windows 95 from Windows for Workgroups, your 
              shares are not maintained </p>
            <p><br>
              DEC Pathworks </p>
            <p>Loaded as a protocol, not a service </p>
            <p>Windows 95 provides support for upgrading over existing DEC PATHWORKS 
              V5.0+. </p>
            <p>PATHWORKS must be started before running Windows 95 Setup to automatically 
              detect and upgrade PATHWORKS components. </p>
            <p>Long filenames do not work correctly on PATHWORKS servers up to 
              and including version 5.0b. You will be able to create and delete 
              LFN files and make and remove LFN folders, but the files and folders 
              will not appear when you use the DIR command, or when you open an 
              Explorer window to the PATHWORKS server </p>
            <p><br>
              If you are using user profiles over a Windows NT or Novell NetWare 
              network, and you include Start Menu/Programs, Network Neighborhood, 
              and/or desktop icons in your profile, the server must have long 
              Filename support to ensure that these parts of the user profile 
              work over the network. </p>
            <p>If you install a network that does not use protected-mode protocols, 
              such as Novell NetWare 3.x, you might see a yellow warning icon 
              next to your network adapter in Device Manager. You can ignore this 
              warning; your network is fully functional. </p>
            <p><br>
              The Hardware tree </p>
            <p>The hardware tree is constructed every time Windows starts or you 
              click Refresh in Device Manager and is maintained as device configuration 
              changes </p>
            <p><br>
              The Current Control Set </p>
            <p>The Current Control Set contains information to load and start 
              Windows Ring 0 components. There are two keys under HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet. 
              The Control key contains information used to control system startup, 
              including the computers network name and the subsystems to start. 
              The Services key contains information to control the loading and 
              configuration of drivers, file systems, and so on. The data in the 
              Services key also controls how these services call each other. </p>
            <p><br>
              The Software tree </p>
            <p>Almost every device node has a corresponding node in the software 
              tree. Devices are organized in classes, like Ports for serial/parallel 
              ports, and Net for network adapters. The UI for non-network classes 
              in ControlPanel | System | Device Manager, and for network classes 
              is ControlPanel | Network. The registry key for classes is HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class. 
              The first Subkey is the class name, and the second Subkey is an 
              index. They contain information for the Device/Network Property 
              sheets </p>

              I took the exam on 16-2-98 and passed with 857 here is some advice 
              which helped me and some of the questions I can recall </p>
            <p>I am doing MCSE with Wave Technologies, I used the Wave study books 
              and the 95 Resource kit. I have the 4 Trancender Win 95 exams and 
              the Wave exams. The Wave exams are easier than the real thing but 
              the Trancender exams are tougher. The important thing with Trancender 
              is that they are only really useful the first time you take them. 
              Don't try them until you have studied the whole syllabus. What I 
              did was then attempt one and as I was doing the exam made notes 
              on areas I felt I was weak in. Study those areas and go onto exam 
              B. Again making notes as I went through studying up and onto C etc.. 
              I did D the night before my 70-63 exam and scored 757 which is a 
              pass in Microsoft (714) but not in Trancender (850). I took the 
              real McCoy the next day and passed with 857. I certainly found the 
              trancender useful for directing my study of weak areas though. Good 
              Luck </p>

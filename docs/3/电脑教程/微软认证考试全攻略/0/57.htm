            <p>Just passed TCP/IP (adaptive version) with 784, the passing score 
              is 570. I </p>
            <p>don't know if the score I got was good or not because the testing 
              center </p>
            <p>where I took it had printing problems, but a pass is a pass none 
              the less. </p>
            <p>Here is what I can remember. </p>
            <p>General comments: </p>
            <p>Yes, the test is different in that it has a few new questions, 
              but there is </p>
            <p>still all the regular stuff like the TCP/IP utilities. I didn't 
              find the </p>
            <p>test that difficult, but I 'm sure that I would have scored well 
              on the </p>
            <p>non-adaptive test. Thought the test was easier than Enterprise. 
            </p>
            <p>There is this new drag and drop type of question where you D&amp;D 
              your answer </p>
            <p>on to the appropriate box. It like the test you took in school 
              where you had </p>
            <p>to match up/draw lines between answers and questions. They don't 
              tell you if </p>
            <p>an answer can be used more than once. </p>
            <p>Things to Know: </p>
            <p>Had a lot of question on browsing. One question had 3 sub nets 
              with PDC on </p>
            <p>one, BDC on another and WINS server on another. Asked you to drag 
              and drop </p>
            <p>labels like Domain Master Browser, Master Browser, Backup Browser, 
              Potential </p>
            <p>Browser on to the pictures of the servers. I wasn't sure what to 
              put for the </p>
            <p>WINS server. I choose Master Browser because I thought each subnet 
              needed </p>
            <p>one. </p>
            <p>Another Drag and drop involved Host name resolution order. </p>
            <p>No subnetting questions although you still had to know ranges and 
              valid IP's </p>
            <p>(subnets, gateways, IP) as they relate to eachother when doing 
              a ipconfig </p>
            <p>/all. </p>
            <p>Quite a few questions on troubleshooting connections. Can ftp but 
              can't </p>
            <p>connect via UNC etc... </p>
            <p>　　Know DHCP global scopes. How to setup redundancy when you have 
              2 DCHP </p>
            <p>servers. </p>
            <p>One or 2 questions on SNMP requirements (Trap IP , Community name) 
            </p>
            <p>　　Know TCP/IP Printing. I should have studied this in more detail. 
              Had a drag </p>
            <p>and drop question involving a Unix server, NT server, Printer, 
              and NT </p>
            <p>workstations. You had to place labels on each device from a selection 
              of </p>
            <p>LPQ, LPR, and TCP/IP Printing service. </p>
            <p>Drag and drop question involving DNS, Primary, Secondary, SOA, 
              Cache file, </p>
            <p>Forwarder. Know the differences. </p>
            <p>That's about it for now... </p>
            <p>Study the other dumps... Chili Pepper, Studyguide. All the answers 
              are </p>
            <p>there. Don't worry about the new adaptive format. It's not that 
              bad. Get the </p>
            <p>Transcenders and take them until you score in the high 800's and 
              understand </p>
            <p>the what and why of the questions and you'll have no problems on 
              this one. </p>

              4 down 2 to go, Good luck! </p>

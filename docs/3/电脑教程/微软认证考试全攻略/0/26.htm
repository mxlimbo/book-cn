          <td>hank you to the others who have added to this. Their questions and 
            tips Have been a lot of help, so I will just add where I think it 
            may be of some help. 
            <p>Take your time. There is plenty of time to do the test. If this 
              is your first One, go ahead and take the practice test. It does 
              not take away from your Time, and it is a nice, relaxing way to 
              start. And, it gives you a successful Start, (it gives you all the 
              answers, so you get to complete a test with !00% </p>
            <p>Correct before you start the real one.) And you might learn a couple 
              things that you ignored in 8th grade :) Think only about how successful 
              you will feel _when_ you pass the test. If, for some reason, you 
              don't pass it this time, just look at it as a learning Experience. 
              Sit down immediately, in the room outside or on the curb, and Write 
              down the things you need to study up on. I talked with one person 
              That was really devastated, and when he began to realize he could 
              go home, With the information fresh, and study up on what more he 
              might need, he left With a new resolve. It is just a test, after 
              all. Not like anything that will Really change your life </p>
            <p>If you use the NewRiders book for Windows 95, be sure and go to 
              their site And get the errata - and realiz it should probably be, 
              say, a page or two longer. Overall, however, spending a lot of time 
              with the book, and verifying info with the 95 Resource Kit kit and 
              win95rk.hlp (on the CD) will get you through What would you answer 
              to questions referencing &quot;PCL&quot; printers? Probably Want 
              to find a source outside of this book to make it clear. Someone 
              might Ask you 3 questions referencing PCL printers someday. </p>
            <p>Don't let a question about user-level access on a 95 network throw 
              you, If no NT or Novell server is mentioned. But be very cautious 
              about doing that anywhere else. And spend a lot of time with the 
              options inside Policy Editor. Try changing all the Options on your 
              home network, (you do have one, don't you??!!) and changing them 
            </p>
            <p>Back, maybe developing some mnemonic to help remember. You may 
              get Exhibits that refresh your memory, but you may not. </p>
            <p>Well, on to ??-??? ;) </p>

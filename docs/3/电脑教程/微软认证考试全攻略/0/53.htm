          <td>70-059 Braindump for TCP/IP 
            <p><br>
              Date: 14th August 1998 </p>
            <p>Passed today with 913. Got five wrong, not quite sure which one. 
              Overall my test was not so bad, with about 4 scenarios ( 1x with 
              four questions, 2x with two questions and 1 with one question ). 
              I used Sybex and found it very good. The review questions at the 
              end of each chapter were quite close to the ones in the Exam. So 
              I would recommend this book for this test. I emphasis on this test 
              because I read somewhere on this site that Sybex is &quot;&quot;full 
              of hot air&quot;&quot;for the IIS4 test. </p>
            <p>Here is my braindump. Sorry I cannot remember the exact wording 
              but the general idea is all I can do: </p>
            <p>1. A diagram with two subnets. Computer WKT1 and Market server 
              in Subnet One and Server Design in Subnet two. WKT1 can access Design 
              but cannot access Market. </p>
            <p>My answer: invalid subnet mask n WKT1. ( two of choices were about 
              default gateway and router, so you are left with two to choose from 
              ) </p>
            <p>2. A Seattle and Washington WINS server needs to replicate ( required 
              ) and at least once a day ( optional ) and another optional I forgot. 
              Then a table showing Seattle’s push partner is Washington and Washington’s 
              pull partner is Seattle. It looks to me that Seattle is pushing 
              and being pulled and therefore Washington’s WINS is not being replicated 
              to Seattle. So I chose Not meeting required result. I could be worng 
              on this one. </p>
            <p>3. A question on a machine &quot;A&quot; doing ARP broadcast when 
              trying to connect to another local machine &quot;B&quot;. I choose 
              machine &quot;A&quot; has invalid subnet mask. </p>
            <p>4. A lot of questions ( easy ones ) on the utility. Example: capture 
              and decode TCP/IP statistics = NETSTA.EXE; charting into spreadsheet 
              – PERFORMANCE MONITOR; look at changes DHCP made = IPCONFIG.EXE; 
              look at netbios and IP file; NBSTAT.EXE; look at IP address to physical 
              address file: ARP.EXE. Notice that none required I need to know 
              the extension. Very easy questions on the utilities. So don’t worry. 
            </p>
            <p>5. A diagram showing about four NT Server looking like routers. 
              You need to add routes to HOST 2 and HOST 3 ( which are located 
              next to each other with HOST 1 and HOST 4 on either side. Four choices. 
              One choice had the wrong route add command ( missing the MASK. I 
              can’t remember which one I chose but just remember the Route ADD 
              command is Route Add [ destination } MASK [ Subnet Mask ] [ default 
              gateway ]. </p>
            <p>6. The famous LMHost file; You ftp Product and it’s fine but not 
              if you ftp the IP address; You do IPCONFIG and get </p>
            <p>123.45.66.7 Engineering Product #……… </p>
            <p>125.55.66.77 Product #……. </p>
            <p>I chose The IP for Product is incorrect. </p>
            <p>7. I forgot another question but the answer is ( pick two ) one 
              is one in PDC of the remote domain and one the domain controller 
              in the local domain. </p>
            <p>8. The big scenario question on requiring all windows based machine 
              to connect and UNIX to …..and trap messages ( fairly well covered 
              in other braindumps ) followed by four proposed solutions with each 
              one getting better and better until the last one being meet required 
              and all optionals. Basically you need enable IP forwarding, RIP 
              for dynamic routing table updates, static mapping for UNIX, SNMP 
              for trap messages etc. </p>
            <p>9. A lot of questions refering to You can connect local machine 
              but cannot remote machines whilst others in your subnet is doing 
              fine. Mostly something not right with your machine; e.g. invalid 
              subnet mask or default gateway settings. </p>
            <p>10. Only a few ( about four ) on subnetting, very easy if you prepare 
              the table whilst aswering the survey before the test starts. Always 
              you have X subnets and max. Host what subnet mask…… </p>
            <p>11. Designing network. How many HOST id’s do you need. Answer one 
              for each Router interface and one for each NIC on Host. If question 
              asks how amny NET id’s then it is one for each Subnet and one for 
              each WAN connection. </p>
            <p>12. Montoring from a UNIX machine . What do you need. I chose on 
              UNIX install SNMP management software and NT server install SNMP 
              Services. </p>
            <p>13. One easy question on TCP/IP printing services. The NT Server 
              to manage as well. On top of TCP/IP printing services configure 
              LPR port and share printer. </p>
            <p>That’s all I can remember. Good luck and good health. </p>
            <p>Thank you Robert again for keeping this site. </p>

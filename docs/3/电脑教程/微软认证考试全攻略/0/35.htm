          <td>70-063 MCSE Win95 Test Questions 
            <p><br>
              I came across these following questions while preparing for the 
              Win 95 exam. Some answers were mentioned, but I am not sure they 
              are correct. </p>
            <p>I have put my opinion also (this is in italic font here), ... <br>
              Thanks. </p>
            <hr>
            <p><br>
              1) One PC has TCP, IPX, NetBEUI, and client for NetWare, File printing 
              service installed. How to increase the Network performance. </p>
            <p>a. Set the file property to server mode <br>
              b. Install file-printing service for Microsoft. <br>
              c. Unbind TCPIP for NW. <br>
              d. Unbind all unused protocol. </p>
            <p>Answer mentioned was B c d </p>
            <p>My opinion: <br>
              Is option &quot;a&quot; wrong. Server mode is supposed to improve 
              preformance. Is the 2nd option file-print service for Microsoft 
              better than File-print service for Netware. Is the option &quot;b&quot; 
              correct. Reg the other two options, ( c and d ) I feel they are 
              right. </p>
            <p>Answers are a and d <br>
              A is correct because it increases disk cache says and means less 
              reads to the hard drive and thus better performance. <br>
              B is incorrect because it is impossible to run both file and print 
              services for Microsoft while running file and print services for 
              NetWare <br>
              C is incorrect because TCP/IP is not bound to client for NetWare 
              so this would be impossible--On the test the computer in question 
              also ran client for Microsoft. <br>
              D is correct because extra protocols slow things down. </p>
            <hr>
            <p><br>
              2) A computer named Y has 2 Network Interface Cards installed it. 
              Y is connected to a network that includes 2 Novell servers. Y is 
              running File and Print sharing for Novell Networks, IPX/SPX, and 
              TCP/IP. Y is also connected to a smaller network that has 2 computers, 
              Q and X. Q is a DOS client running a Novell NetWare Client and X 
              is a Windows 95 computer running Microsoft Client for Novell Networks. 
              What computers can Q and X see? </p>
            <p>a) Q and X can see the resources shared on Y and make use of the 
              resources stored on the Novell servers <br>
              b) X can see the resourcesshared on Y and make use of the resources 
              stored on the Novell servers. Q cannot see any resources. <br>
              c) Only Y can use the resources of the Novell servers. Q and X cannot 
              access any resources on either network. <br>
              d) X can see and use the resources on Y, however cannot make use 
              of the resources on the Novell servers. Q cannot use any of the 
              resources. </p>
            <p>My opinion: <br>
              Win 95 doen't do routing. I feel the answer is option &quot;d&quot;. 
              The computer X can see Y, but the machine Q cannot see due to SAP 
              advertising OFF ( not mentioned in question ). </p>
            <p>I had a similar question but in my scenario the Q and X were both 
              using a NetWare Client (not windows client for NW) Because of the 
              other answers being impossible on my test--again answers slightly 
              different than these, I had to assume that SAP was being used. The 
              only thing that hinted to this was it started by saying the Win 
              95 computer was &quot;active&quot; on a network.--and my answers 
              did not say &quot;could see&quot; but rather &quot;could access 
              resources on&quot; </p>
            <p>The Key here is to realize that Win 95 cannot route IPX/SPX across 
              the two cards--so eliminate any answers that say Q or X access the 
              Novell servers. </p>
            <p>This leaves two (on my test--not above example) then realize that 
              both had same Novell client this allowed me to eliminate one more 
              answer which treated Q and X differently. Only leaving one possible 
              answer... </p>
            <p>That Q and X could access resources on the Y-win 95 machine, and 
              Y could access resources on the Novell server. got it right! 100% 
              on this category. </p>

              3)You want to install win95 system from win3.1. Which cause of action 
              preserves the win3.1 program groups and icons?(choose 3) </p>
            <p>a) install win95, add win3.1 file manager to startup folder in 
              the programs folder on the start men. <br>
              b) install win95 in the existing win3.1 directory <br>
              c) install win95,and then create a desktop shortcut to each win3.1 
              .grp file. <br>
              d) double-click add/remove programs icon in control panel, and then 
              click install in the install/uninstall dialog box </p>
            <p>Answer mentioned was a.b.c </p>
            <p>My opinion: <br>
              Option &quot;b&quot; is correct, since same dir installation automatically 
              converts groups to Program Menu folders. Reg the option &quot;c&quot; 
              it is Ok to to have shortcut to convert each group to folder. But 
              is the option &quot;a&quot; and &quot;c&quot; required for correct 
              answer. </p>
            <p>My test asked for 1 answer-- b is correct </p>
            <hr>
            <p><br>
              4)With which element of win95, must an application interact to use 
              drag and drop printing and object embedding? </p>
            <p>a) Windows explorer <br>
              b) Registry <br>
              c) System policy editor <br>
              d) Win.in file </p>
            <p>Answer mentioned was a </p>
            <p>My Opinion: <br>
              Is it not Registry, since the file associations are stored there 
              and also all other settings reside in Registry. </p>
            <p>I chose &quot;a&quot; because the explorer in the interface that 
              actually is the heart of Win 95 and you interact with it while using 
              drag and drop and OLE-- the info for this is in the registry but 
              you don't &quot;interact&quot; with it. </p>
            <hr>
            <p><br>
              5) Which registry key contains information that tells Windows 95 
              what to do when the user double-clicks and click for a Microsoft 
              Access database file? (Choose two) </p>
            <p>a) HKEY_DYN_DATA <br>
              b) HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT <br>
              c) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE <br>
              d) HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG </p>
            <p>Answer mentioned was b.&amp; d </p>
            <p>My Opinion: <br>
              Since Hkey_classes_Root handles file assoications, the option &quot;b&quot; 
              is OK. But why option &quot;d&quot; is correct. I feel the other 
              one should be option &quot;c&quot; since Hkey_local_Machine contains 
              Hkey_Classes_Root also. </p>
            <p>Not on my test but you are correct the Hkey_local_Machine\software\classes 
              is Identical to Hkey_Classes_Root RK page 1028 </p>
            <hr>
            <p><br>
              6) WIN95's system policy editor can modify what? </p>
            <p>a. Password file <br>
              b. Login script file for push install <br>
              c. System.dat <br>
              d. Admin.adm </p>
            <p>Answer mentioned was d </p>
            <p>My Opinion: <br>
              Why it is not option &quot;c&quot;, since it is possible to modify 
              the Registry, through policy editor, since Registry is nothing but 
              System.dat. </p>
            <p>True-- C is the right answer admin.adm is a template not something 
              you edit. You use policy editor + admin.adm (or other template) 
              to create config.pol. This is of course in file mode. In registry 
              mode you edit system.dat and user.dat directly. </p>
            <hr>
            <p><br>
              7) A win95 computer is used for making resource to NetWare client 
              on of the same network, which network component must be installed 
              on win95 computer? </p>
            <p>a) Client for NetWare network <br>
              b) File and Printer sharing for NetWare Network <br>
              c) NetWare Workstation Shell 3.x <br>
              d) ODI Compatible real mode network driver </p>
            <p>Answer mentioned was . b </p>
            <p>My Opinion: <br>
              The option &quot;b&quot; is correct, but why not option &quot;a&quot; 
              also, since client for Netware networks is required to logon to 
              Netware, for user Level security to be implemented. Share level 
              is not possible with Netware and for user level security, I feel 
              the Option &quot;a&quot; is a must. </p>
            <p>True, but test only allowed 1 answer so B is it--I guess they expect 
              you to assume the client is there because you cannot share without 
              file and print sharing </p>
            <p align="center">—————————————————————————— </p>
            <p><br>
              8) A Win95 machine is participating in a NT domain named manufacture. 
              The manufacture domain trusted another NT domain named corporate, 
              you implement user level security on the Win95 machine. You obtain 
              a list of users and groups from the manufacture domain. You want 
              to security local resource. Which user account is available? </p>
            <p>a. Account from thecorporate domain only <br>
              b. Account from the manufacture domain only <br>
              c. Account from both corporate and manufacture domain <br>
              d. Account on the Windows 95 computer only </p>
            <p>My Opinion: <br>
              I feel the option &quot;b&quot;. is correct. Does 95 machine utilize 
              the NT trust relationship or not. Actually I tried today to simulate 
              this question setup. <br>
              On the 95 machine, when I tried to set the permissions, I could 
              see both the Domains, (in the pull down list) but I could get the 
              user list from only the domain (trusting domain) that is mentioned 
              in Control panel. That is the trusted domain user list didn't come 
              and I got the following error message. </p>
            <p>The contents of this container could not be obtained. The server 
              pointing this info may be temporarily unavailable. </p>
            <p>Hence I feel that option &quot;b&quot; is the correct one. If I 
              am wrong please correct me. </p>
            <p>Well, 100% on this section too and it was c, I had asked my teacher 
              this b4 the test, he said c so I went with it. I think this is what 
              the trust relationship is about the NT's are doing the trusting--95 
              just gets a list. </p>

              9) Anita is an administrator of a NetWare network which includes 
              a Win95 machine. She wants to make a printer attach to Win95 machine 
              available to other NetWare client computer on the network. Which 
              action must Anita take to accomplish this? (Choose two) </p>
            <p>a) Install file and printer sharing for NetWare network on the 
              Windows 95 computer. <br>
              b) Install client for Microsoft network on the Windows 95 computer 
              <br>
              c) Set the print properties to the printer from the win95 computer 
              <br>
              d) Install NetBIOS support for the IPX/SPX-Compatible protocol on 
              the Windows 95 computer </p>
            <p>Answer given a b </p>
            <p>My Opinion: <br>
              The option &quot;a&quot; is correct. But why the option &quot;b&quot; 
              is required. The client Microsoft network is not required. It should 
              be client for netware networks since user level security is required 
              to share the resources. </p>
            <p>This was word for word on my test. I chose and c for the reasons 
              you mentioned, but not sure -- I did miss one in this section??? 
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p><br>
              10) Virtual Memory Address space for Win 16 applications. Is it 
              ...? </p>
            <p>a) 2 GB to 3 GB <br>
              b) 4 MB to 2 GB <br>
              c) 0 to 4 MB <br>
              d) 0 to 2 GB </p>
            <p>My Opinion: <br>
              My understaning is that lower 2 GB is for applications and the upper 
              2 GB is for the System. Win 32 apps uses 4 MB to 2 GB and it doesn't 
              use below 4 MB. I feel Win 16 apps can use anything between 0 to 
              2GB and shared components for all the applications resides between 
              2 GB to 3 GB. Ms Dos apps uses 0 to 1 MB. </p>
            <p>See RK page 986 it shows win16 in 2-3gb range </p>
            <hr>
            <p><br>
              11) You are running a DOS application in a window and it is not 
              TAPI aware. Can you send a FAX to shared FAX Modem from this application. 
            </p>
            <p>a) Copy the documnet into the sharaed fax directory <br>
              b) Send the document to the port MS FAX resides on <br>
              c) Use Quickview to FAX it <br>
              d) It cannot be Faxed using MS FAX </p>
            <p>Answer mentioned was option &quot;d&quot; </p>
            <p>My Opinion: <br>
              I feel Option &quot;b&quot; looks correct, but I have not tried 
              it. If it is not then it is Option &quot;d&quot;. </p>
            <p>Stumped on this one--Instructor said you could capture the port 
              and use the Microsoft fax just like a printer. I wish someone would 
              try it and let me know--I don't have a modem on a network. </p>
            <p align="center">—————————————————————————— </p>
            <p><br>
              12) You upgraded your computer to Win95 from MS-DOS with NetWare 
              network client. You cannot upgrade the existing real mode network 
              driver for the driver is not available yet. Which connectivity restrictions 
              may apply for the Windows 95 computer while it is using real-mode 
              drivers? </p>
            <p>a) The Windows 95 computer can use only command-line utilities 
              to view resources on NetWare servers. <br>
              b) The Windows 95 computer is not able to obtain a list of users 
              and groups from a NetWare servers for user-level security <br>
              c) Only MS-DOS based applications are able to use the NetWare network 
              <br>
              d) There are no connectivity restrictions in effect </p>
            <p>Answer mentioned Option &quot;d&quot; </p>
            <p>My Opinion: <br>
              Due to Netware Network Client ( NETX or VLM ), File and Print Sharing 
              for Netware networks cannot be used and so User Level Security cannot 
              be implemented. So is it not option &quot;b&quot; </p>
            <p>I say d because it is talking about connectivity--you don't have 
              to share to connect. </p>
            <hr>
            <p><br>
              13) Configure win95 computer to be dial-up server. Your PC is part 
              of Microsoft windows NT domain and configured for user-level security... 
            </p>
            <p>a) dial-up password set when dial-up networking installed <br>
              b) password use on NT network <br>
              c) password store in user profile <br>
              d) password you specify when dialing in for the first time </p>
            <p>Answer mentioned was option &quot;a&quot; </p>
            <p>My Opinion: <br>
              Since User Level Security is set, in Dial Up Networking also, the 
              User list can be obtained from the NT Domain and permissions can 
              be given. So There is no necessity for setting a password, which 
              is required for share level security only. So I feel option &quot;a&quot; 
              is wrong and option &quot;b&quot; is correct. </p>
            <p>You're right and transcender and my test confirmed it as well B 
              is the answer </p>

              14) Application is stored on a compressed disk. You configure this 
              application to run in MS-DOS mode. When you try to run the application, 
              an error message appears, stating that the application file cannot 
              be found, and win95 restarts. What could be causing this? </p>
            <p>a) the file was written to the disk under the win95 protected-mode 
              file system and has become corrupted <br>
              b) the file has long filename that cannot be found under Microsoft 
              MS-DOS <br>
              c) the drivespace device driver is not loaded in MS-DOS mode. <br>
              d) the file has been fragmented by the VFAT file system so that 
              the Microsoft MS-DOS FAT file system cannot read it. </p>
            <p>Answer mentioned was option &quot;c&quot; </p>
            <p>My Opinion: <br>
              Since Longfile name is not recognized in MS Dos Mode, option &quot;b&quot; 
              is correct. </p>
            <p>No, MS Dos Mode will truncate the long file name and see the app 
              as an 8.3 file name: plus no name is given. C is definitely correct--if 
              you can't read the compressed drive then you can't read the drive.

              15) Maria's Plug and Play network card is able to use IRQ 5, 7 or 
              11. Her Plug and Play sound card uses IRQ 3 and her modem is hard-wired 
              to IRQ 7. Which IRQ will be assigned first during the system startup? 
            </p>
            <p>a) IRQ 3 <br>
              b) IRQ 5 <br>
              c) IRQ 7 <br>
              d) IRQ 11 </p>
            <p>My Opinion: <br>
              Since Legacy devices has to be handled before Plug and Play cards 
              the option &quot;c&quot; is correct. Plug and Play cards can be 
              automatically switched over to unused IRQ's after the legacy cards 
              are set. </p>
            <p>Yep, hard-wired is first! </p>

              16)You are printing from Excel to Win 95 print server in your workgroup. 
              Which of the following accurately describes the process that is 
              taking place? </p>
            <p>a) The job is spooled on your machine <br>
              b) The job is spooled on the print server <br>
              c) The job is spooled on both machines <br>
              d) The job is not spooled </p>
            <p>The answer mentioned was &quot;B&quot; </p>
            <p>My Opinion: <br>
              When the Print Server is a Win 95 machine, then the second rendering 
              of EMF to Printer format takes place in the Win 95 server and the 
              spooling (creation) of EMF File takes place in the local machine. 
              Does the question indicate about EMF Spooling or the 2nd part. If 
              it is the first part, then option &quot;a&quot; is correct and if 
              it is the 2nd part then it is option &quot;b&quot; </p>
            <p>I was confused on this one too, transcender said B and references 
              Tech net, so I went with them. </p>

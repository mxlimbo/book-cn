              Here is my dump, something I have remembered since yesterday is 
              that I had no questions that I had to pick all the right answers. 
              My questions all said pick one or pick 2 or 3 answers. Either I 
              knew the answer right away, or I knew it was one of 2 choices. </p>
            <p>Another question I remember was about someone works on Y computer 
              logs on to X computer and can see a file he saved on his desktop. 
              Two of the answers looked good, one was user profiles weren't enabled 
              on Y computer which was the one I choosed. Good luck and if you 
              have any questions, please let me know. </p>

              I sat Windows 95 today for the first time and passed with a score 
              of 857 (with 714 required). It wouldn't be right to go on without 
              thanking those who put this list together and those who input to 
              it. This list is what I feel was the biggest study aid I had for 
              the exam, thanks to all whom maintain it. </p>
            <p>A little bit of history, I took the 3.51 Workstation class in December 
              of last year and immediately took the exam and failed it twice. 
              I decided to switch to the 4.0 track and began it with Win 95. I 
              was a bit apprehensive going into the exam having two other failures 
              hanging over my head. I blame my previous failure on not preparing 
              and rushing through the tests (as I finished both tests in less 
              than 30 minutes). After I answered all the questions on today's 
              test and before I rechecked my marked questions I got up and did 
              50 pushups, hey it helped me) after the exam the testing lady said 
              that she was watching me on camera wondering what the heck was I 
              doing! <br>
              As I said, I was a bit apprehensive going in, but I felt I had prepared 
              as well as I could. I prepared with the following resources: </p>
            <p>Windows 95 Resource Kit <br>
              Transcender Exams <br>
              Que's Windows 95 Exam Guide <br>
              Microhard's Test <br>
              Various posted &quot;Braindumps&quot; <br>
              I liked the Que book as I found it very basic and to the point, 
              but I really don't think I could of passed with out my Resource 
              kit (it is pretty &quot;dog eared&quot; and highlighted throughout). 
            </p>
            <p>I liked the Transcender tests, but they are far from being a guaranteed 
              pass, which many learn the hard way. </p>
            <p>The biggest waste of money, in my opinion was the Microhard exams. 
              Unlike the Transcender exams which point you in the direction of 
              questions you miss, the Microhard exams just tell you your score. 
              The questions were poorly written and it was no big help, all it 
              did was add to the 490 question pool I used. </p>
            <p>I would take a Transcender exam and review the questions I missed 
              and highlight the section in green in my Resource kit. I than went 
              through and highlighted all the areas that Transcender pointed to 
              for all the questions in yellow. </p>
            <p>In the two times I read the Resource kit I paid a great deal of 
              attention to the yellow and even more to the green (as I said, my 
              Resource kit is pretty well used up). </p>
            <p>There have been some really good braindumps on this list and those 
              were a big help, not because they gave me answers, but because they 
              gave me more areas to highlight in blue! I was going to post my 
              dump, but don't want to waste too much bandwidth as I seem to have 
              rambled longer than expected. If you want a copy or have any questions, 
              email me at anonymized, if you want to post it on a web page, please 
              do, I know </p>
            <p>I have cruised my share of home pages. I will now prepare for Workstation 
              4.0, brain dumps and advice are most welcome, I bought some new 
              highlighters on my way home!. Thanks Scott for this list. </p>

              Here is my dump, I typed over a previous (well done) dump I got 
              off the list to hopefully jar my memory, hope it helps someone. 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              1) 2 Questions on using long filenames on a Novell Server, both 
              were use OS2 namespace. </p>
            <p>2) A user running Windows 95 dialup client with TCP/IP dials into 
              a RAS NT server running NetB and TCP/IP. User wants to check his 
              mail but can't, I do not remember the answers, but it was pretty 
              common. </p>
            <p>3) Where (in memory) do DLL files reside. (2-3GB?????) </p>
            <p>4) Setup fails during hardware detection, what file can you look 
              at? </p>
            <p>DETLOG.TXT (remember you can't read a log file) </p>
            <p>5) Where are user profiles stored on a Novell server? </p>
            <p>In the users mail subdir. on the server </p>
            <p>6) What do you need in order to change a registry key? </p>
            <p>The key, the name and the value </p>
            <p>7) Know about Point and Print info on a Netware server and that 
              it isn't automatic. Know how to do it! </p>
            <p>8) Jim and Sue share a PC that uses profiles. Both use Exchange 
              to access Compuserve. Sue can and Jim can't. Why not? </p>
            <p>Because Jim does not have Compuserve as a mail service in his Exchange 
              profile. </p>
            <p>9) A question about sharing a fax modem, what to things must you 
              do to share it. This was the trickest question I had. One of the 
              answers was share a directory and another was put it in Exchange 
              which threw me because I have seen fax in an Exchange profile. </p>
            <p>10) You have a Win95 desktop with a local laser printer on LPT1. 
              You have access to a post script printer on an NT server on the 
              network. you run a MS DOS app in a window and configure it for the 
              post script printer. You print a 2 page document from a DOS app 
              and 20 pages print from the local printer. What do you do? </p>
            <p>Capture the post script printer to LPT2 </p>
            <p>11) Where can you change your computer name in the network neighborhood? 
            </p>
            <p>In the identification tab under properties on network neighborhood 
            </p>
            <p>12) You have 2 departments, SALES and ACCOUNTING. Both run Win 
              3.1 and need to be upgraded. Sales runs 16 bit and 32 bit apps as 
              well as DOS apps. ACCOUNTING runs 16 bit and 32 bit apps and need 
              effective security. What O/S would you recommend? </p>
            <p>SALES = Win95 <br>
              ACCOUNTING = WinNT (any time MS says good, effective, great, super 
              security, it's NT) <br>
              13) What file do you run to speed up your hard disk? </p>
            <p>defrag.exe </p>
            <p>14) You are trying to save a file locally called &quot;THIS IS 
              MY FILE&quot;, it's 300 k. Windows Explorer reports 110mb free of 
              HDD space, there are 314 files in the root directory, why can't 
              you save the file? </p>
            <p>LFN's take up extra space so the 512 limit for the root dir has 
              already been reached. </p>
            <p>15) You are running a DOS app in a window, the app is not TAPI 
              aware.You want to send a fax to a shared fax modem? </p>
            <p>Can't remember all of the answers but the correct one is, It CANT 
              be done. </p>
            <p>16) Linda goes to a foreign country and attempts to dial into the 
              office using remote access. The modem tried to dial but she gets 
              an error message that no dial tone could be detected. Why? </p>
            <p>Set the modem to wait for dial tone before dialing and create a 
              new location. </p>
            <p>17) Jim and Sue both edit a shared document on the network. They 
              both edit the doc in their briefcase. Jim does not select &quot;update&quot; 
              but Sue does. What file gets updated? </p>
            <p>The shared file on the network (one of the answers was both Sue's 
              and the one on the server????) </p>
            <p>18) Why does Windows 95 print faster than Windows 31? </p>
            <p>Because of EMF spooling </p>
            <p>19) You remove one mouse and install a new one, how do you remove 
              the device from Device manager. One answer was highlight it in Device 
              Manager and hit the delete key, the only other answer that was close 
              was do nothing, for the life of me I can't remember what I put as 
              an answer. </p>
            <p>20) You have 100 users running Windows 95. They are running MS 
              file/print sharing for Netware and for MS networks. They access 
              netware shared resources. MS client for Netware is loaded at the 
              workstations. The network has Novell servers and NT servers. What 
              type of user access/server should be used (wording may not be exactly 
              the same)? </p>
            <p>I put NT Domain and user security </p>
            <p>21) One question was about W95 resources vs Win 3.1 resources -W95 
              has unlimited resources (w/o this dump, I may not have got this 
              one right!) </p>
            <p>22) Questions about pre-emptive multitasking and how W95 works 
              with it, different scenarios, IE DOS and 16 bit apps etx. </p>
            <p>23) What is thunking?- The process that is undertaken when a 16bit 
              app makes a call to a 32 bit app </p>
            <p>24) What memory model do 32 bit apps fall under? </p>
            <p>Flat </p>
            <p>25) One question asked about how to despool print jobs from W95 
              connected to a Novell server, I just remembered </p>
            <p>MSPSRV.EXE </p>
            <p>26) What can you use if WINS is not available? </p>
            <p>LMHOSTS </p>
            <p>27) One question asked &quot;Which system out of the following 
              4 would need to be upgraded to run W95&quot; </p>
            <p>The only one listed with an EGA display </p>
            <p>28) What are the advantages of NDIS 3.1 support? </p>
            <p>Plug and Play can be loaded dynamically </p>
            <p>29) One question about MS-DOS app. running in MS-DOS mode displays 
              out of memory error What can cause this? </p>
            <p>This was a tough one, because the choices were (don't quote me) 
              a)disable himem sys, b)there is no emm386 in the config sys c)???? 
              and d)something about DPMI set to auto (choose two) </p>
            <p>30) No questions on switches but there was one on &quot;How do 
              you setup W95 to install from the server?&quot; </p>
            <p>NETSETUP.EXE </p>
            <p>31) Two questions on what to do if the system fails on setup, just 
              remember shut it off and turn it back on. </p>
            <p>32) A question about a Lantastic network and not being able to 
              see other computers, the only answer that seemed close was turning 
              something on, I just can't remember what it was, but I got 100% 
              on networking, so I know it was right. </p>
            <p>33) Remember that you can change the attributes with a group of 
              folders together, but you must share them individually. </p>
            <p>34) Know how to change the font size on the display. </p>
            <p>35) Know what files System Policy Editor can change. One answer 
              was system.dat and another was Admin.adm I forget and my head hurts 
              to much to look it up </p>
            <p>36) You send print jobs to a network printer and you delete the 
              printer, what happens to the print jobs? </p>

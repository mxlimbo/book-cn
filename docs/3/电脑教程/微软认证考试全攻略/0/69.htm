          <td>Thanks to all of U who are maintaining and contributing to this 
            site.I just passed today 632/1000, withoutn this site it was impossible. 
            it took 2 weeks of study for me. I am basically a unix guy. I read 
            from Resource kit , this site and http://www.globetrotting.com 
            <p>Now it's my turn to contribute. once again thanks to U all!!! </p>

            <p>Subject: test 70-064 </p>
            <p>1.You are performing a network install of Win95. How can you reduce 
              network traffic after the installation? </p>
            <p>a. Share installation b. Local installation </p>
            <p>2. There was a question about modemlog.txt. It went something along 
              the lines of You want to trap all AT commands sent to your modem. 
              What do you do? (Answer was Turn modem log on or something) </p>
            <p>3. A question on Novell. You have a client on Novell, proper protocols 
              and services, etc. You cann see Novell servers but cannot map a 
              drive to them. Why? </p>
            <p>a. ensure the correct frame type is selected </p>
            <p>b. install tcpip c. etc </p>
            <p>c. </p>
            <p>4. Win31, NT, 95, DOS on LAN. You need them all to access shared 
              folders. What 2 folder </p>
            <p>names can be seen by all clients. (The only 2 that don't use LFN) 
            </p>
            <p>5. There was a question on which apps do not need 3rd party emulation. 
              Mac, Unix, 16 bit Windows, MS-DOS apps that use EMS, MS-DOS apps 
              that use XMS, or MS-DOS apps that make direct calls to hardware. 
              pick 3 </p>
            <p>6. A user is complaining of performance problems. You run System 
              Monitor and there's lots of page faults, etc. etc. etc. What can 
              be done to help the user's performance??(Add more RAM) Go to the 
              resource kit for the answer. There is a good explanation. </p>
            <p>7. 2 machines are connected to network, clienta and clientb. They 
              have identical hardware/software. One complains that machine is 
              running slower than the other. What can you check for with system 
              monitor? </p>
            <p>8. Setup crashed during hardware detection. You power off and on. 
              What can you do? The only answer that made sense was Restart setup 
              and use safe recovery. All the other ones were either delete detlog.txt 
              or move detlog.txt, etc. </p>
            <p>9. Had an exhibit where they showed a routed network with some 
              IP Addresse filled in, including the router's IP address. They then 
              ask for an answer on the Default gateway and IP address of a client. 
            </p>
            <p>10) Know that when a box in System Policy Editor is checked or 
              unchecked, that policy applies (to either the user or goup.) When 
              it is grey it does not apply, therefore, for a specific user, some 
              policies can be set by the group. User policies. </p>
            <p>11. *SAP Advertising, which is used by Novell NetWare 2.15 and 
              above, 3.x, and 4.x servers to </p>
            <p>advertise their presence on the network. You must enable this option 
              if you want the shared </p>
            <p>resources to be available to computers running NETX or VLM.If you 
              select SAP Advertising, </p>
            <p>12. A scenario question went something like this. </p>
            <p><br>
              You have a network with an NT PDC server A Netware server and you 
              want to add new 95 clients. The organization has three departments. 
              Sales, Accounting and Exec. You need to have clients share their 
              files and you want to be able to access the Netware serv </p>
            <p>You have x NT servers &amp; x Novell 3.12 servers &amp; all WIN95 
              clients (all three questions started out this way). You want to 
              blah blah blah. The desired results are......(don't worry about 
              it cause they're repeated again in the check boxes). The proposed 
              is </p>
            <p>What configuration allows browsing the sales groups on the network. 
              Anyway what these three question boiled down to was KNOW WHAT YOU 
              NEED FOR USER PROFILES/BROWSING NETWORK GROUPS and DOMAINS/WHAT 
              IS NEEDED TO SEE FILES ON MICROSOFT SERVER or NOVELL SERV </p>
            <p>13. One question about the 34 threads ( System Performance) was 
              on my test. I spent all last night looking this one up and the best 
              I could come up with was that Tony was right. </p>
            <p><br>
              Things to give a 2nd look: printers(all aspects), backup, drive 
              compression, policies and profiles, network connectivity(Novell 
              and NT) this was the bulk of the test. </p>
            <p>14. Know how to limit access to a directory to a couple of people 
              so they only have read access while everyone else in the same group 
              has full access. </p>
            <p>15. Know how to install WIN95 on a machine that has NT dual booting 
              with OS2 </p>
            <p>16. If you are a pc on one subnet and want to connect to a pc on 
              another subnet.- there will be an exhibit with a router and its 
              ip addresses- what ip address do you use for a gateway. </p>
            <p>Ann and Bob are in the Acct group and you want to give them read 
              only rights but the rest of the Acct group full rights? How do you 
              do it. </p>
            <p>17) That you uncheck the &quot;wait for dial tone before dialing&quot; 
              box in the connection tab of the properties window for a modem if 
              your in a country with no audible dial tone. </p>
            <p>18. Win31, NT, 95, DOS on LAN. You need them all to access shared 
              folders. What 2 folder </p>
            <p>names can be seen by all clients. (The only 2 that don't use LFN) 
            </p>
            <p>19. Setup crashed during hardware detection. You power off and 
              on. What can you do? The only answer that made sense was Restart 
              setup and use safe recovery. All the other ones were either delete 
              detlog.txt or move detlog.txt, etc. </p>
            <p>20. If you cannot print from DOS app, but you can print from windows 
              app, what can you do next? </p>
            <p>Reinstall the printer drivers </p>
            <p>*Capture the printer port </p>
            <p>Turn on EMF spooling </p>
            <p>Install DOS printer drivers </p>
            <p><br>
              21.You are performing a network install of Win95, how can you reduce 
              network traffic after the </p>
            <p>installation? </p>
            <p>*Tell netsetup it is a shared install </p>
            <p>Tell netsetup it is a local install </p>
            <p>Edit msbatch.inf to include netowrk downtimes </p>
            <p>Edit msbatch.inf to include the number of installs to perform </p>
            <p>WHAT NOT to study: 95 Architecture - Memory config stuff. DOS - 
              pre-emptive v.s. cooperative stuff. Process's or Threads. MS-Mail 
              MS-Exchange . </p>

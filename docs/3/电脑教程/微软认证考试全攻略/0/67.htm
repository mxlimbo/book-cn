          <td>hich of the following explains why the performance of a client with 
            a shared printer in an NT Domain is not affected? 
            <p>The domain controller performs all the spooling. <br>
              The job is converted from EMF to Raw on each client pc prior to 
              being sent to the server pc. <br>
              The clients all share a network version of the printer driver. <br>
              Correct answer is b </p>
            <p>What type of memory is available to msdos apps in win95 (choose 
              three)? </p>
            <p>My answers: extended, expanded, conventional. </p>
            <p>Other choice was paged. </p>
            <p>Name two reasons that win95 says that it has a conflict between 
              two plug&amp;play hardware devices. </p>
            <p>They aren’t in the supported hardware list. <br>
              Legacy devices are assigned resources before plug&amp;play devices. 
              <br>
              The resource arbitrator assigns legacy devices higher priority than 
              plug&amp;play devices for resources. <br>
              The bus enumerator assigns legacy devices higher priority than plug&amp;play 
              devices for resources. <br>
              Answers are b and c. </p>
            <p>What things can you do to increase available memory for dos apps? 
            </p>
            <p>My answers: Load real-mode drivers in upper memory, Run in dos-mode. 
            </p>
            <p>What two windows utilities can be used to change the message the 
              user sees upon login to network? </p>
            <p>??? Choices were write.exe, regedit, system policy editor </p>
            <p>What tool would you use to add a shared file on a remote computer 
              that doesn’t have remote registry service installed? </p>
            <p>Windows explorer &lt; my choice <br>
              Regedit <br>
              Netwatcher <br>
              System monitor <br>
              You want to make the largest possible contiguous free space on your 
              hard drive. What is the fastest way to do this? </p>
            <p>My answer: consolidate free space only. </p>
            <p>Three questions I had that I’ve seen before in braindumps where 
              no one is really sure of the correct answer: </p>
            <p>Can you send a fax from a dos app that is not mapi compliant by 
              sending it to a lpt port captured to the fax device?? (Not the exact 
              question) <br>
              2. How do you remove a pcmcia network adapter from a machine? Select 
              from following: </p>
            <p>a. Stop the pc card network adapter first </p>
            <p>b. Log off from network. </p>
            <p>c. Do nothing, just remove card. </p>
            <p>I chose a, but I couldn’t find anything specific on this question 
              in my study material. </p>
            <p>What must an app have support for to have drag&amp;drop printing 
              and object embedding (br&gt;windows explorer <br>
              registry <br>
              Questions I had that I have seen in other braindumps: </p>
            <p>1. I had the basic questions about win32 apps vs. win16 apps vs. 
              msdos apps, and what would happen to the rest of your running apps 
              if one of them locks up. I think I had at least 4 questions on this. 
            </p>
            <p>The basic share-level protection vs. user level security questions. 
              2-3 questions <br>
              The nibble mode question (plug &amp; play parallel devices) did 
              show up on my test. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Computer X has two nics, one to main network and one to subnet 
              with computers Y and Z. Y is win 95 w/ client for netware networks. 
              Z is dos w/ netware drivers. What can each computer see? Y and Z 
              can see X but not main network. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The netsetup question. No switches. <br>
              EMF spooling returns control to application faster. <br>
            </p>
            <p>If user wants to run OS/2 apps he should install win nt, not win95. 
              <br>
              Unix doesn’t support netbios. <br>
              WINS <br>
              How do you create a logfile for your modem? <br>
              A device driver causes your pc to lock up and win95 will not boot. 
              What do you do? <br>
              What directory are user profiles stored in on NT server? <br>
              Setuplog.txt &amp; detlog.txt questions. </p>

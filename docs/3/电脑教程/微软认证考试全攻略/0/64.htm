            <p><br>
              First of all I would like to thank the founder of this wonderful 
              site as well as all those people who in one way or another contribute 
              to this site. </p>
            <p>Well I have just finished taking my 5th exam TCP/IP on 14/05/1998 
              and passed. </p>
            <p>The test was not that difficult but I though I would get much easier 
              questions.Instead I got a killer pool of questions which consisted 
              of about 8 SCENARIOS (I am not good in scenario questions) </p>
            <p>Much has been said already so I think I am not going to repeat.Mind 
              you everything is the same as it appers here on this site. </p>
            <p>I used no books recommended by other members. Just the brain dumps 
              to help me focus on what I ought to know.I used general networking 
              with UNIX TCP/IP knowledge with some NT utilities and that was all.In 
              my thoughts I think TCP/IP is TCP/IP no matter waich Operating system. 
            </p>
            <p>Here we go </p>
            <p>1)A lot of command line utilities: ARP, NETSTAT, NBTSTAT, NSLOOKUP 
              (know these) as well as PERFOMANCE MONITOR and NETWORK MONITOR. 
              In my test mostly I answered NETSTAT when it appeared. </p>
            <p>Question I had include: </p>
            <p>a)Which utility will you use to display TCP/IP statisticss in your 
              network(netstat) <br>
              b)which utility for IP to physical address(arp) <br>
              c)To collect statistics for further analysis(perf mon) <br>
              d)to capture packets for analysis(network monito) </p>
            <p><br>
              2) Know about printing stuff like :What are LPQ, LPD and LPR for? 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              8) I had 8 scenarios.4 of them had the same requirements and optional 
              required results but each one had different solution.The scenarios 
              had something to do with the the fact that You want to introduce 
              NT server in your network and to enable this server to route: </p>
            <p>one said just make it able to route <br>
              the other one said enable IP forwarding <br>
              the other one one said not only Ip forwarding but also install RIP 
              and so on and so forth. <br>
              So I answered invariably as </p>
            <p>does not meet <br>
              meets only required results <br>
              meets required and one <br>
              meets all <br>
              For now this is what I can recall </p>

            <p>You want to improve the performance of a SQL Server 7.0 database 
              by distributing input/output operations across multiple physical 
              disks. You know which tables and indexesare queried most frequently, 
              and you want to place each of them on a separate disk. How canyou 
              place each of the most frequently queried tables and indexes on 
              its own separate disk?Answer: One each disk, create a filegroup 
              consisting of a single file and place each table andindex in its 
              own filegroup.You are planning to use SQL Server Profiler to debug 
              and optimize queries and applicationsin SQL Server 7.0. You want 
              to be able to use SQL Server query-processing tools analyze thedata 
              captured by Profiler. Where should you save the event data that 
              will be captured by the Profiler trace?<br>
              A. In a text file<br>
              B. In a Windows NT Application log<br>
              C. In the trace definition file.<br>
              D. In a SQL Server table<br>
              Answer: D</p>
            <p>Notice: If you want to use SQL Server query processing tools to 
              analyze the captured data, thenyou should save the event data to 
              a table.You must perform multiple identical installations of SQL 
              Server 7.0 in remote branches ofyour company that are not connected 
              to the central office. The network administrators in thebranches 
              have not been trained to install SQL Server 7.0. How can you facilitate 
              theinstallations so that most of the work will be done automatically?Answer: 
              Run SQL Server Setup interactively to install SQL Server on a computer 
              in the centraloffice. During installation, assign the MSSQLServer 
              and SQLServerAgent services to the localsystem user account Send 
              the iss file to the branches.Your Company is using Sql Server 7.0

            <p>The departmental server has Full Text search implemented on its 
              SQL server database. Currently both the Full Text database and the 
              database files reside on the same logical drive. You do not want 
              the Full Text indexing to use more than 25% of the available drive 
              space because you want to allow space for dynamic expansion of the 
              data files. You want to be able to remotely monitor the amount of 
              space in use by the catalogs. How should you remotely monitor the 
              space usage with a minimum number of additional administrative steps?<br>
              A. Use the windows NT Performance Monitor to connect to the Server 
              and to monitor the size of<br>
              the Microsoft Search catalog<br>
              B. Create a scheduled job to regularly monitor the size of the Full 
              Text indexes and send the result<br>
              to your E-MAIL address<br>
              C. Create a batch file to monitor the size of Full Text indexes 
              and send the result to you via<br>
              Network Message. Use the Windows NT Scheduler Service to schedule 
              the batch file to run<br>
              regularly<br>
              D. Create a batch file to monitor the size of the Full Text indexes 
              and send the result to you via<br>
              Network Message. Create a scheduled job to run the batch file regularly.<br>
              Answer: A</p>
            <p>You are a SQL Server 7.0 system administrator for you company. 
              To provide users with Full Text search capabilities, you create 
              a Full Text catalog and enable Full Text indexing for specific tables 
              in a database. From your Windows NT Workstation computer, you want 
              to remotely monitor the size of the Full Text catalog on Windows 
              NT server computer that is running SQL Server. Which of the following 
              tools is the most convenient to use for monitor the Full Text catalog?<br>
              A. Performance Monitor<br>
              B. Query Analyzer<br>
              C. The SP_MONITOR system stored procedure<br>
              D. SQL Server Profiler.<br>
              Answer: A</p>
            <p>Notice: To obtain real-time information about the size of a specific 
              full-text catalog, you can continuously monitor the appropriate 
              instance of the Microsoft search Indexer Catalogs You load a lot 
              data into your database, then you find that the space for log is 
              almost full, how can you do to ensure the restore: (Choose all that 
              apply)<br>
              A. Make a full backup<br>
              B. Make a differential backup<br>
              C. Backup the transaction log with the default options<br>
              D. Backup the transaction log with truncate only<br>
              Answer: A, D</p>
            <p>The engine manufacturing application records data about all the 
              engines that are manufactured at your plant, the database contains 
              approximately 500 Million records and is approximately 50GB in size. 
              The database increases by 1000 records per day. You want to accomplish 
              the following goals:<br>

              2. Provide the ability to recover the database to a specific time<br>
              3. Minimize the number of transaction logs that need to be during 
              recovery<br>
              4. Minimize the time required to backup the database</p>
            <p>You take the following actions<br>
              1. Schedule a full database backup of the entire database to occur 
              every Sunday at AM 1:00 2. Schedule transaction log backup to occur 
              every day at P.M Which result or results do these action produce? 
              ( Choose all that apply )<br>
              A. The time required to recover the database is minimized<br>
              B. The database can be recovered to a specific time.<br>
              C. The number of transaction logs that need to be applied during 
              recovery is minimized<br>
              D. The time required to backup the database is minimized<br>
              Answer: B, D</p>
            <p>You check the free space on a log file and run a BACKUP LOG WITH 
              NO_LOG on a database that is a publisher for transactional replication. 
              You check the free space after running this command and note that 
              free space has not changed. What is the most likely reason that 
              free space has not changed?<br>
              A. The distributor database is full<br>
              B. Log reader agent has stopped<br>
              Answer: B</p>
            <p>You have 2 tables, T1 &amp; T2, GI should be able to update T1, 
              G2 should be only able to select from T1 and third group G3 able 
              to select and update on T2. The question is how manyapplication 
              roles do you need?<br>
              Answer: 3</p>
            <p>Sales representatives use portable computers. They need to implement 
              replication scenario so that the sales representatives can enter 
              the orders. You want to minimize network traffic:<br>
              A. Transactional<br>

            <p>Hello one and all: </p>
            <p>I am happy to say that I finally have something to contribute to 
              the list (which I hope is worthwhile) after being just a &quot;lurker&quot;... 
            </p>
            <p>I passed W95 on Friday (with a lot of lucky stars and a few horseshoes 
              to boot, I think)... Coming from a non-computer background, on a 
              shoestring budget that could ill afford the purchase of the *extra* 
              resources, and no job that would give me that needed *hands on*, 
              I'm still in shock, as I scored an 871! </p>
            <p>I could not have done it without the *sense of community* that 
              this list affords everyone. THANK YOU SCOTT ARMSTRONG for making 
              this list possible. The generosity of so many has been far reaching; 
              to which, I am truly thankful! In particular, I extend my deepest 
              and sincerest thanks to Chris Brown, Frank Turco, and Ed Cortis. 
              Both Ed Erichson and Jason Johnson need to be mentioned; as well 
              as Herb Martin, who always keeps everyone going with his ongoing 
              contributions and clarifications. He answers the question(s) of 
              one, but his answers help the many... Thank you one and all very 
              much!! Your insights and directives definitely helped to point me 
              in the right direction... </p>
            <p>I must take my hat off to all those who have delivered to this 
              list comprehensive brain dumps... I can see now, having taken an 
              exam, that that is not an easy feat to delineate particulars, after-the-fact. 
              My brain was mush after all was said and done for me, and frankly 
              up until now, I could not think of many specifics from my exam. 
              (I'm sure Microsoft is smiling to know that)... I would like to 
              share the insights that I have gained from the exam that I wished 
              I had of known and/or heeded before the exam, that I hope will enlighten 
              others gearing up to doing their FIRST exam, but are not quite there 
              yet. I apologize in advance for: </p>
            <p>- any repetition I might have that others have already said in 
              the past, </p>
            <p>- not being able to delineate many exact *questions* that I got 
              on my test, </p>
            <p>- my verbosity in trying to outline things that I hope will give 
              others more insight than I had myself, </p>
            <p>- my rather rudimentary mail system which does NOT have such features 
              as TTF (true type fonts) and the ability to do such things as charts, 
              etc. </p>
            <p>Since my post is soooooooooo long, here is an outline of the *titles* 
              of what is to follow: </p>
            <p>1) Exam logistics </p>
            <p>2) Exam Philosophy </p>
            <p>3) Brain Dumps, per se </p>
            <p>4) Errors in Publications </p>
            <p>5) Concepts-Questions that seem to come up time and again </p>

            <p>Now for my thoughts, be them what they may... feel free to refute 
              or add to, especially those *veterans* at this MCSE game and the 
              gurus, out there, who keep all of us others, going... </p>
            <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
            </p>
            <p>1) Exam logistics: </p>
            <p>Most know - but just to be sure - the exam is 70 questions, time 
              limit: 90 min., passing grade: 714... </p>
            <p>How the exam is scored (which I found out afterwards): each question 
              is worth 1 mark (that is why there are no *part* marks for questions 
              with 2 and 3 answers). Once a tally of correct answers is counted 
              out of 70, then a mark out of 1000 is calculated. I believe the 
              reason for the mark out of 1000 is so that the mark would be able 
              to incorporate what otherwise would have to be a decimal (ie. 71.4% 
              vs 714). With simple mathematics your actual mark can easily be 
              transferred back into a mark out of 70 (i.e. 871 for me - is 61/70 
              = .871428...) </p>
            <p>If you've never taken an exam, I suggest you take the little tutorial 
              beforehand when you're about to sit down to do the exam. It doesn't 
              take away from the 90 minutes you have for the exam. The content 
              of the tutorial doesn't matter; (mine happened to be on space). 
              But it's the layout of the exam windows and moving from one screen 
              to another etc. that allows you to get comfortable with the environment. 
              This gives you 15 minutes before the actual test to just take a 
              few sighs (heavy ones, if needed) and to help you relax a little 
              before you jump right in. To me, it was really important that I 
              had no *surprises* re: the environment and how to get around that 
              might have thrown my concentration off. </p>
            <p>The exam is not as intimidating as some of the practise demos. 
              out there, because it told you whether to pick two or three answers, 
              it also had a square with an (X) for more than one answer required, 
              or a circle with a (.) for single answers. That aspect, you did 
              not have to guess (which is in some of the demos.). It also gave 
              you a list of all answers with marked and incomplete questions indicated, 
              when you had completed the test; similar to the demos. This way 
              you can go back to specific questions to review and/or complete 
              them. </p>
            <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
            </p>
            <p>2) Exam philosophy: </p>
            <p>Since there is a time limit, the way to approach writing the test 
              is: answer each and every question as best you can with your first 
              instinct as you go through them the first time, but mark any question 
              where you were questioning your judgement. Then, when you have completed 
              the test, go back to the marked questions for a second look with 
              the time you have remaining. Answering the question the first time 
              reading it assured that I had answered the question at least, just 
              in case I would have ran out of time before getting back to the 
              questions I was not sure of. Be sure to not rush through them the 
              first time, however. (I know if I rush through anything, I always 
              make silly errors on things I know the answers to). So I was wary 
              to be methodical and logical as I concentrated on each question; 
              at the same time, I did not doddle or stay very long on questions 
              I was unsure of. </p>
            <p>The clock is up in the righthand corner of the screen which counts 
              down the time you have left. Thus, keep an eye on it to pace yourself 
              accordingly. On the practise demos. I always had about 20-30 minutes 
              to check questions over, but on the final, I only had 15 minutes. 
              So I was glad I had marked the ones I needed to look at a second 
              time; and thus, I was able to quickly go back to them. </p>
            <p>I believe the Microsoft literature outlines the 12 categories that 
              questions are chosen from, but just to be sure, here they are: </p>
            <p>Planning and Installation </p>
            <p>Architecture and Memory </p>
            <p>Customizing and Configuring Windows 95 </p>
            <p>Editing User and System Profiles </p>
            <p>Networking and Interoperability </p>
            <p>Managing Disk Resources and Utilities </p>
            <p>Managing Printers </p>
            <p>Running Applications </p>
            <p>Mobile Services </p>
            <p>Microsoft Exchange </p>
            <p>Plug and Play </p>
            <p>Troubleshooting </p>
            <p>Remember, the exam questions (I believe) were chosen at random 
              (by a computer) from a poll of questions in the 12 categories. Therefore, 
              it is possible for you to get a very similar question testing the 
              same &quot;concept&quot; or related concept later on in your test 
              that would help you with a previous question. What I found to be 
              the most helpful with the questions was for me to quickly hone in 
              on the &quot;concept&quot; that the question was trying to test 
              and draw from my studying of that concept to be able to chose the 
              answer, accordingly. In fact, I believe I had 2 sets of questions 
              where two questions tested the same concept; (thus, the same answer) 
              was the only correct answer. One was on EMF spooling, and the other 
              DEFRAG.EXE. (My lucky stars were shining there). Remember there 
              is no rhyme nor reason to the choices of questions that make up 
              the test in each of the categories. It is all by random choice, 
              done by a computer, who would not take into account that two questions 
              are on the same concept, just different content; (unlike a person 
              making up the test). </p>
            <p>If a person made up the test, he/she would make sure that no two 
              questions tested the same concept within a category. Since I had 
              questions that were basically the same (just different wording); 
              which you may well get, as well, what I found to be the best for 
              me when I came to a second question of the like, I had strength 
              in my knowledge of the &quot;concept&quot; to know that the only 
              answer (i.e. DEFRAG) was the same as another question. At the time, 
              I reassured myself that a computer chose the questions, and not 
              a human, and so I didn't talk myself out of chosing the same answer 
              which one would logically do if one knew a *person* made up the 
              test. </p>
            <p>An excellent discussion about the Microsoft psychology behind the 
              exams is done by Wang Wei at his web site: www.ftq.com (among other 
              juicy tidbits there). There is truth in the idea that: If a *testee* 
              can get into the head of the *tester* than the *testing* of the 
              *test* will be a piece of cake. </p>
            <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
            </p>
            <p>3) Brain Dumps per se: </p>
            <p>Like anything, it takes being burnt once before one becomes conscious 
              of the danger... </p>
            <p>So too with the questions/answers that I accumulated from brain 
              dumps in my prep. for this exam. Many people have stated that: </p>
            <p>- DO NOT USE THE BRAIN DUMP AS YOUR SOLE SOURCE OF STUDYING; </p>
            <p>- DO NOT USE THE QUESTIONS TO *ROTELY* LEARN; </p>
            <p>- MANY BRAIN DUMP ANSWERS ARE WRONG, USE THEM ONLY TO POINT TO 
              CONCEPTS YOU YOURSELF SHOULD THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE TO AFFIRM THE 
              BRAIN DUMP ANSWER, OR TO DISCREDIT IT WITH THAT WHICH IS CORRECT. 
            </p>
            <p>However, I had to get *burnt* before I can now heed the above words 
              that have been spoken by so many, in so many ways. Let me delineate 
              through one of my test questions why I NOW believe wholeheartedly 
              in the above... </p>
            <p>My question (which seems to have been on many people's test) was 
              about the PCMCIA card (PC card, for short) and the *concept* of 
              its removal. My question was worded such that the card was in its 
              slot, *borrowed* by one who now wished to return it to its rightful 
              owner. The question asked (something like): in order to avoid any 
              error damage what should the person do: </p>
            <p>1) log off the network </p>
            <p>2) stop the PC card network adapter </p>
            <p>3) disable the PC card sockets from Device Manager </p>
            <p>4) do nothing - just remove the card </p>
            <p>A few brain dumps stated they had chosen, #4 - do nothing; a few 
              others had stated #3 - disable sockets... I, not having experience 
              with a PC card and not being able to actually get any *hands on* 
              with such a card before the test - wondered about this question 
              - so I went searching through my book resources (to no avail) and 
              to those (*in the know*) who actually have jobs that use these cards. 
              However, when I was asking those people, all I had at my access 
              was only two of the answers #3 and#4 from the brain dumps I had 
              - I did not know of #2, from other brain dumps - just because that 
              one was forgotten, I guess. So when speaking to people who use these 
              cards, I got an answer like, &quot;you'll see the icon of the PC 
              card on the task bar, and you click it. That causes a routine, methodical 
              shut down to occur. However, (my sources said), that although this 
              is not the std. procedure, I often just remove the card, without 
              anything happening... but, that is what happens in real life, and 
              not the std. procedure that should be followed.&quot; </p>
            <p>I was stumped on the test, because none of the answers *matched* 
              what I had been told through brain dumps and other people in the 
              field, and my question on the exam didn't state whether or not the 
              PC card was *hot docked* or not (which didn't help either). What 
              I went with was one of the brain dump answers (which I now believe 
              BOTH are wrong) and what I should have extrapolated from what I 
              was told from the person who was *my eyes* in the field, was that 
              clicking the icon actually &quot;stopped&quot; the network adapter 
              card itself; which was #2. Through this longwinded example, what 
              I hope you get is: </p>
            <p>Don't take the answers from brain dumps as the *sure thing*, but 
              use the &quot;concepts&quot; they present to hone in on the literature 
              about that concept... </p>
            <p>What I found the most helpful (after reading and taking notes from 
              the study guides and the New Riders text) was to *sophisticate* 
              my knowledge of the subject by taking the *concept* from the brain 
              dumps and focusing on the Resource Kit for that topic, for I found 
              it to be the only publication that didn't have errors in it... </p>
            <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
            </p>
            <p>4) Errors in publications: </p>
            <p>Please correct me if I am wrong, for I am still very much a *newbie* 
              to this MCSE pursuit... </p>
            <p>However, these are a couple of things I found in err in both the 
              MS Study Guides and in the New Riders Text for those out there (like 
              myself) who are just starting out and may not know these specifics 
              yet: </p>
            <p>i) Study Guides: </p>
            <p>pg. 163-164 has an outline of the IRQ's - with Com Port 1 having 
              IRQ 3, and Com Port 2 having IRQ 4... This is INCORRECT - it is 
              the exact opposite: </p>
            <p>Com Port 1 - IRQ 4 </p>
            <p>Com Port 2 - IRQ 3 </p>
            <p>(It's easy to remember, because it's always *odd* com port with 
              *even* IRQ, and vice versa - kinda like *magnets* attracting... 
              same concept, sort of....) </p>
            <p>There is one other one that for the life of me, I can't remember, 
              nor find the documentation on - I apologize - but be wary (everyone 
              makes mistakes)... So just because literature comes straight from 
              Microsoft and from it's own *Press*, doesn't mean that there are 
              no errors in them. That is why it's a good idea to have more than 
              one source of reference - if nothing else, as quality control... 
            </p>
            <p>Ah haaaaa - found the concept in my documentation (I just don't 
              have the page reference as to where the error lies in the study 
              guide)!!!... </p>
            <p>The Study Guide: outlines &quot;stack for applications is at Ring 
              0&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;stack for operating system stuff is at Ring 3&quot; </p>
            <p>This is INCORRECT - as stated on pg. 110 - Vol. 1 of the study 
              guide: </p>
            <p>Ring 0 is for critical operating system stuff and, </p>
            <p>Ring 3 is for user, application stuff </p>
            <p>ii) New Riders: </p>
            <p>Re: EMF spooling - in the chapter on Troubleshooting... </p>
            <p>There is a multiple choice question in the review section of that 
              chapt. (chapt. 12) page 510 that states: </p>
            <p>Choosing to return control after the first page is spooled ________ 
              wait time. </p>
            <p>a) increases </p>
            <p>b) shortens </p>
            <p>c) doesn't change </p>
            <p>d) eliminates </p>
            <p>The New Rider's book says the answer is (b) - shortens... </p>
            <p>But, looking at the Resource Kit with reference to the *concept* 
              this question is testing - that is, the specifics and benefits of 
              the EMF spooling, you'll find: </p>
            <p>Chapt. 17 - Optimizing Printing: pg. 573 </p>
            <p>Step 3 of 3 in &quot;defining spool settings for print performance&quot;: 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Select Spool Print Jobs So Program Finishes Printing Faster, 
              and then click one of the following: </p>
            <p>- Click Start Printing After Last Page is Spooled if you want to 
              return-to- application-time to be faster... more disk space required,... 
              increases total print time. The second rendering does not start 
              until the entire file is written to the EMF file... </p>
            <p>- Click Start Printing After Page Is Spooled if you want the second 
              rendering to take place simultaneously with the writing of the EMF 
              file...reduces total print time and disk space required, but it 
              increases the return-to-application time.&quot;* </p>

            </p>
            <p>********* </p>
            <p>As you can see from the above quote from the Resource Kit, the 
              New Rider answer is the exact opposite of what it should be - (I 
              believe) the correct answer should be (a) from the question in the 
              New Rider book... </p>
            <p>******** </p>
            <p>I took the time with the above *concept* to point out an error, 
              but also to give a case in point about using the resources, demo. 
              tests, and brain dumps to hone in on the *concept* to be familiar 
              with - rather than the actual exact question, in the exact wording 
              you happen to see it from others (including myself). </p>
            <p>From the above example, what you should get is that the *concept* 
              of EMF spooling *return-to-application time* is a major test item 
              that seems to be tested on almost every test, and knowing all the 
              particulars related to that concept, would put you in good standing 
              for any type of question that touched on it. </p>
            <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
            </p>
            <p>5) Concepts-Questions that seem to come up time and again: </p>
            <p>From the brain dumps I have seen and my own test, I believe these 
              areas/concepts seem to be tested on each and every test: </p>
            <p>CONCEPT SPECIFIC QUESTION OR RELATED THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR </p>
            <p>a) nibble mode - The question on my test (like others) was: </p>
            <p>&quot;What mode is required if a LPT1-device is PnP compatible? 
            </p>
            <p>Compatibility mode? </p>
            <p>ISA.... mode? </p>
            <p>Nibble mode? </p>
            <p>Serial mode? </p>
            <p>*Just know that *nibble mode* (in the area of printers and PnP) 
              relates to the fact that such a printer has bidirectional communication 
              with the computer... that is the printer can initiate on its own 
              and *tell* the computer that it is, for example, out of paper...(But 
              remember, don't quote me - read about it for yourself... nibble 
              mode pg. 596 - vol. 2 - study guides, and bidirectional communication 
              pg. 769 - Resource Kit) </p>
            <p>b) Win16Mutex </p>
            <p>Concept: WINdow 16-bit application MUTually EXclusive flag </p>
            <p>that Win95 sets whenever a program calls for a piece of code that 
              is *system* code that is 16-bit in nature. (16 bit system code is 
              called *non re-entrant* code) because whenever a process uses this 
              type of code no other process can use it. The *flag* prevents any 
              other program from using the 16 bit system code (See pg. 666-667) 
              Vol. 2 - Study Guide </p>
            <p>c) Effects of F-keys </p>
            <p>at Win95 boot F-8 = step-by-step confirmation of each device driver, 
              etc., loaded at boot (**this is the one I had on my test.) </p>
            <p>F-6 - safemode with network </p>
            <p>F-5 - safemode </p>
            <p>F-4 - starting previous version of MS-DOS </p>
            <p>These four above are the most common ones tested... but, I'd suggest 
              you look at all the F-keys in the Resource kit - just look up F-keys 
              in the index at the back - they are all listed... </p>
            <p>d)MSPSRV.EXE Key concepts related: The application that gives Win95 
              the capability to be considered as a NETWARE Print Server. With 
              this, a Win95 machine can despool print jobs </p>
            <p>e) Thunking Done by the KERNEL (a core component) - Thunking is 
              basically transforming 16 bit code UP to 32 bit code or vice versa. 
              Whichever is needed by the application at the time. Read all about 
              it in the Resource KIT PG. 986 and pg. 339 </p>
            <p>f) Docking as it </p>
            <p>relates to PC card Know the differences between hot, warm and cold 
              docking </p>
            <p>Vol. 1 - pg. 161-162 and PCMCIA card pg. 182 </p>
            <p>g) Enabling LFN </p>
            <p>(long filenames) </p>
            <p>in Netware Whatever the question in this area - just keep in mind 
              that: LFN can only be enabled via the use of/installation of &quot;OS/2 
              Namespace&quot; </p>
            <p>h) Log Files </p>
            <p>*There will always </p>
            <p>be at least one </p>
            <p>question regarding The most important thing about these is that 
              you can </p>
            <p>one of these: only *view* .TXT files - the .LOG file is binary 
            </p>
            <p>BOOTLOG.TXT and is used by the system to recover from a system 
            </p>
            <p>SETUPLOG.TXT crash... BOOTLOG.TXT used if problems at *boot*, </p>
            <p>DETLOG.TXT DETLOG.TXT used if problems/crashes during hardware 
            </p>
            <p>DETCRASH.LOG detection, SETUPLOG.TXT used BEFORE hardware is </p>
            <p>MODEMLOG.TXT detected, NETLOG.TXT used with crashes during network 
            </p>
            <p>NETLOG.TXT installation, MODEMLOG.TXT is a log file recorded when 
            </p>
            <p>DUN is being used, as is PPPLOG.TXT (pg. 808 and 914 - **Know them 
              cold** Resource Kit - for more *juicy* info. about them) </p>
            <p>i) Server Based Setup The key here is to use &quot;NETSETUP&quot; 
              (NO SWITCHES with it) </p>
            <p>j) Know DUN </p>
            <p>k) Know Remote Admin. *(especially for Netware) Key things to know: 
            </p>
            <p>Net Watcher (related to &quot;sharing remote resources&quot;, </p>
            <p>System Monitor (related to &quot;monitoring performance&quot; checking 
              for *bottlenecks* etc., </p>
            <p>Remote Registry Admin. (related to the use of System Policy Editor: 
              POLEDIT.EXE and/or Registry Editor: REGEDIT), </p>
            <p>System Agent </p>
            <p>l) SCANDISK </p>
            <p>m) DEFRAG.EXE There will always be a question on at least one of 
              these. So know them cold... triggering key concepts: </p>
            <p>ScanDisk: cross-linked files, lost clusters, fixing/repairing </p>
            <p>DEFRAG: optimizing speed of hard drive </p>
            <p>n) DriveSpace vs </p>
            <p>DriveSpace3 DriveSpace Compression max. (CVF - Compressed Volume 
              file size max. is 512 MB) </p>
            <p>DriveSpace3 (max. size: 2 GB) </p>
            <p>o) User Profiles </p>
            <p>p) System Policies User profiles stored: NT server: in user's home 
              directory </p>
            <p>*know these cold* Netware: in user's e-mail dir. </p>
            <p>System policies: (related to CONFIG.POL, .ADM templates and POLEDIT) 
            </p>
            <p>q) Exchange, Mail It's really important to be able to &quot;picture&quot; 
              what's postoffice and involved (steps) in setting these up and work 
              with them... **HANDS - ON (is crucial here)... </p>
            <p>r) Briefcase remember: synchronization of files and whatever is 
              last *updated* is what sends out to others. Thus, if 3 people have 
              shared files and the last person *updates*, then all others will 
              be updated other than the last person. Since files are *shared* 
              the *shared* copy is what is updated... </p>
            <p>s) Networking Know Netware cold... know everything there is to 
              know about &quot;Client for Netware Networks&quot; and &quot;file 
              and print sharing&quot; </p>
            <p>t) Note: Be aware that (a question I had) when hooking up to a 
              Netware server one has to have enabled: Client for Netware Networks 
              and *Novell* Netware? Network software (which implies older Netware 
              3.x (NETX) and 4.x (VLM) drivers, etc.) and File and Print Sharing 
              is NOT needed!! </p>
            <p>u) File and Print Sharing is required by the computer that you 
              are connecting to, so that you will be able to see the shared resources 
              (printer and/or files) on that remote computer or that computer 
              on the network... If you want to have your resources *shared* on 
              a network, you must enable File and Print sharing... </p>
            <p>v) Be wary of the *steps* of how to *customize and configure Win95* 
              (ie. Microsoft Client for Netware (or Microsoft) Networks and file 
              and print sharing are both enabled using the Control Panel then 
              clicking Network Icon... Hands on is crucial here... look up your 
              Network Icon, your Password Icon, your System Icon your Add/Remove 
              Programs, your Display Icon, and your Add/Remove New Hardware Icon 
              in the Control Panel (and play with them...) </p>
            <p>w) Know Point and Print with Novel Print Queues </p>
            <p>and remember that MS Client for Novel doesn't support NDS </p>
            <p>x) Know cold: Share level vs User level security </p>
            <p>y) Use NT server - user level security vs. Win95 when &quot;security&quot; 
              is an issue </p>
            <p>(Win95 by default installs share level security) </p>
            <p>z) MS-DOS memory properties - Chapt. 17 Vol 2 Study Guides - know 
              about Conventional memory, EMS, XMS, and DPMI </p>
            <p>I) Virtual Machines </p>
            <p>and address spaces </p>
            <p>and what happens with know everything there is to know here for 
            </p>
            <p>applications hanging all Win16, Win32, and MS-DOS apps. or producing 
              GPF's (general protection faults) </p>
            <p>II) Know TCP/IP, subnet mask, default gateway, DHCP, WINS, DNS 
            </p>
            <p>Remember: DHCP - dynamically assigns an IP address </p>
            <p>WINS - resolves a domain name to an IP address </p>
            <p>(If WINS is not available LMHOSTS does the job) **On my test </p>
            <p>DNS - Domain Name Service - it's job is its name... </p>
            <p>TCP/IP Utilities: know what these are used for - Ping, WINIPCFG, 
              TRACERT, Route, NETSTAT, etc. </p>
            <p>III) PnP - crucial components to know what they are for: bus enumerators, 
              resource arbitrators, PnP BIOS, Configuration Manager, Hardware 
              Tree </p>
            <p>IV) Registry know all the keys and what they are used for in relation 
              to each other </p>
            <p>REGEDIT modifies, remotely can use POLEDIT as well. </p>
            <p>V) LFN - know specifics of their maximums (256 character max. 260 
              characters max with path, specific characters (ie. a comma cannot 
              be used in a LFN), know how *aliases* are created to be able to 
              pick the correct name from a list ** I had this on my exam, etc. 
            </p>
            <p>VI) Ring 0 vs Ring 3 specifics - this one is always on! </p>
            <p>VII) Installation - Know Hardware and software requirements </p>
            <p>- Know specifics of the Installation Process (what happens at certain 
              stages of setup) (ie. previous version of Windows files do not get 
              modified until AFTER Win95 Installation is finished) </p>
            <p>- Know about Dual Booting with NT, DOS, and Troubleshooting </p>
            <p>(best to get further detail in Resource Kit to have ALL info. at 
              your access) </p>
            <p>VIII) Processes and threads - crucial concept: a process has at 
              least one thread executing at any one time *** had this one as well 
            </p>
            <p>IX) Multitasking </p>
            <p>Preemptive know all related to Win16, Win32, and MS-DOS </p>
            <p>and Cooperative </p>
            <p>(Forget about the Multimedia chapter) </p>
            <p>***Note: the list above, although somewhat lengthy - is not near 
              the full comprehensive delineation of all concepts... Be safe to 
              say.... these (I hope) help to point you in the right direction 
              - BUT, the bottom line is ONLY YOU CAN DO YOUR HOMEWORK TO KNOW 
              THIS STUFF... </p>
            <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
            </p>
            <p>6) Resources to use: (A Live-'n-Learn delineation of ORDER below:) 
            </p>
            <p>As I have stated above, I knew next to nothing about the *inner 
              workings* of Windows 95 before I began studying this stuff... Thus, 
              I was (and still am) very much a *newbie* with all of this. But, 
              managing a mark of 871 on the exam, I can safely say now (having 
              gone through it all) that: </p>
            <p>going through the MS study guides from cover to cover - may not 
              have been the best approach to take, first. In retrospect, as a 
              brand new *newbie* to the *tech* world, I would have used my time 
              and energy better had I done the following (parts A-D): </p>
            <p>A) FIRST, from the MS site (www.micosoft.com) downloaded (and/or 
              printed) the Prep. Guide for 070-063 Implementing and Supporting 
              Windows 95 which fully delineated all the concepts that were to 
              be tested on in the exam </p>
            <p>B) read and made notes on the New Rider's Text - &quot;MCSE Study 
              Guide - Windows 95&quot; </p>
            <p>AS THEY PERTAINED TO THE ABOVE CONCEPTS. I found this text to be 
              the easiest to read and understand for someone new to this field. 
              (Note: New Riders has TWO books out that are almost verbatum of 
              one another in this area - one is a newer publication than the other. 
              The newer publication had tear out sheets in the inside front cover 
              of the text that specificially specifies all the concepts and where 
              to find information about each one in that specific text. This publication 
              &quot;MCSE Training Guide: Windows 95&quot; is a white, hard covered 
              book. The other publication is soft covered and is navy blue in 
              colour. It is the older one (about 6 months earlier) and does not 
              include the *tear out sheets*. Much of these two texts are verbatum 
              of the other. But, having both texts you will get a whole other 
              barrage of multiple choice questions at the end of each chapter 
              from both texts.) The older text titled: MCSE Study Guide: Windows 
              95 and Networking Essentials, also has another 1/2 of the book specifically 
              dealing with Networking Essentials. </p>
            <p>Had I had this resource at my access before I read the study guides 
              - (which tend to be more technical in detail), I may not have been 
              so confused and overwhelmed at the beginning... It might (just might) 
              have started out as being something *fun* as well as a challenge, 
              instead of being an arduous chore that I felt it was with trying 
              to first *weed* through the MIRE of the tech. jargon of the study 
              guides. </p>
            <p>C) Then, AFTER the New Rider's text(s) I would have read the study 
              guides to hone my *tech.* knowledge slant to the concepts already 
              investigated... While reading/note taking from those guides, I would 
              have appreciated and understood the exercises that they entailed. 
              Since &quot;a picture is worth a thousand words&quot;, I would have 
              definitely done as many of the exercises in those guides as I could 
              manage with one computer and no network. I would have done them 
              as many times as I needed to not only *get a feel* for the ex. and 
              its associated concept, but I would have *a picture* in my mind 
              of the *steps* involved and what is actually seen on the screen 
              related therein. </p>
            <p>D) Next, using brain dumps and practise questions and asking *those-in-the-know*, 
              I would pinpoint the *concept* behind these extra resources and 
              I would go to the Resource Kit to fill in all the *loop holes* in 
              my knowledge base about those concepts - so to be firm in my mind 
              about those types of questions and what the true, correct answers 
              were. </p>
            <p>**Note: I found out the hard way with the Endeavor demo. practise 
              test that if you have MS Office shortcut icons on your desk top 
              - that demo won't run (or even install)... The Endeavor sees it 
              as a TSR running in the background and it conflicts with the setup... 
              so exiting out of (that is taking those icons off your desktop) 
              will allow the Endeavor to load without a hitch... </p>
            <p>*********************** </p>
            <p>With all of this though - nothing beats *HANDS ON*!! Without that 
              *picture* about how it works and what it looks like, without *playing* 
              with what little I had - I would not have mastered enough in many 
              of the areas to be able to be as successful as I was on the exam... 
              Near to the end when I was still getting 30-40% in the area of MS 
              Mail and MS Exchange on practise tests, I went so far as to set 
              up a mock post office on my machine to be able to *invision* what 
              it and Exchange Profiles actually looked like. Without this *hands 
              on* I would not have been able to DOUBLE/TRIPLE my score in these 
              areas on the final exam... [No wonder those in the field rarely 
              have to study as long, or as hard to achieve the same or better 
              than what I did]... </p>
            <p>(Don't get me wrong, I would like nothing better than to have a 
              job in this area... for it sure would make this goal of acquiring 
              MCSE certification a heck of a lot easier!!! However, I guess there 
              is something to say about the cliche: you can achieve anything - 
              if you put your mind to it!) </p>

              me by Scott A.) </p>
            <p>I wonder how many of you have actually taken the time to *read* 
              this monstrocity? If you have, I thank you... for it has taken me 
              ALL day and practically ALL night to write it...I hope it helps 
              at least someone out there... (it was the least I could do, for 
              all the help I received while *lurking* in the background until 
              I felt I had some kind of knowledge base to be able to contribute 
              in some small way, herein)... </p>
            <p>In closing, I welcome any comments, suggestions, additions/deletions, 
              that will further my knowledge herein... </p>
            <p>Also, Herb (should you have read this)... I believe &quot;courage 
              is drawn from knowledge&quot;... </p>
            <p>It's on to Networking Essentials for me now... I have the study 
              guides and the older New Rider's text at my access for this. Can 
              anyone suggest any other resources that I should look into using, 
              to best prepare for this one? </p>
            <p>Thanks again to one and all... it sure feels good to have that 
              first major one under my belt. </p>

            <p>8) WHEN TO BOOK YOUR TEST: </p>
            <p>I had originally booked my exam for the Tuesday before I actually 
              wrote... come the Monday (the day before my original test date) 
              I felt I was *getting there* in terms of being on top of the concepts 
              in prep. for the test; but, not quite there yet - So, I cancelled 
              my Tues. test... (Note: You have up to 7:00 pm EST the day before, 
              to cancel your test booking time without forfeiting your registration 
              fee...If you were not aware of this rule.) </p>
            <p>By Wed. that same week, I felt I was definitely very close to being 
              ready; and thus, rebooked my test for that Friday...(which was last 
              Fri. Aug. 1) </p>
            <p>What the bottom line point here is, if you book a test date, but 
              you really don't feel ready to write - chances are, you will not 
              do that well - so (if you can), postpone your test until you feel 
              you are &quot;in your comfort zone&quot; as another person stated 
              to me. That way you'll have better odds of passing... </p>
            <p>Why give Bill Gates more than his fair share by you failing and 
              throwing more money into HIS pocket?!... - This crime of failure, 
              because you took the test when you really were not ready, is &quot;one 
              of the most avoidable&quot; (kinda like the sayings for drinking 
              and driving). What the beauty of these tests is that you can write 
              them whenever YOU'RE ready - IT'S YOUR CHOICE... so choose wisely; 
              choose to write when you've done your homework and you're in your 
              &quot;comfort zone&quot;. That way, you'll keep more of YOUR money 
              in YOUR pocket (and not Billy's)! </p>

          <td>70-063　Passed with 842. Thought the test was going to be much simpler. 
            Studied Exam Cram for 95. Read most of Vol. 1 of Self-Paced training 
            Official curriculum. Took Transender tests A,B, and C until I got 
            perfect on them. Went through other brain dumps with 95 resource kit 
            to find the answers for my self. 
            <p>1. Plug n Play for Printers: </p>
            <p>Compatibility mode <br>
              Isa compliant mode <br>
              Nibble mode (right answer) <br>

              Running a Dos App in a full-screen. Also have a 16-bit app &amp; 
              32-bit app running. 16-bit App crashes. What can you do? Choose 
              2 (I thought the wording was lame, since you &quot;could&quot; a, 
              b and c) <br>
              Use Alt-Tab to toggle between Open items <br>
              Hit Clt-Alt-Del choose crashed app and end task <br>
              Continue working in DOS app. <br>

              95 PC. You want to make login to NT domain mandatory. <br>
              Use Policy Editor to check Computer\properties (don’t recall exact 
              wording) <br>
              Regedit HKEY_(Don’t remember which key) \logon <br>

              ***Sorry I don’t remember the exact question. I wanted you to be 
              ready for this concept. So know it! </p>
            <p><br>
              Improvements to 95 Swap file <br>
              a) Can span disks <br>
              b) File can increase of decrease, dependent on needs. (3.1 did this) 
            </p>
            <p>c) Can be stored on a compressed drive (true) </p>

              95 PC in Training Workgroup. Red and Blue Servers are part of the 
              Corporate Domain. Blue is PDC. How does user access/view files on 
              Red Server through Network Neighborhood?. <br>
              double click NN, double-click Blue then Red <br>
              double click NN, double-click Corporate, then Red. <br>
              Don’t remember (variant of A and B) <br>

            <p><br>
              ***The choices are not exactly what were on the test. However, the 
              question is. Not exact words, close though. Just know the concept. 
              PC part of workgroup. 2 servers part of Domain. How do you get to 
              the non-PDC server? </p>
            <p><br>
              Know the Rings and what runs where and if it uses multiple rings 
              it is Protected mode. I saw this on other dumps, but this question 
              was not straight forward or easy. It was a head scratcher because 
              of the way the question and answers were worded. I can’t for the 
              life of me remember how the question or the answers were worded. 
              Sorry. It was not a &quot;The Kernel runs in this ring&quot; type 
              question. </p>
            <p><br>
              Running DOS App in a window. Graphics aren’t working in the window. 
              You have already tried the disabling Fast ROM emulation and Dynamic 
              memory allocation and they haven’t fixed the problem. What should 
              you do? <br>
              a) Don’t remember <br>
              MS-DOS mode <br>
              Make sure that the mouse is NOT in exclusive mode <br>
              Something about bitmapped fonts <br>
              I saw a similar question on a dump that referred to fixing a mouse 
              when running DOS in a window problem.. No such luck on my test. 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              Easy question about which file to look at when Setup crashes during 
              Detection of devices. (DetLog.txt) YOU CAN’T read the Detcrash.log 
              it’s binary!!! If it says you are going to look at it to troubleshoot, 
              it has to be one of the .txt files. 95 uses the .log files. </p>
            <p><br>
              You have machines with the following configs NT 3.5 , OS/2, DOS 
              3.2, and one other. You are going to upgrade all to 95. Which machines 
              do you need to know more about before beginning installation. Choose 
              2 <br>
              Is NT 3.5 machine NTFS? (chose this one) <br>
              DOS 3.2 support for partitions greater than 32MB (chose this one) 
              <br>
              Is NT Server or workstation <br>
              OS/2 running something? Manager or something like that??? </p>
            <p><br>
              Two questions about LFN support on Netware. Load OS/2 name space 
              <br>
              Very strangely worded question on spooling and whether it made jobs 
              print faster or returned you to working faster. Not like question 
              on other dumps. Very bizarre wording. Something like, &quot;95’s 
              Faster printing in Applications, allows what? <br>
              Faster return to Apps <br>
              Print jobs complete faster <br>
              Question about what made printing better? EMF </p>
            <p><br>
              13. You have been assigned the task of backing up, the accounting 
              department’s data. Most of the files don’t change. About 24 MB change 
              per day. What is your backup strategy? </p>
            <p>Weekly Full’s to tape and incrementals to floppy <br>

              Joe has briefcase on his laptop. Agatha on her desktop. Joe’s BC 
              is on a floppy. He copies files from the shared network to his BC. 
              Agatha copies files to her BC. Both edit files. Joe doesn’t do an 
              update. Agatha chose Update all and hits OK on the default. Which 
              files get updated? <br>
              Joes <br>
              Don’t remember <br>
              Shared network files <br>
              Agatha’s BC and the Shared network files </p>
            <p><br>
              A question about threads. Answer was not as simple as &quot;An application 
              that consists of atleast a single <br>
              Thread. However, that narrowed the answer to one of two possible. 
              2 choices began with that. </p>
            <p><br>
              You are in explorer and want to arrange icons in a folder but the 
              option is grayed. What is the problem? <br>
              Details is on (something like that) <br>
              Icons are all shortcuts <br>
              Don’t remember <br>
              Some of files are hidden </p>
            <p><br>
              Easy question about Scandisk. You think your drive has a bad sector. 
              What should you do? <br>
              run defrag <br>
              don’t remember <br>
              run Scandisk Standard <br>
              run Scandisk Thorough (duh?) </p>
            <p><br>
              You want to load a 16-bit disk utility on your 95 PC. What should 
              you do before install. <br>
              do nothing, just load it <br>
              disable long file names <br>
              Don’t load it. <br>
              Don’t remember </p>
            <p><br>
              A question about optimizing your 95 PC. Concept was whether you 
              understand that it is best to unload unnecessary Network Protocols, 
              if you don’t need them. </p>
            <p><br>
              Question about NDIS 2.0. Just know that 2.0 is real mode and 3.1 
              supports 8 adapters and Plug and Play. </p>
            <p><br>
              I didn’t have one Point and Print question. Too bad, I studied so 
              well! :&gt; </p>
            <p><br>
              If I remember more I will post them. Good Luck!</p>

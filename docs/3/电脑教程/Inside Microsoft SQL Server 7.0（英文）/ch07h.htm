<P>This chapter examined the SELECT statement, the hallmark of the SQL 
language. Although we presented a fairly well-rounded treatment of SELECT, instead 
of focusing on basic queries, we looked at more subtle issues and SQL 
Server_specific capabilities.</P>

<P>We saw the issues of NULL and three-valued logic and learned why 
you must always consider these issues while you're properly formulating 
queries. In three-valued logic, an answer is TRUE, FALSE, or Unknown. If you 
must work with NULL values but you don't understand three-valued logic, 
you'll introduce bugs. You must fully understand three-valued logic or structure 
the database to avoid the use of NULL.</P>

<P>You must also understand NULL when doing JOIN operations, and 
we discussed issues concerning OUTER JOIN with several examples. Unlike a 
JOIN based on equality, the JOIN order for an OUTER JOIN is vitally 
important. We looked at search expressions such as LIKE and the issues of trailing 
blanks. We examined aggregate functions, again with a discussion of how you 
must understand NULL for proper use of these functions.</P>

<P>Finally, we looked at the CUBE and ROLLUP OLAP extensions to 
the standard GROUP BY clause for use with aggregate functions and 
considered some pragmatic tips and techniques for using these capabilities.</p>

<p>Although this chapter is far from a complete treatise on the SQL 
language, or on all SQL Server's capabilities, it demonstrates how to use SQL 
Server facilities and extensions to help you solve real-world problems and write 
better applications.</P>

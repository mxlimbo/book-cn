<P>Transact-SQL statements can be grouped together in batches, they can 
persist in the database, they can repeatedly execute as stored procedures, and they 
can be made to automatically fire as triggers. It is essential that you understand 
the differences between these functions and that you understand that their 
actions are not mutually exclusive.</P>

<P>Transact-SQL stored procedures can be quite complex, and they 
can become a significant portion of your application's source code. 
Fortunately, Visual Studio provides debugging support for SQL Server stored procedures.</P>

<P>Programming effectively with Transact-SQL also requires that you 
understand transactional topics, such as when transactions will be committed and 
when they can be rolled back. Since you'll likely be working in a multiuser 
environment, it is vital that you make the appropriate concurrency and 
consistency choices to suit the isolation level for your environment. Understanding 
isolation levels is also important for working with BLOBs in SQL Server using 
the special operators READTEXT, WRITETEXT, and UPDATETEXT. And 
no matter what task you are performing, it is important to realize that you 
must plan for various environmental options that will affect the behavior and 
semantics of your Transact-SQL code.</P>

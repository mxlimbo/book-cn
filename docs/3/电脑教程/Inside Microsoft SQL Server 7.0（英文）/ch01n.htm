<P>As expected, most of the team members took well-earned vacations after the December release. But they haven't stopped working on SQL Server. New capabilities are already well past the design stage, ready to be implemented. The development team is using the feedback from the beta forums and from the 
early users of the released version of SQL Server 7.0 to shape the future of Microsoft SQL Server.</P>

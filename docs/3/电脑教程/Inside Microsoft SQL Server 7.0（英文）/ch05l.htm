<A NAME="199"><H1>Summary</H1></A>
<P>A database is a collection of objects, such as tables, views, and stored 
procedures. Although a typical SQL Server installation will have many databases, it will 
always include the following three: <I>master</I>, 
<I>model</I>, and <I>tempdb</I>.<I> </I>(An 
installation will usually also include 
<I>pubs</I>,<I> Northwind</I>, and <I>msdb</I>.) Every database has its 
own transaction log; integrity constraints among objects keep a database 
logically consistent.</P>
<P>Databases are stored in operating system files in a one-to-many 
relationship. Each database has at least one file for the data and one file for the  
transaction log. You can easily increase and decrease the size of databases and  
their files. Databases and their files can grow and shrink either manually or  
automatically.</P>
<P>Now that you understand database basics, it's time to move on to 
tables, the fundamental data structures with which you work.</P>

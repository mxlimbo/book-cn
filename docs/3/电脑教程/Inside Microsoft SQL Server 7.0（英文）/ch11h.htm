<P>This chapter described server cursors in detail. Cursors are important tools 
that help you bridge the impedance mismatch between the set-oriented world of 
SQL Server and traditional record-oriented programming languages. When 
used properly, cursors are invaluable. When overused or used inappropriately, 
they can cause you to have a bad experience with SQL Server. SQL Server 
provides fully scrollable, updatable cursors. Other mainstream products typically 
provide only forward-only cursors; if they do allow full scrolling, they do not 
allow updates. The cursor capabilities in SQL Server are currently far richer than 
those of any other RDBMS. SQL Server cursors implement and go well beyond 
the functionality in ANSI SQL-92.</P>
<P>SQL Server has four main cursor models: static, keyset, dynamic, 
and forward-only. Cursors can be accessed via syntax used directly in 
Transact-SQL or via function calls used in the programming interfaces to SQL Server 
(ODBC, OLE DB, and so on). These two types of cursors are called Transact-SQL 
cursors and API server cursors. Transact-SQL cursors are typically used if a batch 
or stored procedure must do some row-by-row processing. API server cursors 
are often appropriate for scrolling applications. Cursors allow positioned 
updates and deletes. They can use optimistic concurrency control or locking (also 
known as pessimistic concurrency control). This chapter focused on the 
Transact-SQL syntax, but the key points are relevant no matter what cursor interface you 
use with SQL Server.</P>

<P>A software project's success depends on the experience and skill of the staff 
developing it. Your second SQL Server development project will be better than 
your first, no matter how smart you are, so don't make your first project one that 
will have thousands of concurrent users, manage tens of gigabytes of data, and 
replicate data to 10 other servers. If you tackle such an extensive project your 
first time out, you'll probably fail (or at least finish late and over budget). And 
although it's useful to have experience working with other systems and 
environments, you can't expect successful SQL Server development on the first try.
</P>

<P>The smartest companies start with a small, less-than-mission-critical 
system before moving many applications over to SQL Server. If management 
will not allow you the luxury of working on a &quot;practice&quot; system, you should at 
least try to augment your team with an experienced consultant or two. Look 
for someone who, at a minimum, is a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer 
(MCSE) who has taken both SQL Server exams for electives. In 1999, Microsoft is 
introducing a Microsoft Certified DBA (MCDBA) certification, which would 
indicate a similar level of qualification. This book, while it provides much 
useful information, can't replace other training. And skills such as database 
design, which transcend SQL Server specifically, are essential for a project's success.

<hr>The Microsoft course called &quot;Performance 
Tuning and Optimization of Microsoft SQL Server&quot; is worthwhile. 
Microsoft develops this course with input from the SQL Server 
development group. The course is available at Microsoft Certified Technical 
Education Centers (CTECs). For more information, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ctec" target="_window2">

<A NAME="157"><H1>Installing SQL Server</H1></A>

<P>Now that you understand all the preliminary considerations of installing 
and using SQL Server, you're ready to install the software. The actual mechanics 
of installation are simple the installation program starts automatically when 
you insert the CD into the drive; if it doesn't, you can initiate the installation 
by executing the autorun.exe program at the root of the SQL Server CD.</P>

<P>SQL Server 7 is installed using the InstallShield program, which is 
common to many Microsoft products. One advantage of using InstallShield 
instead of a specific SQL Server Setup program is that you can use the 
Add/Remove Programs options in the Control Panel to add or remove SQL Server 
components. In addition, InstallShield makes the process of running an 
unattended installation much easier than in previous versions. The lengthiest part of 
installation, along with the mechanics of copying the files, is building and 
configuring SQL Server's <I>master </I>database, in which SQL Server stores 
configuration information and information about all other databases, as well as many 
system stored procedures. If you accept the default character set and sort order, 
the installation program simply copies a mostly prebuilt 
<I>master </I>database from the files master.mdf and 
mastlog.ldf from the CD. These files are in a 
subfolder called Data, in the folder for the particular architecture of the machine 
you are installing on, either alpha or x86. After copying these files, the 
installation program does a small amount of additional configuration. A new 
installation using the default character set can typically take less than 15 minutes from 
start to finish (sometimes as little as 5 minutes, depending on the speed of 
your hardware and how much &quot;think time&quot; you need for the questions). If you 
do not accept the default character set or sort order, the installation program 
must reindex the entire <I>master </I>database. This reindexing is a totally automatic 
operation, but it can add 5 to 10 minutes to the installation time. The total installation 
time is still usually under 30 minutes.</P>

<P>When the installation program runs and upgrades a previous 
installation, it rebuilds all the system stored procedures to ensure that the most recent 
versions are installed. By default, installation does not actually visit or modify 
the data pages of user databases. When you upgrade from a prior version of 
SQL Server to SQL Server 7, you must perform an upgrade on any user 
databases you want to use with SQL Server 7. You can do this during the 
installation process, or you can upgrade databases one at a time after the installation 
is complete.</P>

<P>For more details on the installation, see the online documentation and 
the whitepaper entitled &quot;Installing Microsoft SQL Server 7.0&quot;on the companion CD.</P>

<P><A NAME="112"><B>Apartment-model threading</B></A> 
 Each thread is like an apartment that contains all objects created on the thread. These objects are unaware of objects in other apartments. This model provides thread security and eliminates conflicts in accessing global data from multiple threads by giving each apartment its own copy of global data.</P>

<P><A NAME="113"><B>API</B></A> 
 <I>See</I> <A HREF="#116">application programming interface</A>.</P>

<P><A NAME="114"><B>Applet</B></A> 
 Software components, similar to ActiveX controls, that are  written in Java. They provide dynamic features on a Web page. A software vendor might choose to create a product as a Java applet because its interpreted nature lets it run on several different hardware platforms.</P>

<P><A NAME="115"><B>Application</B></A> 
 A computer program used for a particular kind of work, such as word processing. This term is often used interchangeably with &quot;program.&quot;</P>

 A set of DLL or EXE files containing reusable functions that can be used in multiple applications.</P>

<P><A NAME="117"><B>Array</B></A>

<P><A NAME="118"><B>ASCII file</B></A> 
 American Standard Code for Information Interchange, a universally-recognized text file format. Also called a text file, text-only file, or flat file, an ASCII file contains characters, spaces, punctuation, carriage returns, and sometimes tabs and an end-of-file marker, but it contains no formatting information. This generic format is useful for transferring files between programs that could not otherwise understand each other's documents.

<P><A NAME="121"><B>Asynchronous</B></A> 
 Of an action, that executes separately from other events or actions. Asynchronous actions are performed in such a way that other actions can be performed simultaneously.

<P><A NAME="127"><B>Binary compatibility</B></A> 
 When you compile your project, Visual Basic only creates new Class and Interface IDs when necessary. It preserves the class and interface IDs from the previous version(s) so that programs compiled using an earlier version will continue to work.</P>

<P><A NAME="131"><B>By reference</B></A> 
 A way of passing the address of an argument to a procedure instead of passing the value. This allows the procedure to access the actual variable. As a result, the variable's actual value can be changed by the procedure to which it is passed. Unless otherwise specified, arguments are passed by reference.</P>

<P><A NAME="132"><B>By value</B></A> 
 A way of passing the value, rather than the address, of an argument to a procedure. This allows the procedure to access a copy of the variable. As a result, the variable's actual value can't be changed by the procedure to which it is passed.</P>

<A NAME="543"><H2>C</H2></A>

<P><A NAME="133"><B>Call-Back Method</B></A>

<P><A NAME="137"><B>Class ID</B></A> 
 A universally unique identifier (UUID) that identifies a type of COM object. Each type of COM object (item) has its CLSID in the registry so that it can be loaded and programmed by other applications.

<P><A NAME="138"><B>Class module</B></A> 
 The foundation of object-oriented program in Visual Basic. A .cls file; it contains functionality in the form of an object that can be used by other modules in an application. Each class module defines one type of object. 
Used to create objects that can be called from procedures within an application. Whereas a standard module contains only code, a class module contains both code and data -think of it as a control without a physical representation.</P>

<P><A NAME="139"><B>Client</B></A> 
 A computer that accesses shared network resources provided by a server. 
See also <A HREF="#409">workstation</A>.</P>

<P><A NAME="140"><B>Client object</B></A> 
 An object issuing a request for a service. A given object may be a client for some requests and a server for other requests. 
See also <A HREF="#351">server object</A>.</P>

<P><A NAME="141"><B>Client/server</B></A> 
 A network in which specific computers take on the role of a server, with other computers on the network sharing the resources.</P>

<P><A NAME="142"><B>Client-server architecture</B></A> 
 An arrangement used on local area networks that makes use of distributed intelligence to treat both the server and the individual workstations as intelligent, programmable devices, thus exploiting the full computing power of each.This is done by splitting the processing of an application between two distinct components: a &quot;front-end&quot; client and a &quot;back-end&quot; server. The client component is a complete, stand-alone personal computer (not a &quot;dumb&quot; terminal), and it offers the user its full range of power and features for running applications. The server component can be a personal computer, a minicomputer, or a mainframe that provides the traditional strengths offered by minicomputers and mainframes in a time-sharing environment: data management, information sharing between clients, and sophisticated network administration and security features. The client and server machines work together to accomplish the processing of the application being used. Not only does this increase the processing power available over older architectures but it also uses that power more efficiently. The client portion of the application is typically optimized for user interaction, whereas the server portion provides the centralized, multiuser functionality</P>

<P><A NAME="143"><B>Clipboard</B></A> 
 A temporary storage area in memory, used to transfer information. You can cut or copy information onto the Clipboard and then paste it into another document or program.</P>

<P><A NAME="148"><B>Collection</B></A> 
 In object-oriented programming, a class that can hold and process groups of class objects or groups of standard types. A collection class is characterized by its &quot;shape&quot; (the way the objects are organized and stored) and by the types of its elements.</P>

 An object that conforms to the COM standard. Clients deal with a component object only through a pointer to an interface.</P>

<P><A NAME="157"><B>Component object model (COM)</B></A> 
 An object model and a set of programming requirements that enable COM objects (also called Components or objects) to interact with other objects. These objects can be within a single process, in other processes, or even on remote machines. They can have been written in other languages, and may be structurally quite dissimilar. That is why COM is referred to as a binary standard - it is a standard that applies after a program has been translated to binary machine code.</P>

<P><A NAME="158"><B>Compound document</B></A> 
 A document within a container application that contains data of different formats, such as sound clips, spreadsheets, text, and bitmaps. Each piece of integrated data (or &quot;compound-document object&quot;) can exist within the compound document as a linked item or an embedded item.</P>

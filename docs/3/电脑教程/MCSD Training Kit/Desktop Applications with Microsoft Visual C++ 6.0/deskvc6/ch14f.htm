<A NAME="568"><H1>Lesson 5: Zero Administration for Windows</H1></A>

<p>Zero Administration for Windows (ZAW) is a Microsoft initiative designed to reduce
costs associated with using networked personal computers in a corporate environment.
The initiative's core set of technologies greatly facilitate the management of
users, software, and hardware within an organization, and are intended to eliminate the
need for an administrator to touch individual desktops on a network.</p>

<p>This lesson first presents a broad overview of ZAW. It then narrows its focus to
concentrate on ZAW's Windows Installer and Systems Management Server (SMS), two key
technologies that pertain directly to application deployment.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to:</b>


<ul>
<p><li> List the key features of the ZAW initiative.</li></p>

<p><li> Understand the basics of Windows Installer technology.</li></p>

<p><li> Understand SMS.</li></p>
</ul>


<b>Estimated lesson time: 15 minutes</b>
</blockquote></div>
</p>


<A NAME="569"><H2>Features of ZAW</H2></A>

<p>The ZAW initiative is part of the Microsoft Windows Client Strategy. ZAW
exists in some measure today within Windows NT Server 4, and is slated to
become a major part of Windows 2000. Some of the capabilities of ZAW are:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Automatic system update and application installation.</li></p>

<p><li> Persistent caching of data and configuration information.</li></p>

<p><li> Central administration and system lock-down.</li></p>
</ul>


<A NAME="570"><H3>Automatic System Update and Application Installation</H3></A>

<p>Software installation and maintenance is typically a labor-intensive and error-prone
process. Under ZAW, this process becomes much simpler through automation. When a system
component, device driver, or a new version of the operating system is available,
Windows can automatically update itself with the new components. The system can be
configured to boot into a minimal network configuration and check for any updates on
the Internet. If an update is found, the system can update itself without user
intervention.</p>

<A NAME="571"><H3>Persistent Caching of Data and Configuration Information</H3></A>

<p>Previous lessons in this chapter showed how installation programs must store state
and configuration information in the host registry. This method of storage can be
problematic in a networked and mobile environment, in which users who are primarily
away from their desks cannot access their applications or tools from different
locations.</p>

<p>Under ZAW, the local host's data can be automatically reflected to servers,
allowing users to log on to different computers on the network and work within the
context of their host computers elsewhere. This concept of data and configuration
information following a user to another computer is known as <i>persistent
caching</i>.</p>

<A NAME="572"><H3>Central Administration and System Lock-Down</H3></A>

<p>To prevent users from installing hardware and software on their computers as they
please, ZAW allows the network administrator to hide devices such as disk drives,
presenting the user with a single drive letter that represents their home
directory.</p>

<A NAME="573"><H2>The Windows Installer</H2></A>

<p>Perhaps the most important part of ZAW for application deployment is the
Windows Installer, which automates application installation across a network. The
Windows Installer offers many benefits over the conventional installation procedures
described in previous lessons, including the following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> The ability to automatically repair an installed application. For example,
if an application's component file is accidentally deleted, the Windows Installer
ensures that it is replaced when the application starts without user intervention.</li></p>

<p><li> Automatic installation on an enterprise-wide system with up to thousands of users.</li></p>

<p><li> Installation on demand, in which COM components are installed only when they are
first accessed by a client application. This process speeds installation and prevents
unnecessarily cluttering the disks of users who do not need the components.</li></p>
</ul>


<p>The Windows Installer is not a program but rather a set of services. Setup programs
will still exist under ZAW and will interact with the user as before. The Windows
Installer does not replace installer products like InstallShield. Rather, such products
will undoubtedly become even more important under ZAW as
installation becomes more intricate and technology more sophisticated. In the future,
InstallShield and other installer products will undoubtedly generate Setup programs
that incorporate the features and services of the Windows Installer.</p>

<A NAME="574"><H2>Systems Management Server</H2></A>

<p>Systems Management Server (SMS) is a ZAW service that continually inventories
computers on a network. The software and hardware detected on each computer is then
listed in an SQL database. Through SMS, a network administrator has instant access to
an up-to-date inventory of all computers on the network, without the expense and
disruption of a manual inventory.</p>

<p>SMS makes software deployment more efficient, because it provides query functions by
which an installation package can gain access to the SMS database. This process allows
a Setup program to automatically test each computer before deployment, and install only
on computers that meet a specified set of criteria. When it detects a computer that
does not qualify for installation, the Setup program can suggest to the administrator
any required changes, such as hardware upgrades.</p>

<A NAME="575"><H2>Zero Administration Kit</H2></A>

<p>ZAW is slated to be an integral part of Windows 2000, and many of its features are
already available for Windows NT 4.0. For installing ZAW on Windowsç‡¦T 4.0, Microsoft
provides the Zero Administration Kit, which you can download from:</p>

<p><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/zak/zakreqs.htm" TARGET="_window2">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/zak/zakreqs.htm</A></p>

<p>The entire Zero Administration Kit is a self-extracting file roughly 6 MB in size.
If you prefer to receive only the documentation, a separate file in Microsoft Word
format (415 KB) is also available for downloading.</p>

<A NAME="576"><H2>Lesson Summary</H2></A>

<p>The ZAW initiative is designed to reduce the labor and costs associated with
operating a Windows-based network. ZAW's features include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Automatic updating of both the operating system and application files. At regular
intervals, the system checks data sources such as Web sites, and as new files become
available, downloads them automatically.</li></p>

<p><li> Persistent caching, which allows a computer's data and configuration to
follow a user to other locations.</li></p>

<p><li> Central administration and system lock-down, allowing an administrator to protect
individual systems by hiding devices from users.</li></p>
</ul>


<p>The Windows Installer provides services to installation programs running on a
network, making application installation faster and more efficient in its use of disk
space. As a system service, the Windows Installer is at work even when no Setup program
is running. Because it is always active, the Windows Installer is able to repair
applications as needed by automatically replacing files that have been deleted or
moved.</p>

<p>SMS maintains an inventory of hardware and software on a network, storing the
information in an SQL database. Installation programs can query SMS for a
computer's configuration before deployment, and install only on workstations that
meet the application's requirements.</p>

<p><a name="1"></a><b>ActiveX</b> All component technologies built on Microsoft's COM, other than
OLE technology.</p>

<p><a name="2"></a><b>ActiveX control</b> An embeddable, reusable COM object that supports, at a
minimum, the <b>IOleControl</b> interface. ActiveX controls are typically created for
the user interface, but they also support communication with a control container.
Multiple clients can reuse these controls, depending upon licensing restrictions.</p>

<p><a name="3"></a><b>ActiveX control container</b> An application that supports the embedding of
controls by implementing the <b>IOleControlSite</b> interface. <i>See also</i> <a href="#33">control</a>.</p>

<p><a name="4"></a><b>ActiveX Template Library (ATL)</b> A set of compact, template-based C++ classes
that simplify the programming of COM objects. ATL provides the mechanism to use and
create COM objects.</p>

<p><a name="5"></a><b>aggregation</b> A composition technique for implementing COM objects. With
aggregation, a new object can reuse one or more existing objects. This reuse is
achieved by exposing one or more of the interfaces in the original object.</p>

<p><a name="6"></a><b>ambient property</b> A run-time property that is managed and exposed by the
container. Typically, an ambient property represents a characteristic of a form, such

application.</p>

<p><a name="10"></a><b>assertion</b> A Boolean statement in a program's debug version that tests a
condition that should evaluate as true, provided the program is operating correctly. If
the condition is false, an error has occurred; thus, the program will typically issue
an error message that gives a user the option to abort the program, activate the
debugger, or ignore the error.</p>

<p><a name="11"></a><b>asynchronous operation</b> In programming for Windows, a task that proceeds in the
background, allowing the thread that requested the task to continue to perform other
tasks.</p>

<p><a name="18"></a><b>CGI</b> <i>See</i> <a href="#28">Common Gateway Interface</a>.</p>

<p><a name="19"></a><b>child window</b> A window that has the WS_CHILD or WS_CHILDWINDOW style, and is
confined to the client area of its parent window, which initiates and defines the child
window. Typically, an application uses child windows to divide the client area of a
parent window into functional areas.</p>

<p><a name="20"></a><b>class factory</b> An object that creates one or
more instances of an object identified by a given CLSID. A class factory object
implements the <b>IClassFactory</b> interface. A class factory is one of the most

<p><a name="24"></a><b>CLSID</b> A universally unique identifier (UUID) that identifies a type of COM
object. Each type of COM object has its CLSID in the registry
so that other applications can load and program the CLSID. For example, a spreadsheet
might create worksheet items, chart items, and macro-sheet items. Each of these item
types has its own CLSID that uniquely identifies the item type to the system.</p>

<p><a name="25"></a><b>collection class</b> In object-oriented programming, a class that can hold and
process groups of class objects or groups of standard types. A collection class is

interface, referred to as the <i>source,</i> and the object implementing the interface,
referred to as the <i>sink</i>. The connection point implements an outgoing interface
that can initiate actions, such as firing events and change notifications, on other
objects. By exposing a connection point, a source allows sinks to establish connections
to the source.</p>

<p><a name="32"></a><b>containment</b> A composition technique for
accessing one or more COM objects via a single interface. Containment allows one object
to reuse some or all of the interface implementations of one or more other objects. The
outer object manages requests to other objects, delegating implementation when it uses
the services of one of the contained objects. <i>See also</i> <a href="#5">aggregation</a>.</p>

expands into the declarations and calls needed
to expose methods and properties for Automation. The dispatch map designates internal
and external names of object functions and properties, as well as data types of
function arguments and properties.</p>

<p><a name="53"></a><b>document object</b> An object that defines, stores, and manages an
application's data. When the user opens an existing or new document, the
application framework creates a document ob-ject to manage the data stored in the

specified maximum value. A semaphore's state is signaled when its count is greater
than zero and nonsignaled when its count is zero. The semaphore object is useful in
controlling a shared resource that can support a limited number of users. This object
acts like a gate that counts the threads as they enter and exit a controlled area, and

number.</p>

<p><a name="142"></a><b>serialization</b> Also referred to as object persistence. In MFC, the process of
writing or reading an object to or from a persistent storage medium, such as a disk
file. The basic idea of serialization is that an object should be able to write its
current state, usually indicated by the value of its member variables, to persistent
storage. Later, the object can be recreated by reading, or deserializing, the
object's state from storage.</p>

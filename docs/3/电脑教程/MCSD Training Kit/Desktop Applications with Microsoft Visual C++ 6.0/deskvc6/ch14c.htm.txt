<A NAME="547"><H1>Lesson 2: Using InstallShield</H1></A>

<p>As a shortcut for developing setup and uninstall programs, the Professional and
Enterprise Editions of Visual C++ include the SDK edition of Stirling Software's
InstallShield. (The Learning and Standard Editions don't include this tool, but you
can purchase it separately. If you don't have access to this tool, you can still
benefit from reading the information in this lesson.)</p>

<p>This lesson introduces the InstallShield toolkit, which enables you to write a
script that specifies the steps you want performed during installation. InstallShield
then builds a Setup program that installs your product on a user's computer.</p>

<p>With InstallShield, you don't have to write a separate script for
uninstallation. InstallShield creates an uninstall program named Uninst that reads a
log file created during the setup process. The log file enables Uninst to reverse the
steps performed during setup.</p>

<p>InstallShield creates a Setup program for your project that looks and acts much like
the Setup program you used to install Visual燙++. Microsoft creates Setup programs for
many of its products using InstallShield.</p>

<p>An exhaustive description of InstallShield is beyond the scope of this lesson, which
is intended only as an introduction to the product. Setup programs today can be
surprisingly sophisticated, capable of handling a wide variety of file types,
accommodating different operating systems, and handling a bewildering number of
potential problems. They must work not only with traditional distribution media such as
disks and CD-ROMs, but also across networks and the Internet. InstallShield is not
difficult to use, but it offers such a wide array of
options designed to address installation issues that gaining familiarity with it can
take a while. Furthermore, complete control over the product requires learning its
scripting language, InstallScript. As with most programs, practice is the only true
teacher.</p>

<p>InstallShield treats your Setup program as a <i>project</i>, the same term applied
to normal Visual C++ projects. To avoid confusion, this lesson employs the phrases <i>
Setup project</i> or <i>installation project</i> when referring to work done inside
InstallShield, and <i>application project</i> when referring to the Visual C++ files
that the Setup program deploys in their compressed state.</p>

<p>
<div class="sidebar"><blockquote>
<b>After this lesson, you will be able to:</b>


<ul>
<p><li> Configure InstallShield to run as a Visual C++ tool.</li></p>

<p><li> Step through the InstallShield tutorial.</li></p>

<p><li> Create a simple Setup program using InstallShield.</li></p>
</ul>


<b>Estimated lesson time: 15 minutes</b>

<A NAME="548"><H2>Installing InstallShield</H2></A>

<p>If you selected InstallShield when installing Visual C++, the Visual C++ <b>
Tools</b> menu already contains a command for starting the InstallShield Wizard.
However, if the command does not appear in the Visual C++ <b>Tools</b> menu and you are
not using the Learning or Standard Edition of Visual C++, you should install
InstallShield now.</p>

<p><li> <b>To install InstallShield</b></li></p>

<ol>
<p><li> Place the Visual C++ CD-ROM #1 in your CD-ROM drive.</li></p>

<p><li> In Control Panel, start the Add/Remove Programs applet.</li></p>

<p><li> Browse to the IShield folder on the CD-ROM and double-click <b>Setup</b>.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>The Setup program installs InstallShield, places a command on the <b>Start\
Programs</b> menu, and adds the <b>InstallShield Wizard</b> command to the Visual燙++
<b>Tools</b> menu.</p>

<A NAME="549"><H2>Running the InstallShield Tutorial</H2></A>

<p>The InstallShield program provides a good tutorial that demonstrates how to develop
a sample Setup program for the familiar Notepad utility. The tutorial walks you through
various steps, eventually creating a Setup program that places an icon and command on
the <b>Programs</b> menu. When selected, the command
invokes Notepad.</p>

<p>The tutorial shows how InstallShield categorizes your application files into
different groups, allowing you to work on different parts of an installation project.
Each group contains files with similar characteristics, such as system DLLs,
executable files, and Help files.</p>

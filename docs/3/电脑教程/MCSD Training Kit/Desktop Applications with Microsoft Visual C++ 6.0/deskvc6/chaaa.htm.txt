<ol>
<p><li> What is MSF?</li></p>

<p><b>MSF is a collection of models, principles, and practices that helps organizations
become more effective in their creation and use of technology to solve business
problems.</b></p>

<p><li> Which models are most directly related to the development of business&#8211;oriented
software solutions?</li></p>

<p><b>Most directly related to the development of business-oriented software solutions
are the Team Model, Process Model, Application Model, and Design Process Model.</b></p>

<p><li> What is the main focus of the logical design perspective?</li></p>

<p><b>The logical design perspective views the solution from the perspective of the
project team.</b></p>

<p><li> How might a client/server application implement the three tiers of an application?</li></p>

<p><b>A client/server application might implement the three tiers of an application by integrating the business rules into either the data source tier (a thin client/fat server model) or into the client tier (a fat client/thin server
model).</b></p>

<p><li> What are some of the benefits that MFC offers to developers?</li></p>

<p><b>Some such benefits include the ability for developers to quickly and easily generate applications, libraries, and software components. MFC enables rapid
development in all aspects of Windows programming including user interface, Internet,
component technology, and database access development&#8212;all without sacrificing
programming freedom and flexibility. In addition, MFC provides the AppWizard, a
step-by-step visual tool that allows developers to quickly and easily generate frameworks to set
up a basic application structure, and to generate code to implement fundamental
application behaviors.</b></p>

<p><li> You are writing an MFC application that will allow your network administrator to
manage user accounts on an NT network. Which libraries should you install?</li></p>

<p><b>You should install the MFC libraries for Unicode (either shared or static,
according to how the application will be distributed). Internal strings used by Windows
NT, such as user account names and device names, are Unicode strings, so you will need
to install the Unicode libraries if you are planning to write programs that retrieve
and manipulate these strings directly.</b></p>

<p><li> What kind of data can you access through an OLE DB provider?</li></p>

<p><b>OLE DB is capable of dealing with any type of data regardless of its format or storage method. For instance, OLE DB can access data that resides in an
Excel spreadsheet, in text files, or even on a mail server such as Exchange.</b></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="585"><H3>Chapter 2 Review Questions</H3></A>

<ol>
<p><li> What project configurations are created for you automatically by the MFC
AppWizard?</li></p>

<p><b>AppWizard automatically creates the Debug and Release configurations.</b></p>

<p><li> Where, in the AppWizard, can you configure features of the application windows?</li></p>

<p><b>You can configure features of the application windows on the </b>Window Styles<b> tab of
the </b>Advanced Options<b> dialog box in Step 4 of the AppWizard.</b></p>

<p><li> What kinds of help are available from the Visual C++ IDE?</li></p>

<p><b>The Visual C++ IDE provides help from the MSDN library, an essential reference for
developers, containing more than a gigabyte of technical programming information.</b></p>

<p><li> What can you set on the C/C++ tab of the <b>Project Settings</b> dialog
box?</li></p>

<p><b>From the C/C++ page of the </b>Project Settings<b> dialog box, you can set compiler settings and language features such as calling conventions, processor-dependent settings, optimizations, and preprocessor definitions.</b></p>

<p><li> Why might you need to use the <b>Get Latest Version</b> feature of
Visualç‡¬ourceSafe?</li></p>

<p><b>You might need to use the </b>Get Latest Version<b> feature to make sure that you have the
latest version of all files in a project. You might also use the </b>Get Latest Version<b>
command to copy the current versions of the project source files to your working
folder, in case you make changes that render your code incompatible with other recently
edited modules.</b></p>

<p><li> Under what circumstances might you use the Visual SourceSafe <b>Merge</b> facility?</li></p>


<p><b>You might use the </b>Merge<b> facility to merge the changes made to different versions of the same file to recreate a single version of the file.</b></p>
</ol>

<A NAME="586"><H3>Chapter 3 Review Questions</H3></A>

<ol>
<p><li> When developing an MFC application, under what circumstances might you need to
call the Win32 API directly?</li></p>

<p><b>When developing an MFC application, you might need to call the Win32 API directly when you need to access system functionality at a fairly low
level. For example, if you were developing a utility to modify user accounts on a
network, you would be required to use the Win32 networking functions because no MFC classes that provide access to Windows NT network management functions exist.</b></p>

<p><li> What services are provided by the <b>CObject</b> class?</li></p>

<p><b>The </b>CObject class<b> provides serialization (loading and saving data objects to a
agnostic and debugging support (validations and
dumps), and compatibility with collection classes.</b></p>

<p><li> Why would you use an MFC extension DLL?</li></p>

<p><b>Because MFC extension DLLs implement reusable classes derived from existing MFC
classes, you would use an MFC extension DLL to provide an &quot;extended&quot; version
of MFC.</b></p>

<p><li> Which member function of which MFC class implements the application message
loop?</li></p>

<p><b>The </b>Run()<b> member function of the </b>CWinApp<b> MFC class implements the application
message loop.</b></p>

<p><li> What type of classes can implement message maps?</li></p>

<p><b>Classes derived from the </b>CCmdTarget<b> class can implement message maps.</b></p>

<p><li> Name four categories of Windows messages that can be handled by message
maps.</li></p>

<p><b>Four categories of Windows messages that can be handled by message maps are Windows
messages, command messages, user interface update command messages, and control
notification messages.</b></p>

<p><li> What is the function of a document template object?</li></p>

<p><b>A document template object associates a document class with a group of resources (such as menus and icons), a frame window, and a view.</b></p>

<p><li> Which MFC class encapsulates GDI drawing functions?</li></p>

<p><b>The MFC </b>CDC<b> class encapsulates GDI drawing functions.</b></p>

<p><li> How do you ensure that the client area of your application's main window
always displays an up-to-date picture of the application data?</li></p>

<p><b>To ensure that the client area of your application's main window always displays an up-to-date picture of the application data, you should call the
document's </b>UpdateAllViews()<b> member function whenever a document's data changes in a way that will affect its visual representation.</b></p>

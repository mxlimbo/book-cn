<A NAME="8"><H2>Conventions Used in This Book</H2></A>

<P>Before you start any of the lessons, it is important that you understand the terms and notational conventions used in this book.</P>

<A NAME="9"><H3>Notational Conventions</H3></A>

<ul>
<p><li><i>Italic </I>in syntax statements indicates placeholders for variable information. <I>Italic</I> is also used for book titles.</li></p>

<p><li>Names of files and folders appear in Title Caps. Unless otherwise indicated, you can use all lowercase letters when you type a file name in a dialog box or at a command prompt.</li></p>

<p><li>File name extensions appear in all lowercase.</li></p>

<p><li>Names of folders appear in initial caps. Unless otherwise indicated, you can use all lowercase letters when you type a folder name in a dialog box or at a command prompt.</li></p>

<p><li>Acronyms appear in all uppercase.</li></p>

<p><li><code>Monospace</code> type represents code samples, examples of screen text, or entries that you might type at a command prompt or in initialization files.</li></p>

<p><li>Square brackets [ ] are used in syntax statements to enclose optional items. For example, [<I>filename</I>] in command syntax indicates that you can choose to type a file name with the command. Type only the information within the brackets, not the brackets themselves.</li></p>

<p><li>Braces { } are used in syntax statements to enclose required items. Type only the information within the braces, not the braces themselves.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="10"><H3>Keyboard Conventions</H3></A>

<ul>
<p><li>A plus sign (+) between two key names means that you must press those keys at the same time. For example, &quot;Press ALT+TAB&quot; means that you hold down ALT while you press TAB.</li></p>

<p><li>A comma ( , ) between two or more key names means that you must press each of the keys consecutively, not together. For example, &quot;Press ALT, F, X&quot; means that you press and release each key in sequence. &quot;Press ALT+W, L&quot; means that you first press ALT and W together, and then release them and press L.</li></p>

<p><li>You can choose menu commands with the keyboard. Press the ALT key to activate the menu bar, and then sequentially press the keys that correspond to the highlighted or underlined letter of the menu name and the command name. For some commands, you can also press a key combination listed in the menu.</li></p>

<p><li>You can select or clear check boxes or option buttons in dialog boxes with the keyboard. Press the ALT key, and then press the key that corresponds to the underlined letter of the option name. Or you can press TAB until the option is highlighted, and then press the spacebar to select or clear the check box or option button.</li></p>

<p><li>You can cancel the display of a dialog box by pressing the ESC key.</li></p>

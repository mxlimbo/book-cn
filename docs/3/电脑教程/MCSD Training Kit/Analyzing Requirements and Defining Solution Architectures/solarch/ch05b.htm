<A NAME="249"><H1>Overview of Project Envisioning</H1></A>

<p>A project's success depends on the ability of project team
members and the customer to share a clear <i>vision</i> of the
project's goals and objectives. Usually, these goals and objectives
stem from the mission or purpose of the organization. The concept of
vision has broad-reaching implications beyond the implementation of
technology, and effectively aligning a project with an
organization's mission requires careful thought.</p>

<p>Before a team begins any other part of a project, it must develop a
vision that describes a unified aim and direction for the project.
During the process of developing the vision, the team must have the
freedom to brainstorm about the elements of a perfect project and how
it relates to the business needs of the organization. Otherwise,
members of the team who are well aware of business constraints may be
discouraged from using their creative talents and abilities to dream of
the &quot;ideal&quot; goals and objectives for success.</p>

<p>Although a project's vision definition may go through iterative
cycles of refinement, by the end of the envisioning process, those
directly and indirectly responsible for the project must have accepted
the vision and be able to communicate it. The process of defining and
accepting the vision helps team members and the customer clarify the
project's goals and objectives, and provides everyone involved with
a sense of purpose and direction that they can carry with them to
project completion. Without a properly defined vision, it is simple to
become lost in project details.</p>

<p>A properly defined vision promotes success by giving the team a
clear path for the future. In practice, the power of a shared vision
must be harnessed. As shown in Figure 5.1, MSF does this by including
an <i>Envisioning Phase</i> in the MSF Development Process Model, and
defining the vision created in this phase primarily for this
version's product release. A long-term vision for all versions of
the product can also be developed to provide guidance for future
releases. Each incremental product release represents a vision of a
specific aspect of the long-term vision, also called a <i>product
scope</i>, which is used to measure success by tying project and
organization goals to an achievable outcome.</p>

<P><!-- caption --><b>Figure 5.1</b> <i> MSF Development Process Model Envisioning Phase</i><!-- /caption --></P>

<p>MSF uses a <i>Vision Document</i> to help define and quantify the
Envisioning Phase. The Vision Document details the following
elements:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Project vision</li></p>

<p><li> Project scope</li></p>

<p><li> Background information</li></p>

<p><li> Business requirements</li></p>

<p><li> Project requirements</li></p>

<p><li> Deliverables</li></p>

<p><li> Risks</li></p>
</ul>



<p>In this chapter, we describe the Envisioning Phase and the Vision
Document, as well as the relationships between its interconnected
components. Keep in mind that throughout the Envisioning Phase, the
team uses documents to communicate among its members. However, this
documentation is not the end result of envisioning; communication is
the goal. Documents are merely some of the tools used to reach that end
result.</p>

<p>The Envisioning Phase is complete when the team reaches the Vision
Approved Milestone. This milestone is the point where the project's
team and stakeholders jointly approve the product's vision and
determine to move into the planning process.</p>

<A NAME="250"><H2>Why Establish a Vision?</H2></A>

<p>Developing a product without a vision is like sailing a ship without
a compass: The ship is going somewhere, but where? Do the crew members
know where they're going? Are the passengers going where they paid
to go?</p>

<p>Although developing a vision for a product is absolutely essential,
it's a step in product development that is all too often skipped or
undervalued. Most people involved in application development projects
have had much more practice doing the tasks necessary to release a
product than they have in creating a vision for it. Many find the idea
of a product vision unstructured or vague and of little value,
especially those new to product development. However, it's
important to understand that envisioning:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Serves as an early form of planning.</li></p>

<p><li> Establishes clear communication and consensus from the beginning
of the project.</li></p>

<p><li> Helps the team pull different perspectives into a common
understanding.</li></p>

<p><li> Provides the basis for future planning.</li></p>

<p><li> Identifies what the customer and key stakeholders deem essential
for success.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>At a time when more and more organizations are focusing on
&quot;delighting the customer,&quot; building a vision is more
important than ever. It is the first and most critical step in
development, because it describes where the project team is headed and
the landscape everyone is traveling in. In an interview with Laura
Litwack, Steve Sinofsky, at the time Vice President for Microsoft
Office products, noted:</p>

<blockquote><i>Visions are important because they help a team make
decisions at the right level&#8212;closest to where the issue is. In
that sense, a good vision statement is a tool that empowers the entire
organization to work together to build a great product. If there are 10
people working on a project, you can always ask each other everything
and there is a shared understanding of what to do. When there are 1,000
people working on a project, you need a way for people to make
decisions that move the whole project in the same direction without
each person having to talk to all 999 others.</i></blockquote>

<p>A solid vision builds trust and cohesion among team members,
provides perspective, improves focus, and eases decision-making. A
common vision fuels the highest team performance and provides the
following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Clarification</b> Team members need to know what they are
trying to build before they can build it. In addition, they need to
understand why Program Management, Product Management, and the customer
decided to include some features and not others. A vision details not
only what will be done, but also what won't.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Prioritization</b> There is never enough time to include all
the features and elements a team can dream up. During the product's
life cycle, the team needs criteria to guide them through a host of
decisions. Development decides how to code the specification and how to
lay a foundation for future versions of the product. Testing
prioritizes bugs. User Education decides which features to emphasize
and how to explain them. Program Management works with product
designers to decide how the features should work and how the user will
interact with each feature. To make appropriate decisions, the team
needs to understand not only what and why, but also in which order. A
good vision provides the necessary priority framework for making future
decisions.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Integration</b> The vision of this product must complement and
support the vision and functionality of other products in the
organization. Many other products may serve the same customer and users
as this one, and some may have overlapping feature sets. Any long-term
duplication of features across different products should be examined to
ensure that it makes good business sense.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Future investment</b> Not only should the vision guide
today's product, but it should lay a foundation for the future. For
example, if Development knows that business-to-business commerce will
be included in the next version of the product, Internet delays and low
bandwidth issues can be taken into account in the architecture for this
version. This foresight can save time in the future.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="251"><H2>Pitfalls</H2></A>

<p>We have been using MSF and the MSF Development Process Model for
some time now, and have found that it has increased both our team's
productivity and customer satisfaction. But there are hazards. In this
section we describe some of the pitfalls our team has occasionally
fallen into during the Envisioning Phase.</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Pitfall #1: Not taking advantage of the dynamic nature of the
MSF Development Process Model</b> Initially, we went through the
envisioning process as if it were set in stone, not daring to deviate
from the MSF documentation. However, as our team began to mature, we
learned to tailor the process and its deliverables to our
organization's needs and strengths. The Envisioning Phase is a
tool, not a law, for encouraging communication and establishing
expectations.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Pitfall #2: Not being thorough in the Envisioning Phase</b> We
needed to be disciplined about working through the entire envisioning
process before beginning a project. With time and budget constraints,
it is tempting to begin a project using traditional methods and only
use envisioning when it's convenient. We needed to resist that urge
and stay with the framework, because the details of the Envisioning
Phase are critical to the success of any project.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Pitfall #3: Not understanding how the Envisioning Phase
establishes a foundation for complex concepts</b> Envisioning encourages
the project team to sort through information and ideas that may be
difficult to fathom. This process helps to ensure that the Envisioning
Phase is as easy as possible to implement in order to accelerate and
streamline the ongoing process of development.</li></p>
</ul>

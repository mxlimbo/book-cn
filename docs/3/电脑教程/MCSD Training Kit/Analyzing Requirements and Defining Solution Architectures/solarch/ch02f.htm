<A NAME="124"><H1>MSF Application Model for Development</H1></A>

<p>The MSF Application Model for Development (MSF Application Model)
provides a multi-layer services-based approach to designing and
developing software applications. MSF views an application at a logical
level as a network of cooperative, distributed, and reusable services
that support a business solution. Application services are units of
application logic that include methods for implementing an operation,
function, or transformation. These services should be accessed through
a published interface, driven by the interface specification, focus
value toward the customer not the provider, and map directly to
actions. As mentioned in <A HREF="ch01a.htm">Chapter 1</A>, the MSF Application Model describes
applications as using three services: user, business, and data. These
services allow for parallel development, better use of technology,
easier maintenance and support, and flexibility in distributing the
application's services. These user, business, and data services can
reside anywhere in the environment from a single desktop to servers and
clients around the world.</p>

<A NAME="125"><H2>User Services</H2></A>

<p>User Services are logic that provides an application with its user
interface. The user interface is not necessarily visually conveyed; it
can be programmatic, as the user may be a person or another
application. User Services seek to hide or isolate information views
from the application's user interface structure.</p>

<A NAME="126"><H2>Business Services</H2></A>

<p>Business Services are logic that controls the sequencing and
enforcing of business rules. These services provide transactional
integrity as well as transform data into information through the
application of business rules.</p>

<A NAME="127"><H2>Data Services</H2></A>

<p>Data Services are logic that provides the lowest visible level of
detail used to manipulate data. Data Services seek to maintain
consistent application data, as well as separate the application's
design and implementation from the location and structure of the data
store. Most Data Services provide the ability to define, create, read,
update, and delete data.</p>

<p>The MSF Application Model establishes the definitions, rules and
relationships that form the actual structure of an application. It is
designed to influence the approach the team takes for building
applications.</p>

<A NAME="132"><H1>Team Model vs. Hierarchical Model</H1></A>

<p>Most developers fondly remember the first time they saw &quot;Hello
World&quot; displayed on their screen&#8212;an indication that their
first programming effort was successful. Although many of us relish the
memory of that rather simplistic achievement, the fact is that the
complexities of enterprise applications and systems make them nearly
unmanageable. In addition, the deployment of those applications and
systems to hundreds of desktops at many different sites has
significantly expanded the scope of the development process.</p>

<p>As we noted in <A HREF="ch01a.htm">Chapter 1</A>, today's enterprise applications are
too complex for any one person to grasp completely. No one can hold all
the requirements, options, and design choices in mind at one time.
Several people, and several minds, need to work together to hold them
all. In today's enterprise environments, responsibility for
application development must be assigned to a team rather than a single
person.</p>

<p>People sometimes have difficulty adjusting to working in teams. They
are expecting to know &quot;Who's in charge?&quot; A hierarchical
model, such as an organization chart, describes who is in charge and
who reports to whom. However, in today's enterprise environments,
assigning a single project manager to oversee all aspects of a
development project and make all critical decisions creates many points
where the project could fail. The challenges of a single manager
approach can include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> An information bottleneck.</li></p>

<p><li> Insufficient perspective to address all the project's
needs.</li></p>

<p><li> Increases in miscommunication as information is filtered up the
management hierarchy.</li></p>

<p><li> Difficulty in grasping the vast technical knowledge required of
multiple-application platforms.</li></p>

<p><li> The overwhelming breadth of knowledge required to integrate the
project with current internal systems.</li></p>

<p><li> Difficulty in prioritizing business requirements against
technical requirements.</li></p>

<p><li> A single experience, which limits the ability to quickly solve
problems based on historical, more broad-based experience.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>In addition, communication is more difficult in organizations that
adhere to strict hierarchies, which by definition imply indirect
communications. A hierarchical group's communications may be
&quot;filtered&quot; by three or four managers, thus significantly
increasing the likelihood that the true message and intent will be
lost. Often the greatest miscommunication occurs between upper
management's vision and the actual practical work on a project,
four managers removed. This miscommunication can lead to the
disengagement of individuals from the project, decreased productivity,
and increased likelihood of project failure.</p>

<p>To combat many of the difficulties with a single manager approach, a
team model describes the key roles and responsibilities of a project
team. No single person is in charge of the overall project. Instead,
each team member is in charge of a specific role that must be performed
in order for the project to be successful.</p>

<p>The team model does not define the management structure of the team
from a personnel-administration perspective. A multi-disciplined team
acquires project resources from many departments within the
organization and from the organization's vendors. Project teams are
specifically designed to address project goals and assign project
responsibilities to different roles. The leaders of each role are
responsible for executing their role's activities given the
resources assigned to their part of the team. The daily management
tasks they perform within the roles are specifically related to project
activities, not to particular human-resource (HR) activities. The HR
management of the organization's employees continues to be handled
by each individual's current manager. Such activities can include
compensation plans, benefits, vacations, and performance reviews. The
team provides performance information about individuals to their
managers but doesn't oversee the individual's adherence to
employment policies.</p>

<p>The team approach has its challenges. Potential pitfalls that need
to be understood and continually mitigated include:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Lack of a single point of contact for external
communication.</li></p>

<p><li> An inconsistent vision applied to different aspects of the
project.</li></p>

<p><li> Team members with different agendas for the project.</li></p>

<p><li> Inexperience that prevents an effective team implementation.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>In this chapter, we'll look at ways to avoid these pitfalls.</p>

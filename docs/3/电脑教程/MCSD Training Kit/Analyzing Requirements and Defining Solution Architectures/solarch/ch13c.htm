<A NAME="631"><H1>Stabilization Process</H1></A>

<p>The stabilization process is completed, as are the other phases of
the project, by the entire project team. Each team member must execute
his or her responsibilities with the primary goal of shipping the
product. The somewhat frantic final days of the development process,
when the team is pushing very hard to get the product out the door, is
often referred to as the <i>end-game</i>. Within project teams, many
stories can be related about activities and heroics during this
end-game crunch time, which demonstrate the team's complete
commitment to releasing the product.</p>

<p>Unlike the other phases of the development process, this phase is
not characterized by the action steps; rather, it is characterized by
the interim releases. The same steps are repeated within each interim
release: fix the bugs, synchronize all product deliverables, ship the
release, and extensively test the release. Eventually, the team will
determine that a release is ready for prime time, and that will be the
Final Product Release.</p>

<A NAME="632"><H2>Who Does What During Stabilization?</H2></A>

<p>Although the team works together to achieve the Release Milestone
that marks the end of the Stabilizing Phase, individual team roles have
their own focuses during this phase. Because the primary emphasis is on
shipping the release, every role focuses on something to do with
shipping the product.</p>

<p>Table 13.1 identifies some specific team role responsibilities for
the Stabilizing Phase. The lead for each team role ensures that these
responsibilities are carried out and communicates with the rest of the
project team.</p>

<A NAME="633"><H2>Interim Milestones</H2></A>

<p>Unlike the previous phases that can be characterized by steps, the
Stabilizing Phase is better characterized by its interim milestones.
Each interim milestone functions as a product release. These product
releases continue in an iterative fashion until the team determines
that the final product release has been created. At each of these
interim releases, the team synchronizes and ships all the product
deliverables. With each successive interim release, the product is
tested, bugs are tracked, and corrections are made. The final product
release decision is a shared responsibility across the project team
leads, the customer, and the operations and support groups.</p>

<A NAME="634"><H2>Milestone #1: Interim Releases as Bugs Converge</H2></A>

<p>As discussed in <A HREF="ch12a.htm">Chapter 12</A>, the team can release the interim product
releases to portions of the user community to provide additional
testing. During the Stabilizing Phase, the team should see a downward
trend in the number of reported bugs. This downward trend signifies
that the application is becoming more stable. Although there are often
peaks and valleys in the number of reported bugs, overall the team
should see a downward trend that is manifested over time, not
necessarily at each fixed point in time.</p>

<A NAME="635"><H2>Milestone #2: Zero-Bug Release</H2></A>

<p>ZBR is the first point in the project when the development team
finally catches up to the testing team, and there are no active bugs,
or no bug is active for more than a specified length of time (usually
72 hours). It is to be expected that the bug count will increase after
this product release, but the development team will continue to fight
to get to ZBR with each successive interim product release. Reaching
ZBR is a strong indication that the team is in the final stages of
shipping the product, and the end-game is in full swing.</p>

<A NAME="636"><H2>Milestone #3: Release Candidates</H2></A>

<p>When the team thinks the product is potentially ready for final
release, a release candidate is built. Each release candidate includes
all the elements required in a shippable product, and has no active
bugs. The team will perform highly intensive testing against the
release candidate to flush out any final show-stopping bugs. This
intensive testing determines whether the release candidate will become
the final product release, or if the team must generate a new release
candidate with the appropriate fixes. It is unlikely that the first
release candidate will be the one that ships, as show-stopping bugs are
often found in the first release candidates.</p>

<A NAME="637"><H2>Milestone #4: Final Product Release</H2></A>

<p>The final product release is the release candidate that all the key
stakeholders, team members, and customers agree is the version that
will be shipped. This is the release that is shipped in the box, and on
which no further development or testing is conducted. Determining which
release is the final product release is a difficult decision.
Ultimately the answer is about shipping the right product at the right
time. Does this product fully meet the needs of the customer? Other key
release considerations are the bug report data, the results of the
release candidate testing, and the supportability of the product. As
with most major decisions, there are many inherent risks, but the
decision will be made as a team effort.</p>

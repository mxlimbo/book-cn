<A NAME="226"><H1>Artifacts and Deliverables</H1></A>

<p>Throughout the project, the team generates various artifacts and
deliverables. <i>Artifacts</i> are documents of all kinds that are
generated as part of the project, and <i>deliverables</i> are the
specific documents and applications required by each phase of the
project.</p>

<p>Some product information remains internal to the project team. Not
all project artifacts are customer deliverables; for example, meeting
agendas are not deliverables. However, all artifacts are important as
either documentation or aids to the process. Usually, artifacts should
be kept after the project is complete, as part of the project
documentation.</p>

<p>Deliverables are the key elements that must be developed, built, and
handed off throughout the project, and are externally visible to people
in the organization who are not involved in the project. Some
deliverables are documents; some are code or applications. All
deliverables are important and should be kept for future reference
after the project is complete.</p>

<p>Each artifact or deliverable should be communicated in the most
effective way. For example, not all documents have to be printed.
Distributing an agenda through e-mail or on the organization's
intranet may be just as effective and less time-consuming. If a
prototype is not executable, developing it as a Web site and thereby
making it available to all interested parties at the same time, no
matter where their location, might be the most effective way to
communicate it.</p>

<p>Everyone should remember that the objective is to deliver a
completed, useable application that meets the stated needs, not to
generate mounds of paper. The team should be creative in its use of
technology to communicate artifacts, to share results, and to move the
process forward.</p>

<p>For example, imagine that a PowerPoint presentation is e-mailed in
advance to all the participants in an online progress meeting, who are
located in five different countries. The PowerPoint presentation is
cued up on a projector at each 
location. The online meeting is then started and cued up on the same
projector. Finally, a Web browser attached to the Web server at the
home office navigates to the Web prototype on that server and loads the
home page. During the online meeting, the participants alternate
between the presentation and the browser, making comments and
suggestions. Meanwhile, a developer incorporates as many suggestions as
possible into the prototype and then instructs everyone to refresh
their browsers to see the changes. In this manner, the group moves
through the prototype, and at the end of the online meeting the group
agrees that the prototype meets the stated needs. Such a scenario,
considered the stuff of fantasy only a few years ago, brings an
entirely new meaning to the phrase &quot;rapid application
development.&quot;</p>

<p>Although the team might not have access to such technology, or a
given project might not warrant using it, team members should
nevertheless take a close look at their assumptions about
communication. They should think creatively in order to deliver
effectively. Above all, they must be sure everything they do is moving
them <i>through</i> the process model and <i>toward</i> the
project's goal: a stable, useable product that meets the stated
customer needs.</p>

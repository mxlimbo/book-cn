<p>During the initial phase of deployment planning, it's essential
to identify possible risks, anticipate how they might affect the
deployment, and explore mitigation measures. Successfully identifying
these risks helps the team avoid delays and feel prepared to face
potential complications.</p>

<p>It's important to review and update the Master Risk Assessment
Document during each phase of development because, over time, new risks
come to the fore while others recede. Table 13.2 is a simplified
example of the type of risk matrix that might be developed in
connection with the deployment process.</p>

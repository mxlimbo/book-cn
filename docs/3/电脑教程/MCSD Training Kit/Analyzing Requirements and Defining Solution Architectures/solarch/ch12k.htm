<p>He looked at the role list on the transparency. &quot;I want to save
Bill and Marta for last, so let's go to User Ed. Marilou, how's
your work progressing?&quot;</p>

<p>Looking in her project binder, Marilou said, &quot;As you noted in
our Developing Phase kick-off last week, Dan, my role is responsible
for developing the elements of user support, like documentation and
reference cards. I'm also responsible for doing product usability
testing.&quot;</p>

<p>She pulled a small binder out of her bag. &quot;Here is the
beginning of the user documentation. I met with the development team
last Friday. They walked me through what they had, and we did some
screen captures. I worked on the documentation for those over the
weekend.&quot; She turned to Bill. &quot;Bill, I can't finish the
documentation until you tell me we've got a freeze on the visual
interfaces and give me the final screen shots. Is that going to happen
soon?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think so,&quot; he replied, looking at the project schedule
in front of him. &quot;We're supposed to be done with an alpha
version this Wednesday. I'll check with the team to see if the
interfaces will be frozen by then, and I'll send you an e-mail. If
it is, we can get together Thursday morning.&quot;</p>

<p>Marilou nodded. &quot;That'd be great.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan asked, &quot;What about usability testing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm working with Marta on writing some usability test
scripts,&quot; said Marilou, &quot;but we can't really finish until
we get to the first beta.&quot; She looked at her notes. &quot;I'm
also working with you and Jane to plan the beta testing, which you
already know.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan nodded. &quot;Sounds good, Marilou. I'm glad you're
doing the documentation, because you'll also be doing the user
training for the managers. Jane showed me the documentation you did for
some special classes, and I must say I'm impressed.&quot;</p>

<A NAME="39"><H1>MSF Enterprise Architecture Model</H1></A>

<p>How does the enterprise function today? Many organizations can only
tentatively answer this question. The MSF Enterprise Architecture Model
gives current systems a context that can provide a rationale for the
systems' existence, both current and future. Additionally, the MSF
Enterprise Architecture Model can provide the foundation for the
implementation of business solutions by using technology. Not only do
different systems provide features and functionality of their own, but
these systems can be logically combined to create an overall system
that is greater than the sum of its parts. This overall effect is the
desired future state of the organization's enterprise architecture,
which the evolutionary implementation of the MSF Enterprise
Architecture Model can provide.</p>

<p>As illustrated in Figure 1.2, the MSF Enterprise Architecture Model
is a framework composed of four architecture perspectives: Business,
Application, Information, and Technology.</p>

<P><!-- caption --><b>Figure 1.2</b> <i>The four enterprise architecture perspectives</i><!-- /caption --></P>

<A NAME="40"><H2>Business Perspective</H2></A>

<p>The Business Perspective includes broad business strategies and
plans for moving the organization from its current state to its desired
future state. The Business Perspective describes how the business
works. It includes:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> The organization's high-level goals and objectives.</li></p>

<p><li> The organization's products and services.</li></p>

<p><li> Business processes that embody the functions and the
cross-functional activities performed by the organization.</li></p>

<p><li> Major organizational structures.</li></p>

<p><li> The interaction of all these elements.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="41"><H2>Application Perspective</H2></A>

<p>The Application Perspective represents the services, information,
and functionality that cross organizational boundaries, linking users
of different skills and functions to achieve common business
objectives. It defines the enterprise application portfolio and
includes:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Descriptions of the automated services that support the business
processes presented in the business architecture.</li></p>

<p><li> Descriptions of the interaction and interdependencies of the
organization's application systems.</li></p>

<p><li> Priorities for developing new applications and revising old
applications based directly on the business architecture.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="42"><H2>Information Perspective</H2></A>

<p>The Information Perspective describes what the organization needs to
know to run its business processes and operations. It includes:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Standard data models.</li></p>

<p><li> Data management policies.</li></p>

<p><li> Descriptions of the patterns of information consumption and
production in the organization.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>The Information Perspective also describes how data is bound into
the workflow, including structured data stores such as databases, and
unstructured data stores such as documents, spreadsheets, and
presentations that exist throughout the organization. Often, the
information most critical to an organization resides not only in
database servers, but on the thousands of desktop computers that
comprise the enterprise's active working environment.</p>

<A NAME="43"><H2>Technology Perspective</H2></A>

<p>The Technology Perspective lays out the hardware and software
supporting the organization. It includes:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Desktop and server hardware.</li></p>

<p><li> Operating systems.</li></p>

<p><li> Network connectivity components.</li></p>

<p><li> Printers.</li></p>

<p><li> Internet connectivity.</li></p>

<p><li> Other necessary peripheral devices.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>The Technology Perspective provides a logical, vendor-independent
description of infrastructure and system components that is necessary
to support the application and information perspectives. It defines the
set of technology standards and services needed to execute the business
mission. These standards and services include, but are not limited
to:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Topologies.</li></p>

<p><li> Development environments.</li></p>

<p><li> Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).</li></p>

<p><li> Security.</li></p>

<p><li> Network services.</li></p>

<p><li> Database management system (DBMS) services.</li></p>

<p><li> Technical specifications.</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="44"><H2>Four Perspectives, One Architecture</H2></A>

<p>Although the MSF Enterprise Architecture Model has four
perspectives, there is only one enterprise architecture. As an
organization builds an enterprise architecture, it is important to
remember that the architecture's value is not in any one individual
perspective but in the relationships, interactions, and dependencies
between the perspectives.</p>

<p>The development of these four architecture perspectives and the
examination of their individual and collective interactions should
reveal the information that an organization requires to make rational
decisions about its IT priorities, projects, policies, standards, and
guidelines. This information is critical for IT implementation and
purchasing decisions, and provides a powerful communication tool
between the organization's IT and business units.</p>

<A NAME="45"><H2>Alignment of Business and IT Goals</H2></A>

<p>Two significant problems arise for IT managers when facing software
deployment and development of business applications:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>After the fact</b> By the time the IT group gets involved, the
fundamental business processes are already established, and the IT group misses
a major opportunity to effectively apply technology.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Out of the business decision-making process</b> Because IT is
disassociated from the line of business, myriad miscommunications and
poor decisions are made about technology.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>Organizations should focus on forming a partnership between IT and
the line of business. People and processes must rest on a solid
foundation before new technology that provides true business value can
successfully be deployed.</p>

<p>When confronted with the rate of change and innovation that are
inherent in high-technology industries, IT departments may become so
consumed with keeping up with new technology, or so frozen with
indecision, that they lose sight of the organization's purpose and
vision. As a result, they may lose credibility and relevance within the
entire organization. To maintain credibility and relevance, IT
departments must constantly focus on applying new information
technologies in ways that consistently support the organization's
purpose and business vision.</p>

<p>The MSF Enterprise Architecture Model is a tool for ensuring the
alignment of IT activities to the business operations of the
organization. Business unit managers should never doubt that the IT
group, and all information technologies under it, exist to support the
business. On the other hand, the IT group cannot be expected to align
its plans with the business units if it is not given the opportunity.
It is critical that the IT and line-of-business managers share a
cooperative and reciprocal relationship.</p>

<A NAME="46"><H3>Artificial Wall</H3></A>

<p>Often, an artificial wall exists between the IT and business units
of an organization. We say &quot;artificial&quot; because it primarily
results from two false assumptions made by both the business and IT
communities:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Business false assumption: &quot;They don't need to
know&quot;</b> Many business people think that they should be able to
list requirements outside of a specific business context and have the
IT group produce valuable solutions based solely on those requirements.
An abundance of empirical evidence suggests that requirements are very
difficult to meet without a contextual frame, and that generating
requirements should involve a number of organizational perspectives,
especially that of IT departments.</li></p>

<p><li><b>IT false assumption: &quot;We already know&quot;</b> Many IT
people believe that, even with their limited exposure to the front-line
business activities, they can &quot;do it better.&quot; Again,
empirical evidence suggests that until people actually carry out the
functions of a job, they don't understand all its nuances.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>For the IT group to successfully support the business groups, both
groups must work to tear down this artificial wall. The IT and business
groups must forge a partnership based on recognition of their common
goal: satisfying the business objectives of the organization. Crucial
to this objective are these considerations:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><b>Business-driven requirements first</b> The MSF Enterprise
Architecture Model's Business Perspective provides a framework for
determining the impact a project must have to meet the business needs
of the organization. These business needs serve to justify each
project.</li></p>

<p><li><b>IT's understanding of business</b> The IT group must have
an understanding of the organization's business drivers and
opportunities, core processes, and business goals so that it can make
rational and informed decisions about IT support activities.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Business's understanding of IT costs</b> Business unit
managers must recognize that when considering the value proposition for
altering existing processes or undertaking the development of new ones,
true IT costs, including the cost implications of using specific
information technologies, must be part of the equation.</li></p>

<p><li><b>IT's involvement in business decisions</b> Business units
should involve the IT group in the development of their business cases
and in the definition of changes to business processes.</li></p>

<p><li><b>Business's involvement in IT decisions</b> Investments in
IT infrastructure should be presented and approved based on business,
not technical, grounds.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>Both business and IT managers must let go of the notion that only
those people trained in their own respective disciplines can truly
understand their needs. The more each group understands and experiences
the &quot;realities&quot; of the other group, the less likely they are
to perceive the other as being on an &quot;opposing side&quot; and the
more likely they are to find common ground.</p>

<A NAME="47"><H2>Dangers to Avoid During the Enterprise Architecture Process</H2></A>

<p>As an organization defines an enterprise architecture, significant
issues can seriously impede its chances of successful
implementation.</p>

<A NAME="48"><H3>&quot;Buy&quot; List Focus</H3></A>

<p>The idea of enterprise architecture is not new. Most large
organizations claim to have an enterprise architecture in place, but
often what they have is no more than a simple &quot;buy&quot; list of
approved products. A list of approved products, however, does not
constitute or guarantee an effective enterprise architecture. The
organization must go beyond the product list to specify the overall
strategy and migration steps, as well as provide guidelines on how
individual project teams should use the listed products to achieve the
IT goals of the enterprise.</p>

<A NAME="49"><H3>Lack of a Clearly Articulated Future State</H3></A>

<p>Without adequate planning and a clear vision of where an
organization needs to be, based on business drivers and other reasons
specific and internal to the organization, introducing an enterprise
architecture will not help the organization arrive at the future state
it strives to reach.</p>

<p>For clarity, look again at the definition outlined earlier. The only
way to have a <i>progression</i> is to be making <i>progress toward a
clearly defined goal</i>. The opposite of progression can be
regression, but it can also be walking in circles. It is imperative
that an enterprise architecture plan include a clearly defined
description of the desired future state.</p>

<A NAME="50"><H3>Too Big and Too Complex to Achieve</H3></A>

<p>Another common problem lies in attempting to define <i>all</i> the
details of an enterprise architecture, no matter how wide or deep. The
enterprise architecture can become so large that individual and
enterprise-wide IT projects suffocate under the weight of their own
paper. Because the architecture takes so long to develop, the problem
changes before the organization can produce a solution.</p>

<p>Enterprise architecture debates are problematic. A typical
enterprise architecture plan can be hundreds or even thousands of pages
long, and take one to two years to complete. Remember that this is the
time frame for the plan itself, and does not include the
implementation. The size and complexity of the resulting enterprise
architecture, and the time frame in which it is developed, often make
it difficult to identify and prioritize key, organization-wide IT
needs. The resulting projects fail to address real business problems,
and the IT unit still has the problems it originally set out to
solve.</p>

<A NAME="51"><H3>No Provision for Feedback and Course Correction</H3></A>

<p>Building an enterprise architecture should be a collaborative
process between the users of the architecture (the project teams), the
business owners, and the enterprise architecture team. Enterprise
architectures are often built without any provision for feedback from
individual project teams. At some point, the architecture must be moved
from planning to implementation, and it is the individual project teams
that drive the implementation. Without clear communication and a
mechanism for feedback from the people actually doing the work, an
architecture might be put into place that looks good on paper but is
inappropriate or unstable.</p>

<p>All too frequently, business conditions and priorities change over
the course of developing an enterprise architecture plan. Additionally,
newer and more powerful technologies often supersede the technologies
originally proposed as solutions to problems identified in the plan. If
there is no opportunity for periodic feedback and course correction,
the entire architectural effort is jeopardized.</p>

<A NAME="52"><H3>Lack of Integration and Stability</H3></A>

<p>Even when individual IT solutions work, they often stand alone
without being an integral part of the overall enterprise architecture.
Frequently, power users bring in unsubstantiated, or &quot;cool,&quot;
technologies or application features that can destabilize the
architecture. This in turn causes other technologies or application
systems that could significantly improve operations to suffer, because
the environment is too chaotic to introduce them effectively.</p>

<A NAME="53"><H3>Lack of Focus on Implementation</H3></A>

<p>A true enterprise architecture encompasses not just the plan, but
also the implementation. Application systems must be built and
infrastructure must be deployed. Everything that is defined in the
architecture must be implementable within reasonable constraints.
Often, however, enterprise architecture efforts are not firmly based in
reality.</p>

<p>It is acceptable to have goals that &quot;push the envelope&quot;
within the architecture, but the basics must come first. For example,
if the architecture specifies that systems consolidate onto specific
platforms, it should also put into place specific migration assistance
or incentives for individual project teams to support and implement the
architecture.</p>

<A NAME="54"><H3>Failure to Deliver on Immediate Business Needs</H3></A>

<p>Many enterprise architecture plans lose sight of the fact that
business operations must be maintained and projects must be delivered
while the architecture is under development.</p>

<p>If the IT department offers no assistance for the organization's
business requirements, the business units will implement technology and
systems on their own in an attempt to survive and thrive in any way
they can. Any approach to enterprise architecture must stress the
delivery of key application system functionality to meet immediate
business needs during the development of the architecture.</p>

<A NAME="55"><H2>Objectives of the MSF Enterprise Architecture Model</H2></A>

<p>The MSF Enterprise Architecture Model consists of a suggested
process augmented with discussions of techniques and key principles.
The process is designed to quickly deliver benefits to the organization
and to take advantage of rapid advances in technology and changing
business conditions, by using versioned project releases. A dynamic MSF
Enterprise Architecture Model facilitates learning from feedback and
rational decision-making. This approach improves an organization's
ability to adopt and internally apply innovative technology that
provides direct business value.</p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr> As an organization implements the MSF Enterprise
Architecture Model, it's important to remember that this approach
provides a roadmap that can and should be appropriately customized to
reflect the specific needs of the organization or
situation.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>The MSF Enterprise Architecture Model has the following
characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Integrated</b> Specific needs of business stakeholders, the
architecture team, and individual project teams are balanced. Project
teams understand both the whole system and the individual parts of the
technology within their organization. Business stakeholders understand
where technology objectives are aligned with business needs.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Iterative</b> The enterprise architecture is built through a
succession of versioned releases.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Actionable</b> The primary goal of all enterprise architecture
development is to quickly reach an interim release that can be
implemented. In the meantime, project teams work to advance the
architecture to the desired future state. This approach provides ample
opportunity for feedback and course correction.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Prioritized</b> Efforts focus on where they can provide the
most value to the business while improving overall IT efficiency.
Architectural decisions are always framed to maintain support for
critical business processes.</li></p>
</ul>

<A NAME="70"><H1>EA Kickoff</H1></A>

<p>By the kickoff meeting for Ferguson and Bardell's Enterprise
Architecture Project, Dan had stopped worrying about whether he was
going to get good people for the team. Apparently, the other department
heads had wanted to impress the new CIO, and as a result, sent Dan some
of their best and brightest. In fact, Dan's new worry was whether
all the egos and opinions would fit around the table in his office.</p>

<p>Jenny showed up early. &quot;Not like her boss!&quot; thought Dan
with a grin as he welcomed her. Next in the door was Kevin Kennedy, a
management fast-tracker sent over by the CEO. Kevin was on the
firm's long-range planning committee, where he'd established a
reputation for both insightful analyses and the willingness to share
them.</p>

<p>Right behind Kevin came Jo Brown, the Assistant COO for Ferguson and
Bardell. Jo had been heavily involved in the firm's Y2K effort, and
as such had extensive knowledge of the firm's application
portfolio. In addition, she was known for her sharp wit and even
sharper memos, especially if someone wasn't following the
Procedures Manual.</p>

<p>As the group was taking their places around the table, in strolled
Dr. Richard Kaplan, who was somewhat of an enigma at Ferguson and
Bardell. Dick's first contact with the company had been as part of
a consulting team in the late 1980's, doing an analysis of the
firm's data storage. Something about him had impressed the IT
Director at the time, who had later hired him and stuck him in the
development area as an &quot;analyst.&quot; Dick had proceeded to teach
himself data modeling and data warehouse technology and was often used
in the early stages of development projects. He was something of a
loner, and seen by some as not too bright because of it. Dan, intrigued
to find a Ph.D. working in development, had once asked to borrow
Dick's dissertation, which was titled &quot;The Epistemology of
Kant: Based on Etymological Studies of His Later Writings.&quot; After
reading only a few pages, Dan knew that Dick Kaplan was no dunce.</p>

<p>&quot;Morning, all,&quot; said Dick, casually putting his pipe in
his jacket pocket as he took the last chair. &quot;Sorry if I've
held things up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, we were just starting, Dick. Glad you could make it,&quot;
replied Dan, handing Dick the last of the notebooks he had been passing
around. &quot;Did Bill have any problem letting you go to work on
this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, he groused about it a little, but I gauged the level to
be about a 1 on the Bill-O-Meter, so I think it's okay.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan laughed. &quot;Jo and Kevin, I hope you had no problems either,
taking this assignment.&quot;</p>

<p>Jo spoke first. &quot;Not a bit, Dan. They just told me to show up
here at 10:00 A.M. for an important project and to give you whatever
amount of time you needed.&quot; Kevin nodded in agreement.</p>

<p>&quot;Excellent,&quot; said Dan as he took his place at the table
and opened up his notebook. &quot;Since none of you are up to speed on
what we are doing here, I'd like to begin by outlining what this
project is about. If you'll open your notebooks, you'll find an
agenda. At the top of the agenda, you see that the name of the project
is Ferguson and Bardell's Enterprise Architecture Project, or
F-BEAP for short. Our job, briefly, is to discover and document our
current enterprise architecture and to develop a direction for the
future.&quot;</p>

<p>Kevin had been listening to Dan closely and taking some notes. Now
he stopped and asked, &quot;Okay, I'll bite&#8212;what is an <i>
enterprise architecture</i>, anyway?&quot;</p>

<p>Dan smiled. &quot;Take a look further down your agenda, Kevin. Our
first task is to define EA. Normally, I would have written it on the
agenda, but I wanted all of us to write it out manually, so that we
could get it locked in our brains a little better and so that we could
discuss it as we went.&quot;</p>

<P><A HREF="javascript:fullSize('gcs1ar01x.htm')" onMouseOver="window.status='Click to view at full size';return true;" onMouseOut="window.status='';return true;"><IMG SRC="images/gcs1ar01.jpg" WIDTH=404 HEIGHT=511 BORDER=0 ALT="Click to view at full size"></A></P>


<p>He stood and moved to the whiteboard behind the table. &quot;I'm
going to write 
the definition out one phrase at a time, and I want you all to copy it
onto your agenda. We'll discuss it as we go. Here's the first
phrase.&quot; Dan turned and wrote <i>A logically consistent plan of
activities and coordinated projects</i> on the board and waited while
the others copied it down.</p>

<p>&quot;First of all,&quot; Dan began, &quot;it's a plan. It's
not just a document about what we are doing; it's also a plan of
what we're going to do. Within the plan, it is logically
consistent. In other words, if we take any two random sections of the
plan, they make sense together. And, it covers both
activities&#8212;things we do over and over&#8212;and stand-alone or
one-time projects. Everybody got that much?&quot;</p>

<p>While everybody was still writing, Jo asked, &quot;Dan, that's
awfully broad. Are we trying to document every activity and every
project going on at Ferguson and Bardell?&quot;</p>

<p>Dan shook his head. &quot;An EA is primarily concerned with an
organization's Information Technology plans. We're not trying
to document everything throughout the company.&quot;</p>

<p>Kevin asked, somewhat curtly, &quot;Then why are we all here? I
don't know very much about your area.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As you'll see in a moment, Kevin,&quot; Dan said evenly,
&quot;each of you has a viewpoint that is valuable and necessary for
our EA.&quot; He turned back to the board. &quot;Okay, let's keep
going.&quot; He added <i>that guide the progression of an
organization's application systems and infrastructure.</i> to the
definition on the board. &quot;See, this is the point of the plan. We
will use the document this team creates as a guide for our work in the
IT department, both for applications we build or buy, and for any
infrastructure work we do. Any questions?&quot;</p>

<p>There were none, so Dan wrote the next part of the definition on the
board. <i>The plan should move from the current state to a desired
future state&#8230;</i> He finished writing and then waited until the
others had also finished. &quot;This is an important point. The EA
document must both describe where we are now and where we want to be.
Implied in this is that we should also put a timetable on that future
state; in other words, we have to lay out some goals for reaching
wherever it is we want to be. Does that make sense?&quot; Everyone
nodded in agreement, so Dan continued. &quot;Alright. This last phrase
begins to explain why you are all here.&quot; He turned and completed
the definition with <i>based on current and projected business
objectives and processes.</i> He turned back to the group.</p>

<p>&quot;You see,&quot; he said, putting down the marker and sitting
back down at the table, &quot;we in IT cannot write our own EA
document. We need input from other parts of the firm so that we base
our document on the business, not just on what we want to do.&quot; He
turned to Kevin. &quot;So you see, Kevin, you are here because of your
work on the strategic plan of the firm. We have to know those strategic
plans before we can develop both our own strategic plans for IT as well
as our own tactical plans.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What about the rest of us, Dan?&quot; said Jo. Dick Kaplan
added, &quot;Yes, Dan, I can see the need for Kevin here, but I'm
not sure I see where an Assistant COO and a jack-of-all-trades analyst
are needed.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan replied, &quot;Good questions, you two, but I think the next
item on the agenda will help explain each of your roles more fully.
Look under the first tab in your notebook.&quot;</p>

<A NAME="71"><H2>Four Models with Perspective</H2></A>

<p>In their notebooks, they saw a drawing that showed a triangle
subdivided into four sections labeled Business, Application,
Information, and Technology. &quot;To be complete, an enterprise
architecture is based on four models that each present a different
perspective,&quot; Dan said. The descriptions of each one are on the
following pages. Let's walk through them and look at what each of
you are responsible for.&quot;</p>

<p>He turned to Kevin. &quot;The Business Perspective is yours, Kevin.
We want to know Ferguson and Bardell's broad business strategies
along with the plans for carrying out those strategies. Basically,
you've got to tell us both how the business works today and how the
planning group envisions it working tomorrow. You've also got to
help us understand the business processes we follow to run the
business. It's all there in the bullet points on that page. Does
this make sense to you?&quot;</p>

<p>Kevin seemed somewhat more subdued as he studied the Business
Perspective page in the notebook. Finally he looked up and said,
&quot;This is a big task, but I think my background with the planning
group will help. I can do this.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan nodded. &quot;It <i>is</i> a big task, but you wouldn't have
been assigned to this team if we didn't think you could do it. And,
as you'll see in a minute, we're going to cut it down to size
before we leave today.&quot;</p>

<p>He then turned to Jo. &quot;Your area, Jo, is the Application
Perspective. You are responsible for identifying and documenting the
applications and functionality that Ferguson and Bardell uses to carry
out the processes that Kevin identifies. In addition, you have to find
and document the interaction and interfaces <i>between</i> applications
and functions. Again, it's laid out there on the page. Does it make
sense to you?&quot;</p>

<p>Jo nodded. &quot;I can see now why I was chosen for this role. My
work on the Y2K project, along with the application inventory we did,
will be a good jumping-off point for this project.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Absolutely,&quot; Dan said. &quot;Don't limit yourself
with that thought, though. Even without the Y2K project, your
credentials speak for themselves. I suspect your knowledge of the
operations of the firm would have put you here anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan then turned to Jenny. &quot;I bet you already know which of
these is yours, Jenny,&quot; he said, smiling.</p>

<p>Jenny smiled back and said, &quot;Yes, I think I do.&quot; She
became more serious and continued, &quot;And, as I look over the
Technology Perspective bullets on this page, it looks like an excellent
job for some sort of asset discovery tool, which, of course, we
don't have. So, do I have to gather all this data by
hand?&quot;</p>

<p>Dan noted the frustration in her voice. &quot;Jenny, you're
right. That sort of tool would make this much easier. But I think that
if you check with Jo, you'll find her Y2K hardware inventory will
make a good base document for your work. Beyond that, you may be able
to gather much of what you need with a well- 
designed e-mail questionnaire. And I'll talk with Tim about adding
the asset management tool to the budget for this year.&quot; He leaned
back in his chair and continued, &quot;Make sure you don't limit
your thinking to just auditing the current situation, though. Look at
the definition again and match it up with the bullet points on your
page. You have to document the current environment&#8212;this is true,
but, you also have to plan for the environment the company should have
in the future. You're responsible for thinking through and
proposing whatever technologies we will need to take this firm where it
wants to go strategically. Granted, all of us, including me, are going
to have to agree on those technologies, and you are going to have to
make a business case for them, but considering the amazing capabilities
that technology is bringing us, I'd say you have the most 'fun'
position on this project team.&quot;</p>

<p>Jenny thought about that a moment and was about to say something
when Jo leaned over to her and started singing &quot;Blue Skies.&quot;
Jenny laughed and said, &quot;Okay, okay, I guess I'm sold.
I'll do the grunt work now so that I can do the soaring work
later.&quot; She looked at Dan and smiled. &quot;And when we break up
here today, I'll tell Tim you want to see him about a budget
adjustment.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fair enough,&quot; said Dan. He then turned to Dick, who had
been observing the interactions with an amused expression on his face.
&quot;So, Dick, you've got the sheet that's left. What do you
think of being the one to bring us the Information
Perspective?&quot;</p>

<p>Dick studied the Information Perspective page in his notebook and
then said, &quot;Well, it looks to me to be the most abstract of the
four. I'm supposed to document what the firm 'needs to know' to
carry out its processes and operations. I suppose the best way to do
that will be to take the output of Kevin's and Jo's work, and
then transform it into models showing the information and data needed
to make it work.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm also supposed to make a note of all the places we
store information and what our data management policies are, if any.
This sounds as if it needs to be based on what Jenny does, to some
extent. So, all in all, my work is dependent on theirs to start out
with. But, as we make plans for the future, their work will be somewhat
based on my work, because they will have to consider what data models
and data stores we already have in place and how their work will
interact with those. Does that cover it, in a nutshell?&quot;</p>

<p>Dan shook his head and smiled. &quot;Dick, I asked for you because
of your ability to look at disparate concepts and combine them into a
coherent whole. Once again, you have explained it better than the
official material did. But even though you ultimately have to base your
work on the output of the others, I think you already know enough about
the firm's business, processes, and technology that you can begin
work on your section now. Do you agree?&quot;</p>

<p>Dick nodded and then asked, &quot;Do you want me to use UML to
document this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ultimately, I will,&quot; said Dan, as the others looked
puzzled. &quot;For now, though, just begin with some simple tables of
data structures and the processes they relate to. Those will be easier
for us to grasp on this first version.&quot;</p>

<A NAME="72"><H2>Proactive, Reactive, and Versions</H2></A>

<p>Dan turned to the next page in the notebook. &quot;Let's take a
moment to look at the direction of process and priorities on this team.
Everyone turn to page 6 in the first section.&quot;</p>

<p>On that page, a diagram showed the Business Perspective on one side,
with an arrow flowing through the Application and Information
Perspectives into the Technology Perspective. &quot;This is how EA work
is often carried out,&quot; Dan said. &quot;First we understand and
document the business strategic plans and processes, and then we build
applications and information stores to carry out those plans. Finally,
we implement the technology necessary to support the applications and
information we need.&quot;</p>

<p>Kevin leaned back in his chair and said, &quot;Cool! So I bring in
the gospel from 
the business side, and all the rest of you use that to do your thing
while I sit 
back and relax.&quot; He smiled smugly and said, &quot;I'm liking
this project better by the moment.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan thought to himself, &quot;And I'm liking you less by the
moment.&quot; Concealing his thoughts, he said to Kevin,
&quot;That's part of the picture, Kevin. But let's look at the
next page for another take on it.&quot; They all turned the page and
saw a drawing similar to the first, except that now the arrow flowed
back from the Technology Perspective, through the Information and
Application Perspectives into the Business Perspective. Dan continued,
&quot;In today's world, technology is changing so rapidly, with
such important implications for business, that only a foolish business
planner ignores the impact technology can have on his or her plans. In
short, what we want is to have a two-way flow of information throughout
all four perspectives, but especially between Technology and
Business.&quot; He looked directly at Kevin. &quot;One of your tasks,
in fact, will be to take the technology possibilities we discover and
feed them back into the long-range planning process of the firm. To do
that, you will have to listen carefully and learn thoroughly as Jenny,
Jo, and Dick share their insights. Do you think you can do
that?&quot;</p>

<p>Noticing the tone in Dan's voice in this last sentence, Kevin
said in a somewhat more subdued manner, &quot;I certainly will
try.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good!&quot; said Dan emphatically. He looked at the rest of
the group. &quot;I hope you can all see how your part fits into the
whole and how important each of you is to the success of this project.
Any questions about roles and perspectives?&quot; There were none, so
Dan turned the page in his notebook and said, &quot;Alright then,
let's take a look at schedule.&quot;</p>

<p>When the team looked at the calendar page, there were muttered
expressions of disbelief. Finally, Jenny looked at Dan and said,
&quot;Dan, I know you said this was a two-month project, but after
looking at the tasks before each of us, and at the overall task of the
team, I don't see any way we can do this in two months. Two years,
perhaps; but two months? No way.&quot; There were nods of agreement all
around the table. Dan waited a moment and then responded.</p>

<p>&quot;Jenny, if we were going to produce a complete EA this first
time, you would be exactly right. But you see, that is the trap that so
many firms fall into. They try to document everything in the first cut.
In other words, they try to achieve both 100 percent breadth and 100
percent depth. What happens is that by the time they finish, much of
the architecture has changed, and they have to go through the process
all over again. And because they spend so much time documenting the
current state, they never get to plan the future state.&quot; He
paused, then stated firmly, &quot;This team is going to avoid both
mistakes. And here is how.&quot;</p>

<p>He moved to the whiteboard, erased it, and then drew a line across
the middle. &quot;If we draw what I just said, this line represents 100
percent breadth.&quot; He drew another line at the bottom of the board,
then drew arrows between the two lines. &quot;And this box represents
100 percent depth.&quot; He then drew a line about an inch below the
top line. &quot;This is how we keep from drowning in detail. We only
shoot for about 10 percent depth this first time around.&quot; He put
the marker down and continued. &quot;For our documentation of the
current situation, we aim for a fairly high level of
abstraction&#8212;major processes, major infrastructure resources,
primary strategic plans. It is up to each one of us to identify the key
elements in our area, the ones we absolutely have to pay attention
to.&quot; Moving back to the board, he then drew three boxes above the
middle line. &quot;Once we have a big picture of our current situation,
we can pick out two or three big projects or processes that we want to
implement, and we make those our priorities for this planning
'season.' That's the end of Version 1 of the F-BEAP.&quot;</p>

<P><A HREF="javascript:fullSize('gcs1ar02x.htm')" onMouseOver="window.status='Click to view at full size';return true;" onMouseOut="window.status='';return true;"><IMG SRC="images/gcs1ar02.jpg" WIDTH=404 HEIGHT=303 BORDER=0 ALT="Click to view at full size"></A></P>


<p>&quot;How can we do 10 percent and still carry out our tasks?&quot;
asked Jo. &quot;I am beginning to see the value of this work, and
I'm beginning to get excited about being part of this team. But if
we're going to produce some half-baked document that is too general
to be of any use to anyone, I want out now. And, if all we're doing
is some fuzzy justification for projects you want to do anyway, I
don't want to be a part of that either.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan realized that Jo's reputation for forthrightness was
well-deserved. He thought about her comments for a minute, thinking how
to respond. Finally he said, &quot;Jo, I'm with you. My time is too
valuable to waste on a project or a document that is just fluff. And, I
don't need cover for my pet IT projects. I'm a big enough boy
that I can ask for what I want without help from you or anybody
else.&quot; He noticed that Jo didn't seem fazed by this last
comment. &quot;Well, I'm glad to see she takes it as well as she
dishes it out,&quot; he thought.</p>

<p>Dan went back to his place at the table. &quot;Let me see if this
analogy will help. Let's say we need to do some extensive
remodeling work on our house. First we'd probably get a high-level
picture, an architectural drawing or something to that effect, of the
area we need to work on&#8212;the current state. Then we'd compile a
list of the things we want to change, and based on what seems the most
important and cost-effective, we'd decide what we should focus on
first. We'd pick out two or three of the projects on our
list&#8212;the ones that had to be done right away or those that we
could actually do in a reasonable time frame, and we'd move forward
on them. We'd get whatever additional documentation we needed; but
otherwise, we'd do the process well enough to enable us to move
forward <i>intelligently</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's the key here, everyone. We want to work at a high
level so we can get the first version complete in a reasonable amount
of time. But the goal is to document the current state just well enough
to enable us to plan for the future state, without tripping over any
'gotchas' along the way.&quot; He turned to Jo. &quot;Does that
make sense to you, Jo?&quot;</p>

<p>She nodded slowly. &quot;Yes, it does. In fact, it's an
excellent analogy. When we're remodeling, we're not building a
new house. We don't have to do extensive planning just to start.
We're already <i>living</i> in our house. It's already built.
We could go back and recreate all the plans necessary to build it
again, but why? We're better off simply understanding what we have
well enough that we can mold our vision of the house in the future
based on the reality of the house we have today. Then, we plan how to
get from here to there, with some feedback along the way from our
friendly neighborhood contractor and her pal the architect,&quot; she
concluded, smiling at Jenny and Dick.</p>

<p>&quot;By George, I think you've got it!&quot; said Dan, looking
around at the others. &quot;Is everybody clear on our goals for Version
1, then?&quot; When everyone nodded, Dan turned back to the agenda in
the front of his notebook. &quot;Alright, then, we're ready for
assignments.&quot;</p>

<A NAME="73"><H2>Getting Started on F-BEAP</H2></A>

<p>Dan pulled some handouts from his notebook and passed them around
the table. &quot;What I am giving you now is a listing of the things
that I think are part of your EA perspective. Some of them are from the
diagrams you've already seen; others I've added based on my
months here at Ferguson and Bardell. You may think some are
unnecessary; you may think of others you want to add. We can deal with
either possibility as long as you can justify your decision to the
team.</p>

<p>&quot;Before our next meeting, I want each of you to make a list of
all the primary items you can think of under each thing. Keeping in
mind our 10% depth goal, go back and rank the items in terms of
importance and whether they help to form the foundation of the element.
In other words, you want to be sure to include the absolute fundamental
items that must be included for Ferguson and Bardell to run. Other
items may not be fundamental, but if they're important, include
them, too.</p>

<p>Finally, make a first cut at identifying any relationships you see
between the items you've listed. The more relationships you
identify, the more fundamental that item probably is to the EA. Of
course, there is also the possibility that an entire process or two may
be unnecessary, which we hope we will see as we move through the
project.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dan, when is our next meeting?&quot; asked Dick, taking out
his personal digital assistant to note the date and time.</p>

<p>&quot;Next Monday, a week from today. That should give each of you
plenty of time to write up your first draft. I'd like you to send
those documents to everyone by Thursday afternoon so that we can all
review them before Monday. Is that okay with everyone? Yes? Good.&quot;
Dan paused and looked at each member of the team. &quot;I know you know
that this is important, and I'm looking forward to seeing what you
come up with. I'll see you back here next Monday, and in the

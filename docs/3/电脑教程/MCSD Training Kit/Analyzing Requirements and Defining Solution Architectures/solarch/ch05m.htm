<A NAME="288"><H1>Client Perspective</H1></A>

<p>Monday morning dawned clear and early&#8212;<i>too</i> early for Dan,
who had just gotten to sleep, it seemed, when the alarm went off.
&quot;At least I've got everything ready so I can just grab it and
go,&quot; he thought as he stumbled toward the shower.</p>

<p>Forty-five minutes later he pulled into the parking garage, grabbed
his bag, and headed for his office. A sudden growl from his stomach
reminded him he hadn't eaten yet. &quot;I sure hope Jane remembers
the food,&quot; he thought as he picked up the packets of material he
had run off the night before and headed for the Oak Room.</p>

<p>Ahead of him he saw Bill and two younger workers heading for the
conference room, one with a laptop under his arm, and all three engaged
in an intense discussion. Dan heard references to &quot;COM&quot; and
&quot;Visual Modeler&quot; and realized that the people with Bill were
Sam and Beth, the two programmers working on the prototype.</p>

<p>Dan quickened his pace so he could catch up, and asked, &quot;So,
guys, you got something good for us today?&quot; Sam and Beth both
nodded and smiled, and then looked at Bill. &quot;Absolutely! Dan,
these two are wonders when it comes to this stuff. I'm amazed at
what they've been able to do since last Wednesday.&quot; Bill shook
his head ruefully and said, &quot;I dunno, Dan. Looks like us old COBOL
cowboys are getting left behind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't let him kid you, Mr. Shelly,&quot; Sam said as they
turned into the conference room. &quot;He was right there with us,
turning out screens and cleaning up our work as we went along. In fact,
when Beth showed him the program flow chart, he made some really good
suggestions. He knows his databases, that's for sure.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I already told you, Sam, no money left for raises this year,
so quit your brown-nosing,&quot; Bill growled. Dan could tell, though,
that he was pleased at the compliments from this hotshot
programmer.</p>

<p>Grabbing a doughnut and coffee as he moved to the front of the room,
Dan offered a silent prayer of thanks for Jane's memory. He piled
the packets of new material on the credenza, put the meeting's
agenda on the projector, and then turned to the group. &quot;Good
morning, all.&quot;</p>

<P><A HREF="javascript:fullSize('gcs5ar06x.htm')" onMouseOver="window.status='Click to view at full size';return true;" onMouseOut="window.status='';return true;"><IMG SRC="images/gcs5ar06.jpg" WIDTH=404 HEIGHT=511 BORDER=0 ALT="Click to view at full size"></A></P>


<p>As the murmurs of &quot;G'morning&quot; died down, Marilou
added, &quot;My, we're chipper this morning!&quot;</p>

<p>Dan smiled. &quot;All an act, Marilou. I'm actually just running
on nervous energy and excitement.&quot; He looked over the agenda.
&quot;Is everybody ready to begin?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, where's Mr. Stewart?&quot; Tim asked. &quot;I thought
he was joining us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's coming later, Tim,&quot; Dan said as he handed out
the packets he had prepared the night before. &quot;I thought we could
knock out the risk assessment fairly quickly, so I asked him to join us
around 8:45.&quot; Dan replaced the agenda with another
transparency.</p>

<p>&quot;I appreciate all of the hard work you people did on the risk
matrix I sent you. The opinions of probability and impact were
surprisingly similar across the group. I've averaged them,
calculated the exposure, and ranked them. Let's take a look and see
if we agree with the group wisdom.&quot;</p>

<p>As Dan had expected, &quot;scope creep&quot; was a clear choice for
the project's primary risk. Because of the tight schedule, missing
the ship date was next. Tim argued strongly that the team needed to
consider the project's impact to the network and that concern wound
up as the third biggest risk. The risk of exposure ratings dropped
substantially, and the remaining seven risks were ranked by only one or
two team members.</p>

<p>The group worked through each of the risks, building mitigation
plans, contingency plans, and contingency triggers. In most cases,
assessing the risks required no further research. When Bill and Tim
began to argue about the impact RMS might have on the network, however,
the group decided that Tim should do further research on the risk of
network saturation before they could adequately address the issue.</p>

<p>They were just wrapping up the risk assessment when Jim Stewart came
into the conference room. &quot;Welcome, Mr. CFO!&quot; said Dan.
&quot;Pull up a doughnut and have a chair&#8212;there's plenty of
both to go around.&quot;</p>

<p>Jim sat across from Dan and ignored Dan's offer. &quot;I hope
I'm on time,&quot; he said in a somewhat brisk manner. Something in
his tone made Dan eye him closely but he could read nothing on the
man's face. Dan thought to himself, &quot;Get a grip! Quit
projecting your own exhaustion onto others.&quot; He retrieved the
doughnut box, moved it to the credenza, and looked squarely at Jim.
&quot;You're right on time, as usual. We were just wrapping up the
risk assessment document, and we're ready to go through the draft
Vision Document with you. I hope you got a copy?&quot; He looked at
Jane, and she nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I received a copy,&quot; Jim replied. He took off his
glasses and wiped them slowly. Dan had seen him do this before in
management meetings, and it always bode ill for whomever was in the
line of fire.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I received a copy,&quot; Jim repeated. By now, everyone
on the project team had picked up the tone in Jim's voice, and they
were all looking at him, wondering what it meant. &quot;I have my copy
right here, and it seems somewhat incomplete, I must say.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here it comes,&quot; thought Dan. &quot;Incomplete in what
way, Jim?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>Jim began thumbing through the document. &quot;I see the vision
statement, and the user profiles, and the rest. All very interesting.
Especially the proposed solution.&quot; He put the document back on the
table and looked directly at Dan. &quot;I don't see anything in the
solution about project management. Not a word. Why are we going to all
this trouble, reinventing the entire time and billing system, if we
don't give our supervisors a better way to manage projects and
control costs?&quot; By this time, he was jabbing his glasses in
Dan's direction.</p>

<p>Trying to keep his voice level, Dan answered, &quot;What did you
have in mind, Jim? This is a draft document, after all. We asked you
here to get your input and feedback, and that's what we want. So,
tell us how you think project management should be included in
RMS.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, it's as plain as the nose on your face,&quot; replied
Jim heatedly. He stood up and began pacing as he talked.
&quot;We've got projects that go over budget all the time. We have
to eat thousands of dollars on some of them because they are fixed-bid
projects. Because of the way we do time tracking, most of the project
managers complain that they can't get good data on how much time
has been spent and how much is left. Before they even realize it, they
are over the allotted hours on part of the project, or even on the
entire project.</p>

<p>&quot;Now here you are, proposing to put all the time data into a
central data store. You've written this nice Vision Document, but
there's not one word about giving the project managers a tool to
track time by project. How hard can that be? As the person who is
authorizing the budget for this, I demand that you add it to the
project!&quot;</p>

<p>At that, Bill jumped up and shouted, &quot;That's a load of
bull, Jim! Where do you get off coming in here and throwing your weight
around! Here we are, busting our tails to get this app out the door in
two months&#8212;two months!&#8212;and you've got the nerve to ask
for more! I don't know why your precious project managers can't
track project time manually, just like we do. We can manage our
projects in IT just fine, thank you, without any extra tools.&quot;</p>

<p>Jim glared at Bill. &quot;Yes, I've seen how well you manage
development projects, Bill. Just how late were you last time&#8212;six
months, I believe?&quot;</p>

<p>Bill's face turned red, but before he could say anything else,
Dan slammed his hand on the table. &quot;That's enough! Sit down,
Bill, and shut up before you say something we'll all regret. And
Jim, it's not fair to throw that project back in Bill's face,
because it suffered from the very thing we're trying to avoid with
this project.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan moved to the head of the table and put the risk matrix back on
the overhead projector for everyone to see. &quot;Jim, we were working
on this before you got here. I want you to look at it for a moment
while I explain what happened to the project time-tracking
feature.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan pointed at the first row of the matrix. &quot;These are risks
we've identified for this project. What is the absolute number one
risk we identified?&quot;</p>

<p>Jim squinted at the screen and then remembered to put his glasses
back on. Reading the first item, he recited, &quot;Scope creep. Sounds
like a horror movie disease.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is, Jim, it is,&quot; said Dan. &quot;Scope creep wrecks
more project plans than almost any other risk. It happens when
well-meaning customers insist on adding features to the scope of the
project, without adjusting anything else.&quot; Dan turned to Jane.
&quot;Jane, did we identify tracking time by project as a potential
feature for RMS?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Absolutely, Dan,&quot; replied Jane. &quot;In fact, a number
of users mentioned it while I was working on the use cases. So we
discussed it in our last meeting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And what happened to it?&quot; Dan asked, glancing at Jim to
see his reaction to her response.</p>

<p>&quot;We decided to delay it until Version 2.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But why?&quot; Jim exclaimed. &quot;What Version 2? Why not
put it in the program this time?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because of the tradeoff triangle,&quot; replied Marilou,
moving to the whiteboard. She drew the triangle on the board and
explained to Jim the relationship of resources, features, and schedule.
&quot;So you see, we decided that the only way to include this feature
was to slip the ship date, and we don't want to do that. We want to
get this version of RMS out on time so that our users will begin to
trust our word. Even though the project management feature is
important, we didn't feel it was a core feature of the product, so
we decided to hold it until Version 2.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And how do I know there will be a Version 2?&quot; asked Jim,
skeptically. &quot;Promises are cheap, but they're sometimes hard
to keep.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You'll know there will be a Version 2 when we deliver
Version 1 on time,&quot; said Dan, &quot;because you'll see that we
keep our word. We'll start on Version 2 immediately after we
deliver Version 1 and we'll follow the same process we did for the
first version.&quot;</p>

<p>Jim thought about all this for a moment and then said, &quot;Dan,
you came to us with high recommendations from the law firm. One thing
they noted was that almost all of your projects came in on time and on
spec.&quot; He paused, looked at Bill, then continued. &quot;No offense
meant this time, Bill, but I've never seen our development staff
deliver either on time or on spec, much less both at once. I guess
I'm just skeptical. If you and Dan and all the rest of you can
deliver what's in this document within the time frame you've
outlined, then I can wait for Version 2 for my project management
feature.&quot;</p>

<p>The room fell silent for moment, until Tim looked at Dan and said,
&quot;So, did we mitigate that risk, or just avoid it?&quot; Everyone
froze and looked at Jim, wondering how he would take Tim's comment.
Jim stared at Tim for moment, then started laughing, and everyone
relaxed.</p>

<p>Jim turned to Bill. &quot;I'm sorry I came on like that. I guess
I think I can make software happen just by fiat.&quot; He stuck out his
hand, and after a pause, Bill slowly took it.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I guess I sorta lost my cool, too. Sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hope,&quot; said Dan, &quot;that in about seven weeks,
you'll both can shake hands again. That will mean we delivered
Version 1 on time, and we can all start work on Version 2 with
Jim's feature added. To get there, though, we've got to get
going on the rest of today's agenda, so let's move
forward.&quot;</p>

<p>The team worked through the draft Vision Document, making some minor
changes, but basically keeping it intact. When they finished, Dan said,
&quot;Alright, Bill, show time! Are you guys ready to give us a glimpse
of the RMS of the future?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; Bill said, as Sam and Beth moved into position.
Beth put her flowchart on the easel at the head of the table, while Sam
set up a monitor at the other end. &quot;First, we're going to look
at Beth's chart of the data flow and program flow for the
application. Then, we'll see what Sam's done with the major
screens for RMS and get your feedback.&quot;</p>

<p>Working through the flowchart didn't take much time at all, as
RMS was a fairly simple application. When Sam turned on his monitor and
navigated through several well laid out screens. Marilou whistled.
&quot;Wow, Sam, you got this done since last Wednesday?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Actually, after Bill brought us the draft Vision Document, I
didn't like what we had, so I redid most of it over the
weekend,&quot; Sam replied. He minimized the Visual Basic application
that contained the screens. &quot;Watch this.&quot;</p>

<p>Sam started up the browser on his laptop, loaded a file from his
local hard drive, and suddenly they were looking at a time-entry table
inside the browser. &quot;I thought you might like to see what a
Web-based client might look like,&quot; he said, grinning.</p>

<p>&quot;How'd you get that laid out so quickly, Sam? That's
pretty good work.&quot; Dan looked at the various tables and links,
obviously impressed. &quot;Why, it even looks like the spreadsheet
I've seen some of our folks using to calculate their
time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's because it's based on that spreadsheet. With
Office being so HTML-capable, I simply did a spreadsheet the way I
wanted it, saved it as HTML, and then tweaked it a little bit.
Didn't take very long at all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, but making it actually do something would take a lot
longer,&quot; said Bill, frowning. &quot;Don't go getting any ideas
about your Web-based client, Marilou.&quot;</p>

<p>Marilou just grinned. &quot;I'll just save this little
demonstration till the Planning Phase, when we get to arm-wrestle over
which client to build.&quot;</p>

<p>The team took some time to examine each screen in detail, affirming
some and making suggestions about others. Sam and Beth both took notes,
and Sam promised that the final prototype would be ready by
Wednesday's meeting.</p>

<p>Finally, Dan said, &quot;I think we've covered it as well as we
need to. Good work, Beth and Sam. I think we've all got a much
better feel for what RMS could be.&quot; He looked at his
watch&#8212;almost 10:00 A.M. Time to wrap it up. &quot;Does anyone have
any questions? No? Okay, here's the plan for Wednesday.</p>

<p>&quot;Wednesday is our final Envisioning Phase meeting. We'll
finalize our Vision Document and our risk assessment document, and look
at the revised prototype. By then I'll have finished the project
structure document, which is basically a background document about the
project and the team. Finally, we'll make a go/no-go decision at
that meeting.&quot; He picked up one of the thick packets he had passed
out earlier. &quot;In here is your reading material for Wednesday. This
is the outline of the Planning Phase, including information about the
MSF Design Process. It's a lot, I know, but you need to read it
between now and Wednesday morning. Once we finish Envisioning, we want
to be ready to move right into Planning and start mapping out the
design. Everyone understand?&quot; The team nodded, and everyone rose
from the table and began to pack up.</p>

<p>As they did so, Tim turned to Jim with the box of doughnuts.
&quot;Ready for one of these now?&quot; Jim looked first at the box and
then at Tim. Laughing, he took one, and they walked out together,
confectioner's sugar dusting the floor as they went.</p>

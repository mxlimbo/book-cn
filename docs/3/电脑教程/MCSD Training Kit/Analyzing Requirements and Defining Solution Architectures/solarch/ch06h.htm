<A NAME="321"><H1>Case Study 6 -- Planning RMS</H1></A>

<p>&quot;Alright, everyone, confession time. Did you read the material
for today?&quot;</p>

<p>Dan was standing at the head of the conference table, sipping a cup
of coffee. He had just put a transparency on the overhead projector
showing the MSF Development Process Model, with the Planning Phase
highlighted. The first meeting of the Planning Phase had started about
fifteen minutes earlier, and the team had already worked through Agenda
Building and a review of the Envisioning Phase.</p>

<p>After a moment of silence, Tim piped up, &quot;I cannot tell a lie,
Dan. I didn't touch it. We had that server go down, and that virus
problem in Cleveland, and I just didn't get to it.&quot;</p>

<p>Jane grinned at him. &quot;What, you didn't pull one of your
patented all-nighters to be ready for today?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I could have, but I figured putting all that info in my head
wouldn't do any good if my head was on the table all through the
meeting.&quot;</p>

<p>After the chuckles died down, Marta broke in timidly, &quot;Well, I
read all of it, but it was slow going. Frankly, I didn't understand
most of it.&quot; Across the table, Jane nodded in agreement.</p>

<p>&quot;That's understandable, Marta,&quot; said Dan. &quot;After
all, application development isn't your area of expertise, nor is
it Jane's, or even Tim's. That's why we're going to
review some of the information as we go along.&quot; He turned to Bill.
&quot;On the other hand, Bill, development <i>is</i> your area, so it
should have been an easier read for you. Were you able to get through
it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Scanned the whole thing Wednesday night,&quot; said Bill
gruffly, opening his project notebook. &quot;It looks to me like a lot
of make-work. Putting out reams of paperwork doesn't make a program
appear out of thin air. And another thing: I grant you that RMS is
important, but it's not really <i>big</i> as applications go. Why
are we doing all this planning work when we could just cut to the chase
and crank the thing out?&quot;</p>

<P><A HREF="javascript:fullSize('gcs6ar01x.htm')" onMouseOver="window.status='Click to view at full size';return true;" onMouseOut="window.status='';return true;"><IMG SRC="images/gcs6ar01.jpg" WIDTH=404 HEIGHT=511 BORDER=0 ALT="Click to view at full size"></A></P>


<p>Before Dan could respond, Marilou jumped in. &quot;Oh, you're
just grumpy because you're planning on taking off early today, and
you're afraid all this planning work is going to cut down on your fishing time.&quot; Bill asked how she
knew he was leaving early. &quot;Because when I pulled into the parking
garage,&quot; Marilou answered, &quot;There was your big blue truck
with a fishing boat taking up five parking spaces!&quot;</p>

<p>Everyone laughed except Bill, who looked sheepish. Tim leaned over
and said, &quot;She got you again, old man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's OK, Bill. If we work hard, we should play hard
too.&quot; Dan said, &quot;I've seen your car here before mine most
mornings, and after mine most evenings. When we get done here, go catch
a few for me.&quot; He walked to the whiteboard. &quot;Bill has raised
some important questions, though, and I think we ought to consider them
for a moment before we look at the planning materials.&quot; As he drew
the MSF Development Process Model on the board, he said,
&quot;Bill's right&#8212;we could skip some of the MSF work and
probably get the RMS application out the door sooner. So why am I
insisting we do this project 'by the book'? Because we have some
much bigger projects in the pipeline, ones that absolutely require a
framework like MSF. I don't want to introduce MSF on one of those
because of the risk of failure. I want a high-profile, quick-hit win
for MSF so that everyone understands its value and buys into it as the
way Ferguson and Bardell does development. This project fits that bill
perfectly. So even though it may be overkill, we're going to walk
the MSF process step by step, both to learn it ourselves and to sell it
to the rest of the organization.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Like Jim Stewart?&quot; asked Tim, devouring a doughnut.</p>

<p>&quot;Like Jim, and Bill's development team, and the head of
engineering, and any number of other people who are watching this
project closely. They know what we've promised, and they are
watching to see if we make it. I want them to know that they can make a
request of the IT department and get a response in a reasonable amount
of time. I also want them to understand, through their interactions
with Jane, Marilou, and Marta, just what a reasonable time frame truly
is. I want this project to have some ROI other than the benefits of the
project itself.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan turned back to the board and drew a triangle beside the model
diagram. &quot;There's another reason we're going to do this
exactly by the book, and that is its impact on Ferguson and
Bardell's enterprise architecture.&quot; He wrote <i>EA</i> inside
the triangle and drew a looping arrow between the triangle and the
model. &quot;The work we do for this project is based in part on our
enterprise architecture. In the end, though, the architecture will be
changed by our work. So, the two are interactive in an ongoing, dynamic
way.&quot; He wrote the word <i>documentation</i> on top of the arrow
and turned to Bill. &quot;That's one of the reasons for the paper
work. The artifacts we produce during the RMS project will be
incorporated into the documentation of our EA.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've been hearing about EA,&quot; said Marilou.
&quot;Someone was saying that that smart-aleck Kevin Kennedy was
working on a project to create our enterprise architecture. As if his
ego needed any boosting.&quot;</p>

<p>Ignoring the personal commentary, Dan replied, &quot;The rumor mill
has it only partly right, Marilou. You don't <i>create</i> an
enterprise architecture, because it already exists on its own. What
Kevin and the others on that team are doing is <i>documenting</i> our
existing EA and planning the next revision of it. The RMS project is
related to their planning, and they will incorporate the output of our
Planning Phase into their work. In addition, we will be coordinating
with them later in the process.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan moved back to the table and sat down. &quot;There are two keys
to not getting bogged down in planning and documentation in MSF. The
first is <i>balance</i>. You want to cover all the bases at a level of
detail that is appropriate to the scope and importance of the project.
The bigger or more important the project, the more planning and
documentation you need to do.</p>

<p>&quot;The second key is <i>scheduling</i>. At the beginning, we put
together a tentative project schedule showing when we wanted to hit
certain major milestones. By keeping our eyes on those deadlines, we
keep ourselves from spending too much time on one step. We have to keep
moving to hit those deadlines.&quot; Dan paused, then asked, &quot;Is
everyone OK with this? Do you understand why we have to do all the
pieces of the Planning Phase?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Makes me feel like the neurotic in the old joke,&quot; said
Jane. Seeing Dan's puzzlement, she continued, &quot;My
husband's a therapist, and he once asked me if I knew the
difference between a psychotic and a neurotic. When I said 'No,' he
told me that the psychotic says, 'Two plus two is five.' The
neurotic says, 'Two plus two is four, but I don't like
it!'&quot; After the chuckles died down, Jane continued,
&quot;I'm like that neurotic. I understand why we have to do it,
but I don't like it. It looks like a lot of work.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is, Jane,&quot; said Dan with a nod. &quot;The Planning
Phase is detailed, sometimes tedious work. It is also the key to the
success of the project. The quality of the planning work we do directly
affects the quality of the application we deliver.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the sooner we get going, the sooner my folks can start
building that application,&quot; said Bill with a hint of impatience.
&quot;We're all convinced, Dan, even me. I'd rather be coding,
but I see the need. So let's move to the next agenda
item.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good idea, Bill,&quot; said Dan. They all refocused their
attention as he changed the transparency. &quot;Let's take a look,
then, at what we've got in front of us.&quot;</p>

<A NAME="429"><H1>Case Study 7 -- Introducing COM+</H1></A>


<p>The information provided in this case study is taken from the
Microsoft white paper <i>Designing COM+ Applications</i>, supplied by
the COM+ team.</p>

<p>&quot;Dan, I'm glad I ran into you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bill, somehow I don't believe this was a chance
encounter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you're right.&quot; Bill smiled glumly. &quot;The
other day, when we met with the Enterprise Architecture team, I said
the RMS application would not use the new version of COM being released
with Windows 2000. We're still not using COM+, but we're using
a lot of the technology that it's based on. I've been getting
lots of questions from the development team about this new stuff.
We're not sure our design for RMS will work in the COM+
world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bill, you're starting to sound like one of your young,
hot-shot, super geeks. There is always some about-to-be-released
technology that will change the world. Somehow, the world always
survives. Why do you think COM+ would have that much effect on
RMS?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well I'm sure my team would love to save the world, but
we'll just settle for saving the company. You now how a big part of
MSF is versioned releases? We're just trying to make sure our
design is solid for now and later.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan paused as he realized the positive effect MSF was having on the
development team. &quot;I guess you <i>can</i> teach an old dog new
tricks. You're right. You know, I was at an executive briefing last
year where I heard a great presentation on COM+. I made a few friends
on that trip; I'll see what I can do.&quot;</p>

<A NAME="176"><H1>Waterfall Model</H1></A>

<p>The common metaphor of building a house is often used to describe
the traditional approach to application development. The builder first
gathers information from the customer about his or her needs and
desires, determines what needs to be built, designs the structure, and
constructs it from the plans. The builder must ensure that the building
holds together and that all the components, from the electricity and
plumbing to the doorbell, are fully functional. The customer 
then tests everything to ensure that all elements meet expectations.
Even after the customer moves into the new home, the builder must
occasionally come back to fix minor problems.</p>

<p>The stages of building a house are similar to the stages of the
Waterfall Model of application development. As shown in Figure 4.1, the
tightly defined Waterfall Model is an orderly, highly structured
process based on the following well-defined development steps:</p>

<ul>

<p><li> Gathering system and software requirements</li></p>

<p><li> Analysis</li></p>

<p><li> Program design</li></p>

<p><li> Coding and unit testing</li></p>

<p><li> System integration</li></p>

<p><li> System testing</li></p>

<p><li> Operation acceptance</li></p>

</ul>

<p>Each step is completed and thoroughly documented before the next
step can begin.</p>

<p>Strict use of the Waterfall Model is declining. Following this model
causes several problems throughout the product life cycle, which are
summarized below.</p>

<ul>

<p><li> <b>Extra time</b> Typically more time than was initially scheduled
is needed to integrate subsystems into a complete, working
application.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Late design changes</b> Design flaws that require significant
changes to the product are discovered late in the software coding
process. Rarely is tangible design validation performed in the
project's early stages.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Inadequate risk resolution</b> The project's risks are not
resolved until late in the product life cycle.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Lack of requirement revisions</b> The project's
requirements must be stated and frozen at the first stages of the
development process. Often, the project's stakeholders don't
completely understand the business and product requirements at the
beginning of project. With most software projects, requirements are
clarified and changed throughout the project, which dramatically
increases product cost and delays ship times. If the changes are not
integrated into the product, the stakeholders don't think the
product they receive is the one they requested.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Limited opportunities for input</b> The traditional practice
allows a single review process to finalize each project stage. This
single opportunity to voice concerns and suggest changes produces an
over-sensitized focus on details that can lead to adversarial
relationships between project stakeholders.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Lack of review</b> The first four stages of the Waterfall Model
are paper-based exercises, and to prove that the project is
progressing, reams of paper may be produced as each stage is completed.
As volumes of system documentation are presented, the most understood
portions are often the ones that are reviewed, while the more complex
portions are simply assumed to be correct.</li></p>

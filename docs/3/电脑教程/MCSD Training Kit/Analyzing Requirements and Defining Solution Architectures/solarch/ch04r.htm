<p>Dan stood up. &quot;Thanks, Jim, for your help with this. I think
you certainly opened our eyes to some of the implications of this
system and why we are considering writing a replacement for it.&quot; He turned to Marta,
Bill, and Jane. &quot;Thanks also to the three of you for giving us a
good idea of both the process and the issues in your areas. I think we
have a very clear picture of how time and billing works and of what the
issues are with it. Alright, any questions? Tim?&quot;</p>

<p>Tim was tapping his pencil on the table. &quot;You just said we were
'considering' writing a replacement for time and billing. Sounds to
me like we don't need to 'consider' it. We just need to <i>do</i> it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know it seems that way, but remember, all we've heard is
the current situation. We haven't done any work to find out the
cost of writing a replacement, and we can't do that until we agree
on what the replacement will look like. We have to agree on a vision
for the solution and then come up with a cost for that vision. Then
we'll be able to decide whether it makes sense to build something.
That's part of the beauty of MSF. If we follow it properly, we
won't start any projects that should never have been started, or
commit significant resources to something before we are sure it
warrants them.</p>


<p>&quot;Any other questions? No? Alright, then, here are our
assignments.</p>


<p>&quot;I will capture what we've written on the whiteboard and
add it to the project directory. You'll find it listed as 'Initial
Issues' in the 'Envisioning' directory.</p>


<p>&quot;Jane, would you please work with Jim over the next few days to
put a finer point to that cost-of-money figure? If we decide we can
design a solution that will enable us to cut our invoice cycle to one
week, we're going to need a solid number as part of our cost
analysis. Jim, is that OK with you? Do you have the time?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How about it, Jane? Do you have some time to work on this with
me?&quot; Jim asked.</p>

<p>&quot;We've got a few people out tomorrow, so it may be tough,
but I think I can move things around to free up some time. How about
this afternoon?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Two o'clock?&quot; Jim suggested, and Jane nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;Good,&quot; said Dan. He began handing out packets of paper,
already punched for the team's binders. &quot;Here is your reading
material for our next meeting. Be sure you've already covered the
MSF Development Team Model and MSF Development Process Model material.
The new stuff is about goal-setting and iterative design. Be ready to
use it on Monday morning. Same time, same place. We're just about
ready to get creative with time and billing.&quot;</p>

<p>As the group filed out of the conference room, Marta turned to Tim.
&quot;I've used the term 'iterative' before, but I'm not
sure it means the same in an IT setting like this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The best definition I can think of is the one I read on the
wall of the computer lab in school, Tim replied. &quot;It said
'Iterative, noun; see iterative.'&quot; They both laughed and
headed to their offices.</p>

<p>At the mention of the acronym, the other members of the team
realized that they were moving to the next item on the agenda and got
out notepads and pens. Dan turned down the room lights and laid his
first transparency on the overhead projector's glass. It showed an
arrow going in a circle, divided into three different sections.</p>

<p>&quot;Bill and Tim, you both took the MSF training we held in
January, so some of this will just be review. Marilou, I seem to
remember that you borrowed the material from the IT library in
February. Were you able to go through it?&quot; Marilou nodded.
&quot;Good. So, Jane and Marta are the only ones who haven't seen
this before. I'll get both of you a copy of the basic material, so
you can look it over 
before the next meeting. For now, I want to go over some of the key
points that apply to today's agenda. As we move through this
project, we'll spend part of each meeting reviewing the pertinent
MSF material for that phase of the project.</p>
<p>&quot;MSF stands for Microsoft Solutions Framework, and it is just
that: a framework. It is a set of principles, models, and processes on
which we can build our own project-management framework, metrics, and
procedures. It is both conceptual and pragmatic, and comes out of the
experiences of Microsoft and many other firms as they struggle with
using technology to further business goals.</p>

<p>&quot;This arrow represents the ongoing work of the IT department.
That work falls under one of these three rubrics: Plan, Build, or
Manage. Notice that the arrow is going in a circle, indicating that the
work is iterative. In other words, we never stop planning, building,
and managing.&quot;</p>

<p>He replaced the first transparency with the next one. It showed
another arrow going in a circle, but this time the circle was divided
into four sections instead of three.</p>

<p>&quot;This diagram shows one of the models of MSF, the Development
Process Model. This is a model of the process we are going to follow as
we work through our project together. The process has four phases:
Envisioning, Planning, Developing, and Stabilizing. In other words,
first we have to get a vision for what the problem really is and what
our solution might be. Then, we have to do the hard, detailed work of
building plans to carry out the solution. Once the plans are complete,
we have to develop the solution. Finally, we have to deploy the
solution and make it stable and usable. There are many more details to
this model which we will fill in as we go along, but that's the
gist of it for now.&quot;</p>

<p>Jane squinted at the image on the screen. &quot;What are those
diamond-looking things at the points of the compass? They look like
bases on a baseball field.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Glad you asked, Jane. Those are milestones. Each phase of the
project concludes with a milestone, which is a time for all the members
of the team to review progress, resynchronize objectives, and make any
mid-course corrections needed. There are also milestones within each
phase. We'll cover these as we move through the phases.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan turned off the overhead projector and turned the lights back up.
He pointed to a box on the credenza. &quot;I have gotten each of you a
binder for this project, and I'll be handing out various MSF
materials for you to review as we move through the work. One of your
assignments for the next meeting will be to review the sections
I've already put in the binders. They are the parts of MSF that are
specific to developing new software applications. Which leads us to
RMS.&quot;</p>

<A NAME="170"><H1>RMS Application</H1></A>

<p>Dan leaned back against the credenza. &quot;RMS stands for Resource
Management System. It is a new application that we are going to develop
for use throughout Ferguson and Bardell, including all the branch
offices. As I've already said, RMS is both a critical and a highly
visible project. In fact, all the employees of the firm are resources
that RMS will manage, and RMS will handle the scheduling and time
tracking of those employees as well. In other words, every person at
Ferguson and Bardell will be able to see and use the results of this
team's work. And, since RMS will provide the means we'll use to
gather time and billing information, everyone's paycheck will
depend on RMS being both effective and stable.&quot;</p>

<p>As the significance of the project began to sink in, the room became
very quiet. Dan waited a moment and then continued. &quot;Normally,
developing such an application would have been handled exclusively by
the Chief and his crew. In thinking about the RMS project, though, I
decided that it was the perfect project for introducing MSF to Ferguson
and Bardell. I think, as you begin to understand the value that MSF can
bring to a company, you'll see what I mean.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me make one thing very clear from the beginning: My
decision to involve all of you, and to do the RMS project using MSF
methods, does <i>not</i> mean that I don't trust the Chief or his
team. He and I have already discussed RMS and why I wanted to tackle it
this way.&quot;</p>

<p>Jane interjected, &quot;But Dan, you said this was a project to
develop a new piece of software. How can that involve me? I haven't
the slightest clue how to&#8212;what was that you called it,
Bill?&#8212;'crank out code.' I barely know how to record a macro in
Word. What good am I to a project that is supposed to write a new time
and billing system?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am wondering why you asked me to be part of this team,
too,&quot; Marta added. &quot;It is true I did some programming in
college, but I suspect you are not going to write this application in
either GBASIC or Fortran. Therefore, my question is the same as
Jane's: What am I doing here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Excellent questions, and certainly understandable,&quot; Dan
replied. &quot;Let me explain what you both are doing here&#8212;indeed,
what each of us is doing here&#8212;by way of these next few
transparencies.&quot; And with that, he turned the projector back
on.</p>

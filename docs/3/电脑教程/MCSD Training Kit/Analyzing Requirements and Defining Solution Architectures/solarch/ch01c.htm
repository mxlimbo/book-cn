<A NAME="31"><H1>Microsoft Solutions Framework (MSF)</H1></A>

<p>MSF is a collection of models, principles, and practices that helps
organizations be more effective in their creation and use of technology
to solve their business problems. It helps by providing measurable
progress and rigorous guidance that is flexible enough to meet the
changing needs of an organization. The core building blocks for this
MSF-based solutions guidance are the six major models:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> MSF Enterprise Architecture Model</li></p>

<p><li> MSF Team Model for Application Development</li></p>

<p><li> MSF Process Model for Application Development</li></p>

<p><li> MSF Risk Management Model</li></p>

<p><li> MSF Design Process Model</li></p>

<p><li> MSF Application Model</li></p>
</ul>



<p>We describe each model briefly below. In later
chapters we show how they can be applied to application development
projects.</p>

<A NAME="32"><H2>MSF Enterprise Architecture Model</H2></A>

<p>The MSF Enterprise Architecture Model provides a consistent set of
guidelines for rapidly building enterprise architecture through
versioned releases. The model aligns information technology with
business requirements through four perspectives: Business, Application,
Information, and Technology. Using this model helps shorten the
enterprise architecture planning cycle.</p>

<A NAME="33"><H2>MSF Team Model for Application Development</H2></A>

<p>The MSF Team Model for Application Development (MSF Development Team
Model) provides a flexible structure for organizing project teams. It
emphasizes both clear roles and responsibilities and clear goals for
team success, and it increases team member accountability through its
team of peers approach. Its flexibility means that it can be adapted
depending on the scope of the project, the size of the team, and the
skills of the team members. Using this model and its underlying
principles and practices helps produce more engaged, effective,
resilient, and successful teams.</p>

<A NAME="34"><H2>MSF Process Model for Application Development</H2></A>

<p>The MSF Process Model for Application Development (MSF Development
Process Model) provides structure and guidance through a project's
life cycle that is milestone-based, iterative, and flexible. It
describes the phases, milestones, activities and deliverables of an
application development project and their relationship to the roles of
the MSF Development Team Model. Using this model helps improve project
control, minimize risk, improve quality, and shorten delivery time.</p>

<A NAME="35"><H2>MSF Risk Management Model</H2></A>

<p>The MSF Risk Management Model provides a structured and proactive
way to manage project risks. It sets forth a discipline and environment
of proactive decisions and actions to continuously assess what can go
wrong, determine what risks are important to deal with, and then
implement strategies to deal with 
those risks. Using this model and its underlying principles and
practices helps teams focus on what is most important, make the right
decisions, and be better prepared for when the unknown future becomes
known.</p>

<A NAME="36"><H2>MSF Design Process Model</H2></A>

<p>The MSF Design Process Model provides a three-phase, user-centric
continuum that allows for a parallel and iterative approach to design
for the greatest efficiency and flexibility. Three different
phases&#8212;Conceptual Design, Logical Design, and Physical
Design&#8212;provide three different perspectives for three different
audiences&#8212;users, the project team, and developers. Moving from
Conceptual Design through Logical Design to Physical Design shows the
translation of user-based scenarios to services-based components so
that application features can be traced back to user requirements.
Using this model helps ensure that applications are created not just
for the sake of technology, but to meet business and user
requirements.</p>

<A NAME="37"><H2>MSF Application Model</H2></A>

<p>The MSF Application Model provides a logical, three-tier,
services-based approach to designing and developing software
applications. The use of user services, business services, and data
services allows for parallel development, better use of technology,
easier maintenance and support, and the greatest flexibility in
distribution, because the services that make up the application can
reside anywhere from a single desktop to servers and clients around the
world.</p>

<A NAME="38"><H2>Presentation of MSF in This Book</H2></A>

<p>Throughout this book, we use the basic concepts of MSF to provide a
foundation for our discussions of enterprise architecture and
enterprise application development. The MSF models and their key
principles originate within the MSF team at Microsoft. In this book, we
draw heavily on materials provided by the MSF team. Rather than
limiting ourselves to these materials, however, we also draw on other
sources and our own application development experience to round out
these concepts and show how they can be applied in practical ways
within an organization. When discussing MSF concepts, we try to
distinguish information drawn from places other than official MSF
sources wherever it is possible to do so in a way that does not detract
from the readability of the text and the cohesiveness of the approach
to application development we are trying to present.</p>

<A NAME="191"><H1>MSF Development Process Model</H1></A>

<p>Traditional approaches to software development, such as the
Waterfall and Spiral Models, often cannot meet the needs of today's
enterprise application development environments.</p>

<p>With the Waterfall Model, a project progresses through sequential
steps, from the initial concept through system testing. This model
identifies milestones along the course of the project and uses them as
transition and assessment points. This approach works well for a
project in which requirements can easily be specified at the beginning,
but may not work well for a complex project where requirements can
change during the project's life cycle. Additionally, practitioners
of this model rely heavily on volumes of documentation and a single
review process for each stage. These two Waterfall practices usually
lead to overextended &quot;analysis paralysis&quot; and adversarial
relationships between developers, customers, and users.</p>

<p>Using the Spiral Model, the application evolves over a number of
iterations. Early passes through the Spiral life cycle provide
increasingly tight definitions of the product, with middle and later
iterations adding features and functionality to the application. The
Spiral Model seeks to confront project risks early in a software
project and address them in early product releases. Due to its
iterative nature, the Spiral Model supports creative adjustments along
the way, thus evolving and hopefully improving the quality of product.
The highly iterative Spiral process requires significant amounts of
process and documentation automation to become efficient. In practice,
customers and users may develop a general sense of instability because
the product can change too rapidly for them to grasp. Finally, many
Spiral projects lack a known ending point, so they continue to iterate
indefinitely with no financial or business end within site.</p>

<p>As shown in Figure 4.5, the MSF Development Process Model combines
the strengths of these two models, providing the benefits of
milestone-based planning from the Waterfall Model and the benefits of
the iterative creative process from the Spiral Model.</p>

<P><!-- caption --><b>Figure 4.5</b> <i> MSF Development Process Model</i><!-- /caption --></P>

<p>The MSF Development Process Model has three primary traits:</p>

<ul>

<p><li> A phased process (the four wedges of the diagram in Figure
4.5).</li></p>

<p><li> A milestone-driven process (the diamonds separating the
phases).</li></p>

<p><li> An iterative process (the process arrow aiming back into the
first phase).</li></p>

</ul>

<p>Although Figure 4.5 shows the four phases as quarters, the phases do
not necessarily require equal amounts of time to complete. Different
business and technological environments will require different time and
resource ratios for the various phases.</p>


<A NAME="192"><H2>Phased Process</H2></A>

<p>The MSF Development Process Model consists of four interrelated
phases. Each of these phases represent deliverables for which a
baseline should be established before the development process can move
to the next phase of the project. The four phases and their primary
tasks are:</p>

<ul>

<p><li> Envisioning, which must produce a shared vision.</li></p>

<p><li> Planning, which must produce a detailed project plan and
application architecture.</li></p>

<p><li> Developing, which must produce a well-built, complete
product.</li></p>

<p><li> Stabilizing, which must produce a stable, deployed product.</li></p>

</ul>


<A NAME="193"><H2>Milestone-Driven Process</H2></A>

<p>The MSF Development Process Model is based on milestones that are
points for review and synchronization, rather than points for freezing
the application or its specifications. They enable the team to assess
the project's progress and make midcourse corrections, such as
adjusting the scope of the project to reflect changing customer
requirements, or reacting to risks that may materialize during the
course of the project.</p>

<p>The MSF Development Process Model uses two types of milestones: <i>
major milestones</i> and <i>interim milestones</i>. Each milestone,
whether major or interim, is marked by one or more <i>deliverables</i>.
Deliverables are physical evidence that the team has reached a
milestone.</p>


<A NAME="194"><H3>Major Milestones</H3></A>

<p>Each phase of the development process culminates in an externally
visible major milestone. <i>Externally visible</i> means that the
milestone and its deliverables are visible to entities outside the
project team, such as the customer or operations personnel.</p>

<p>A major milestone is a point in time when all team members
synchronize their deliverables. Additionally, those external to the
project team such as the customer and users; operations, support, and
help desk personnel; the distribution channel (commercial software);
and other key project stakeholders, should be updated on the project
status.</p>

<p>A significant role of major milestones is to allow for a
stage-by-stage assessment of the project's viability. The project
team and the customer, having reviewed the deliverables for the current
phase, jointly make the decision whether or not to move into the next
phase. Thus, major milestones serve to move the project from one phase
to another.</p>


<A NAME="195"><H3>Interim Milestones</H3></A>

<p>Within each phase of the MSF Development Process Model are various
interim milestones, which, like major milestones, are review and
synchronization points, rather than freeze points. Unlike major
milestones, however, interim milestones are <i>internally
visible</i>&#8212;that is, visible only to members of the project
team.</p>

<p>Interim milestones indicate early progress and break large work
assignments into smaller pieces that are easier to address.</p>


<A NAME="196"><H2>Versioned Process</H2></A>

<p>The MSF Development Process Model is a versioned process in the
sense that it is designed to be repeated during the life cycle of a
given product. Each succeeding completion of the MSF Development
Process Model allows for the addition of features and functionality in
order to satisfy changing business requirements.</p>

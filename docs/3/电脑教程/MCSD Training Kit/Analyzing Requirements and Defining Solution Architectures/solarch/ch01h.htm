<A NAME="69"><H1>Case Study 1 -- Developing an Enterprise Architecture</H1></A>



<p>Tim O'Brien, the Network Manager for Ferguson and Bardell, poked
his head into the CIO's office. &quot;You wanted to see me,
Dan?&quot; he started to say, and then realized that the office was
empty.</p>

<p>He was turning to leave when he heard a scuffling noise, followed by
grunting and more scuffling. Either Dan Shelly had trapped a gorilla
under his desk, or there was someone in his office.</p>

<p>Tim advanced into the room slowly, not wanting to be too far from
the exit because of the gorilla possibility. He heard the grunting
again and realized it came from between the desk and the credenza. He
moved around the desk, and there, sitting on the floor, was his
boss.</p>

<p>Dan pulled a cardboard box from the bottom of the credenza, then
grunted as he lifted out a stack of manila folders and dropped them
into his lap. He scanned the titles of the folders and glanced into
some of them, but apparently couldn't find what he was looking for.
With a gesture of disgust, he added the folders to a growing pile
beside him and reached for another set.</p>

<p>Tim couldn't remember when he had ever seen a CIO in such a
position. &quot;But, that's Dan,&quot; he thought. Not much for
pretense when there was work to be done. Tim leaned against the wall
and grinned. &quot;I've already cleaned all the lottery tickets out
of there, if that's what you're looking for.&quot;</p>

<p>Without looking up, Dan replied, &quot;Huh! Wish what I was looking
for was as easy to find as a winning lottery ticket.&quot; He looked at
the last folder in the box, made another sound of disgust, and threw it
onto the stack on the floor. Getting up and brushing himself off, he
turned to Tim. &quot;Is there anywhere else in this building where they
might have stashed information about EA?&quot;</p>

<p>Tim prided himself on keeping up with the industry and its acronyms,
but this one stumped him. He knew ET, CNA, and a bunch of others that
were close, 
but EA? Not a clue. He decided to play along. &quot;Uhm, which EA would
that 
be, Dan?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The one for Ferguson and Bardell, of course,&quot; replied Dan
as he put the folders away and kicked the box back into the credenza.
Straightening up, he saw the confusion on Tim's face and said,
without condescension, &quot;Enterprise Architecture, Tim. I'm
looking for something on Ferguson and Bardell's Enterprise
Architecture.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, <i>that</i>,&quot; said Tim, relieved he didn't have
to guess anymore. Of course, he still had to pretend that he knew what
it meant. &quot;I don't think we have one of those.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan laughed. &quot;No, Tim, we have one. We just don't seem to
have it documented anywhere. Which, by the way, I suspected all along,
and which is why I asked you to stop by.&quot;</p>

<p>He shut the credenza door and sat down at his desk, motioning for
Tim to sit 
opposite him. &quot;Here's the situation, Tim. We're going to
be starting some major projects around here over the next year or so.
Before we can start, though, we need to get an idea of what we have and
why we have it. In short, we need to document our enterprise
architecture, or at least make a first cut at it.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan pulled a folder out of his desk and opened it. &quot;I'm
putting together an inter-disciplinary team that is going to take no
more than two months to do a first draft of our EA and to recommend our
first set of projects.&quot; He glanced at his calendar and said,
&quot;Today is February 22. The kickoff is next Monday, March 1. I want
someone from your area, someone sharp who knows our technology
infrastructure well, and whom you would like to put on an important
project&#8212;either because he or she needs the experience, or likes a challenge.
Can you think of someone who meets those criteria?&quot;</p>

<p>Tim grinned. &quot;Well, I know one guy who fits that profile
exactly: sharp, knows the place, likes a challenge&#8212;me!&quot;</p>

<p>But Dan shook his head. &quot;No, Tim, you're not the right
person for this team. I want someone else from your group.&quot; Seeing
the crestfallen look on Tim's face, Dan continued in a more gentle
tone, &quot;Don't be too disappointed, Tim. I've got another
project coming up that's going to be both big and important, and
your name is already on the list.&quot;</p>

<p>Tim brightened up somewhat when he heard that. &quot;That's
good. I wouldn't want the young bucks to get all the credit around
here!&quot; He and Dan both laughed; Tim's youth was a regular
source of kidding around the department.</p>

<p>Tim thought a moment and then said, &quot;There's that woman we
added last fall, about the time you came aboard. You know, the one
whose name you never can get right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You mean Jenny? Jenny Flute, or Jenny Alto, or &#8230; shoot,
what is her name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Jenny Sax, Dan&#8212;Sax, like saxophone. She's doing good
work with the network on her shift, and I've noticed that she has
already memorized almost all the fixed IP addresses we have. She seems
to have a knack for detail and for documentation, and&#8212;well, her
<i>brain</i> just seems better organized than most of ours. If I
understand what you're looking for, I think she would be
perfect.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She sounds like it,&quot; said Dan. &quot;Can you spare her
for this? It will mean about ten hours a week, possibly more.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It'll mean some adjustments, but we'll handle it.
Besides, it'll make her a better resource later on, and it's
only for two months.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan was pleased at Tim's response. It was exactly what he had
hoped his young Network Manager would say. Tim was already showing the
kind of take-care-of-your-people attitude that made good leaders. Dan
stood and walked Tim to the door of his office. &quot;Thanks for your
willingness to help out, Tim. Ask Jenny to stop by later today so I can
go over the assignment with her. And be watching your e-mail as well.
I'll be announcing the other big project within the next week or
so.&quot;</p>

<p>As Tim said goodbye and left, Dan stood in the doorway of his
office, thinking. &quot;That's one good one on the team,&quot; he
mused. &quot;Sure hope the other managers see the value in this and
send me good people as well. Otherwise,&quot; he reflected as he turned
back to his desk, &quot;this EA project is going to be like lots of
others I've seen&#8212;all technology and no business.&quot;</p>

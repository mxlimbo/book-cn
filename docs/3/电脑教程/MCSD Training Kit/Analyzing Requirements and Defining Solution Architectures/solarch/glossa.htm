<p><a name="103"></a><b>application</b> A grouping of software for the purpose of solving
a business problem.</p>

<p><a name="104"></a><b>application architecture</b> The design and plan for building an
application, as well as certain consistent styles of application
construction.</p>

<p><a name="105"></a><b>Application Model</b> One of the six core models of MSF. The MSF
Application Model for Development (MSF Application Model) provides a
three-tier services-based approach to designing and developing software
applications. MSF views an application at a logical level as a network
of cooperative, distributed, and reusable services that support a
business solution. The model describes applications as using three
services: user, business, and data.</p>

<p><a name="106"></a><b>Application Perspective</b> Part of the Enterprise Application
Model. The enterprise architecture from the point of view of the
applications used to support business processes.</p>

<p><a name="107"></a><b>architecture</b> A design and plan for building something; also,
the style of that plan or design. <i>See also</i> <a href="#136">enterprise
architecture</a>, <a href="#104">application architecture</a>.</p>

<p><a name="108"></a><b>architecture first</b> An approach to IT planning 
and implementation that emphasizes basing such work on a
well-thought-out, well-understood enterprise architecture. It
represents a commitment that all three parts of the IT
task&#8212;planning, building, and managing&#8212;are based on a
coherent, higher-level architecture; that the architecture has been
worked out before the start of the coding work; and that the
architecture drives 
the work.</p>

<p><a name="109"></a><b>artifact</b> Documents of all kinds that are generated as part of
the project. <i>See also</i> <a href="#126">deliverable</a>.</p>

<A NAME="711"><H2>B</H2></A>

<p><a name="110"></a><b>best practice</b> Refers to recommended procedures to follow. The
term does not imply that best practices that will always produce
successful results.</p>

<p><a name="111"></a><b>buffer</b> Time added to a project schedule to help the project

product.</p>

<p><a name="113"></a><b>build strategy</b> One of the four strategies designed to
extricate an organization from the IT abyss. The build strategy
endeavors to define a long-term infrastructure target that increases
flexibility while maintaining cost levels.</p>

<p><a name="114"></a><b>business function</b> Business functions are the highest level of
what business processes are intended to accomplish. For example,
financial management is a business function; accounts 
receivable is a related business process. <i>See also</i> <a href="#116">business
process</a>, <a href="#117">business process decomposition</a>.</p>

<p><a name="115"></a><b>Business Perspective</b> One of the four perspectives in the
Enterprise Architecture Model. The business perspective views the
enterprise architecture from the point of view of the business
processes. It includes broad business strategies and plans for moving
the organization from its current state to its desired future state.
The business perspective describes how the business works. Subtopics
might include the organization's high-level goals and objectives,
the organization's products and services, business processes that
embody the functions and the cross-functional activities performed by
the organization, major organizational structures, and the interaction
of all these elements.</p>

<p><a name="116"></a><b>business process</b> A process is &quot;a structured, measured set
of activities designed to produce a specified output for a particular
customer or market. It implies a strong emphasis on how work is done
within an organization.&quot; (Davenport, Harvard Business Review,
1993). Business processes have customers and in most cases (but not
always) cross-organizational boundaries.</p>

<p><a name="117"></a><b>business process decomposition</b> A top-down hierarchical way of
analyzing in detail an organization's business processes. The flow
of analysis usually proceeds in the following order: function, process,
activity, and task. Business rules and processes usually apply at the
task level. <i>See also</i> <a href="#116">business process</a>.</p>

<A NAME="712"><H2>C</H2></A>

<p><a name="118"></a><b>candidate project list</b> During the planning phase of the
enterprise architecture, determining which IT projects to undertake
requires complex tradeoffs in uncertain situations. The candidate
project list helps IT planners to balance business needs and goals
against technological possibilities and risks and prioritize projects
for a versioned release of the enterprise architecture.</p>

<p><a name="119"></a><b>client/server architecture</b> <i>See</i> <a href="#227">two-tier architecture</a>.</p>

<p><a name="120"></a><b>Conceptual Design</b> The process of acquiring, documenting,
validating, and optimizing business and user perspectives of the
problem and the solution. Its purpose is to capture and understand
business needs and user requirements in their proper context. The
output of Conceptual Design is a set of information models, use cases,
and usage scenarios that document the current and future states of the
system. <i>See also</i> <a href="#166">Logical Design</a>, <a href="#178">Physical Design</a>, <a href="#128">Design Process
Model</a>.</p>

<p><a name="121"></a><b>control strategy</b> One of the four strategies 
designed to extricate an organization from the IT abyss. Organizations
in the IT abyss attempt to get all IT under control by setting
funding 
targets for future application and infrastructure spending.</p>

<p><a name="122"></a><b>controlling risk</b> Addressing the results of risk tracking and
the process as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="123"></a><b>critical success factors</b> The activities, tasks, technology,
funding, and milestone requirements that must be accomplished before an
organization can reach its long-term goals and objectives. Similar to
dependencies.</p>

<p><a name="124"></a><b>current state assessment</b> An assessment of the actual
present-day status of the organization's business processes,
applications, information stores, and technological support made during
the planning phase of the enterprise architecture.</p>

<p><a name="125"></a><b>customer-focused mindset</b> A best practice or principle of a
successful team, it means committing to understanding and solving the
business problem, focusing on the alignment of business and technology,
and involving the customer throughout the process.</p>

<A NAME="713"><H2>D</H2></A>

<p><a name="126"></a><b>deliverable</b> A physical artifact created by the team, usually
associated with reaching an interim or major milestone. It can be the
only product 
or one of several products associated with that milestone.</p>

<p><a name="127"></a><b>design patterns and antipatterns</b> A design pattern is
instructive information that captures the essential structure and
insight of a successful family of proven solutions to a recurring
problem that arises within a certain context and system of forces. It
identifies the key aspects of a common design structure that make it
useful for creating a reusable object-oriented design. Design patterns
can be either generative or non-generative. Generative patterns can be
used to solve engineering problems, whereas non-generative patterns are
merely observed. Generative design patterns provide complete solutions
to business and technical problems. They are primarily geared toward
&quot;green field&quot; designs, meaning they are applied to new
designs.</p>

<p>A design antipattern is geared toward solving problems for which an
inadequate solution is already in place. The best way to differentiate
patterns and antipatterns is to say that patterns lead to an original
solution for a set of criteria and forces, while antipatterns lead to a
new solution when the current design is not working. Thus patterns are
used when starting from scratch, and antipatterns are used to fix
things that are broken.</p>

<p><a name="128"></a><b>Design Process Model</b> One of the six core models of MSF. The
MSF Design Process Model is based on three different
phases&#8212;Conceptual, Logical, and Physical Design&#8212;that provide
three different perspectives for three different audiences&#8212;users,
the project team, and developers.</p>

<p><a name="129"></a><b>desired architecture</b> The future envisioned state of the
enterprise architecture.</p>

<p><a name="130"></a><b>Developing Phase</b> The third of four distinct phases of the MSF
Development Process Model, it is the period during which all projects
for the versioned release are initiated. It culminates in the Scope
Complete Milestone, indicating all projects have been started and
preparations have been made for external testing and stabilization.</p>

<p><a name="131"></a><b>Development Process Model</b> One of the six core models of MSF.
The MSF Process Model for Application Development (MSF Development
Process Model) is a project life-cycle model that is milestone-based,
iterative, and flexible. It describes the phases, milestones,
activities and deliverables of an application development project and
their relationship to the roles of the MSF Development Team Model. It
includes four phases (<a href="#140">Envisioning</a>, <a href="#180">Planning</a>, <a href="#130">Developing</a>, and
<a href="#215">Stabilizing</a>), each with its own major milestone (<a href="#234">Vision Approved</a>,
<a href="#189">Project Plan Approved</a>, <a href="#212">Scope Complete</a>, and <a href="#191">Release</a>). <i>See also</i>

technology consultant to the team and is responsible for actually
writing the application.</p>

<p><a name="133"></a><b>Development Team Model</b> One of the six core models of MSF. The
MSF Team Model for Application Development (MSF Development Team Model)
provides a flexible structure for organizing project teams. It
emphasizes both clear roles and responsibilities and clear goals for
team success, and it increases team member accountability through its
team of peers approach. It consists of six roles: <a href="#186">Product Management</a>, <a href="#188">Program Management</a>, <a href="#132">Development</a>, <a href="#232">User Education</a>, <a href="#222">Testing</a>, and <a href="#167">Logistics Management</a>. <i>See also</i> each of the six roles, respectively.</p>

<p><a name="134"></a><b>digital nervous system</b> Analogous to a biological nervous
system in that it provides an organization with the information it

maintain a competitive advantage.</p>

<A NAME="714"><H2>E</H2></A>

<p><a name="135"></a><b>Enterprise Application Model</b> An architecture model for
designing and building enterprise applications. The model consists of
six submodels: Business, User, Logical, Technology, Physical, and
Development.</p>

<p><a name="136"></a><b>enterprise architecture</b> A structure that describes the
organization's business activities, the applications and automation
that support those business activities, the information necessary to
carry out those business activities, and the technologies and
infrastructure used to deliver the applications and information. It
results in a logically consistent plan of activities and coordinated
projects that guide the progression of an organization's
application systems and infrastructure. The plan should move from the
current state to a desired future state based on current and projected
business objectives and processes.</p>

<p><a name="137"></a><b>Enterprise Architecture Model</b> One of the six core models of
MSF. The MSF Enterprise Architecture Model provides a consistent set of
guidelines for rapidly building enterprise architecture through
versioned releases. The model aligns information technology with
business requirements through four perspectives: Business, Application,
Information, and Technology.</p>

<p><a name="138"></a><b>enterprise architecture planning</b> The process of working from a
current state to an envisioned future state of the enterprise
architecture. The process anticipates and plans for the obstacles that
impede progress toward initiation of projects that will move the
organization forward.</p>

<p><a name="139"></a><b>enterprise architecture process</b> A rational way to make
decisions that lead to action rather than reporting. Once this rational
process is in place, you can focus on project selection and
prioriti-zation and &quot;plan while building&quot; rather than 
plan first and then build.</p>

<p><a name="140"></a><b>Envisioning Phase</b> The first phase of the MSF Development
Process Model, during which the project team is assembled and comes to
agreement with the customer on the project vision and scope. The
Envisioning Phase culminates in the Vision Approved Milestone.</p>

<p><a name="141"></a><b>execute strategy</b> One of the four strategies designed to

extricate an organization from the IT abyss. A strategy for
organizations that aspire to lead and must focus their energies on
identifying and testing new opportunities while continuing to drive
performance.</p>

<A NAME="715"><H2>F</H2></A>

<p><a name="143"></a><b>feature team</b> In large projects, a multidisciplin-ary subteam
that is responsible for a particular feature set.</p>

<p><a name="144"></a><b>features</b> One of the three sides of the tradeoff triangle, the
other two being resources and schedule, it refers to the product and
its quality.</p>

<p><a name="145"></a><b>four perspectives</b> Together, they make up the 
Enterprise Architecture Model. MSF uses the 
acronym BAIT to refer to the four perspectives: Business, Application,
Information, and Technology.</p>

<p><a name="146"></a><b>function team</b> In large projects, a subteam within a role. They

<p><a name="158"></a><b>IT abyss</b> A model that describes the gap between an enterprise
and its ability to maximize value from its IT investments. The IT abyss
is the most prominent feature of the IT landscape and represents the
present state of an organization on the IT landscape chart, situated
between past and future states. An organization's position relative
to the abyss on the IT landscape chart determines which of four
strategies it should adopt to help it get out of or across the IT
abyss.</p>

<p><a name="159"></a><b>IT assets</b> What the organization has, grouped in three main
areas: application portfolio, technology infrastructure, and IT
organization.</p>

<p><a name="160"></a><b>IT/business performance</b> The organization's current
performance, grouped in two main areas: spending and results.</p>

<p><a name="161"></a><b>IT diagnostic areas</b> Enterprise architecture planners can
evaluate an organization's current IT environment in three key
diagnostic areas: IT assets (what the organization has), IT management
processes (how things are done), and IT/business performance (current
performance).</p>

<p><a name="162"></a><b>IT inventory</b> A quick, high-level inventory across the
enterprise, looking only at the details of the areas that the vision
identifies as being of interest. The IT inventory of an organization
can be divided into three categories:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Applications</b> Systems made up of executable software.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Information</b> Computerized data stores containing
information, often accessed through a database management system.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Technology</b> Hardware, software, and electronic networks that
support applications and data stores.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>For analysis purposes, an organization's IT 
inventory also includes items that are planned or under
development.</p>

<p><a name="163"></a><b>IT landscape</b> A graphical representation of an
organization's IT assets evaluation depicting past, present, and
future performance. The IT abyss model describes varying levels of the
IT landscape. Factors contributing to the IT abyss include IT assets,
IT management processes, and IT business performance.</p>

<p><a name="164"></a><b>IT lifecycle</b> The process of planning, building, and managing
information technology.</p>

<p><a name="165"></a><b>IT management processes</b> How the organization does things,

direction-setting, funding, execution, and review.</p>

<A NAME="718"><H2>L</H2></A>

<p><a name="166"></a><b>Logical Design</b> The process of describing a 
solution in terms of the organization, structure, syntax, and
interaction of its parts from the perspective of the project team. The
purpose of Logical Design is to apply the services-based 
organizing principles of the MSF Application Model, and to lay out the
structure of the solution and the relationship among its parts. The
output of Logical Design is a set of business objects with
corresponding services, attributes, and relationships; a high-level
user interface design; and a logical database design. <i>See also</i>

<A NAME="720"><H2>N</H2></A>

<p><a name="174"></a><b>N-tier architecture</b> An application architecture in which the
presentation, business, and data tiers are logically separated. Also
called three-tier architecture. &quot;N-tier&quot; is becoming the
preferred term since it implies (correctly) that the logical separation
of services can result in more than three tiers. <i>See also</i>

user interface design for a particular platform, and a physical
database design. <i>See also</i> <a href="#120">Conceptual Design</a>, <a href="#166">Logical Design</a>, <a href="#128">Design Process Model</a>.</p>

<p><a name="179"></a><b>plan, build, manage IT lifecycle</b> The fundamental life cycle
upon which MSF is based. Enterprise architecture focuses on the
planning aspects of the MSF lifecycle.</p>

<p><a name="180"></a><b>Planning Phase</b> The second phase of the MSF Development Process
Model that culminates with the Project Plan Approved Milestone.</p>

<p><a name="181"></a><b>postmortem</b> A formal process of reviewing what went right and
what went wrong with a project as a way of learning for the future.</p>

<p><a name="182"></a><b>proactive analysis</b> An evaluation of how new and unused
technologies can be applied to the organization. In this approach,
planners do not treat the boundaries of current business practices as
limitations, but try to change business processes through a new
application of technology in a 
way that adds value to the organization. The proactive approach means
that IT professionals have to imagine future directions that the
organization might take and look for ways to apply new or unexploited
old technologies to business. <i>See also</i> <a href="#190">reactive analysis</a>.</p>

team, it means the team treats the work performed as a product,
enabling it to use a versioned release strategy to prioritize features
and address changes.</p>

<p><a name="188"></a><b>Program Management role</b> One of six MSF team roles. It is
responsible for driving the timely development of the solution. The
program manager drives critical tradeoff decisions, facilitates team
communication, and manages the schedule and resource allocation, but is
not the &quot;boss&quot; as he or she might be in a traditional
top-down project team.</p>

<p><a name="189"></a><b>Project Plan Approved Milestone</b> The major milestone at the end
of the Planning Phase that represents the point at which the project
team, the customer, and key project stakeholders agree on the project
deliverables. This milestone provides an opportunity to establish

the status quo. Then an individual or a team is given the task of
forestalling change or attempting to control change as the organization
drifts toward another&#8212;usually unplanned-for&#8212;state.</p>

<p><a name="191"></a><b>Release Milestone</b> The major milestone at the end of the
Stabilizing Phase that represents the point at which the team has

plan (successful or 
otherwise) into a repository for use and reference by future projects.
Conversely, risks can be simply removed from the risk management
process after they have occurred or been resolved.</p>

<p><a name="194"></a><b>risk</b> The possibility of loss or injury; a problem waiting to

sides are resources (people and money), schedule (time), and features
(the product and its quality). It is used to make project tradeoffs. A
change to one side requires that the team make a correction on one of
the sides to maintain project balance, including potentially the same
side on which the change first occurred.</p>

<p><a name="227"></a><b>two-tier architecture</b> Also known as client/server
architecture. In a two-tier architecture, a client process handles the
data processing and presentation parts of the application. Data is

<A NAME="133"><H1>Project Responsibilities</H1></A>

<p>Rather than being a methodology, MSF is a framework that can be
adapted to suit the particular needs of any organization. The MSF Team
Model for Application Development (MSF Development Team Model) is one
aspect of this framework. The model describes how teams should
structure themselves and what principles they should follow in order to
be successful at developing software.</p>

<p>The MSF Development Team Model is specific in nature, but as part of
the framework, it should be viewed as a starting point. Different
project teams may implement aspects of the framework differently,
depending on the scope of their project, the size of their team, and
the skills of their team members.</p>

<p>Specific responsibilities must be carried out and specific goals
must be met in order for any project to be successful. These
responsibilities and goals serve to provide continual direction for all
the team members. Key project responsibilities and goals include the
following:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Customer satisfaction</b> Projects must meet the needs of their
customers and users in order to be successful. It is possible to meet
budget and time goals but still be unsuccessful because customer needs
have not been met.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Delivery within project constraints</b> Most projects measure
success using &quot;on time, on budget&quot; metrics.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Delivery to specifications based on user requirements</b> The
Functional Specification describes in detail the deliverable to be
provided by the team to the customer. This specification represents an
agreement between the team and the customer as to what will be built,
and constitutes the basis for &quot;Doing what we say we will
do.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Release after identifying and addressing all issues</b> All
software is delivered with defects. The team's goal is to ensure
that those defects are identified and addressed before the product is
released. Addressing defects can involve everything from fixing the
defect in question to documenting work-around solutions. Delivering a
known defect that has been addressed along with a work-around solution
is preferable to delivering a product containing unidentified defects
that may &quot;surprise&quot; the team and the customer later.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Enhanced user performance</b> For a product to be successful,
it must enhance the way that users work. Delivering a product that is
rich in features and content but can't be used is considered a
failure.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Smooth deployment and ongoing management</b> The effectiveness
of deployment directly affects the perceived quality of a product. For
example, a faulty installation program may imply to users that the
installed application is similarly faulty. The team must do more than
simply deploy the product; it must deploy smoothly and then support and
manage the product.</li></p>
</ul>



<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr> Many factors can affect a project, some of which
will constrain it. When the project team focuses on meeting the
agreed-upon goals of the project and delivering the product on time, it
ensures that the organization receives the right Return on Investment
(ROI), which is the right product for the right price.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>The MSF Development Team Model addresses the need to meet these key
goals by assigning tasks to six team roles: Product Management, Program
Management, Development, Testing, User Education, and Logistics
Management. Each goal requires a different discipline, so each team
role embodies a different discipline. The people who carry out the team
roles must have the unique perspective and set of skills necessary to
meet each goal.</p>

<p>Table 3.1 shows the correspondence between the six roles of the MSF
Development Team Model, which we discuss in detail later in this
chapter, and the six key goals of an effective project team. Because
each goal is critical to the success of a project, the roles that
correspond to these goals are seen as peers with equal say in
decisions. There is no project master, but simply a team that knows
what to do and is properly equipped to do it.</p>

<p>How does a team get started on a project when it doesn't know
how long it will take, how much it will cost, and what it is going to
create? Answering these questions is the core function of the MSF
Development Team Model discussed in the next sections of this chapter
and the MSF Development Process Model discussed in <A HREF="ch04a.htm">Chapter 4</A>. These
models involve a bottom-up scheduling process, a top-down design
process, and separation of responsibilities, so at first glance, they
don't seem to answer these questions at all. But in fact, they lend
themselves well to minimizing risk and exposure in the early phases of
a project. Making the correct decisions early in the process and
avoiding changes late in the process significantly decreases a
project's overall time and costs.</p>

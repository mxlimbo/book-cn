<A NAME="8"><H2>Course Overview</H2></A>

<p>This self-paced course combines text, graphics, and review questions to
teach you about analyzing requirements and defining solutions architecture.
The course assumes that you will work through the book from beginning to
end, but you can choose a customized track and complete only the sections that interest
you.</p>

<p>The book is divided into the following chapters:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b><a href="ch01a.htm">Chapter 1</a>, &quot;Enterprise Architecture&quot;</b> This chapter examines the need for
application and infrastructure guidance at an enterprise level. It begins by suggesting that
systems be implemented with an architecture-first process. Next, the chapter introduces the
Microsoft Solutions Framework (MSF). Chapter 1 also examines the MSF Enterprise Architecture
Model and its Business, Application, Information, and Technology Perspectives. This chapter
additionally points out that the four primary goals of an enterprise architecture are that it
be integrated, iterative, actionable, and prioritized. Finally, this chapter discusses how to
begin the enterprise architecture process and continue to deliver systems and applications
while the architecture process is underway.</li></p>

<p><li> <b><a href="ch02a.htm">Chapter 2</a>, &quot;Enterprise Applications&quot;</b> This chapter examines the features
of modern enterprise applications, and issues that should be considered. It discusses designing
large-scale, distributed, enterprise applications and the need to reduce their complexity. It
also recommends managing this enterprise application complexity through abstraction, which
involves grouping similar requirements together into a small number of abstract categories.
Various architecture descriptions are discussed, such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML),
Design Patterns, and AntiPatterns. Additionally, this chapter out-lines ten principles for
delivering successful applications. Chapter 2 finally suggests that organizations use the
several perspectives represented by Microsoft's Enterprise Application Model and discusses
the application architecture framework provided by the separate MSF Application Model for Development.</li></p>

<p><li> <b><a href="ch03a.htm">Chapter 3</a>, &quot;Project Teams&quot;</b> This chapter discusses who is responsible for
doing what so that all the different parts of an application project are managed properly. The
chapter also discusses building a project team within the context of the MSF Team Model for
Application Development (MSF Development Team Model). The discussion progresses from
understanding the six equally vital team roles to finding and enlisting leaders from different
parts of the organization. Chapter 3 also pinpoints specific responsibilities that must be
fulfilled for a project to be successful, and assigns these responsibilities to specific team
members. It looks at ways to analyze project requirements from the perspectives of different
team members and also explores ways to scale the project team to fit the needs and size of the
project. Finally, this chapter examines team and leadership characteristics that will help make
an organization's use of its project resources more effective.</li></p>

<p><li> <b><a href="ch04a.htm">Chapter 4</a>, &quot;Development Process&quot;</b> This chapter is primarily devoted to
the MSF Process Model for Application Development, otherwise known as the <i>MSF Development
Process Model</i>. Rather than a step-by-step methodology, MSF is a structural framework that
an organization can adapt to suit its particular needs. The MSF Development Process Model is
the part of this framework that describes the life cycle of a successful software development
project. Using a development framework has been successfully proven in the software industry to
improve project control, minimize risk, improve product quality, and increase development
speed. Also in this chapter, we discuss the Unified Process development framework along with
its workflows, stages, and milestones.</li></p>

<p><li> <b><a href="ch05a.htm">Chapter 5</a>, &quot;Project Vision&quot;</b> This chapter describes the dynamics of the
MSF Development Process Model's Envisioning Phase. This chapter also discusses what
information to gather from the project stakeholders, how to create a product vision, how the
MSF Development Team Model's various roles participate in the envisioning process, and what
their responsibilities are. In addition, Chapter 5 examines how the envisioning process
develops over a period of time. Finally, this chapter presents a detailed discussion of risk
management, based on the MSF Risk Management Model.</li></p>

<p><li> <b><a href="ch06a.htm">Chapter 6</a>, &quot;Project Plan&quot;</b> This chapter outlines the process of mapping
concepts to actions and explains team roles in the Planning Phase of the MSF Development
Process Model. It takes an in-depth look at the MSF Design Process Model and the conceptual,
logical, and physical architectures of an application. This chapter also discusses how the MSF
Application Model's user, business, and data service layers can be incorporated into the
application's physical architecture. The MSF Development Process Model's Functional
Specification, Master Project Plan, and Master Project Schedule are all emphasized as key
deliverables of the Planning Phase. Finally, Chapter 6 discusses principles of scheduling, as
well as the ongoing task of risk management.</li></p>

<p><li> <b><a href="ch07a.htm">Chapter 7</a>, &quot;User Service Layer Technologies&quot;</b> This chapter examines how
to create effective and efficient user interface (UI) designs. It also explores legacy,
current, and future technologies that affect the user service layer design of the MSF
Application Model. Additionally, this chapter discusses the impact of Web technologies on
current application design techniques. We complete Chapter 7 with an in-depth look at
implementing a Web-based application.</li></p>

<p><li> <b><a href="ch08a.htm">Chapter 8</a>, &quot;Business Service Layer Technologies&quot;</b> This chapter focuses on
such issues as using an object context to manage state, using explicitly defined interfaces
when possible, composing functionality, maintaining state across transaction boundaries,
propagating errors, and programmatically controlling security. In addition, this chapter takes
a detailed examination using COM and COM+ within the business service of an application's
physical design. This chapter concludes with a detailed look at using COM components with
Microsoft Transaction Server.</li></p>

<p><li> <b><a href="ch09a.htm">Chapter 9</a>, &quot;Data Service Layer Technologies&quot;</b> This chapter examines design
issues related to data requirements and explores characteristics of different data
access technologies. This chapter also discusses best uses for each access technology, and
normalization of data and data integrity. In addition, this chapter identifies how business
rules can affect application data and where these rules are implemented. Furthermore, Chapter 9
examines technologies that provide data access to legacy data system stores and Enterprise
Resource Planning (ERP) applications. Finally, this chapter reviews COM+ In-Memory Database
(IMDB) features that can improve data access performance.</li></p>

<p><li> <b><a href="ch10a.htm">Chapter 10</a>, &quot;Testing and the Production Channel&quot;</b> This chapter explains
how to build a working environment that supports development, testing, certification, and
production. Using real-life examples, this chapter describes the production channel and its
goals. Chapter 10 thoroughly examines testing, and recommends several ways to execute and
monitor tests. It also discusses ways to scale out an application's production environment
by adding servers to the physical implementation. Finally, this chapter examines ways to
classify program faults and failures, discuss the larger issue of product bugs, and describe
methods of tracking, classifying, and resolving known bug problems.</li></p>

<p><li> <b><a href="ch11a.htm">Chapter 11</a>, &quot;Application Security&quot;</b> This chapter looks at different
security-related protocols and the basic security concepts of authentication. It also examines
encryption, which stores and passes information from one place to another
so that it can't be read by anyone who intercepts it. Additionally, this chapter discusses
access control, which determines what users are allowed to accomplish, and auditing, which
records what goes on inside the operating system as users request and work with the resources
the system makes available to them.</li></p>

<p><li> <b><a href="ch12a.htm">Chapter 12</a>, &quot;Development Deliverables&quot;</b> This chapter examines the
creation process, including how the various team roles function during development. This
chapter further explores testing, bug tracking, and the &quot;zero-defect mindset,&quot; and
also shows how the project management team makes effective trade-offs. In addition, this
chapter discusses how multi-layer applications are implemented as monolithic or client/server,
or distributed in physical form. Finally, Chapter 12 explores the end of the MSF Development
Process Model's Developing Phase, when code-complete is reached, and all product features
and original code are incorporated into the application.</li></p>

<p><li> <b><a href="ch13a.htm">Chapter 13</a>, &quot;Product Stabilization&quot;</b> This chapter emphasizes the
evolutionary cycle the team will progress through to move from the Developing Phase's Scope
Complete Milestone to the Stabilizing Phase's Release Milestone. We summarize this
phase's effort as four primary steps: Fix the bugs, synchronize all product deliverables,
ship the release, and extensively test the release. Leading up to the Release Milestone, the
chapter identifies several key interim milestones that are reached by the continual iteration
of the phase's steps. This chapter also provides some guidelines for the deployment of an
application after the product is released. From the preplanning phases though pilot testing,
support, and troubleshooting, we explore efficient ways to deploy the application with as
little negative impact as possible on the users and their systems and networks.</li></p>

<p><li> <b><a href="ch14a.htm">Chapter 14</a>, &quot;Project Review&quot;</b> This chapter emphasizes the value of a
solid project review, as it both relates to a project just completed and to the ongoing growth
and improvement of the organization. The chapter examines the relationship between the project
review and the Capability Maturity Model for Software, and also shows the project review's
importance in creating a best practice guide for the organization's development teams. This
chapter examines the practical considerations of conducting a project review: when to schedule
a project review, who should attend, and the proper physical setting for a project review.</li></p>

<p>Also included on the supplemental CD-ROM is the RMS Sample Application and its documentation
(see the next section).</p>

<A NAME="12"><H2>Case Studies</H2></A>

<p>The concepts taught in each chapter of this book are demonstrated in a series of case
studies. These case studies present fictitious scenarios of a company that
is using the development process, concepts, and application design strategies outlined in the
book to analyze application requirements, define a solution
architecture, and create a product. These case studies are designed to help you understand the
concepts and goals presented in the chapters, and to offer a clear picture of how this
book's development methodology could work in real life for your own company's projects.
The &quot;<a href="atba.htm#13">Case Study Background</a>&quot; section below provides the information necessary to
understand the structure and context of the case study's fictional organization. Read
through this section thoroughly before you begin this book.</p>

<p>The Resource Management System (RMS) Sample Application, which is referred to in the case
studies and included on the supplemental CD-ROM, is a complete multi-layer application that
uses key Microsoft technologies, such as Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0, Active Server Pages,
Dynamic HTML, Microsoft Outlook 98, Microsoft Transaction Server 2.0, Microsoft Exchange Server
5.5, and Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 to manage company resources. The application presents a
real-world example of a multi-client, distributed application that accesses two different data
stores. Along with the compiled executables and full source code, sample documentation is
provided as a simple example of the documentation created by the project team throughout the
case studies. The RMS Sample Application provides a basic resource management system for
scheduling and tracking individuals and their proficiencies. In reality, two developers coded
this application over a two-month period, which speaks to their skill levels and the benefits
of the development tools, technologies, and platforms chosen for the application.</p>

<p>The &quot;<a href="atba.htm#5">Getting Started</a>&quot; section earlier in this introduction provides important
setup instructions that describe the hardware and software requirements necessary to run the
RMS Sample Application.</p>

<A NAME="13"><H3>Case Study Background</H3></A>

<p>To make the case studies both more interesting and more useful, we decided to present them
as a story&#8212;imaginary, but nonetheless true to life and based on the real experiences of
the authors. Our goal is that as you read this story, you will get a clear picture of how the
development methodology could work for your own organization and your own projects.</p>

<p>To better understand the issues presented in the case studies, here is some
background information about the fictitious company.</p>

<p><b>The Company</b></p>

<p>Ferguson and Bardell Incorporated is a Chicago-based engineering, architecture, and project
management firm. Founded in 1948 by two WWII veterans, it has grown to over 800 employees with
revenues in 1998 approaching $230 million. Corporate headquarters occupy seven floors of a
prominent office high-rise in downtown Chicago, with satellite offices in Detroit, Milwaukee,
Cincinnati,
Indianapolis, and Louisville.</p>

<p>Ferguson and Bardell embraced technology early and often. Unfortunately,
consistency and coherence did not always accompany that early adoption. For example, the
company stored project data in proprietary formats in a multitude of locations that were
connected either by modems or by overnight messenger services. Additionally, until recently the
company used three different word
processors, including a terminal-based one.</p>

<p>In 1998, the board of directors and senior management came to the conclusion that the
firm's IT efforts were inadequate. One board member, who was familiar with studies of
effective business uses of technology, contacted the consulting firm responsible for the
studies. After examining Ferguson and Bardell's IT practices and accomplishments for two
months, the consultants brought a set of recommendations to the board.</p>

<p>The most controversial recommendation was to remove the position of IT
Director, which at that time reported directly to the CFO, and to create instead a CIO position
within senior management. Several board members, as well as the CFO, wanted to keep the org
chart as it was, but the consultants were insistent. &quot;As long as IT is seen only as a cost
center,&quot; they argued, &quot;you will never get the business value out of technology that
you should expect. And, if you keep IT out of the boardroom, you can't possibly learn
enough about technology to make informed business decisions about it. You have to include the
IT function in your management team and in your management decision-making if you want to see
Ferguson and Bardell crawl out of the technology abyss it's in.&quot;</p>

<p>The new CIO came aboard in October, highly recommended by his former
employer, a regional law firm where he had risen in five years from Network Manager to CIO. The
former IT Director, who had decided to leave rather than take on the redesigned position, had
spent the previous year putting a new network infrastructure in place and enabling Internet
connectivity across the enterprise. As a result, the new CIO had some time to get oriented
before starting a major project. He spent the first three months getting to know his staff,
learning the ropes of the business, and putting certain processes and procedures in place.</p>

<p>In January, he brought in a Microsoft trainer to introduce Microsoft Solutions Framework
(MSF) to his leadership staff, whose response was mixed. Some were enthusiastic, some were
skeptical, and a few hinted that they figured this was another management fad that would soon
pass. Nevertheless, he pushed ahead, confident in his belief that only a consistent project
framework, informed and driven by business-IT interaction, would accomplish what Ferguson and
Bardell needed to accomplish.</p>

<p><b>The Teams</b></p>

<p>Ferguson and Bardell's new CIO understood that to build an enterprise architecture, he
would have to bring together a team that represented several of Ferguson and Bardell's
departments. To develop applications within the context of the company's enterprise
architecture, he would have to create project teams. He needed people who would take
initiative, who were accomplished in their respective fields, and whom he could count on to see
a task through to completion. He knew that building any team could be a challenge, as each
person would bring his or her own perspective, approach, and personality to the team.</p>

<p>To develop the company's enterprise architecture, the CIO assembled the following
team:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Dan Shelly, Chief Information Officer</b> Dan is in his early forties and loves
business, technology, and the Chicago Bulls, though not necessarily always in that order. As
the new CIO, he is both liked and respected; his peers on the management team appreciate his
understanding of business issues, and his staff in IT appreciate that he came up through the IT
ranks. As one network engineer put it, &quot;Dan knows what it's like to be on call at 3 in
the morning!&quot; Dan is still excited about the potential of technology to make a substantive
difference to the company, but he has been around long enough to know how hard it can be to
actually make that difference.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Jenny Sax, Network Support Technician</b> Jenny's first job out of college one
year ago was with the network support staff of Ferguson and Bardell. In a short time, she has
developed a reputation for documenting everything she works on. The company's first help
desk guide magically appeared one Monday morning after she spent the previous Friday talking
with frustrated users. Detail-oriented, she never misses a chance to learn exactly how things
work.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Kevin Kennedy, Management Specialist</b> Kevin is part of Ferguson and Bardell
long-range planning committee. In the last year, he has been working directly with the CEO to
optimize the planning and budgeting process. Though often brash, he is considered to be on the
fast track toward stepping into the shoes of the CEO when he retires in four years. He has
worked in most management roles within the company and gathered a reputation for getting the
job done, regardless of the cost.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Jo Brown, Assistant Chief Operations Officer</b> When no one else would step up to the
plate, Jo took over the stalled Y2K project and succeeded in getting Ferguson and Bardell
compliant for the millennium. After completing the Y2K project five months ahead of schedule,
Jo has gone back to her normal job of keeping the company's operations running smoothly.
Her most recent project was to create a procedure manual to simplify the business
process for the company. As long as everyone follows the book, everything works smoothly,
but she is known for sending blistering e-mails to the poor souls that try to break the
rules.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Dick Kaplan, Business Analyst</b> Every company needs an odd bird, and Dick fills that
role for Ferguson and Bardell. In a previous life, Dick was a philosophy professor, and he has
a Ph.D and several books to his credit. While looking around for something a little different
to do, he stumbled into the consulting business in the early 1980s. Ten years ago, he decided
he wanted to work for an architectural firm and chose Ferguson and Bardell. In his current role
as business analyst, he is asked to participate on most application design teams because of his
easygoing nature and uncanny ability to simplify complex problems.</li></p>
</ul>

<p>Even before the company's enterprise architecture was in place, Dan had decided to use
the RMS project to test the new development framework. To see this project through, the
following team members would need to learn how to work together:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Bill Pardi, Director of Development</b> Bill has been with Ferguson and Bardell since
leaving the military in 1978. He has risen through the ranks, beginning with punch-card work
and moving through various &quot;heavy iron&quot; systems into PC-based database development
using dBase III and Paradox. He was made head of Development in 1996 after leading a 35-person
team in a two-year effort to write a new accounting package for Ferguson and Bardell from
scratch. Even though the application was six months late and 40 percent over budget, everyone
associated with the project agreed that without Bill, it would have been much worse.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Jane Clayton, Director of Accounting</b> Jane knows more about how Ferguson and
Bardell actually works than almost anybody else. She started at the company ten years ago as a
clerk in the accounting department, and rose to the position of director four years ago. She
promotes high-quality work, and she focuses on shielding her staff from obstacles and other
distractions, whether those obstacles are people, policies, or technology. She's no
computer guru, but she has dealt with software long enough to know what works for accounting
purposes and what doesn't.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Tim O'Brien, Network Manager</b> Tim looks ten years younger than his true age of
28. He's interested in all types of technology but has focused his career on Microsoft
products by earning an MCSE certification in addition to his EE degree from Northwestern.
He's fun to be around, with a ready wit and a smile to match. His tardiness to work and
meetings is legendary, as is his knowledge of the Ferguson and Bardell technologies and his
ability to troubleshoot problems quickly and effectively.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Marilou Moris, Trainer</b> A favorite of the Ferguson and Bardell staff, Marilou is an
independent trainer who lives in downtown Chicago. From there she travels all across the
Midwest, doing training for both companies and training centers. She has done a lot of training
for Jane's staff in particular, and she and Jane have become good friends. Jane recommended
her to Dan when he needed a trainer for the project team.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Marta Wolfe-Hellene, Engineer</b> Both the youngest member of the project team and the
newest employee at Ferguson and Bardell, Marta is extremely intelligent, hard-working, and
well-spoken. As a result, some people think she is soft until they try to push her. She is
quiet, almost to a fault, but can show a quick and dry wit once she is comfortable with the
people around her.</li></p>

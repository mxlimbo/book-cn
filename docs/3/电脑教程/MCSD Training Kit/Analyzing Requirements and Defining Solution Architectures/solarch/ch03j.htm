<A NAME="167"><H1>Agenda Overview</H1></A>

<p>&quot;First of all,&quot; Dan continued, &quot;let's look at
some elements that may be new to you. Three items on this agenda will
be on every meeting agenda for this project. The first is Agenda
Building. This is an opportunity, right at the beginning of the
meeting, for the team to adjust the agenda as it sees fit. Normally, I
will construct and distribute an initial agenda a few days before a
team meeting. It's possible&#8212;indeed, likely&#8212;that you will
want to discuss items that I either don't know about or that I
forgot to include. So, the Agenda Building item is your chance to add
or subtract items from the agenda as a team.</p>

<P><A HREF="javascript:fullSize('gcs2ar01x.htm')" onMouseOver="window.status='Click to view at full size';return true;" onMouseOut="window.status='';return true;"><IMG SRC="images/gcs2ar01.jpg" WIDTH=404 HEIGHT=511 BORDER=0 ALT="Click to view at full size"></A></P>


<p>&quot;At the end of the agenda, there will always be questions and
answers. This is your last chance for clarification or information
before we move to the Wrap-Up item. Your questions do not have to be
about items on the agenda, but they do have to relate to the project
and be pertinent to the group. We don't want to waste team
members' time with questions about other projects or with specifics
about this project that the team as a whole is not involved in.</p>

<p>&quot;The final item on the agenda will always be the Wrap-Up. This
is where we recap any decisions we made in the meeting and make sure
everyone is clear on what we did. This is also where we confirm any
assignments made during the meeting, along with deadlines. You'll
notice I use the term Path-Forward Assignments. It may be that during a
meeting we will have to analyze a situation, possibly taking apart a
problem and figuring out what went wrong. That's okay; we need to
learn from our mistakes. At the end of the meeting, though, we want to
focus on where we go from here. What is our path forward for the
current project? What are our immediate next steps? That's how we
want to conclude our meetings. Any questions?&quot;</p>

<p>At this first meeting, no one wanted to be the first to ask a
question, so Dan pressed ahead. &quot;Does anyone have any adjustments
to the agenda that they would like to propose?&quot; Everyone looked
around the table to see who might be the first to break the ice.
Finally, Marta raised her hand slowly.</p>

<p>&quot;Pardon me, Mr. Shelly, but in your opening remarks you
mentioned how important this project is to the company, and how visible
it will be. I appreciate the invitation to be a part of the project
team, but I'm not sure why I'm here. Might it be worthwhile to
add an agenda item for you to explain why each of us has been
included?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;First of all, Marta, it's Dan, not Mr. Shelly. Secondly,
your question is an excellent one. My plan is to match up team members
with roles in item 5 on the agenda, where I think it will become clear
why each of you is on the team. Does that work for you?&quot; With
another small smile, Marta nodded, and Dan looked at the others around
the table. &quot;How about the rest of you? Does it make sense to you
to proceed this way?&quot; Everyone nodded in agreement. Tim leaned
over to Marta and whispered loudly, &quot;Thanks for asking, Marta. I
was wondering the same thing, but the last time I asked a question in a
meeting, I got made project lead!&quot; Everyone laughed, and the
tension level in the room dropped noticeably.</p>

<p>Dan turned to Jane. &quot;Jane, why don't you move us into our
next agenda item by introducing yourself? We'll just go around the
table. Tell us your title, how long you've been at Ferguson and
Bardell, and what your responsibilities are.&quot; He looked at the
rest of the team. &quot;We six are going to be working closely together
over the next couple of months, so the sooner we get to know one
another, the better. Start now to get a good sense of each other's
abilities, as well as each other's blind spots. To be a good team,
we'll want to use each person's strengths and help each person
work around their weaknesses and preconceptions. Honest communication
is a must, so begin by listening and learning as we do the
introductions.&quot; He turned back to Jane. &quot;Okay, Jane, tell us
all about yourself.&quot;</p>

<A NAME="326"><H1>Development and EA Team Meeting</H1></A>

<p>When Dan came into the conference room, he was struck by the seating
arrangement. The EA team was on one side, and Bill and his two
developers were on the other. &quot;Looks like disarmament talks of
some sort&#8212;which is not a bad comparison,&quot; Dan thought to
himself as he took his place at the head of the table.</p>

<p>&quot;Hope everyone's lunch was satisfactory, and that you are
all ready to work together on this,&quot; he said as he opened his
notebook. &quot;Has everyone looked through the materials I sent around
last week?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I sure did, and there's something I just don't
understand,&quot; said Bill, obviously irritated. &quot;We've been
busting our tails on the RMS project team, but it seems like the EA
team is setting our IT direction. Before you came in, Mr. Kennedy here
was telling us about all the great new technologies we're going to
implement at Ferguson and Bardell. Since when does someone from
Long-Range Planning dictate our technology choices?&quot;</p>

<p>Before Dan could answer, and before Kevin Kennedy could open his
mouth, Richard Kaplan said in a calm voice, &quot;Now, Bill, don't
act so surprised. I've been sending you weekly updates on the work
of the EA team, so what Kevin said shouldn't have come as a shock.
As for Kevin, he sometimes likes to assume airs, but that doesn't
mean we should discount either his intelligence or his contributions.
If we all take a look at the agenda, we'll see that this meeting is
about the mutual feedback loop explained in the materials Dan sent
around.&quot; Although Dick's words were fairly blunt, neither Bill
nor Kevin seemed offended. In fact, they both looked somewhat
sheepish.</p>

<p>&quot;As usual, Dick has brought us to a moment of clarity,&quot;
said Dan. &quot;Our purpose here is not to endorse one team's views
over the other's. As we used to say in graduate school, the work of
both teams should be <i>informed</i> by the work of the other team. The
EA team has spent the past six weeks putting together an excellent
first cut at both documenting our current EA state and at planning the
high-priority projects for the coming year. As you might expect, RMS is
one of those projects. So before we complete the design process for
RMS, we need to synchronize the two efforts. That is the purpose of our
meeting today.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Frankly, Bill, because the RMS project is so important, it may
have more impact on us than we on it,&quot; said Jo Brown.
&quot;We've seen in our research into other companies how
high-priority projects have a tendency to reshape a company's
EA.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, but even if that's the case here, we still want to
validate the direction of the RMS project against the stated business
direction of Ferguson and Bardell,&quot; said Kevin. &quot;Ultimately,
what we build for RMS should fit into the long-range plans of the
company.&quot; He looked at Dan. &quot;Don't worry, Dan. I
haven't forgotten the two-way information flow you've been
pounding into my head.&quot; Kevin turned to Bill. &quot;Our technology
plans and discoveries have to be part of the input to our business
plans, as well.&quot;</p>

<p>Bill shook his head. &quot;I never thought I'd hear someone on
the business side say something like that.&quot; He smiled wryly at
Kevin. &quot;I guess there's hope for you after all.&quot; Kevin
just laughed. &quot;Some would not agree with you, Bill, but thanks for
the vote of confidence, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan was glad to see signs of willingness to cooperate and was
grateful to Dick Kaplan for his influence. &quot;OK, folks, now that
we've established the relationship between our two teams, let's
get going on the agenda. First, I'd like the EA folks to share the
highlights of their individual perspectives that might relate to the
RMS project.&quot;</p>

<P><A HREF="javascript:fullSize('gcs6ar03x.htm')" onMouseOver="window.status='Click to view at full size';return true;" onMouseOut="window.status='';return true;"><IMG SRC="images/gcs6ar03.jpg" WIDTH=404 HEIGHT=511 BORDER=0 ALT="Click to view at full size"></A></P>


<p>The four EA team members took a few minutes each to point out
findings or plans that they felt could have an impact on RMS. Bill,
Sam, and Beth took notes and asked questions, and a lively discussion
ensued. Jo told them that the RMS project was already a key component
of their plans for the year, and that a project to build a training and
skills tracking system might begin after RMS was complete. Sam noted
that tying into the training and skills system might be a good feature
for RMS Version 2.</p>

<p>Jenny Sax discussed the company's intention to narrow its
approved technologies list to decrease support and training costs. She
also mentioned that a pilot group was working with Windows 2000, but
that it wouldn't be deployed across the enterprise until well into
the fall of 2000, if then.</p>

<p>Beth turned to Sam. &quot;Do we need any COM+ features for RMS
Version 1? Do we need Windows 2000 sooner for either Version 1 or
Version 2?&quot;</p>

<p>Sam shook his head. &quot;It might make certain parts of the
business layer easier, but not enough to change the deployment schedule
for Windows 2000. We can make do with what we have, and simply rewrite
those components whenever we get 2000 deployed and stable.&quot;</p>

<p>Dick talked about some of the information gaps he had discovered.
&quot;One of the key gaps is good scheduling and resource information.
In fact, almost every project and department manager has complained
about the inability to match resources and projects across the
enterprise. I'd say there are a number of people hoping RMS is
going to take care of that.&quot; He pulled a packet of papers from his
bag and passed them over to the development team. &quot;As part of my
work, I've put together a proposed data model and dictionary for
Ferguson and Bardell. It's not completely approved yet, but I
thought you might want to look at it and see if it is in agreement with
your work on RMS.&quot;</p>

<p>The three developers looked over the data documentation sheets.
&quot;Dick, this is great!&quot; Beth exclaimed. &quot;There's a
lot of overlap, but you've thought of some fields we hadn't
considered. We'll take a look at this more closely later, and
I'll send you our comments.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kevin, what about the business direction?&quot; asked Dan.
&quot;What key strategic plans does the RMS team need to know
about?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The biggest one is expansion,&quot; said Kevin as he shared
his own handouts. He pointed to the first bullet point. &quot;As you
can see, we're going to go from six offices to ten over the next 18
months. We're also going to add approximately 250 people, which is
more than a 30-percent increase in staff.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wow! That's some growth rate,&quot; exclaimed Sam.
&quot;And all those folks will be doing time sheets, right? That
certainly changes some things&#8212;or at least, locks in some plans we
were already considering.&quot; He looked at Beth and Bill, who both
nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;That sounds like a good transition to the next item on the
agenda,&quot; said Dan. &quot;What does the RMS team have to share with
the EA team? Bill, why don't you take some time to bring the EA
folks up to speed on the RMS project and the technologies you are
considering.&quot;</p>

<p>Bill outlined the various design paths the development team was
considering, including the question of whether to use Win32 clients or
Web clients. The EA team spent some time asking questions, trying to be
sure they understood the implications of various decisions on their EA
work. Finally Dan said, &quot;It sounds to me as if both teams
understand each other's work pretty well. Let's move on to
coordination and recommendations.&quot; He turned to the development
team. &quot;What have you heard from the EA folks that has an impact on
your design choices?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think the biggest impact will come from the expansion plans
Kevin talked about earlier,&quot; said Sam. &quot;In our original
design work, we were planning on no more than 300 concurrent users. We
thought that was a safe number, given the time differences between the
offices and the fact that people update their time sheets throughout
Friday and Monday. That left the options open between a Web client and
a Win32 client. Now, with the number of concurrent users shoved up
another 100 to 200, I think we've got to go with a strictly Web
client, keeping as much functionality as possible on the application
servers to minimize network traffic.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But Sam,&quot; said Dan, frowning, &quot;if I remember
correctly, some of the most important functionality for the managers
was in the Win32 client, and you hadn't put it into the Web client.
In fact, a few of the features strike me as being fairly difficult to
pull off in a Web client. Won't doing a pure Web client increase
your development time?&quot; Sam and Beth both nodded, and the group
fell silent as they considered the dilemma. Dick Kaplan stopped
doodling on his legal pad. &quot;Do you have the Logical Design with
you?&quot; he asked Bill.</p>

<p>Bill tapped his bag. &quot;Sure, it's right here. Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let me see it a minute,&quot; Dick said. Bill passed it across
the table, and Dick studied it for a minute. Then he looked at the
group. &quot;I think I see a way we can get off the horns of this
dilemma.&quot; He laid the drawings out on the table for the EA team to
see. &quot;These drawings are representations of the various functions
of the RMS application. Look first at the user services, then the
business services, and finally the data services, and tell me if
anything strikes you.&quot;</p>

<p>The group, including Bill, Beth, and Sam, spent some moments looking
over the various drawings in silence. Finally, Jo said, &quot;I'm
not a developer, but from what I can tell, it almost looks like two
separate applications using a common database.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Beth.</p>

<p>Jo picked up the drawings and rearranged them on the table.
&quot;See? This set over here is all concerned with entering time,
verifying the time entered, submitting time, and approving the
timesheet.&quot; She pointed to the second group of drawings. &quot;And
these are all about resources: knowing their skills, assigning them to
projects, and checking on their availability.&quot; She stood up and
folded her arms. &quot;There's some common data, obviously, because
in both instances we're working with the same resources and the
same projects. But the purposes seem separate.&quot; Dick slowly nodded
his head as he listened to the discussion with his eyes closed.</p>

<p>Suddenly Sam snapped his fingers. &quot;That's it!&quot; He
turned to Bill and Beth. &quot;We build <i>both</i> clients! A Web
client for time entry for everybody, and a Win32 client for just the
managers. Most of the managers are in the office when they assign
resources, anyway, and there's a limited number of them.&quot; He
was getting more excited as the pieces fell into place in his mind.
&quot;And we can use Transaction Server with it, to make sure that the
time sheets get across even if the server is clogged up.&quot;</p>

<p>Sam seemed pleased with the vision he had just articulated, but Bill
was aghast. &quot;<i>Two</i> clients? I wasn't even sure we could
get one done in time, and now you want to do two? There is no way we
can hit the deadlines that way!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure there is, Bill!&quot; Beth said. &quot;If we split the
services up like that, we can divide the work along both tiers and
clients and work in parallel. Some of the other people in the
department want to work on this project, anyway. We can get more done
in less time, <i>and</i> meet our scalability requirements as
well!&quot;</p>

<p>Looking dubious, Bill turned to Dan. &quot;What do you
think?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think it might work, Bill. I like the idea of the
single-purpose Web client, and it will be easier to write. As for the
parallel development effort&#8212;that's a management problem, not a
technical one. I know a pretty good development manager who's
probably up to the task.&quot;</p>

<p>Bill could see that Beth and Sam were excited about the solution,
and he threw up his hands in mock surrender. &quot;Alright,
alright&#8212;we'll try it! But if it doesn't work, we write it
my way: terminal emulation and assembler language.&quot; Everyone
laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;Remember, Bill, the Planning Phase can include proof of
concept work, said Dan. &quot;It might be worthwhile to have a certain
pair of eager-beaver programmers put something together before
committing completely to the two-client concept. No fancy interface,
not fully functional; just something showing the effect of that many
Web clients on our servers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can you two do that?&quot; asked Bill. They looked at each
other and then nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;Good, then that's a plan. And a good example of letting
our company's enterprise architecture inform our development
work.&quot; Dan turned to the EA team. &quot;What about you four? Is
there anything that the RMS development team has shared that you'll
need to consider as you wrap up your EA work?&quot;</p>

<p>Jenny nodded. &quot;Absolutely. For one thing, we have been
considering whether or not to make a stronger commitment to our
intranet. It's served some good purposes, but it needs to be more
than a source of static information. We have been debating whether it
made sense to move some of our business processes onto the intranet,
and I'd say that decision is now made. Our task is going to be
identifying other candidates for that technology.&quot;</p>

<p>Kevin added, &quot;Another area the long-range planning group has
been looking at is expanding our service area even further outside our
offices. In fact, we're looking at a national advertising campaign
in about nine months. One of the concerns we've had, though, is
connectivity issues involved with having that many people on the road.
Jenny and Tim have already worked with us, showing us various ways we
might deal with these issues. I think this meeting today has helped us
to see we need to consider not only the pipes, but also what runs
across those pipes. I, for one, am much more confident in the ability
of our IT group to come up with creative solutions to business
needs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kevin, I think that's the nicest thing I've ever heard
you say about a group you weren't part of!&quot; said Jo with a sly
grin. &quot;We need to get you away from the CEO more often.&quot; The
room got quiet as everyone waited to see how Kevin would take such a
jab, but he said simply, &quot;Sometimes a fast-tracker needs to do
some growing to stay on the fast track.&quot; The few appreciative
murmurs made Kevin smile.</p>

<p>Dan waited a moment, before continuing. &quot;I think this has been
a productive meeting for both teams. The EA team will be wrapping up
Version 1.0 of the EA plan for Ferguson and Bardell in about a week,
and I'm sure they would like to see the Functional Spec for RMS
when it is done. Before we finish, are there any questions or
comments?&quot;</p>

<p>Dick Kaplan had been staring into space for the past few minutes,
seemingly oblivious to the conversation of the others. Now he looked at
Dan. &quot;I'd like to meet with you and the development team after
we're done, if the four of you have a moment. I've got an idea
that might be helpful for the RMS work.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can you three stay for moment?&quot; Dan asked Bill. All three
nodded. &quot;Good. If no one has anything else, we're
adjourned.&quot;</p>

<p>As the rest of the EA team gathered up their things to leave, Dick
joined Dan and the developers, who were standing together discussing
the idea of two clients. &quot;OK, Dick, we're all ears,&quot; Dan
said. &quot;You've already helped us with your insight into the
work flows of RMS. What else have you got?&quot;</p>

<p>Dick turned to Beth. &quot;What were you considering for your
back-end data store?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;SQL Server, of course,&quot; she said. &quot;That's the
corporate standard.&quot;</p>

<p>Dick shook his head. &quot;I think you should reconsider.
There's a better choice for the application you have in
mind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dick, I know you're not as committed to the Microsoft
product mix as the rest of us, but I'm not going to let another
database in the door.&quot; Bill was slightly irritated. &quot;I just
got rid of the last dBase III application four months ago. We
standardized on SQL Server for a number of good reasons, and I
don't want another database that I have to train for, program for,
and support.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bill, you're not hearing what I am saying,&quot; Dick said
calmly. &quot;I didn't say anything about another database. I said
you should consider another data store. There's a
difference.&quot;</p>

<p>Bill was getting visibly irritated. &quot;Dick, you're talking
in riddles again. Stop being the Socratic professor and spit it
out.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan interrupted. &quot;He's right, though, Bill&#8212;there is a
difference. We tend to think of databases as the only place to store
data, but it's too narrow a concept. We store data in file systems,
e-mail, scanned documents, the Internet, any number of places that are
not traditional databases.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Exactly,&quot; said Dick. He turned to Beth and Sam.
&quot;What three primary data elements are common across both
application threads in RMS?&quot;</p>

<p>Sam and Beth answered almost simultaneously, &quot;Resources,
projects, and time.&quot;</p>

<p>Dick nodded and continued, &quot;And what data store do we already
have in place that everyone has access to and that already deals with
people and time?&quot;</p>

<p>Dan and the developers thought for a moment. Suddenly Sam said,
&quot;Exchange! Our Exchange server stores every user and their
calendar!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think you might consider Exchange as one of your data stores
for RMS,&quot; said Dick, &quot;especially when you add in its ability
to replicate across the enterprise, and the fairly rich set of objects
and services it exposes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not to mention its integration with Web technologies,&quot;
said Dan. &quot;Excellent suggestion, Dick. You're two for two
today.&quot;</p>

<p>Bill's initial irritation had melted during this conversation.
&quot;I didn't realize you know so much about day-to-day
programming issues, Dick,&quot; he said as the group moved out of the
conference room.</p>

<p>&quot;Each of us has abilities and interests that are hidden, just
as one side of an object is hidden when you look at the other
side,&quot; said Dick calmly. &quot;No one can know another person
completely. Don't worry about it.&quot;</p>

<p>They had arrived at Dick's office door. Bill asked, as if on an
impulse, &quot;Do you keep a copy of your dissertation in your office?
If so, I'd like to borrow it. It sounds like it might be
interesting reading.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I never would have thought of you as someone interested in
Kant,&quot; Dan said in surprise.</p>

<p>&quot;I think the man said something about hidden interests and
abilities. Besides,&quot; Bill continued, &quot;I hear Kant was a
killer fisherman.&quot;</p>

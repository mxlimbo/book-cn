<A NAME="494"><H1>DCOM Connector for SAP</H1></A>

<p>SAP is a proprietary system designed to run line-of-business
applications to manage a large variety business functions. This means
that users must work with proprietary interfaces to manage SAP data.
SAP, which is an integrated product, allows corporations to graphically
map and manage their business processes into an integrated whole.</p>

<p>One of the latest versions of SAP, R/3, is object oriented. This
allows SAP system designers to create COM interfaces to support a
variety of programmable interfaces supported by COM via the DCOM
Connector for SAP. The DCOM Connector for SAP aids in integrating the
functionality contained in distributed environments.</p>

<p>The run-time instances of business objects or remote functions
provided in the R/3 application are available in MTS as COM objects
using the DCOM Connector. The DCOM Connector is installed in the MTS in
the form of components within a package and allows developers to create
and administer COM objects.</p>

<p>The SAP R/3 DCOM connector is fashioned around the multi-service
layer architecture and contains an R/3 application server that exposes
the SAP business objects and remote functions that can be called from
components within MTS. These objects and functions are mapped through
COM via a DLL. Clients can make calls to those components through MTS,
which communicates with the R/3 application server and makes the
communication transparent to the client application.</p>

<p>In the DCOM Component Connector, ABAP objects (BAPIs) are mapped
onto COM interfaces and visa versa. (ABAP stands for Advanced Business
Application Programming Interface.) BAPIs is a term used to represent
objects that have a guarantee not to change. It stands for a
well-defined interface to processes and data of business application
systems. Also, the SAP Business Object Repository (BOR) is integrated
with the Microsoft Repository (XML Repositories). The solution is
scalable because the components can be installed and distributed as
often as needed and connections are pooled to R/3's Remote Function
Calls (RFCs). When Windows NT clients are used, security is provided in
the context of MTS. Optionally, Windows NT user IDs can be mapped to
R/3 security for a single logon. All Tables and Structures are
represented as ADO recordsets. There is automatic marshaling via RDS.
At the core, OLE DB is used to and from map ABAP tables. ADO is the
interface to OLE DB. The DCOM Connector automatically generates proxy
and stub components for objects. The next version of the DCOM Connector
will support 2PC and outbound calls, and requires COM+ Services.</p>

<p>The DCOM Component Connector provides the following benefits for
corporations:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>A new dimension of openness</b> The DCOM Component Connector
provides interoperability between R/3 objects and COM objects across a
hetero-geneous network through well-defined business interfaces. It
exposes R/3's mature business processes and business objects to
open DCOM access, making it easier to complement and extend R/3 using
Microsoft tools&#8212;for example, to create new front ends or to
extended business processes.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Leverage existing programming skills</b> With the DCOM
Component Connector, developers have the choice of either extending the
Business Framework by using software components written with SAP tools
(ABAP Objects) or COM tools (Visual Studio, Visual Basic, Visual C++,
and Visual J++). This leverages existing investments in training,
people, and in the huge market for pre-built COM components.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Eased integration</b> The integration of R/3 Business
Components with third-party products, legacy systems, and homegrown
applications has become much easier with the DCOM Component Connector.
Now even distributed transactions of several systems containing several
databases are possible.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Evolutionary approach</b> The DCOM Component Connector works
even if R/3 itself does not run on a Windows NT platform. This allows
corporations to save costs by leveraging their existing infrastructure.
And through the built-in scalability of multiple servers in every
service layer (MTS and R/3 Application Server), this solution is able
to grow with developers' needs.</li></p>

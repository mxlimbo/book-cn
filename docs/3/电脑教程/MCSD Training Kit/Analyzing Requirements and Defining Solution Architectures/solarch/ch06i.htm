<A NAME="322"><H1>Overview of the Planning Phase</H1></A>

<p>&quot;As you can see, the Planning Phase lies between the
Envisioning and Developing Phases. The purpose of Planning is to take
the common vision we built in Envisioning and transform it into
concrete plans for Developing. It's one thing to say, 'We want an
application that does thus-and-so.' It's another thing entirely
to be able to say, 'And this is how we're going to build
it.'</p>

<p>&quot;To get from the vision to the plans, here is the process we
will follow.&quot; The next transparency showed a flow chart.
&quot;First, we'll work our way through the MSF Design Process,
which I'll talk about in a minute. The output of that work goes
into the main deliverable for Planning, the Functional Specification.
Based on the Functional Spec, we then develop a Master Project Plan and
a Master Project Schedule. Those three documents&#8212;the
Specification, the Plan, and the Schedule&#8212;drive the Developing
Phase. Any questions so far?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So the Functional Spec is where we get down to the
nitty-gritty detail of the application?&quot; asked Marta.</p>

<p>&quot;That's right,&quot; said Dan. &quot;Only when we've
agreed on that can we finalize our plans for the remainder of the
project, and only after we've finalized our plans can we do the
final schedule.&quot; He turned to a new page in his project notebook.
&quot;Does anyone remember where the plan and schedule come
from?&quot;</p>

<p>Marta and Marilou both began thumbing furiously through their
notebooks, and Marta mumbled, &quot;I seem to remember something about
'top-down versus bottom-up scheduling,' but I can't find
it.&quot;</p>

<p>Tim leaned over to look at Dan's notebook, then leaned back
toward Marta and stage-whispered, &quot;Try page 56.&quot; He grinned
at Dan as everyone else turned to the correct page, and Marta said
triumphantly, &quot;The project plan and schedule are a compilation of
our individual plans and schedules.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Exactly right,&quot; said Dan, smiling, &quot;even if you did
get help from the peanut gallery over here.&quot; He put a new
transparency on the overhead. &quot;Let's take a look at what each
of you is supposed to focus on during this phase, and what plans and
schedules you each deliver.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan explained the deliverables each of them was responsible for.
&quot;The final deliverable is a revision of the Master Risk Assessment
Document, which we'll do toward the end. Any questions?&quot;</p>

<p>Marta and Marilou raised their hands at almost the same time, but
Marilou put hers down again. &quot;I bet you're going to ask the
same thing I am, so you go ahead.&quot; Marta turned to Dan.
&quot;Looking at these deliverables, I'm not sure I know how to
pull this off. I'm not a developer. How do I evaluate the design
for testability, for instance? And how does Marilou evaluate for
support?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good questions, Marta. The short answer is that I've got
some extra material for both of you, along with some books for you to
look through. I'll also be working with both of you individually,
just as I have with Jane on her conceptual design work, which we'll
see in a moment. And I'll give you the contact information for the
people who filled these roles on the project at my old law firm. They
said you could call them if you needed to.&quot;</p>

<p>Marilou gave a thumbs-up. &quot;I figured you'd have planned
ahead, Dan. Thanks!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not a problem. Remember, I want you all to be successful. Now
let's take a look at how we design an application.&quot;</p>

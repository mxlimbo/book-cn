<A NAME="271"><H1>Vision Approved Milestone and Its Deliverables</H1></A>

<p>The goal of the Envisioning Phase is to reach the Vision Approved
Milestone, which is the culmination of the team's work during this
phase and signifies agreement between the customer and the team on
critical project issues.</p>

<p>Four deliverables are required to meet the Vision Approved
Milestone. They are:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> A Vision Document, which outlines the product being developed,
the needs it will meet, its features, and initial schedule</li></p>

<p><li> A Project Structure Document, which outlines who is responsible
for each role in the MSF Development Team Model and identifies the team
lead for each role</li></p>

<p><li> A Master Risk Assessment Document, which lists possible risks to
the project and outlines how the team plans to deal with each one</li></p>
</ul>



<p>We also recommend that a prototype system be included with the
deliverables for this milestone to show how the team initially plans to
execute the project, and to present concrete visual evidence of the
product vision.</p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr> The goal of any deliverable is that it serves as
an efficient communication tool. In this context, a deliverable does
not necessarily result in a paper artifact. A deliverable can take
whatever form is appropriate (a document, a diagram, a screen shot,
e-mail, and so on) as long as it facilitates
communication.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>Every major milestone in the MSF Development Process Model signifies
an agreement between the customer, the project team, and any other key
project stakeholders. Reaching the Vision Approved Milestone indicates
agreement on the points listed in Table 5.4.</p>

<p>The Vision Approved Milestone provides the initial opportunity for
the customer and the project team to decide whether to proceed with the
project. After reviewing the deliverables from the Envisioning Phase
and fully understanding the product vision, the customer or the project
team may decide that the product does not provide enough benefits to
justify its costs. This decision represents a critical point in the
beginning of the project. A well-executed Envisioning Phase enables the
team and the project stakeholders to proceed with confidence, knowing
that there is sufficient information about the remaining development
phases to maximize the chances for success.</p>

<A NAME="272"><H2>Vision Document</H2></A>

<p>To be effective, the Vision Document developed by the end of the
Envisioning Phase should include at least these elements:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> A vision statement</li></p>

<p><li> User research</li></p>

<p><li> Competitive information</li></p>

<p><li> Feature buckets and features</li></p>

<p><li> A rough schedule</li></p>
</ul>



<A NAME="273"><H3>Writing a Vision Statement</H3></A>

<p>During the 1960s, when the United States was trying to place a man
on the moon, President John F. Kennedy created a vision for everyone in
the country to rally behind. We can paraphrase that vision as:</p>

<blockquote><i>In the next decade, we will send a man to the moon and back
safely.</i></blockquote>

<p>This vision statement illustrates many of the attributes of SMART
goals, which are:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Specific</li></p>

<p><li> Measurable</li></p>

<p><li> Achievable</li></p>

<p><li> Relevant</li></p>

<p><li> Time-based</li></p>
</ul>



<p>To bring this discussion down to earth, another example of a solid
vision statement is:</p>

<blockquote><i>Quickly create the fastest spreadsheet on the
planet.</i></blockquote>

<p>Presented with that vision statement, every member of the project
team would instantly know that performance issues were more important
than any other factor. In fact, a good rule for concise vision
statements is to make them so clear that a new employee will stand as a
good chance of working toward a solution that is consistent with the
project's goals as a current employee.</p>

<A NAME="274"><H3>Reporting on User Research</H3></A>

<p>What the team learns about its customer and users is the
underpinning of everything else it does. Site visits, contextual
research, market research, focus groups, and international visits will
help gather the information needed to describe the primary customer and
the users. Additionally, this research provides information for
creating usage scenarios that describe how users currently work and how
they will work in the future with the product.</p>

<A NAME="275"><H3>Providing Competitive Information</H3></A>

<p>Will the product provide an appropriate return on investment in both
today's and tomorrow's competitive landscapes? What other
solutions are available to meet the customer's needs? The team must
make sure that the product it envisions solves the customer's
problem better than any other available solution and that it does so in
a way that justifies the investment. The best solution to a problem
doesn't have to be a software solution. For example, it may be
simpler and more cost-effective to hire the services of a person, such
as an accountant, instead of using financial software. Even if a
software solution does fit the needs, it should not be assumed that the
software must be built from scratch. Research about other systems that
provide the required functionality might identify a commercial
solution. Even if the solution is not purchased, insight can be gained
from the commercial software that will lead the team toward creating a
stronger internal product.</p>

<p>Sometimes a project must compete with other demands on the
organization's resources. For example, in the latter part of the
1990s, many companies spent a significant portion of their software
budgets evaluating the threat of the Year 2000 problem, which directly
affected many other software projects.</p>

<A NAME="276"><H3>Describing Feature Buckets and Features</H3></A>

<p>Feature buckets are the categories into which all the product's
features will fit. Program Management uses these categories to test
whether the proposed features meet the goals of the product. If a
feature doesn't fit into any of the buckets, it's probably not
important enough for the current release.</p>

<p>Feature buckets should be specified with an eye to the future. Some
people maintain that each release of a product can provide only three
categories of features. Even so, it's a good idea to create as many
as five feature buckets to allow for a product's current and future
needs. This practice builds a foundation now for the features that will
be postponed until a later version of the product.</p>

<A NAME="277"><H3>Specifying Priorities and the Schedule</H3></A>

<p>By the end of the research, analysis, and rationalization steps in
the envisioning process, the team usually has a rough idea of the
schedule and of the tradeoffs necessary to meet it. Additionally, the
team will choose the appropriate tradeoff triangle setting for the
project and will use the triangle to communicate how the project's
resources, features, and ship date will be constrained, optimized, and
accepted. Including this information in the Vision Document shows that
the team is thinking about the tangible realities of development, and
gives some structure to the other elements of the vision.</p>

<A NAME="278"><H2>Prototype System</H2></A>

<p>Clearly communicating the information learned from the customer and
users is difficult. Information about business requirements must be
communicated to team members with varying degrees of technical and
business background, and information about how the product will solve
the business problem must be communicated to the customer and
users.</p>

<p>To more easily accomplish this communication, a prototype
application that demonstrates portions of the product's vision
should be developed during the envisioning process and included in the
Vision Approved Milestone deliverables. The prototype may be a working
application, or it may be a series of sample application screen shots.
This prototype helps clarify existing ideas and helps draw out
additional ideas from the team, the customer, and the product's
users.</p>

<A NAME="279"><H2>Project Structure Document</H2></A>

<p>Whereas the Vision Document describes what will be done, the Project
Structure Document describes who will do it. This document simply
identifies:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Each team role.</li></p>

<p><li> Who the lead is for each role.</li></p>

<p><li> Who is assigned to each team and their contact information.</li></p>

<p><li> Who the project stakeholders are.</li></p>

<p><li> How the project will be managed, such as change control systems
and status reporting.</li></p>

<p><li> Project meeting schedules, e-mail aliases, and web sites.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>It can also be helpful to include a short description of the team
leads' background and experience and to provide contact information
for stakeholders such as the product's customer and key users.</p>

<A NAME="280"><H2>Master Risk Assessment Document</H2></A>

<p>An important deliverable of the Vision Approved Milestone is the
Master Risk Assessment Document, which provides an analysis of the
project's risks and plans to manage them. The bulk of the Master
Risk Assessment Document consists of the itemized risks with their
descriptions that were gathered in the risk action planning step of the
MSF Risk Management Process described earlier. These are typically
summarized into a top-ten list, both for an executive overview and to
raise additional awareness. This list describes the risks, their
contingency plans, and who is responsible for executing those plans.
Finally, a simple chart of risks with their management metrics can
quickly communicate which risks have the greatest probability of
occurrence and greatest impact on the project.</p>

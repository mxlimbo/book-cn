<A NAME="676"><H1>Preparation for a Project Review Meeting</H1></A>

<p>The basic agenda for any project review should cover the following
questions:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> How did the project schedule work for the team?</li></p>

<p><li> How effectively were resources applied to the project?</li></p>

<p><li> What strengths and weaknesses of each project phase can team
members identify?</li></p>

<p><li> What did not work well on the project?</li></p>

<p><li> What suggestions can team members make to improve the overall
process?</li></p>

<p><li> What recommendations would team members make for future
projects?</li></p>
</ul>



<p>The questions listed above do not necessarily have to be addressed
in any particular order in the project review process; however, they
are essential starting points for any project review. Typically,
Program Management should arrange the project review process and
timeline before the actual review process takes place, and add any
additional questions or issues, tailored specifically to the project,
to cover in the review.</p>

<p>All team members involved in the project should feel free to reflect
on their involvement, roles, percent of time spent on the project,
dates involved, and so forth. Typically, the project review timeline
acts as a vehicle to focus people on the entire project, rather than
the final project stages or their exclusive roles in the project.</p>

<p>For most projects, the process and agenda should be distributed a
week in advance, along with recommended issues for the team to
contemplate when preparing for the actual review. The team members may
want to respond before the actual meeting or meetings to allow Program
Management to further organize the project review and distribute a
project observation list.</p>

<p>For a small or informal review process, the team may simply consider
a review agenda and mention their observations at a single review
meeting. It is beneficial for the team to look over reviews from
earlier projects, to help set the team's 
expectations.</p>

<A NAME="677"><H3>Facilitating the Meeting</H3></A>

<p>It is often beneficial to have an individual outside of the project
team facilitate the review meeting. Otherwise, the Program Management
team lead should identify a facilitator for any review meetings, as
Program Management is ultimately responsible for facilitating the
review process.</p>

<p>The facilitator should maintain order and structure in the meeting,
and also 
ensure that the team members remain focused and do not personally
attack one another. The facilitator should also make sure that all
agenda items are covered, that everyone is equally involved in
discussions, and that the meeting is conducted within the appropriate
time frame.</p>

<A NAME="678"><H3>Recording the Discussion</H3></A>

<p>Ideally, the project review discussion should be recorded so that
all team members can observe what's being written. Large sheets of
flipchart paper taped on the meeting room's walls, computers, and
whiteboards can all be effective means of recording the meeting.</p>

<p>Recording the discussion is effective because everyone involved
focuses on the information itself instead of on one another, helping
keep the discussion on track. Creating new documents during a review
meeting is also excellent in facilitating the meeting because they
offer an alternative means for which to handle unrelated topics or
tangents&#8212;the recorder simply writes off-subject ideas on a
separate sheet of paper. That way, valid ideas aren't lost, but
they don't defocus the team's discussions pertinent to the set
agenda, either.</p>

<p>In addition, recording comments prompts team members to voice their
thoughts more concisely and to avoid repeating issues already
documented. Lastly, it's often beneficial to provide an objective
recorder not directly involved with the project. Thus, the recorder can
focus on capturing information, while not necessarily analyzing
thoughts as they are presented.</p>

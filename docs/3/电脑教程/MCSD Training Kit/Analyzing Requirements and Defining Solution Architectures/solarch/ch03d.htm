<A NAME="134"><H1>The MSF Development Team Model</H1></A>

<p>Because a large number of activities must be performed and several
perspectives must be addressed in each project, assigning ownership of
key project-success factors to specific team roles significantly
improves project-success rates. As shown in Figure 3.1, MSF identifies
six distinct roles that comprise the MSF Development Team Model. Each
role has clearly defined responsibilities, and when all roles are
combined at the completion of a project, all critical success factors
will have been covered.</p>

<P><A HREF="javascript:fullSize('f03ar01x.htm')" onMouseOver="window.status='Click to view at full size';return true;" onMouseOut="window.status='';return true;"><IMG SRC="images/f03ar01.jpg" WIDTH=404 HEIGHT=329 BORDER=0 ALT="Click to view at full size"></A></P>
<P><!-- caption --><b>Figure 3.1</b> <i> MSF Development Team Model's roles</i><!-- /caption --></P>

<p>Usually, each role has a team of people assigned to it to carry out
that role's responsibilities, with one person acting as the role
team's leader. Assigning a leader to each role creates a single
point of contact to represent that role on the project team.</p>

<p><div class="caution"><blockquote><b>CAUTION</b><hr> Assigning responsibility to teams of people
can mean that no one takes responsibility for anything. But with MSF,
each team role has specific responsibilities for critical portions of
the development process. The overall success of the project is the
primary shared responsibility of all the team members.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>For project teams to be successful, they should have:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Experienced leaders.</li></p>

<p><li> Self-motivated team members, empowered to make decisions and
accountable for the success of their team's role.</li></p>

<p><li> A focus on shipping the product.</li></p>

<p><li> A commitment to a shared project vision.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>To facilitate communication, a project team should be a small,
multi-disciplined group that has the following characteristics of good
teambuilding:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Trust</b> People can rely on each other, and each person
exhibits repeatable patterns of consistent behavior. &quot;We do what
we say we will do.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Respect</b> People have regard for each other's abilities.
&quot;We all add value to the team.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Commitment</b> Everyone agrees on the project's goals and
accepts success as an all-or-nothing proposition. &quot;We will get it
done, period.&quot;</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Accountability</b> People act on clearly defined goals,
responsibilities, and expectations. &quot;I'll do this, you'll
do that, and by Tuesday we'll have built our house.&quot;</li></p>
</ul>



<p>These fundamental characteristics will lead the team to what's
known as the &quot;right&quot; principle: &quot;It's everyone's
responsibility to ship the right product at the right time.&quot;</p>

<A NAME="135"><H2>Product Management</H2></A>

<p>The job of the Product Management role is to respond to the
customer's need or problem. The key contribution of this role is to
drive the team to a shared vision of how to meet the need or solve the
problem. Product Management answers the business-driven question
&quot;Why are we doing this?&quot; and ensures that all members of the
team know and understand the answer.</p>

<p>The key external goal of this role is customer satisfaction. Product
Management can achieve this goal by acting as the customer advocate to
the team and as the team advocate to the customer. (Here, it's
important to distinguish between the customer and the users: The
customer pays for the product, while the users use it.) Product
Management works with Program Management to determine the
&quot;tradeoffs&quot; between what the project will deliver, the
project development time, and the amount of money it will cost.</p>

<p>As the customer advocate to the team, the leader of the Product
Management role is responsible for understanding customer requirements,
creating the business case, establishing the shared project vision
between the team and the customer, and ensuring that any solution that
the team develops meets the needs of the customer by solving the
particular business problem.</p>

<p>As the team advocate to the customer, the leader of this role is
responsible for high-level communications and managing customer
expectations. High-level communications include public relations,
briefings to the customer and senior management, marketing to users,
demonstrations, and product launches.</p>

<p>Product Management also communicates the initial ship dates the
customer expects the team to target. However, successful projects
employ a bottom-up scheduling process determined by other team roles,
and Product Management must then communicate the achievable ship dates
to the customer.</p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr> The customer (the person paying the bill for the
project) will have a set of expectations for the project. Meeting these
expectations creates a satisfied customer, which helps define a
successful project. Once a project's vision is set, the key role
for Product Management is to manage customer expectations. Thus, the
Product Management role often defines what success and failure are for
a project.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>Product Management should continually manage customer expectations
by asking the question &quot;Did we do what we said we would do?&quot;
Suppose a project had an initial goal of delivering five features for
$10,000 in two weeks, but instead delivered three features for $7,000
in one and a half weeks. Was this project a successful one for the
customer? From a Product Management view, we would say, &quot;We agreed
with the client on the second day which of the most important features
could be done within the budget and the time frame. We met those goals,
so the project was successful. We've started a second project for
the other two features and two additional features.&quot; Product
Management included the customer in the tradeoff, demonstrated the
decision-making process, and informed the customer of the changing
risks and challenges. (The standard challenges are cost control,
resource allocation, product features, and the product completion
date.) When everyone involved with the project can say, &quot;Yes, we
did what we said we would do,&quot; trust and respect are built among
team members and with the customer.</p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr> Poorly communicated expectations are the primary
reason so many projects fail. When a project's features, resources,
or ship date change, whether planned or not, the expectations of the
customer, the users, and all project team members should be
reset.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>The Product Management team represents the interests of the customer
and helps the customer identify and prioritize the features of the
product. Because the customer has final signoff on which features can
wait for a later release and which features must appear in this
release, Product Management facilitates this decision by ensuring
communication between the customer and the team. Program Management may
be asked to remove features from the current release to meet the
product ship deadlines, because Program Management is responsible for
the schedule and for determining how long it takes to deliver the
agreed-on feature set. If Program Management determines that a feature
must be cut to maintain the schedule, the customer and Product
Management can agree or not agree. However, if the customer and Product
Management decide that the feature must stay in this version, they must
also agree that Program Management can change the schedule and the ship
date. Alternatively, the customer and Product Management may choose to
spend more money to allow the addition of members to the project team.
Program Management will determine where and how the money is spent, as
well as whether the addition will in fact improve the schedule. The
customer and Product Management will approve the overall cost of the
project.</p>

<p><div class="caution"><blockquote><b>CAUTION</b><hr> Applying additional resources to projects
does not always decrease time schedules, because communication and
management overhead increases.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>Within the project team, the term <i>Product Champion</i> might be
used to describe the leader of the Product Management role. Often, the
Product Champion will be a member of the organization's senior
management team. The other people assigned to the Product Management
role will be the individuals with the strongest understanding of the
organization's structure, business, and strategic goals.</p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr> If the project team is a consulting group or
vendor for a project, Product Management will have two sets of customer
expectations to meet: those of the consumer, who sponsors the project
and foots the bill, and those of the customer, who is typically the IT
person who engages the consulting group and pays for its services.
Typically, the consulting group will need to rely on its expertise to
explain the organization's use of MSF and how both the consumer and
the customer will work with the project team within this
framework.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="136"><H2>Program Management</H2></A>

<p>The job of the Program Management role is to own the development
process and to drive the process to ensure the product is delivered
within the project constraints. The leader of this role must understand
the difference between being a leader and being a boss. In his book <i>
Dynamics of Software Development</i> (Microsoft Press, 1995), former
Microsoft Program Management team director Jim McCarthy writes:</p>

<blockquote><i>Keep in mind that the goal is to endow each person on the
team with the fullest possible authority, not to rake it in for
yourself.</i></blockquote>

<p>The primary responsibility of the leader of the Program Management
role is to move the project through the development process to ensure
that the right product is delivered at the right time. Through
leadership, facilitation, and consensus building, this leader
coordinates all the other team leaders and their particular
responsibilities. Although occasional scheduling pressures may mean the
Program Management leader must prod the team firmly back on track, he
or she should forget the dictatorial management style.</p>

<p>The leader of Program Management owns the overall schedule for the
project, which has been built from the bottom up by the other roles
within the project team. He or she coordinates the creation of the
project's master schedule with the other team leaders. Any overrun
or buffer time for the project is owned by and applied at the
appropriate time by Program Management. When individual portions of the
project are completed ahead of or behind schedule, Program Management
determines the impact on other roles and coordinates schedule
changes.</p>

<p>The skills needed for the Program Management role include a strong
understanding of the business side of the organization as well as a
solid understanding of the technology currently used by the
organization and the technology needed for the project. The leader of
the Program Management role must possess strong organization skills and
strong communication skills.</p>

<p>In organizations that are new to MSF, Program Management often
requires a much deeper understanding of the framework and processes
that enhance the efficiency of the rest of the team and its leaders.
Although leadership characteristics are important for all roles, this
expertise is particularly important in Program Management. To be most
effective, the Program Management team should have the respect of the
other team members before the project begins, including the business,
technical, and senior management groups. Typically, the Program
Management team will include the administrative resources used by other
team roles, as well as support for scheduling and coordinating various
meetings among the different team roles.</p>

<p>As the owner of the project's feature set, Program Management
defines which features will be delivered in order to meet the agreed
upon requirements. Product Management may determine critical
requirements, but Program Management determines which particular
product features meet those requirements. Additionally, Program
Management recommends to the customer which features may be negotiated
for future versions given time and money constraints. Program
Management owns the features outlined in the Functional Specification
(what will be built) and the Master Project Plan (how it will be
built). Program Management also coordinates and facilitates the
creation of these documents by getting input from each of the team
members. It's essential that each member contribute his or her
input and approve the Functional Specification and Master Project
Plan.</p>

<p><div class="caution"><blockquote><b>CAUTION</b><hr> It's important for the Program Management
leader to remember that team members have a much deeper knowledge of
their particular responsibilities than he or she has. Program
Management needs to rely on them, trust their expertise, and yet still
provide the overall framework to deliver the whole product within all
project constraints.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>As the owner of the project's budget, Program Management
facilitates the creation of the planned cost by gathering resource
requirements from all of the roles on the team. Program Management must
understand and agree with all resource decisions (hardware, software,
people, and so on) and must track the actual costs against the planned
costs. However, the Program Management leader will need to provide
regular status reports to the team and key stakeholders throughout the
project. Another symptom of failed projects is the delay of status
report delivery until after the budget has been exceeded. It's
important to remember that adding additional funding is a tradeoff and
is therefore a decision that should be made by Product Management and
the customer.</p>

<A NAME="137"><H2>Development</H2></A>

<p>The job of Development is to be technology consultants and product
builders. As technology consultants, Development provides input into
high-level designs, evaluates technologies, and develops prototypes and
proof-of-concept systems to validate potential solutions and to
mitigate development risks early in the development process. To succeed
in meeting its quality goal, it is important that Development focus not
only on coding certain aspects of the project according to the
Functional Specification, but also on solving the business problem. As
a result, Development must innovate, but only to solve the
customer's problem, not just for the sake of implementing
interesting features. Often to improve envisioning and communication,
Development will create prototypes, and to test technology that is new
to the organization, the group will create proof-of-concept systems.
These systems may also provide ways to communicate architectural
decisions to the rest of the team.</p>

<p>As builders, Development provides a low-level product and feature
design, estimates the effort required to deliver that design, and then
builds the product. In many organizations, a few senior members of the
Development team drive the architecture for the product. These
architects are involved in the early phases of a project, fleshing out
the details of the Functional Specification and determining the
appropriate internal and external system interactions for the
product.</p>

<p>Development estimates its own schedules because it is responsible
for the daily coding work. This MSF concept of schedules being created
by those responsible for the work is called <i>bottom-up
scheduling</i>. It is an important factor in delivering the right
product at the right time. The goal is to achieve a higher quality
schedule and to increase accountability for the estimates and for the
work.</p>

<p>Development's responsibility for the technical implementation of
the project's features primarily falls within the Logical Model and
Physical Model of the Enterprise Application Model discussed in <a href="ch02a.htm">Chapter
2</a>. Development determines exactly how to implement each feature, the
actual architectural implementation, and how long the coding portion of
the project will take to implement. Development does not determine
which features to implement, but how to write the code for the
product.</p>

<p>In addition, during the Planning Phase of a project, Development
must be able to determine the impact on the schedule of adding and
removing features. During the late phases, Development is not
specifically responsible for the actual deployment of the product, but
it must work closely with Logistics Management to understand what
installation and setup routines will be needed.</p>

<p><div class="caution"><blockquote><b>CAUTION</b><hr> The person assigned as the leader of the
Development role should not be assigned to any other roles. The goal is
to let the developers do what they do best: write &quot;killer
code.&quot;</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="138"><H2>Testing</H2></A>

<p>The job of the Testing role is reality induction. Testing must be
able to clearly articulate both what is currently wrong with the
product, and what is currently right with it, so that the status of the
product's development is accurately portrayed. Performing a valid
test requires a good grasp of the needs of the users and a clear
understanding of what the product will do to meet those needs. Testing
develops test strategies, plans, schedules, and scripts.</p>

<p>The goal of Testing is to make sure that the team knows and
addresses all 
issues before releasing the product. An issue is anything that prevents
the product from meeting its requirements. It can be a fault in the
Development team's code (known as a bug), a deviation from the
Program Management team's specification, or a defect in the User
Education team's documentation.</p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr> It's important to distinguish between
Testing and total quality assurance (TQA). Testing has a project focus
and involves detailed technical work. TQA, on the other hand, is often
a corporate function organized under a Director of Quality, whose
responsibility is process compliance with corporate, government, or
other regulatory standards.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>The same people should not be assigned to the Testing and
Development roles. Two key reasons for such a separation are:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Better, independent assurance that coded products truly meet the
requirements.</li></p>

<p><li> The ability to exploit the concurrency of two working teams.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>Testing's independent assessment should verify that Development
has met its quality goals, but it is everyone's responsibility, not
just Testing's, to ship a good product.</p>

<p><div class="caution"><blockquote><b>CAUTION</b><hr> It is the Development team's
responsibility to write quality code. Separating the Testing role from
the Development role does not remove the responsibility of code quality
from the Development team.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="139"><H3>Change Control</H3></A>

<p>The project will need a change control process and system.
Committing to the change control process is everyone's
responsibility, though implementing the change control system often
falls to Testing. Developers have used source code control systems such
as Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for years, but this type of system
provides only revision control. All project artifacts, such as
documents, agendas, functional specifications, source code, and
compiled code, must be placed under revision control, but revision
control is only a portion of change management. As an example, simply
turning on revision marks in Microsoft Word does not ensure that the
correct edits are made and that the correct information is presented.
Thus, change management incorporates many additional steps,
including:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> Creating a baseline.</li></p>

<p><li> Determining which elements should change.</li></p>

<p><li> Determining how the change will affect existing systems,
processes, or documents.</li></p>

<p><li> Identifying how the change will be implemented.</li></p>

<p><li> Identifying who will implement the change.</li></p>

<p><li> Determining the impact the change will have on project
constraints, budget, schedule, and politics.</li></p>

<p><li> Determining who makes the change-approval decision.</li></p>

<p><li> Implementing the change.</li></p>

<p><li> Creating a new baseline that includes the change.</li></p>
</ul>



<p><div class="caution"><blockquote><b>CAUTION</b><hr> Change proposals should be evaluated in
batches to prevent the project team from being overwhelmed or
distracted from daily work plans.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="140"><H3>Compiling Source Code</H3></A>

<p>A few important responsibilities of Testing are often
overlooked:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Bug reporting and tracking</b> As with change management,
implementing the bug reporting and tracking system is also the
responsibility of the Testing team.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Building the product</b> Someone must be responsible for
building (compiling) the product, and often this <i>Build Meister</i>
is a member of the Testing team. The Build Meister should use only the
source code that is stored in the revision control system. Compile
scripts can automate much of the tedium of building code; however,
ensuring that the build occurs properly is important.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Risk tracking and management</b> Ongoing risk tracking and
management are the responsibility of all teams. Program Management
should provide a common method for tracking risks, such as using
Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. The Testing team's role is
&quot;reality induction,&quot; meaning that it provides an outside view
of development risks and schedule.</li></p>
</ul>



<p><div class="caution"><blockquote><b>CAUTION</b><hr> Risk plans that are created or updated five
minutes before a project review meeting are useless. Teams should be
managing risks as a continuous, ongoing process to help ensure that
quality products can be delivered on time.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="141"><H2>User Education</H2></A>

<p>The job of the User Education role is to enhance user performance so
that users are as productive as possible with the product. To
accomplish this goal, User Education acts as the advocate for the users
of the product, much like Product Management acts as the customer
advocate. However, this is a two-way street, because User Education
also acts as the team's advocate to the users of the product.</p>

<p>As the user advocate to the project team, User Education
participates in the design process to ensure delivery of a product that
is useful and usable, and that needs as little performance support
material as possible. User Education is responsible for usability
testing, tracking usability issues, and ensuring that those issues are
addressed in the product's user interface (UI) design.</p>

<p>By actively participating in UI design as well as other user
enhancements, User Education can have a direct impact on a project by
helping to reduce the costs of supporting it in the operations/delivery
channel. These ongoing support costs are often not adequately
considered for many software products. However, the cost-benefit
calculation is very simple: The easier a program is to use, the lower
the ongoing user support costs.</p>

<p><div class="caution"><blockquote><b>CAUTION</b><hr> Do not fall into the budgetary trap of
assigning unrealistic user productivity gains that grossly overestimate
the total ROI for a project.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<p>Too often projects roll into production without a training plan or
consideration of how the users will actually learn to use the product.
Where user performance support materials are required, User Education
designs, builds, and tests the materials that will enable easier use.
These materials can include reference cards, keyboard templates, user
manuals, online help, wizards, Web pages, and even full-featured
courseware. Once the support materials are created, User Education
coordinates the appropriate training for the user community.</p>

<p>Just as it is important for Product Management to manage the
expectations of the customer, it is important for User Education to
manage the expectations of the user community. However, users
shouldn't be expected to be able to understand the language of the
Functional Specification. Using prototypes to communicate business and
technical requirements to the user community greatly improves the
success of the project. Additionally, users will feel progress is being
made when they actually see screens and working portions of programs.
Although marketing is the responsibility of Product Management, it is
important to keep users informed. Randomly posted signs, e-mails about
new features or functionality, and beta test programs are excellent
methods of communicating with the user community.</p>

<p><div class="note"><blockquote><b>NOTE</b><hr> In cases where an application is being developed
for another organization, the User Education role is still important.
The consulting organization can't expect the IT person who is
paying the bill to adequately represent or interact with the user
community. Just as Product Management manages customer expectations,
User education manages those of users. Successful projects never spring
new products on users and expect that they will love the features.
Adequate preparation and training are always essential.</blockquote></div>
</p>

<A NAME="142"><H2>Logistics Management</H2></A>

<p>The job of the Logistics Management role is to serve as the advocate
for the operations, product support, help desk, and other delivery
channel organizations, and to focus on the smooth deployment and
ongoing management of the product. Logistics Management participates in
the design process to help ensure that the product is deployable,
manageable, and supportable. This role is responsible for creating the
deployment schedule. Logistics Management, Product Management, and
Program Management work together to determine which users and sites
will receive the product in what order. Logistics Management then
prepares the sites to receive the product.</p>

<p>For large projects, the Logistics Management team leader should have
experience with large-scale product deployments to several thousand
desktops. Logistics Management is responsible for the entire deployment
of the product to all desktop systems, and requires both a strong
technical background and excellent communication skills. Logistics
Management also oversees the technicians or contractors who install,
configure, and migrate the users' systems. Additionally, this role
requires experience in estimating and coordinating software
installations.</p>

<p>Logistics Management is responsible for understanding the
product's infrastructure and its support requirements. All
installation sites, as well as all user systems, must meet those
requirements before the product can be deployed. Typically, this is
facilitated through the creation and implementation of rollout,
installation, and support plans. Significant advances in Microsoft
Windows 2000, the Active Directory, and System Management Server have
greatly decreased the deployment effort required to target and touch
user systems.</p>

<p>Although Logistics Management's primary responsibility is to
smoothly deploy the product to all users, the leader of this role also
needs to create an ongoing support plan and ensure that existing
support groups are able to help users. Just as important as training
the user community is providing training to the operations and
help-desk personnel. The training process must involve these groups
early in the product's life cycle and during the beta-test phase.
Formal support documentation, backup and restore requirements, and
disaster-recovery plans must be created for the product before it is
handed off to the operations group. For a fixed period after turning a
product over to operations, Logistics Management should plan on
providing the operations group with technical support. It is difficult
to anticipate all the problems and issues that will arise from a fully
deployed application, so Logistics Management must plan for the
unexpected.</p>

<p>Other Logistics Management activities include supporting interim
operations and supporting the product during the development process.
Logistics Management will often be required to assist in monitoring the
applications' behavior within the test environment. Additionally,
this role provides initial support for the software during the
production process in the form of development systems, test systems,
certification, and production systems. Product support for the
quasi-production process used during the beta-testing phase must also

should provide the Development team with the appropriate information

of the installation, the use of automated software delivery tools, and
the migration processes created by the Development team will determine

<A NAME="67"><H1>Summary</H1></A>

<p>In this chapter, we began by describing <i>architecture</i> as a
coherent, unified technology plan. We noted that architecture should
focus on business goals and objectives and provide direction for IT. We
then discussed the need for both business unit and IT managers to make
a commitment to architecture-first design and practice.</p>

<p>We examined the challenges facing the IT organization in today's
rapidly changing business environment and concluded that the only sane
response to such an environment is a well-designed enterprise
architecture. We gave this definition of enterprise architecture:</p>

<p><blockquote><i>
A logically consistent plan of activities and coordinated projects
that guide the progression of an organization's application systems
and infrastructure. The plan should move from the current state to a
desired future state based on current and projected business objectives
and processes.</i></blockquote></p>

<p>We introduced MSF and discussed the MSF Enterprise Architecture
Model, which is based on four perspectives (Business, Applications,
Information, and Technology) and has four goals (to be integrated,
iterative, actionable, and prioritized). We noted the importance of
aligning enterprise architecture with the business goals of the
organization and discussed the wall that can exist between IT and the
business units.</p>

<p>Finally, we discussed the relationships between the
organization's strategic plan, its enterprise architecture, and
individual application projects.</p>

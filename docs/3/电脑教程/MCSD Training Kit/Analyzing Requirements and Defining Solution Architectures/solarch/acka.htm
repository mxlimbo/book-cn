<A NAME="1"><H1>Acknowledgments</H1></A>

<p>Many thanks for the tireless support from my family, the entire KiZAN 
team, and my fellow authors, Bruce and Tim. Thanks for the help from Eric, 
Wendy, and Vicky from Microsoft Press in publishing this book. Also, thanks to 
Rod Fergusson for his insightful comments, and the MSF group and Mary 
Kirtland for the extensive use of their material.</p> 

<p>This book could also not have been created without the incredible editing 
team at OTSI. Special thanks to Joyce Cox and Joan Lambert. If any of this 
book makes sense, they deserve the credit, and if not, I deserve the blame. </p>

<p>For the undaunted support and love from my wife, Sandy, I'm eternally 
thankful. You keep my life together, while I do crazy things such as writing&#8212;and yes, 
I'm done with this one.</p> 

<p><i>&#8212;Scott F. Wilson</i></p>

<p>First of all, I would like to thank Scott for being such a great person to 
work with. Doing a big book is no bowl of cherries, but you made it 
worthwhile, friend. I'd also like to acknowledge all the folks at KiZAN, who have been 
unfailingly helpful, professional, and pleasant throughout. Thanks to 
Allan McGuffey, who taught me not to be passive.</p> 

<p>Additionally, even though they may not see it, I want to throw a thank-you to 
the staff at the Steak-and-Shake, without whom much of the late-night 
authoring would not have been possible! Finally, I want to thank the two most 
important people in my life: Jesus Christ, and my wife, Nina. Between the two of them, 
I am about as blessed as any one man can be.</p>

<p><i>&#8212;Bruce Maples</i></p>

<p>Thanks to the KiZAN team for continuing to deliver great products. 
Special thanks to my wife, Laura, and our daughters, Taylor and Hannah, for their continuing love, patience, and support.</p>

<p><i>&#8212;Tim Landgrave</i></p>

<A NAME="227"><H1>Relationships Between Models</H1></A>

<p>Much of this book is concerned with various models. (As we said
earlier, a model is an abstraction used to simplify or represent a
process or concept.) It is important to remember that many of these
models are interrelated. As we conclude Part 1 of this book, we need to
examine the relationships between models at three different layers of
abstraction.</p>

<p>The MSF Enterprise Architecture Model discussed in <A HREF="ch01a.htm">Chapter 1</A> should
exist at the highest level of abstraction within the IT environment. In
other words, it is the top-level model or artifact for IT design and
practice. It should be related to, and driven by, the
organization's strategic plan. In turn, the MSF Enterprise
Architecture Model should be the driver for any Enterprise Application
Models that are developed.</p>

<p>The information captured in a higher-level model or document should
inform and flow into the appropriate area of the lower-level model or
document. The plans and processes outlined in the organization's
strategic plan and operations manual should, for example, be the basis
for the Business Perspective of the MSF Enterprise Architecture Model.
In turn, the Business Perspective of the MSF Enterprise Architecture
Model should form the Business Model of specific enterprise
applications. In other words, each application's architecture must
also cohabit with the organization's enterprise architecture.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we discussed the MSF Development Process Model,
which describes the process for building an application. A part of this
model is the development of a Design Model for the application's
conceptual, logical, and a physical architecture. Although it is not a
step-by-step process, the MSF Development Process Model helps provide
the steps for a project team to get where it wants to go.</p>

<p>It is sometimes difficult to show a clear-cut information flow
between parts of one model and parts of another.</p>

<p>It is also important to clearly understand terms from different
models that are similarly named. Table 4.3 helps keep the terms in
their correct &quot;home&quot; model.</p>

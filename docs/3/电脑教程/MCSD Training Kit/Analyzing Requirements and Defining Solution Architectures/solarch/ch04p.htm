<A NAME="231"><H1>Current State</H1></A>

<p>&quot;As most of you know, this project is concerned with possibly
building a new application called the Resource Management System, which
we call RMS for short. This application will take the place of our
current processes for scheduling resources and reporting and billing
time. I've asked some of you to prepare background information so
that we all know how we do these things today. I realize that two days
is short notice, so I gave this assignment to the people who are
already familiar with how we do things.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan glanced at Tim with a smile. &quot;Considering what you went
through last night, Tim, it's probably fortunate that I didn't
ask you to prepare anything extra for this meeting.&quot; Tim nodded.
&quot;Only too glad to be a spectator this time, boss.&quot;</p>


<A NAME="232"><H2>Scheduling Resources</H2></A>

<p>Dan turned to Marta Wolfe-Hellene, who was sitting at the end of the
conference table. &quot;Marta, even though you are fairly new to
Ferguson and Bardell, I knew that you had already had some experience
with how resources are scheduled. Why don't you begin?&quot;</p>

<P><A HREF="javascript:fullSize('gcs3ar01x.htm')" onMouseOver="window.status='Click to view at full size';return true;" onMouseOut="window.status='';return true;"><IMG SRC="images/gcs3ar01.jpg" WIDTH=404 HEIGHT=511 BORDER=0 ALT="Click to view at full size"></A></P>


<p>Marta stood to speak, referring to the neatly written notes in her
binder. &quot;The week I started with Ferguson and Bardell, the
Director of Engineering called me into his office. We talked about a
number of things, primarily what I would be doing and how the work was
done here. One of the things he showed me was his Master Scheduling
Sheet.</p>


<p>&quot;This was nothing more than a very large Excel spreadsheet,
with dates across the top and names down the left side. The names were
all the various resources he was responsible for&#8212;the engineers,
designers, secretaries, and administrative people. They were listed
alphabetically, by last name then first name.</p>


<p>&quot;He explained that whenever a project needed resources, he
would open this spreadsheet and scan it to see who was available during
the time frame of the project. If someone who was competent to do the
work was free, he would block out that person's time by filling in
the appropriate dates with the name of the project. If nobody was
available, he would have to either juggle resources or negotiate with
the salesperson who sold the job to see whether the dates could be
adjusted.</p>


<p>&quot;The system is fairly straightforward, and I've seen it
used in many small firms,&quot; commented Dan. &quot;However, Ferguson
and Bardell is not a small firm, which leads me to think that our
Director of Engineering might have some issues with this system. Am I
right, Marta?&quot;</p>

<p>Marta smiled. &quot;He told me he gave you an earful about it last
week on the golf course and that he wasn't taking you golfing again
unless you got it fixed. So I think that's a safe assumption,&quot;
she said to chuckles all around the table. &quot;I've made a list
of the issues that he and I discussed. Shall I put them on the
whiteboard?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's a good idea,&quot; replied Dan. &quot;In fact, put
up a Scheduling Resources heading, and we'll list all the issues as
we go along.&quot;</p>

<p>Marta walked to the whiteboard, wrote <i>Issues List</i> at the top,
and then put <i>Scheduling Resources</i> underneath.</p>


<A NAME="233"><H3>The Issues</H3></A>

<p>&quot;The first problem,&quot; she began, &quot;is that nothing on
the spreadsheet tells you the abilities of the various resources.&quot;
She wrote the problem on the board. &quot;Because it's a
spreadsheet, you can't list a varying number of facts about a
resource. So there's no way to search or to sort on abilities. I
know all about this problem, because it has already happened to
me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How so?&quot; asked Tim.</p>

<p>&quot;One of my areas of concentration in graduate school was
programmable logic controllers. Unfortunately, the Director didn't
know this and it didn't show up on the scheduling sheet, so when he
had a PLC job come up, he didn't think of me as a resource. We lost
the job even though I was available, because he didn't think he had
anyone to do it.&quot; Jim squirmed uncomfortably in his chair but
didn't say anything.</p>

<p>&quot;A second issue,&quot; continued Marta, adding it to the list
on the whiteboard, &quot;is that the scheduling sheet is disconnected
from the calendar system. Ferguson and Bardell uses Outlook and
Exchange as its calendar system, but very few people have any reason to
keep their Outlook calendars up to date.</p>


<p>&quot;As a result, managers can't check the availability of
resources via their calendars. When managers plug people into a
schedule, they either send an e-mail to them, telling them what they
are doing and when, or they try to page or call them. Often, managers
get back an e-mail saying that so-and-so is not actually available.
There is no link back from anyone's calendar to the resource
spreadsheets, so someone might look free on the spreadsheet when he or
she is actually out on vacation or already committed to a meeting. When
this happens, the manager has to go back to the spreadsheet and start
over.</p>

<p>&quot;Finally, the scheduling system is basically unmanageable. It
worked OK when each manager was responsible for, say, 30 people. With
Ferguson and Bardell's drive to create a flattened organization,
some managers are scheduling as many as 100 resources. It's simply
not possible for them to keep track of everyone's skill set, much
less everyone's calendar. To put it simply, we have outgrown the
spreadsheet method of scheduling.&quot; Marta sat down, and all eyes
turned back to Dan.</p>

<p>&quot;Good job, Marta,&quot; said Dan. &quot;Succinct and
accurate.&quot;</p>


<A NAME="234"><H2>Completing Timesheets</H2></A>

<p>Next Dan turned to Bill Pardi. &quot;Chief, I asked you to tell us
about timesheets for two reasons: because you've been doing them
for years, and because I know you've had problems with your
staff's timesheets. So, what can you tell us?&quot;</p>

<p>Bill grunted, &quot;Hope you don't expect me to stand up.
I'm worn out from filling out timesheets.&quot; Nods and smiles
came from the rest of the group around the table.</p>

<p>&quot;Our timesheet system is basically a manual process,&quot; Bill
began. &quot;We have a Word template that people use to create a new
timesheet each week. At the top is a place for the employee's Name,
ID Number, Department, Title, Status, and Supervisor. Below that is a
table, with columns for Date, Job Number, Category, Phase, Total Hours,
Billable Hours, Mileage, Meals, Lodging, and Description.&quot; He
passed a sample timesheet to the other members of the team, even though
most of them were already familiar with it.</p>

<p>&quot;There are some things to notice about the sheet,&quot; he
said. &quot;The employees fill in, line by line, how they spent their
work time during the week. Each line is supposed to have a Job Number.
This is the ID number for the job or project, and is assigned by the
accounting office.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How do they know the Job Number?&quot; asked Marilou, who, as
an independent contractor, kept her own timesheet and was not familiar
with the Ferguson and Bardell system.</p>

<p>&quot;They ask what it is, or they're told, whenever they get a
work assignment,&quot; replied Bill. &quot;Unfortunately, sometimes
they get the wrong one, or one hasn't been created yet because the
project is so new. That's one of the problems with this.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan interrupted, &quot;We'll get to the issues for this section
in a minute, everyone. In the meantime, let Bill finish laying out the
current system as it is.&quot; He turned back to Bill. &quot;What are
Category and Phase used for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, they aren't always used, Dan. They are primarily for
larger projects. Phase refers to the part of the project they are
working on, and Category is the generic type of activity.&quot; Bill
looked at Jane. &quot;For smaller jobs, there is no Phase. And on jobs
where it seems obvious what the activity is, we often leave the
Category blank and assume that Accounting will fill it in. Right,
Jane?&quot;</p>

<p>Jane grinned. &quot;Absolutely right, Bill. Of course, you know the
old saying about <i>assume</i>, right?&quot; Everyone laughed, and Jane
continued, &quot;I especially enjoy how every time-entry for your
department shows Development as the Category. How do you do Development
during lunch?&quot;</p>

<p>Before Bill could say anything, Tim interrupted. &quot;That's
easy! If you eat where Bill eats, you <i>develop</i> heartburn during
lunch!&quot; This got a good laugh from everyone, even Jim. Bill
growled back, &quot;I can't help it if you've got a pansy
stomach,&quot; but it was obvious he was joking.</p>

<p>Although the team had a lot to accomplish during the meeting, Dan
wasn't in too much of a hurry to pull them back on track. These
moments of good-natured ribbing were part of the process of becoming a
team, and he was glad to see the interaction between the members. He
paused to allow the laughter to die down and then said, &quot;Perhaps
we can all go to lunch with Bill and judge for ourselves.&quot; He
turned back to Bill. &quot;I see places for Total Hours and Billable
Hours. Why is that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Obviously, not all of the work done by everyone in the company
is billable,&quot; Bill answered. &quot;Even billable resources go to
training, for instance. And we occasionally have a situation where a
resource decides that a piece of work took longer than it should, and
they list the time but don't consider it billable. We try to
minimize that sort of thing, but if it is in good faith, we allow
it.&quot;</p>

<p>He continued, &quot;The Mileage, Meals, and Lodging columns are for
employees to turn in expense items. Of course, for meals and lodging
they also have to turn in receipts. The last column, Description, is
important because it is the column that actually goes onto the invoice
for the customer.&quot;</p>

<p>Marilou interrupted again. &quot;What if someone has an expense that
isn't listed on the form&#8212;say, a book they purchase?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it depends,&quot; said Bill. &quot;If the expense is
billable back to the client as part of a project, the employee lists it
under one of the three expense columns and then explains what it really
is in the Description column. If the expense is not billable to a
client but is an internal expense, it doesn't go on the timesheet
at all. Instead, it's handled through an internal purchase-order
system.&quot; Marilou nodded that she understood, and Bill continued.
&quot;Once the employee finishes filling in the timesheet, it's
e-mailed to the central office. We have a Time alias set up in Exchange
so that timesheets can be e-mailed either through Outlook or via the
Internet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At which point it becomes Jane's problem,&quot; Dan said.
&quot;Alright, Bill, what are the issues with this system?&quot; Dan
moved to the whiteboard, picked up the marker, and turned back to the
group. &quot;And, since you are worn out from doing your timesheets,
I'll do the writing for you.&quot;</p>


<A NAME="235"><H3>The Issues</H3></A>

<p>&quot;My part of the process will probably win the prize for having
the most issues,&quot; said Bill. &quot;One of the largest issues is
the possibility of error because people enter their own time. The Word
table can't check the data as it is entered, so people often
miscalculate or misenter their hours, especially if their time is so
chopped up that the table runs to two or three pages. We also get wrong
project numbers or no project numbers all the time. If the project
number is wrong, the time gets billed to the wrong project. Sometimes
we catch it before it goes to the customer, but occasionally we
don't, and the customer gets billed incorrectly.</p>


<p>&quot;Another issue is the fact that the timesheet is static data.
In other words, there is nothing on the screen that changes as people
enter the data to give them feedback about what they have entered.
Sure, they can add it up manually, but often they are hurrying to get
their timesheet done and e-mailed before the deadline, and they just
don't take the time to check it thoroughly. As a result, they leave
out an entire day, or they enter something twice. If something updated
a total every time they completed a line, they would be more likely to get it
right the first time.</p>


<p>&quot;A third issue&#8212;Marta already mentioned this one&#8212;is
that people's timesheets are disconnected from their calendars.
Some people use their Outlook calendar, and others use various other
calendar programs and hand-held things. Whatever time-tracking method
they use, they have to open it up, read the data from it, and re-enter
the data into their timesheets. There's no quick-and-easy method
for dumping their calendar data into their timesheets, even as a
starting point that they could then edit.</p>


<p>&quot;Which leads to another issue,&quot; Bill said as Dan continued
to write. &quot;This may seem esoteric to some of you, but our current
system encourages duplication of data. One of the primary principles of data management is to store
data once and only once, and preferably in a central location that is
easily accessible to everyone who needs it. Currently we have time data stored in various
user devices and documents, which is then rekeyed into the timesheets,
which are then entered again somewhere else. We need to cut down on the
number of places this data is kept.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We hear you, and we agree,&quot; said Dan as he finished
noting the issue on the board. &quot;We may not solve this problem
completely, especially in the first RMS release, but we can certainly
put it up here as a target.&quot; He turned back to the board.
&quot;What else?&quot;</p>

<p>Bill looked at his notes and then at the group. &quot;All of the
above come together to make the system a pain to use.&quot; There were
nods of agreement around the table. &quot;So most of our employees do
their timesheets at the last minute because they hate the hassle. And
as a result of <i>that</i>, the timesheets are often late, which makes
the rest of the process late.&quot; He looked at Jim, the CFO.
&quot;I'm assuming that when the billing process runs late, it
causes some other issues that you would know about, right?&quot;</p>

<p>Jim nodded vigorously and started to say something, but Dan
interrupted him. &quot;Jim, would you mind dealing with those further
implications as part of item III on the agenda? I would rather give you
a block of time all together than piece it out as part of item II,
because I think what you have to say will be valuable and I don't
want to dilute its impact.&quot; Jim thought about that for a moment,
then said, &quot;I think that's a good plan, Dan. I'll make
some notes as we go along, and deal with them when we get to item
III.&quot;</p>


<A NAME="236"><H2>Recording Time</H2></A>

<p>Dan turned to Jane. &quot;Alright, Jane, we've scheduled the
resource, done the work, filled in the timesheet, and e-mailed it in.
What's next?&quot;</p>

<p>Jane opened the manila folder in front of her and pulled out copies
of a flowchart, which she passed to everyone around the table. &quot;I
thought it might be easier to follow this part of the process if I
charted it out for you.&quot; Murmurs of appreciation followed as the
team members looked at the chart.</p>

<p>&quot;As you can see, Accounting's part of the process begins in
the upper left, when the timesheets are received in the Time alias in
Exchange.&quot; She looked up at the group. &quot;Because of the volume
of timesheets, we have eight different clerks with access to that
alias. We rotate the task among them, because if we assigned it to
anyone full-time, he or she would quit.&quot; Looking back at the
chart, she continued. &quot;No matter who's doing the work, the
process is the same. We open each 
e-mail and save the attached timesheet in a directory named for the
employee. We use the date the e-mail was received as the name of the
file when we save it. Then we open the file and print it.</p>

<p>&quot;Once we have the paper copy, we enter the data into the time
and billing add-on for our accounting package. We then print a summary
of the time for the week, by team, and fax or hand-deliver the summary
to the appropriate manager for approval. The manager reviews each
employee's time totals and either approves or disapproves the time
for that employee. He or she then faxes or hand-delivers the signed
summary back to us, along with any notations of approval or
disapproval.&quot;</p>

<p>While Jane paused, Marta asked, &quot;How often is a timesheet not
approved?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;About 5 percent of the time,&quot; Jane answered.
&quot;Usually it's because people haven't entered all their
time, or they've miscalculated it in some way, and the manager
knows it.&quot; Marta nodded that she understood, and after waiting to
see if there were any other questions, Jane continued.</p>

<p>&quot;If a timesheet is disapproved, we e-mail it back to the
employee with a note about what the manager said, and we ask the
employee to redo the timesheet and resubmit it. We also delete the one
we saved so that two timesheets don't cover the same time period.
Then all the approved timesheets are posted into the time and billing
system.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let's stop there, Jane, and list the issues just for what
you've covered so far,&quot; said Dan, moving to the whiteboard.
&quot;What are the issues, as you see them, with the way we record the
timesheets currently?&quot;</p>


<A NAME="237"><H3>The Issues</H3></A>

<p>&quot;There are two big issues, but they are caused by a third
issue, so which one should I start with?&quot; asked Jane.</p>

<p>&quot;Let's do the primary one first, then we'll list the
problems it causes,&quot; replied Dan. &quot;What in your mind is the
'driver' issue?&quot;</p>

<p>Jane said emphatically, &quot;Just the fact that it's a large,
cumbersome, manual process. It has multiple steps, most of which
involve keying, printing, and keying again. There are too many hands
and too few computers in it for me.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan wrote <i>Manual Process</i> on the board. &quot;I think we can
all agree that anything manual associated with 800 timesheets has to be
both large and cumbersome.&quot; He drew an arrow downward from Manual
Process. &quot;So what are the two issues caused by this one?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The first is the number of errors we get in data entry. The
second is the amount of time this process takes each week.&quot;</p>

<p>As he wrote, Dan said over his shoulder, &quot;Elaborate for us,
please.&quot;</p>

<p>Warming to her subject, Jane responded, &quot;Some weeks we enter
over 10,000 line items into the time system. Even excellent data-entry
people, which we have, make mistakes when that much work is involved.
We catch most of them in the review process, but even so, some get out
to the customer. I've worked hard to get the mistake rate down, and
we've cut it substantially, but our eyes and fingers can only take
so much.</p>


<p>&quot;The other thing is the way this process eats up my resources!
I could get much more done, even with fewer people, if we didn't
have to deal with this monster each week. And it never stops. Every
Monday, you know as you walk through the door that you are going to
spend the entire day keying in time. I'm telling you, it's a
killer.&quot; Realizing she was getting too excited, she paused and
took a deep breath. Letting it out, she concluded, &quot;Anyway, those
are the three issues.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think there's a fourth,&quot; said Marta.</p>

<p>&quot;And a fifth,&quot; added Marilou.</p>

<p>&quot;OK you two, let's hear them,&quot; said Dan, turning back
to the board. &quot;Marta, you first.&quot;</p>

<p>Marta looked at Jane. &quot;Didn't you start out by saying that
you rotate the time-entry task among eight different resources, because
if you assigned anyone permanently to it they would quit?&quot; Jane
nodded. &quot;And didn't you also say that when people <i>are</i>
assigned to it, they dread it?&quot; Again, Jane nodded, and Marta
continued, &quot;Then I would say another issue with this part of the
process is the effect it has on employee morale and retention,
wouldn't you, Jane?&quot;</p>

<p>Jane thought about it a moment. &quot;You know, I hadn't
considered that as an issue, because I was mainly focusing on the
technical or data pieces of the problem. But come to think of it, the
biggest gift I could give my staff would be to take weekly time-entry
off their plates.&quot; She turned to Dan. &quot;Are we allowed to
consider quality-of-life issues like these, Dan?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Absolutely,&quot; Dan replied. &quot;Sometimes they are harder
to quantify, as we'll see when we look at return-on-investment
issues later on. But Marta's point is a good one. Making Ferguson
and Bardell a good place to work is important, especially when you
consider the cost of recruiting and training a new hire.&quot; He
turned to the board. &quot;Let's list it just as Marta said it:
'Employee morale and retention.'&quot; Looking at Marilou, he
asked, &quot;And what's your issue, Marilou?&quot;</p>

<p>Pointing to Bill, Marilou said, &quot;It's the same problem Bill
talked about in his section. We've got duplication of data again.
By my count, we've got time data in at least three locations: the
employee's machine where the timesheet is created, the central
directory where the sheet is stored, and the time and billing system
where it is entered.&quot; She looked at Bill. &quot;Kind of tough to
guarantee data integrity, not to mention concurrency, wouldn't you
say?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure would!&quot; Suddenly Bill realized he was agreeing with
the person he had called an Excel-clicker-turned-trainer in their last
meeting. He looked up at Dan, who had set him straight about
Marilou's technical background and who now had a slight smile on
his face. &quot;If it were up to you to redesign this monster, Marilou,
what would you do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Get a central data store to start with, that's for
sure,&quot; she said firmly. &quot;Try to cut down on the number of
places time data is kept and analyzed. We might not be able to get it
all the way to one, but we could get pretty close if we thought it
through carefully.&quot; Bill nodded his agreement.</p>

<p>&quot;That's the right direction, Marilou,&quot; Dan
interjected, &quot;but it's a topic for a later meeting. Hang onto
it, because we'll need it soon.&quot;</p>


<A NAME="238"><H2>Generating Invoices</H2></A>

<p>Dan turned back to Jane. &quot;There's more to your flowchart,
Jane. Tell us about this last section.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's actually fairly simple,&quot; said Jane, looking down
at the chart in front of her. &quot;As you can see, once the timesheets
are posted to the time and billing system, we run trial invoices and
print them. The trial invoices are then sent to both management and
sales for review. After both of them sign off on the invoice, the trial
invoices are posted to the main accounting system, which runs the
actual invoices.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are there any issues with this part of the process?&quot; Dan
stood at the board, marker ready.</p>


<A NAME="239"><H3>The Issue</H3></A>

<p>&quot;I've given it some thought, and the only issue I can come
up with is not so much an issue with this process as it is with the way
Ferguson and Bardell is structured.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And that is?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; Jane answered, &quot;some of our work is billed on
a project basis, and some of it is strictly hourly. The hourly work is
managed through this process. The project work is billed the same no
matter how much time we spend on it. When we go over the amount of time
allotted to a project, we lose money. But because of the way we track
time, we often don't know we are over until we do the
invoice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So the issue is that there is no way to track time by project
and compare the amount of time we actually spend with the amount of
time the bid allows for?&quot; asked Tim.</p>

<p>&quot;That's right,&quot; said Jane. &quot;It doesn't happen
often, because most of our sales people and managers work together to
make sure we have good estimates for our larger projects. Typically, it
happens on smaller jobs where the work is only going to last a few
weeks. By the time we catch it, the project is already over the
estimate and there's no room to make it up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alright,&quot; said Dan, &quot;let's put it on the issues
list, and perhaps as we move through the process, we can come up with a
good way to deal with the problem as part of the overall RMS
project.&quot; He moved away from the whiteboard and back to his place
at the table.</p>

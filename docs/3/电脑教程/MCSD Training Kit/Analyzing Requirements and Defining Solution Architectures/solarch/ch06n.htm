<A NAME="327"><H1>Physical Design</H1></A>

<p>Bill and the rest of the development team spent most of Tuesday
working through the Physical Design process, trying to get a working
document ready for the RMS team meeting on Wednesday. Dan was with them
at the beginning of the day but got called away by Jim Stewart at about
10:30.</p>

<p>After lunch, Dan stopped by the small conference room in the
development team area where Bill and the others were still working.
&quot;So, how's it coming?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pretty well, actually.&quot; Bill replied. &quot;We've got
two data stores defined&#8212;SQL Server and Exchange. We've worked
out their data elements and normalized as much as possible. Most of the
components are sketched out, along with their interface contracts.
We're working on packaging now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What about deployment strategies?&quot; asked Dan.</p>

<p>Sam looked up from his laptop. &quot;We've got some ideas, but
we want to test the prototypes a bit more before we commit to a final
deployment plan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have new prototypes?&quot;</p>

<p>Bill nodded. &quot;Yes. Sam and Beth stayed late last night to write
some quick-and-dirty proof-of-concept applications, and we're using
some of their work in our planning.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wow, I'm impressed,&quot; said Dan. &quot;Think you'll
have something for us tomorrow? How about a schedule?&quot;</p>

<p>Beth grinned. &quot;Oh, we'll have something, all right. <i>
What</i> we'll have is another question.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As for the schedule,&quot; Bill added, &quot;I've been
working on that with input from Sam and Beth, and I'm afraid
I've got some bad news, Dan. We just don't see how we can make
that tentative deadline we set in the Envisioning Phase.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even with the buffer time?&quot; asked Dan.</p>

<p>Bill nodded. &quot;Even with the buffer time, and even with some
pretty fancy footwork around parallel development paths. The two
clients, the two data stores, the integration with the accounting
package to do the invoice work&#8212;it's just too much to pull off
in that time. We'll need another month, at least.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan looked as if he'd been hit in the stomach. &quot;Just what I
needed to hear after my meeting this morning,&quot; he thought grimly.
He took a deep breath. &quot;Bill, I told you and the team we will
practice bottom-up scheduling. If you and your people say that the
current feature set will take an extra month, then I'll back you
up. We'll just have to tell the customer and the users that to get
the feature set they want, they'll have to wait. I just have one
question: Is the one month firm, or do you really need two?&quot;</p>

<p>The three developers looked at one another for a moment. Then Sam
said, &quot;It's firm, Dan. Our prototypes haven't turned up
any problems that are showstoppers. One month.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan nodded. &quot;I'll count on it.&quot; he said quietly and
walked away.</p>

<p>&quot;What's with him?&quot; said Sam to Bill. &quot;I've
never seen Dan look like that.&quot;</p>

<p>Bill gave a noncommittal grunt, but he, too, wondered what was
wrong. &quot;Guess we'll find out tomorrow morning,&quot; he
thought, and turned back to the calendar sheets in front of him.</p>

<p>The next morning found the RMS team in their usual chairs, waiting.
Dan's car was in the parking garage, and his office light was on,
but he was nowhere to be found. Finally, at 8:15, just as Tim was
dialing Dan's pager for the second time, the CIO came into the
conference room with notebooks in his hands and a frown on his face. He
put his notebooks down and then sat and stared at the others for a
moment.</p>

<p>When Tim said, in a cheerful, sing-songy voice, &quot;And good
morning to you, too, Dan!&quot; Dan looked at him blankly. Then he
shook his head. &quot;Sorry, folks. Guess I was still mentally in my
last meeting. I apologize.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We were beginning to get worried, Dan,&quot; said Jane.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Marta, &quot;we were worried you'd been
taking lessons from Tim!&quot; The others laughed as Tim stuck out his
tongue at her. She got up and moved to the credenza. &quot;Would you
like some coffee and a doughnut?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That would be great,&quot; said Dan as he opened his project
notebook and handed out materials to the others. &quot;I had a 7
o'clock this morning and didn't have time for breakfast.&quot;
Marta handed him some coffee, and he took a sip. &quot;Thanks,
Marta&#8212;that really hits the spot. Yes, that meeting not only kept
me from eating, it also made me late. We just couldn't come to any
agreement. In fact, they were still discussing things when I left. I
just said I had to be here, and walked out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing bad, I hope,&quot; said Marta as she put a couple of
doughnuts in front of Dan and sat down.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Marta, one thing I learned long ago is if you don't
have any problems, you're either out of business or dead. This
problem has already happened, unfortunately, so what we're really
trying to do is keep it from happening again.&quot; He took a bite of
doughnut, chewed thoughtfully for a moment, and continued talking to
the group between bites. &quot;There's a chance we may have to deal
with the problem in this group before all is said and done. But I think
that's down the road a ways.&quot; He brushed the sugar from his
hands. &quot;In the meantime, we have a project to complete, a design
to finalize, and an agenda for today. So let's get
started.&quot;</p>

<P><A HREF="javascript:fullSize('gcs6ar04x.htm')" onMouseOver="window.status='Click to view at full size';return true;" onMouseOut="window.status='';return true;"><IMG SRC="images/gcs6ar04.jpg" WIDTH=404 HEIGHT=511 BORDER=0 ALT="Click to view at full size"></A></P>


<p>Dan stood and moved down the table. &quot;Bill, the Development role
drives Physical Design, so why don't you come up here and
drive?&quot;</p>

<p>Bill came to the head of the table and handed out sets of documents
showing the various pieces of the proposed design. &quot;Our meeting
with the EA team on Monday afternoon was very fruitful. In the process
of working out some issues with scalability, we decided we needed both
a Web client&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes!&quot; interjected Marilou, pumping her fist.</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;<i>and</i> a Win32 client,&quot; finished Bill,
returning Marilou's look of triumph.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; exclaimed Jane, &quot;you're going to
build <i>both</i> clients? What in the world for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you'll turn to the second and third pages, which show
the overall process flow and the technologies used, I think it will
make sense,&quot; replied Bill. He waited as the rest of the team
traced through the drawings.</p>

<p>&quot;Wow, you're using Exchange as the primary data store for
the assigning of resources and the tracking of time,&quot; said Marilou
as she studied the documents. &quot;That'll make some of the
worker-bees unhappy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot; asked Jane.</p>

<p>&quot;Because, some of them don't keep their calendar in
Exchange. They use paper calendars, or stand-alone organizers, or
whatever works for them. They aren't going to want to
switch.&quot;</p>

<p>Tim spoke up. &quot;I guarantee you that my folks would gladly trade
their paper calendars, or Post-It notes, or their faulty memory, for an
automated tool that would cut their two-hour time sheets down to a few
minutes. And if they could do it from home over the Web, they'd
think they had died and gone to heaven.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And Jim Stewart would be ecstatic to think we might get some
value other than e-mail out of Exchange,&quot; said Jane. &quot;We sold
it to him as an enterprise-wide solutions base, but other than our room
reservation folder, we haven't produced much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, what we're saying is that we considered the tradeoffs
and decided that this particular technology made the best business <i>
and</i> technological sense,&quot; said Tim, leaning back in his chair
and smiling.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Tim,&quot; said Dan, &quot;I do believe you've caught
up on your reading!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Had some help&#8212;again,&quot; said Tim, putting his hands
behind his head.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, however you're getting it done, I'm glad
you're up with the rest of us. And you're right: This was one
of a number of tradeoffs the development team made in working through
Physical Design. Let's get back on focus and let Bill take us
through the rest of the design.&quot;</p>

<p>The group spent the next 20 minutes working through the design,
examining the various components and the objects and services they
contained. When Bill explained how using multi-layer design, along with
certain Microsoft technologies and design practices, would allow the
pooling of connections to the data stores, Marilou sat up. &quot;So <i>
that's</i> what Sam had in mind that day! That's a significant
boost to scalability, which is like giving us a gift of time before we
have to deal with growth issues.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Exactly,&quot; said Dan. &quot;In addition, because we're
building RMS this way, we can change pieces of it without disrupting
the whole thing. And we can use some of the components in other
applications as well, cutting our development time in the
future.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Speaking of time, Chief,&quot; said Tim, &quot;How does your
schedule look, now that you're writing two clients and hitting
multiple data stores? And didn't I see some Transaction Server
stuff in there as well? Even with all the people you've got
writing&#8212;I saw the names beside the components&#8212;I just
don't see any way you can be done by deadline.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The short answer is, we can't,&quot; said Bill, frowning.
&quot;I already told Dan. No matter which way I slice it, I can't
find a way to hit the delivery target we originally set. We're
going to have to have an extra month.&quot;</p>

<p><i>&quot;You can't have it!&quot;</i> boomed a voice from the
hall, and in strode Jim Stewart.</p>

<p>&quot;Jim, what a surprise,&quot; said Dan, without rising from his
chair. The edge in his voice, even though he spoke evenly and without
shouting, was palpable, and everyone except Jim noticed it. Ignoring
Dan, he turned to Bill. &quot;I'm telling you, Bill, there is no
way we can wait an extra month for the RMS application. You and your
guys have got to deliver it on time, if not early!&quot; The CFO was
growing more and more agitated as he leaned over the table in
Bill's direction. He banged his fist on the table and almost
shouted, &quot;And if you can't deliver on time, I'll find
someone who can!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Enough!&quot; interrupted Dan sharply. He moved back to the
head of the table. &quot;First of all, sir, this is my meeting, and you
don't come busting in here without asking. Secondly, Bill works for
me, not you, and it's not your place to threaten any of my
employees with termination. And finally, I don't work <i>for</i>
you, but <i>with</i> you. If you don't understand what I'm
saying, then you and I have our own issues to work out in private, not
in front of the employees. Do I make myself clear?&quot;</p>

<p>The room was suddenly very quiet. After a long moment, Jim passed
his hand across his face and slumped against the credenza. &quot;Dan,
I'm sorry,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Tim stood up. &quot;Here, Mr. Stewart, take my chair.&quot; As Jim
sat down, Tim got him some water. Jim sighed and said again,
&quot;I'm sorry, Dan. I guess I just lost it.&quot; He took a
drink, then continued, &quot;I was coming down to see if you were done.
The executive committee finished its meeting, and I wanted to tell you
how it came out. But when Bill mentioned needing another month for RMS,
something just snapped.&quot; He sighed again. Turning to Bill, he
said, &quot;It looks like all I do is say ugly things to you, and then
have to apologize. If I keep this up, you'll need tracking software
to keep up with it all. Sorry, Bill.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As long as the software reports an equal number of insults and
apologies, I guess we'll be okay,&quot; said Bill gruffly. He put
out his hand, and Jim took it.</p>

<p>Leaning on the credenza with his arms folded, Dan said, &quot;Well,
Jim, I'd say our agenda is pretty well shot. So why don't you
take a moment to calm down and then tell the team why the RMS project
is suddenly so important to you that a slippage of a month sends you
into conniptions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Conniptions'&#8212;I like that. Perfectly describes what I
just did.&quot; He sighed again and then asked, &quot;How many of you
know what happened this past Friday in the sales department?&quot;</p>

<p>Marilou and Jane looked at each other, and Jane said, &quot;A few of
us heard something about it, but we don't know many of the details.
Wasn't it something about losing a potential project?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, but it was what we lost and how we lost it that caused
such a stir,&quot; said Jim. He got up and started pacing.</p>

<p>&quot;Here's the scoop. One of our sales guys has been working
for six months on a big construction project, right down the street
from here. We were up for architecture, engineering, project
management&#8212;the whole cahuna.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if you've ever been in sales, you know how these
things go. Our guy put the proposal and bid together two months ago and
then didn't hear anything for a month. He got some hints that we
were in the finals, but these folks weren't going to do any further
interviews, or rebidding, or anything. So, our guy was pretty much in
the dark. Until Friday, that is.</p>

<p>&quot;When he got in to the office on Friday morning, there was a
voice mail waiting from the CEO of the firm doing the project. We had
the project <i>if</i> we could begin work a week from Monday. Seems
they had some sort of financing that was about to fall through, and
they had to show progress by that date. To make matters worse, we had
to accept it <i>in writing</i> by 3 PM on Friday. <i>And</i> we had to
guarantee that we could put a full project team on the project on that
Monday, no later. <i>And</i> there were substantial performance
penalties if we didn't have the team in place.&quot;</p>

<p>Jim stopped pacing, put his hands on the back of the chair, and
faced the group. &quot;Well, the sales guy was frantic. He only had
about five hours to pull together his response, and he had to be
absolutely sure we could perform. He went to the head of each division,
trying to line up resources. People started scrambling&#8212;after all,
everyone likes business, and this was both high-profile and big. But in
the end, we couldn't do it. We had enough architects and almost
enough engineers. But we didn't have enough project managers with
the experience to pull this off, and we were short on civil engineers.
We hated to do it, but when 2:30 came and it looked like we
couldn't do it, the sales guy sent them a formal refusal by
messenger, and we all said what a shame it was.&quot;</p>

<p>Everyone had been following Jim's story with rapt attention, but
Bill was confused. &quot;So we lost some business because we didn't
have the resources! What's the big deal? It's happened before,
and it'll happen again. And anyway, they were nuts to think we
could jump that high on such short notice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, Bill, there's more,&quot; Dan said quietly.
&quot;The story's not over, not by a long shot.&quot;</p>

<p>Jim nodded. &quot;Isn't that the truth!&quot; He sat down and
continued. &quot;You're right, Bill; we've lost work before
when we didn't have the resources. What made this such a disaster
is&#8230;&quot; he paused a beat &quot;&#8230;we actually <i>did</i> have
the resources. We just didn't know it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whoa, I hate it when that happens,&quot; said Tim,
grimacing.</p>

<p>&quot;Turns out,&quot; said Jim, &quot;we had two project managers
coming off other projects, but there was no record of that anywhere in
the office. Their original project schedules showed they were going to
be on those projects at least another month, but there had been some
problems with supplies on one project and the other had finished early.
They had sent e-mails to the head of the PM department, telling him
they would be back in town this week, but he was out sick and
didn't see their messages. The only way we track our projects
managers is on the chart on his wall, and he wasn't there to update
it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the civil engineers?&quot; asked Marta.</p>

<p>&quot;Turns out that the spreadsheet your boss uses only shows each
resource's latest degree. Five of our electrical engineers have
Master's degrees in EE, but their Bachelor's degree was in
civil engineering. Two of them had actually done civil engineering work
for a number of years before going back for their Master's. But
nothing we use now was capable of telling us that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And when did we discover we could have done the work,
Jim?&quot; Dan prompted, still leaning against the credenza with his
arms crossed.</p>

<p>Jim sighed. &quot;The secretary called the head of PM at home around
2 in the afternoon. After she called, he decided to check his e-mail
and found the messages from his two managers. He called back in about
2:45.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the hidden civil folks?&quot; asked Marta again.</p>

<p>&quot;One of them walked by while we were moaning about the fact
that we didn't have enough CEs. He told us about his own background
and mentioned two of the others. Then one of them told us of the
others. By then it was about 4:45. That's when it really hit the
fan.&quot; Jim shook his head, apparently still amazed at the mess.</p>

<p>&quot;Just how big was this contract that we lost because we have no
idea what's going on in our own company?&quot; Jane asked
quietly.</p>

<p>Jim looked down at the table. &quot;Four point two million.&quot;
His voice was barely audible.</p>

<p>Tim whistled, &quot;Whew! We could buy a whole roomful of new
servers with that!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's still not all of it,&quot; said Dan grimly.
&quot;Go ahead and tell them the rest, Jim. Tell them about this past
weekend. It's OK.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You'll all hear about it in a day or two, anyway, so I
guess there's no harm in telling you now.&quot; He paused and then
continued. &quot;When word got upstairs about losing a contract of that
size and prestige, things started popping around here, and I do mean
popping. The executive management committee met over the weekend, as
well as Monday morning and this morning. They weren't pleasant
meetings, let me assure you.</p>

<p>&quot;The bottom line is that the COO is 'leaving to pursue other
interests' at the end of this month. Apparently this screw-up was
the last straw. Jo Brown is going to take his place, but not until she
wraps up some other work. In the meantime, I've been made interim
COO as well as CFO. Those are the major changes in people, but there
are other shakeups coming as well, including the guy over in project
management. The management committee&#8212;which includes Dan&#8212;has
no more than two weeks to turn in the first draft of a completely
documented procedure manual for their departments. We tried telling the
CEO that he couldn't just dictate a deadline for a project like
that, but he was in no mood to listen to arguments about bottom-up
scheduling.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And after you left this morning, Dan, the discussion turned to
RMS. There's some confusion about who is in charge of it, and since
you are still the fair-haired child, you got away without catching any
of it. But the last thing the Old Man said to me was, 'Stewart,
we've got to get that RMS thing up and working, so we don't
ever lose a contract like this again. I'm holding you personally
responsible for getting it done. And if you can't do it, I'll
find somebody who can!'&quot;</p>

<p>The team members winced at the harsh words. The CEO's temper was
legendary. &quot;So when you heard me delaying the project, it just
took you over the edge, right?&quot; Bill said quietly.</p>

<p>Jim nodded, without looking at either Bill or Dan. &quot;It's
really unfortunate, because I actually trust both of
you&#8212;<i>all</i> of you&#8212;more than I've ever trusted any
tech folks. But I just don't know what I'm going to do. If we
don't get RMS built and put in place on schedule, I know someone
else who's going to be 'pursuing other interests.'&quot;</p>

<p>Dan walked purposefully to the whiteboard and drew a triangle. He
wrote the words <i>Features</i>, <i>Resources</i>, and <i>Schedule</i>
on the three sides of the figure. Then he turned back to the group.
&quot;Jim, do you remember this?&quot;</p>

<p>Jim looked up and smiled wanly. &quot;Absolutely&#8212;the Golden
Triangle. One of the best concepts I've ever learned, even if it
was from a techie.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not just for the beginning of a project, Jim.
It's for use anytime something changes.&quot; Dan drew a big minus
sign beside the <i>schedule</i> side of the triangle. &quot;To write
the application we originally planned, our development team tells us it
is going to take a month longer. You're saying we don't have
that month. So our schedule is less than it needs to be. To bring the
Golden Triangle back into balance, we've got to change something.
Either we have to drop features, or add resources, or change the
design, or adjust the schedule somewhere else.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan moved back to his spot at the credenza. &quot;I like the design
we have, and I'd rather not change it. So we can either drop
features or add resources. And keep in mind the mythical man-month.
Adding resources, especially to a project as short and as small as RMS,
may not produce what you want.</p>

<p>&quot;You are the customer. Ultimately, it's up to you to
determine the best way to rebalance the Golden Triangle. We can make
suggestions, but you have to decide. So what's it going to
be?&quot;</p>

<p>All eyes turned to Jim as he stared at the table. Finally, without
moving or looking up, he said, &quot;Drop the accounting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; exclaimed Jane. &quot;That was one of the main
features of RMS! We can't drop the accounting interface! How do you
expect us to generate invoices?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The same way you do now,&quot; said Jim with an edge creeping
back into his voice. He stopped, took a deep breath, turned to Jane,
and continued. &quot;Jane, the accounting interface and features are
important to you and your people, but look at the big picture. We still
save the time-sheet data entry. We still get the resources database,
and the resource tracking, and the automated time-sheet generation. And
we get it all in place within the original deadline. That's the
right business decision for Ferguson and Bardell, and as the customer
for RMS as well as the acting COO, that's the decision I'm
making. Whatever heat comes from it, I'll just take.&quot; He
turned to Dan. &quot;Didn't we talk earlier about doing a Version
2? Can't we make the accounting interface that version's top
priority?&quot;</p>

<p>Dan nodded. &quot;Our plan is to begin work on Version 2 as soon as
we finish this version.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then that's what we should do,&quot; said Jim, getting up
and crossing the room to shake Dan's hand. &quot;Thanks for your
help and your insights. Sorry to meet and run, but I've got some
other fires to put out, and this one looks pretty well under
control.&quot; He turned to the rest of the team. &quot;I believe we
have a major milestone scheduled for Friday morning. I'm looking
forward to it. Good luck!&quot; And he was gone.</p>

<p>&quot;Wow, I sure wouldn't want to be in his shoes,&quot; Tim
said.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I believe his moccasins have some hard paths to walk in
the next few months.&quot; Dan moved back to the head of the table.
&quot;It's our job to do all we can to get RMS delivered on time
and not be a rock inside those moccasins.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan looked over his agenda. &quot;Tell you what&#8212;I want to
adjust this. I had wanted to develop draft versions of our other
deliverables today, but we're now significantly behind schedule for
this meeting, so let's can some of it. Here's what we're
going to do. We're going to go over the parts of the Functional
Spec. Then I'll assign different parts to different people. As you
complete your section, 
e-mail it to the rest of us for comment. I'll put the sections
together for a final document that we can approve on Friday.</p>

<p>&quot;Bill, I know your development plan and schedule is toast after
these changes, and the rest of us rely on that as a basis for our own
work. So there's no reason to work on the Master Project Plan or
the Master Project Schedule until you have a chance to make your
changes. I want you to adjust your plan and schedule as quickly as
possible and e-mail them to the rest of us. Then we can adjust our own
documents, and everyone will submit their final versions to me for
compilation. Does that make sense to everyone?&quot;</p>

<p>Everyone nodded, and Bill said, &quot;Subtracting is easier than
adding. I should be able to have the revised documents to everyone by
this afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Excellent,&quot; said Dan. He started making notes as he
spoke. &quot;Let's assign the Functional Spec sections. Jane, I
want you to take the vision summary and design goals. Marilou,
you've got the requirements and the usage summary. Bill, you and
Tim work together on features and dependencies. I'll do the
schedule summary, and Marta, you make a first cut at risks. We'll
use your work to jump-start our work on Friday on the Master Risk
Assessment Document.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So on Friday we'll go over the three design models, the
Functional Spec, the Project Plan, and the Project Schedule, and make
any changes we need to. Then we'll go through the Master Risk
Assessment Document together, using Marta's work as a guide.
Finally, Jim will join us and we'll work through the milestone
questions, just like last time. Any questions?&quot;</p>

<p>Everyone seemed anxious to get started, so Dan concluded the meeting
by saying, &quot;Remember, everyone, I need your documents as soon as
possible so that I can compile them and get them back to you by
tomorrow afternoon. Let me know if you have anything else pending that
I can move to someone else. I need you to be free to concentrate on
this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How 'bout my laundry?&quot; asked Tim as the others
laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;That's why we gave you a laptop, Tim,&quot; said Dan with
a grin. &quot;Take it and your clothes to the laundromat and do some
multi-tasking. Who knows? Maybe watching your stuff spin-dry will
remind you of the Process Model.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nah, when I do laundry, it's more like a living example of
risk management,&quot; said Tim, grabbing another doughnut as he
prepared to leave.</p>

<p>&quot;You keep eating those doughnuts,&quot; said Marta over her
shoulder as she walked out, &quot;and you won't need to worry about
laundry for a while, because you'll have to buy a whole new
wardrobe!&quot;</p>

<p>Tim just grinned as he followed her out the door.</p>

<A NAME="242"><H1>Case Study 4 -- Determining Goals</H1></A>

<p>&quot;Wow, look at this place!&quot;</p>

<p>Tim O'Brien turned completely around as he came through the door
of the Oak Room, where Ferguson and Bardell held its board meetings.
His eyes wide, he said, &quot;Look at that picture on the wall.
It's bigger than my desk!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Talk about a big desk&#8212;take a look at that conference
table,&quot; said Jane Clayton as she followed Tim into the room.</p>

<p>The rest of the RMS project team entered the room, with all but Dan
Shelly and Bill Pardi doing their fair share of rubbernecking. Dan had
already been working in the room for two days, getting things ready for
the Monday morning team meeting. Bill had helped install the networking
and communications equipment when the Oak Room was remodeled a few
years earlier, so he was neither surprised nor intimidated by it.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, people, it's just a big board room. Let's
move to this end of the conference table and get started.&quot; Dan was
already beginning to feel the pressure of the project timeline, and he
was anxious to get started. Over the weekend, he had laid out the
project calendar, and its time limit had come into sharp focus. As the
team moved to join him, he wondered if he had bitten off more than he
and the team could chew.</p>

<p>&quot;Where do you want us, Dan?&quot; asked Marilou Moris, moving
toward a chair beside Jane.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, do you have a seating plan or preference?&quot; added
Marta Wolfe-Hellene, debating whether to sit next to Bill, who seemed
not to like her, or by Marilou, who usually talked only to Jane.</p>

<p>&quot;I do have a seating plan, but it's only for one of you,
and we'll get to that later. For now, just grab a spot near this
end.&quot; He sat at the head of the table and motioned for the others
to take a seat. Jane noticed all the diagrams on the walls and the
easels with flip-charts spread around the room. She turned to Dan and
said, &quot;Boy, you've been busy as a beaver this weekend!&quot;
She waved a hand at the room and said, &quot;What's all this
about?&quot;</p>

<p>Dan finished laying out some papers on the table in front of him
before addressing the others. &quot;Alright, folks. I'll explain.
Last week, after our meeting, I went to Mike Adamley, our Chief
Operations Officer, and explained to him what we are trying to do. I
told him we needed a big space to work in. In short, that we needed a
&quot;war room.&quot; He gave us permission to use this room. It'll
be our home for the next two months.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We get to use the Oak Room for two months? Wow, we must be
important!&quot; said Tim, leaning back dangerously far in his chair, a
smug smile on his face.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't get a big head, Big Head,&quot; said Jane as she
pretended to push his chair over. &quot;<i>We're</i> not important;
it's the <i>work</i> that's important.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's exactly right, Jane,&quot; said Dan. He flipped on
the overhead projector and laid a transparency on it. &quot;And
it's time to get that important work moving. So, if everybody will
turn to the agenda I sent you over the weekend, we'll get
started.&quot; Sensing the edge in Dan's voice, the team quickly
quieted down and opened their binders.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; Dan continued, &quot;the first item on the agenda,
as always, is Agenda Building. Does anyone have any changes they'd
like to suggest?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've got one,&quot; said Tim. Everyone looked at him with
surprise. Tim admired Dan so much that it was unusual for him to
question or add to anything Dan did. Even Dan seemed surprised.
&quot;Alright, Tim, that's what this is for. What do you want to
change?&quot;</p>

<p>Tim suddenly looked a little sheepish. &quot;Well, some of you know
that I'm usually on the run to make these meetings on time.&quot;
There were grins of acknowledgement from the other team members.
&quot;I know we have coffee and juice when we meet, but I was hoping we
could have something more substantial.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Like, breakfast?&quot; said Jane, laughing. &quot;What do you
want us to do, cater in a brunch for you?&quot;</p>

<p>Tim blushed and said, &quot;No, not like that. I'd just like
something to nibble on. I was thinking of something like&#8212;well,
doughnuts.&quot;</p>

<p>This brought hoots from the rest of the team. Tim's fondness for
pastries was well known. Dan said, &quot;And who, pray tell, do you
think should provide these delicacies?&quot;</p>

<p>Tim said, &quot;Well, I thought we should take turns.&quot; Then,
reaching into his backpack, he brought out a box full of doughnuts.
&quot;And I decided to take first turn.&quot; To his team members'
delight, he placed the box on the table, and asked Dan, &quot;Can I
have one now?&quot;</p>

<P><A HREF="javascript:fullSize('gcs4ar01x.htm')" onMouseOver="window.status='Click to view at full size';return true;" onMouseOut="window.status='';return true;"><IMG SRC="images/gcs4ar01.jpg" WIDTH=404 HEIGHT=511 BORDER=0 ALT="Click to view at full size"></A></P>


<p>Dan just laughed and said, &quot;Tim, I can always count on you to
help me remember what is really important in this work.&quot; The edge
was gone from his voice. &quot;Alright, everyone grab a napkin off the
credenza and get your doughnut.&quot;</p>

<p>Once the team had settled back down, happily munching on Tim's
doughnuts, Dan said, &quot;Normally, agenda changes have to be voted
on, but I think Tim's addition is approved by acclamation. Good
idea, Tim. We'll add munchies to the meetings from now on. Alright,
let's move on.&quot;</p>

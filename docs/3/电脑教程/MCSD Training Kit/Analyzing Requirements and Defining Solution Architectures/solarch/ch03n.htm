<p>The next transparency, titled Team Goals for Success, had six
bullets. &quot;I want us to shoot for these six goals for project
success,&quot; said Dan. &quot;See what you think of them.&quot; He
read the goals out loud. &quot;Satisfied customers. Delivery within
constraints. Delivery to specifications based on user requirements.
Only release the software after addressing all known issues. Enhanced
user performance. And finally, smooth deployment and ongoing
management.&quot; He turned to the group. &quot;The contention of MSF
is that no project can be called a success unless <i>all six</i> of
these goals are met. My question for all of you is, are these valid
goals?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure, they're great goals, Dan, but I've never seen
any project come close to meeting all six of them!&quot; Jane
exclaimed. &quot;Aren't these just a little too
optimistic?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not only that, but some of them seem contradictory,&quot; Tim
added. &quot;How do you satisfy your customers, deliver within
constraints, and deliver to specifications that you got from the users?
It's not possible to do all of those on the same project, is
it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's the beauty of the framework,&quot; Dan answered,
taking a step out from behind the projector. &quot;I've <i>seen</i>
this work. I've seen a project team use MSF on a large project and
succeed because of it. At my last firm, we put in a client tracking
system and used the MSF approach to do it. If you asked anyone
associated with that project, they would tell you that all six goals
were achieved. I'm telling you, it <i>can</i> be done. And
here's how we're going to do it.&quot; He switched to a
transparency that displayed six ovals arranged in a circle.</p>

<p>Dan turned to the group. &quot;This model represents the six roles
on an MSF project team. Each of you is here to fill one of these roles.
Before I tell you what the roles are and which role is assigned to each
of you, I want to point out something about this diagram.</p>

<p>&quot;There are two types of project teams. The kind you are
probably familiar with is the <i>hierarchical</i> type, where one
person is the Project Manager and everyone else reports to him or her.
The problem with that is that the only person on the team who is
ultimately responsible, and who therefore is highly motivated to make
the project a success, is the Project Manager.</p>

<p>&quot;The model we are going to use is represented by these ovals.
You'll notice that all of them are the same size and that they are
all related to each other in the same way. In other words, they are
equals. This is a <i>team of peers</i>. Each person on this team is
equally important, and each is equally responsible for the success or
failure of the project. You'll also notice that each oval is a
different color. Each person on the team has a role and a
responsibility. As we move through the project, responsibilities will
become clearer, but for now, just understand that each one of you has a
role on the team that only <i>you</i> can fulfill. Now, let's look
at the roles.&quot;</p>

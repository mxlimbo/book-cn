<A NAME="595"><H1>Development Process</H1></A>

<p>Within the MSF Development Process, the true significance of the
Developing Phase is the project team and stakeholders' agreement
that the planned feature set as implemented meets all expectations.
Additionally, stakeholders and project team members must agree that all
features included in the product have been completed, and that the
product as a whole has been developed appropriately.</p>

<A NAME="596"><H2>Who Does What During Development?</H2></A>

<p>During the Developing Phase, all team members should focus on their
particular roles as well as continue to identify and manage risks. Each
role has primary responsibilities that combine to provide the necessary
project coverage to successfully complete the Developing Phase. These
responsibilities are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Product Management</b> Product managers are responsible for
managing customer expectations. They also continue plans for channeling
product information to customers and external stakeholders. Product
managers also prepare customers for alpha and beta releases.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Program Management</b> Program managers facilitate
communication between all the project teams, and coordinate the interim
milestone releases across the entire team. Program managers are also
responsible for several of the phases' deliverables, such as
revisions of the Functional Specification, Master Project Plan, Master
Project Schedule, and Master Risk Assessment Document.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Development</b> Developers create all code necessary to
implement all product features. They also provide initial functional
testing of code and features. The Development team is responsible for
creating the baselined code for the interim alpha and beta releases as
well as the baselined scope complete product release.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>User Education</b> The User Education team conducts initial
product usability testing and begins user performance testing. This
team coordinates the user community for alpha and beta product
releases. User Education team members additionally create initial user
performance materials to support the product, such as help wizards,
online training materials, and formal user training courses. The User
Education team is ultimately responsible for the Developing Phase's
baselined user and support documentation deliverables.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Testing</b> Testers create detailed test specifications, plans,
cases, data, and scripts to conduct initial functional testing. These
testing elements are executed during the Developing Phase to validate
the interim internal, alpha, and beta releases. Testing's primary
role is identifying and tracking bugs as the team moves toward the
scope complete product release. The Testing team is also responsible
for documenting the product testing process, from start to finish.</li></p>

<p><li> <b>Logistics Management</b> Logistics managers provide internal
team operations support. They also create operations support materials
and documentation, as well as deploy and support initial product alpha
and beta releases.</li></p>
</ul>



<p>Several general steps should take place throughout the Developing
Phase. As mentioned with the Envisioning Phase steps, these steps are
not intended as 
imperatives, but merely guidelines. The step names are for
simplification only, and can be modified for a team's specific
project.</p>

<A NAME="597"><H2>Step #1: Analysis and Rationalization</H2></A>

<p>At this point in the development process, the team should have
identified a solid plan of action with few variables. Thus, the
Developing Phase should not necessitate a significant amount of
additional research; the phase should primarily begin with the analysis
of the current application design.</p>

<p>Within the Development team, the design and project schedule should
be analyzed to identify specific resources to be applied to the coding
process. By looking at feature buckets, performed as part of the
Planning Phase's design process, the Development team can identify
coding teams responsible for particular product features. In
determining the coding teams, the Development team can also consider
the packaging of the application into service layers (also part of the
design process). Coding teams can be created based on differing skills
required by languages and tools to implement specific code within the
user, business, and data access service layers.</p>

<p>The Testing team should examine the product design to determine who
will conduct the types of tests, and further review the use cases to
verify that the proper usability testing will occur. The Testing team
should have identified an exhaustive set of test scenarios based on use
cases, physical design, and non-functional requirements, such as
application and user performance metrics during the planning phase, and
now must determine how to execute these test scenarios.</p>

<p>Finally, as discussed later in this chapter, the project team will
release multiple versions of the product during the Developing Phase.
With each release, feedback from users, as well as the Testing and
Logistics Management teams, must be analyzed to determine the current
product release's successes and failures. Any issues and bugs
existing in the product should be pinpointed for causes and product
locations, and then be resolved appropriately.</p>

<A NAME="598"><H2>Step #2: Implementation</H2></A>

<p>The next step in the Developing Phase is for the source code
development 
team to implement the application design. However, there are other
artifacts (or documents) that must be delivered at the Scope Complete
Milestone. The User Education team must create user- and
application-support artifacts, which must exist to ensure a successful
product release. Although many teams focus solely on traditional user
and installation documents, the User Education team can focus on online
help and tutorials as well as program wizards to improve user and
support experiences.</p>

<A NAME="599"><H2>Step #3: Validation</H2></A>

<p>Validation is a full team effort; however, throughout the Developing
Phase validation is particularly the responsibility of the Development
and Testing teams. The ongoing usability testing, performance
validation, bug tracking, and zero-defect quality mindset all drive the
validation step.</p>

<p>Because multiple product releases occur throughout the Developing
Phase, there are many instances in which at least a portion of the team
will focus on validating the current deliverables. For efficiency in
validating the application code, the Development and Testing teams
should automate as much of the testing process as possible.</p>

<A NAME="679"><H1>Organizing a Project Review Team</H1></A>

<p>Program Management may choose to organize a project review team when
planning a review for larger projects. The team approach works
especially well when several project teams are involved in a large
project.</p>

<p>Program Management may use a variety of tactics in organizing a
project review team. For instance, functional discipline groups can be
created: one for development, one for testing, one for user education,
and one for program management. Another example of a project review
team is a multifunctional group comprised of members from each
functional discipline, based on the particular development process
phases.</p>

<A NAME="680"><H3>Project Review Preparation</H3></A>

<p>Upon its organization, a project review team should meet separately,
prior to the actual review meetings. The product team leads and
managers should also attend this preliminary review team meeting to
determine the project review schedule and goals. During this
preliminary meeting, the attendees should identify all groups and
individuals needed for the actual project review.</p>

<A NAME="681"><H3>Gathering Information</H3></A>

<p>In gathering information for a project review team, the entire
project team responds by e-mail with comments about the project's
strengths and weaknesses, and also with improvement suggestions for the
next milestone or release. The project review team should concurrently
interview team members in preparation for one or more project review
meetings.</p>

<A NAME="682"><H3>Analyzing</H3></A>

<p>The project review team should ensure that all pertinent information
generated before and during the project review is gathered and
analyzed.</p>

<A NAME="683"><H3>Developing Recommendations</H3></A>

<p>To develop recommendations, the project review team should
prioritize each action item and issue identified as a strength or
weakness based upon its effectiveness at reaching the project
team's goals. Such resulting recommendations should focus only on
high-priority items and issues.</p>

<p>Problems, items, and issues that pose project weaknesses should be
studied carefully. If best practices exist to address such weaknesses,
the project review team should list these best practices as recommended
solutions. For problems with no known best-practice solution, the
project review team should determine alternatives for solving the
problems.</p>

<A NAME="684"><H3>Presenting and Reviewing Recommendations</H3></A>

<p>As a final step in the preliminary review process, the project
review team should present a summary of all findings and
recommendations to the management and project teams. All additions,
revisions, and corrections should be recorded for inclusion in the
project's final report. The project team as a whole should select
the recommendation or recommendations to be accepted to implement in
the development process for the next milestone or release.</p>

          <td>　　新加坡实行引进外来人才的政策可说是一种&quot;双赢&quot;策略，而不是一场&quot;零和&quot;游戏。外来人才固然可得益于新加坡良好的制度和环境而有更好的发展前景，新加坡本身也因外来人才的到来而获益匪浅。事实上，政府制定吸引外来人才的政策正是基于新加坡自身利益的考虑。
            <p>　　我们可以把新加坡的整体利益比作一块大饼。外来人才的到来，增加了新加坡的整体竞争力，提高了整体新加坡人的福利，使得利益的大饼变得更大，从而每个新加坡人都能分到比原来更多的分量。抵制外来人才的结果却使整体利益的大饼变小，虽然分的人少了，每个人能分到的分量却比原来的小了。</p>
            <p>　　有的人担忧外来人才的到来会剥夺本地人的就业机会，增加竞争压力。事实上，整体竞争力的提高会为新加坡带来更多的就业机会，最终获利的还是新加坡人。另外，如果这些人才不到新加坡来，本地人就没有竞争了吗？实际上，那将使这些人才从外部来和新加坡竞争。</p>
            <p>　　正如李光耀资政1989年就指出，受过训练和有才华的专才是各国争取的目标。现在各国都提倡发展知识经济，人才的争夺更趋激烈。新加坡一定要有广纳天下贤才的气度，才能掌握足够的人才资源，在激烈的竞争中立于不败之地。</p>
            <p>　　人才的引进还具有积极的外部效果。当引进外国的研究人员和学者时，他们的研究成果和知识就在当地传播。当引进中国的运动员的时候，他们不仅为新加坡夺得了几面金牌，从长远看，他们将会起交流和带动的作用，提高本地人的运动水平。君不见意大利的足球甲级联赛有多少外籍球员上阵，而意大利的足球水平同时也是世界最高的。</p>
            <p>　　实际上，新加坡原本就是由世界各地的移民组成的社会。它的发展根本就离不开许许多多外来人才的贡献。你能想象一个没有外来人才的新加坡吗？新加坡应该学习唐代中国长安的气度，开阔自己的胸襟，吸引、容纳天下各类人才来这里发展。新加坡人应该培养对待外来人才的成熟心态 
              ――你好，我也好。我们也看到许多有志的新加坡人不怕输，勇于在平等的条件下和外来的人才展开竞争，共同交流进步。</p>
            <p>　　要大的饼还是要小的饼？理智的新加坡人一定会作出正确的选择。 <br>

              　　<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A bigger cake, or a 
              smaller one?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">　　By recruiting foreign 
              talent, Singapore is pursuing a policy that is likely to lead to 
              a &quot;win-win&quot; situation, and not a &quot;zero-sum&quot; 
              outcome. While professionals and skilled workers from other lands 
              benefit from the city-state's sound institutions and environment 
              which can help them fulfil their aspirations, the host country can 
              also substantially benefit from the arrival of these talented people. 
              In fact, the government's policy has been formulated in the interest 
              of the country.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">　　The overall interests 
              of Singapore can be likened to a big cake. The foreign talent help 
              to make the cake even bigger by enhancing the city-state's competitiveness 
              and increasing the well-being of all the people. Therefore, each 
              Singaporean can have a slice of the cake which is larger than it 
              would have been.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">　　On the other hand, 
              if these foreigners are prevented from coming to Singapore, then 
              the size of the cake which is supposed to bring benefits to everyone 
              will shrink. Although it will then be shared by fewer people, each 
              slice will be smaller.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">　　There are worries 
              that the newcomers will rob the locals of their jobs and make the 
              competition tougher. In reality, the new arrivals will bring more 
              jobs to the country by raising its general competitiveness. In the 
              final analysis, it is Singaporeans who will stand to benefit. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">　　Besides, would the 
              locals be sheltered from competition if these foreigners did not 
              come to Singapore? No. They would still face the contention from 
              the same competitors, only that the competition will be coming from 
              outside the country.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">　　As pointed out by 
              Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew as early as 1989, well-trained and 
              talented people are sought after by all countries. As every country 
              is striving for a knowledge-based economy, the rivalry to win over 
              people with expertise and skills has been intensifying. To stay 
              on top of the increasingly keen competition, Singaporeans must be 
              broad-minded enough to accept talent from all lands so as to possess 
              sufficient human resources it needs. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">　　Moreover, foreign 
              personnel will help upgrade their local counterparts. Researchers 
              and scholars recruited from abroad will share the fruits of their 
              learning and intellectual pursuits with others in the host country. 
              Athletes recruited from China have not only won gold medals on behalf 
              of Singapore but will, in the long run, also help raise the standard 
              of sports among Singaporeans. Just look at the Italian soccer team 
              playing in the league matches. Many foreign footballers are playing 
              for Italy while the country's performance in soccer ranks among 
              the best in the world.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">　　In fact, being a society 
              of immigrants, the growth of Singapore has been inseparable from 
              the contributions of numerous talented people from abroad. Can anybody 
              imagine how Singapore would develop without the participation of 
              talented foreigners?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">　　The city-state should 
              be as open as Chang'an, the capital of China in the Tang Dynasty 
              (A.D. 618-907) when the land attracted and accommodated various 
              competent people from all corners of the world. Singaporeans should 
              be more mature in their attitude towards foreign talent, for only 
              in this way can there be mutual benefit for both parties. Fortunately, 
              many Singaporeans are not &quot;kiasu&quot;; they are full of confidence 
              and are fully prepared to compete with the new arrivals on an equal 
              footing. They are ready to exchange their knowlegde and skills for 
              mutual progress. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">　　A bigger cake, or 
              a smaller one? Sensible Singaporeans are sure to make the right 
              choice.</font></p>

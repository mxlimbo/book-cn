<p>Girl you are my song</p>
<pre>
Girl you are my song
You are the melody
And you're the harmony
Girl you 're in my mind
Spinning around my brain
And I go insane

You light up my life
You make the sunshine
And you keep away the rain
Sweet is your emotion

Girl you are my song
You are the melody
And harmony
Babe you're the only 
Music of my life
If it never ends I'll never tired

When you're happy 
Makes me feel so good
When you're sad I 
Feel the same way too
You are my song

Fly listening to you
Makes me feel so light
You're the one 
Who sets me in the sky
You control the rhythm of my heart
And I hope that it will never stop 
You are my girl

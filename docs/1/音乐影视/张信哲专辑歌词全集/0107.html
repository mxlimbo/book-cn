<p>Without you</p>
<pre>
No  I can't forget this evening
nor your face when you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way
the story goes
You always smile
But in your eyes your sorrow shows
yes it shows

No  I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
I had you there
But then I let you go
And now it's only fair
That's I should let you know
What you should know

I can't live if living is without you
I can't give I can't give anymore
I can't live if living is without you
I can't give I can't give anymore

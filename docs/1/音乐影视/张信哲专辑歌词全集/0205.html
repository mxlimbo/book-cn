<p>Blue balloon</p>
<pre>
I have a blue balloon a happy tune
Love enough to last me all through
the afternoon 
I have the New York time and 14 dimes
and
Expectations of the most profound 
nursery rhyme 

Before the rivers run dry
Before the last say good-bye
Let's be kind to one another
we can try 

So don't just throw your love above
It's not too late to find out
Before the sand has all run out of
the hour glass 

The carnival is here

The crown appears

Plastic painted people hold
each other near 
Hopes are always high
The echo of the sky and when in
it's over
There just a lonely sight of good-bye

Too late to hide it now
It's all around us now
Oh ! How I want you girl
To lie beside me now
While there still this time
and now my balloon still rhyme
Let me love you now
We can drink a cool good wine

So don't just throw your love above
You and me had last find out
Before the sand has all run out of
the hour glass

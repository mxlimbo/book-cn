<p>Knife</p>
<pre>
You've touched my life
With the softness in the night
My wish was your command
Until you ran out of love
Tell myself I am free 
Got a chance of 
Living just for me
No need to hurry home
Now that your're gone

Knife cuts like a knife
How will I ever heal
I'm so deeply wounded
Knife cuts like a knife
You've cut away the heart 
Of my life(and I ooh)

When I pretend wear a smile 
To fool my dearest friends
I wonder if they know
It's just a show
I'm on a stage day and night
I go through my charades
But how can I disguise
What's in my eyes

I've tried and tried
Locking up the pain
I feel inside the pain of
Wanting you wanting you

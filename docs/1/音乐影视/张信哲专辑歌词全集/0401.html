<p>My eyes adored you</p>

My eyes adored you
Oh I'll never lay a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me

You couldn't see how I adored you
So close so close and yet so far
Carried your books from school
Playing make believe you're married to me

You were fifth grade I was sixth when we came to be
Walking home everyday over barnaca bridge and bay
Till we grew into me and you
Went our separate ways

My eyes adored you
Oh I'll never lay a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a adored miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you
So close so close and yet so far

Ready for city lights
Climbed the ladder up to fortune and fame
I worked my fingers to fortune and fame
Made myself a name
Funny I seem to find that no matter how the years unwhine
Still I reminds about the girl I miss
And the love I left behind 

All my life I will remember 
How warm and tender we were way back than oh , baby
Full of feeling sad regrets
I know I want never forget you my childhood friend

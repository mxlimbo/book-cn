<p>Against all odds</p>
<pre>
How can I just let you walk away
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath with you 
You're the only one who really knew me at all

How can you just walk away from me 
When all I can do is watch you leave
'Cause we shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Who has just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just a memory of your face

Well take a look at me now
There's just an empty space 
And you comin' back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've got to face

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

Well take a look at me now
There's just an empty space
And that's what I've got to face
Take a good look at me now

Take a good look at me now
And you comin' back to me is against the odds
Is the chance I've gotta take
Take a look at me now

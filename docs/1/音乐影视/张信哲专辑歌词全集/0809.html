<p>Let it go</p>
<pre>
Too many doubts
Too much fear 
Too much danger
When society constructs
Our human nature
On live by the rules
Live by the law
Live by commandments
Notions preconcieved can lead
Towards amendments

Let it go, Let it go
Let it free your body
Let it move your soul
Let it go oh no
We are made we are not born
Let it go
Let it free your body
Let it move your soul
Let it go oh no
We are made we are not born
(Let it go  Let it go)

Learn to convert
Learn to assert
Learn to abandon
Ideologies and disciplines
At random
Lay down my laws
Lay down the rules
Lay down commandments
LIft the sanctions that restrict
This man's madness

Uniformity conventionality is
The bane of our existence
Keeps us safely at a distance
Non-conformity, Unconventionality
Is to dare to be
Let your hair down can't you see

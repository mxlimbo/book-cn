<p>Smile a little smile</p>
<pre>
You really should have said
This time is gone for good
He never come back now
Even though he said he would
So darling dry your eyes
So many other guys
Would give the word I'm sure
To wear the shoes he wore

Oh come on
Smile a little smile for me
Rose marry where the use in crying
Little little while you see
Rose marry you must keep on trying
I know that he hurt you bad
I know darling don't be sad and
Smile a little smile for me
Rose marry , rose marry

I guess your lonely now
Love is coming to an end
But darling only now
Are you free to start again
Lift up your pretty chin
Don't let those tears begin
You're a big girl now
And you'll pull thru some how

Smile a little smile for me
Rose marry , rose marry

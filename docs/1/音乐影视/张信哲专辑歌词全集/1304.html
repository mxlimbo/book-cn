<p>Missing</p>
<pre>
I step off the train
I'm walking down your street again
And past your door
But you don't live there anymore
It's years since you've been there
(And) Now you're disappeared somewhere like outer space
You've found some better place
And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain

Could you be dead?
You always were two steps ahead of everyone
We'd walk behind while you would run
I look up at your house
And I can almost hear you shout down to me
Where I always used to be
And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain

Back on the train 
I ask did I come again?
Can I confess I've been hanging round your old dress?
And the years have proved to offer nothing since you moved
You've long gone but I can't move on 
And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain

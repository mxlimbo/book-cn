<p>One more try</p>
<pre>
I've had enough of danger and people on the streets
I'm looking out for angels
Just trying to find some peace
Now I think it's  time that you let me know
So if you love me, say you love me
But if you don't just let me go

Cause teacher there are things that I don't to learn
And the last one I had made me cry 
So I don't want to learn to hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy

Whose teacher has told him goodbye 
goodbye (goodbye)

When you were just a stranger and I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger(no, but) now I feel the heat 
That look in your eyes it's telling me no
So you think that you love me know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
Just let me go

So when you say that you need me
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong 
Let me go

And teacher 
There are things that I still have to learn

But the one thing I have is my pride, ooh yeah
So baby I don't want to hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Who just isn't willing to try 
I'm so cold, inside
Maybe just one more try

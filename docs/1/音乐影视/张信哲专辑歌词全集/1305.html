<p>Pray</p>
<pre>
When the time gets near for me to show my love
The longer I stayed away for 
hiding from a word I need to bear now
Don't think I'll hear it again

But the nights were always warm with you
Holding you right by my side
But the morning always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes

All I do each night is pray
Hoping that I'll be a part of you again some day
All I do each night is think
Of all the times I closed the door to keep my love within

If you can't forgive the past
I'll understand that
Can't understand why I did this to you
And all of the days and the nights so I'll regret it
I never showed you my love

Surely we must be in sight
Of the dream we long to be live
Of you stop and close your eyes
You'll picture me inside
I'm so cold and all alone

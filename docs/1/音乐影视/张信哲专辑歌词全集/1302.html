<p>Good night girl</p>
<pre>
You hear me so clearly 
And see how I try
You feel meso heal me, and tear me apart
And I won't tell a soul
I won't tell at all
And do they have to know
About my good night girl

Caught up in your wishin' well
Your hopes and sadness
Take your love n' promises 
And make them last, you make them last

You keep me so near you
And see me so far
And hold me and send me
And deep in your heart
And I won't tell a soul

I won't tell at all
And I won't let them know
About my good night girl

Doesn't matter how sad I made you
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Just remember the same old reason
Reflected in your eyes
You said you want me

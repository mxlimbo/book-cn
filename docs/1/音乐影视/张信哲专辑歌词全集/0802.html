<p>Some where in my broken heart</p>
<pre>
You made up your mind 
It was time it was over
After we've had come so far
But I think there's enough 
Pieces of forgiveness 
Somewhere in my broken heart

I would not have chosen 
The road you have taken
It has left us miles apart
But I think I can still find 
The will to keep going 
Somewhere in my broken heart

So fly Go ahead and fly
Till you find out who you are 
And I, I will keep my love unspoken
Somewhere in my broken heart

I hope that in time you will find
What you long for love 
That's written in the stars
When you finally leave
I think you will see it
Somewhere in my broken heart
(Somewhere in my broken heart)

              <blockquote> 
                <p><br>
                  Starry, starry night <br>
                  Paint your palette blue and gray <br>
                  Look out on a summer's day <br>
                  With eyes that know the darkness in my soul <br>
                  Shadows on the hills <br>
                  Sketch the trees and the daffodils <br>
                  Catch the breeze and the winter chills <br>
                  In colors on the snowy linen land. </p>
                <p>Now I understand <br>
                  What you tried to say, to me <br>
                  And how you suffered for your sanity <br>
                  And how you tried to set them free <br>
                  They would not listen, they did not know how <br>
                  Perhaps they'll listen now... <br>
                  <br>
                </p>
                <p> Starry, starry night <br>
                  Flaming flowers that brightly blaze <br>
                  Swirling clouds in violet haze <br>
                  Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue <br>
                  Colours changing hue <br>
                  Morning fields of amber grain <br>
                  Weathered faces lined in pain <br>
                  Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand. </p>
                <p> Now I understand <br>
                  What you tried to say, to me <br>
                  And how you suffered for your sanity <br>
                  And how you tried to set them free <br>
                  They would not listen, they did not know how <br>
                  Perhaps they'll listen now... <br>
                  <br>
                </p>
                <p> For they could not love you <br>
                  But still, your love was true <br>
                  And when no hope was left inside <br>
                  On that starry, starry night <br>
                  You took your life as lovers often do <br>
                  But I could've told you, Vincent <br>
                  This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you... <br>
                  <br>
                </p>
                <p> Starry, Starry night <br>
                  Portraits hung in empty halls <br>
                  Frameless heads on nameless walls <br>
                  With eyes that watch the world and can't forget <br>
                  Like the strangers that you've met <br>
                  The ragged men in ragged clothes <br>
                  The silver thorn, a bloody rose <br>
                  Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow. </p>
                <p> Now I think I know <br>
                  What you tried to say, to me <br>
                  And how you suffered for your sanity <br>
                  And how you tried to set them free <br>
                  They would not listen, they're not listening still <br>
                  Perhaps they never will... </p>

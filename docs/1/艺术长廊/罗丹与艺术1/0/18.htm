              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">　　While visiting 
                the second circle in Hell, Virgil and Dante saw, among those who 
                had committed sins of the flesh, Paolo and Francesca, two personages 
                who had really lived in the Middle Ages in Italy. Around 1275, 
                Francesca, the daughter of Guido da Polenta, married Gianciotto 
                Malatesta, Lord of Rimini, who entrusted her in the care of his 
                brother, the handsome young Paolo. Paolo and Francesca fell in 
                love with each other while reading romances of courtly love. As 
                soon as they exchanged their first kiss, Gianciotto caught them 
                by surprise and stabbed them. &quot;Love has led us to a unique 
                death&quot; Dante makes their shades say. This forbidden love 
                and its consequent eternal damnation, was a favourite theme among 
                19th century artists, from Ingres to Delacroix, and from Ary Scheffer 
                to Cabanel and Henri Martin. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">　　Rodin portrayed 
                the famous lovers at the very instant they became aware of their 
                feelings. He placed them in the centre of the left leaf of The 
                Gates of Hell. This group was still in place at the beginning 
                of 1886 but was removed shortly afterwards, probably because it 
                portrayed a state of pure happiness which did not fit in with 
                the theme of the composition. It was exhibited in Paris, then 
                in Brussels in 1887, when it was given the title of The Kiss by 
                critics who were surprised at the lack of costume or decorative 
                details referring directly to Paolo and Francesca. Rodin had already 
                rejected the easy solution of picturesque, litterary or mythological 
                subjects which, by distracting the viewer, weakened the emotion 
                that should be felt when contemplating a sculpture.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">　　 Like many 
                groups originating from the Gate, The Kiss became an independent 
                work. On 31 January 1888, the Directorate of Fine Arts commissioned 
                a version in marble, double the size, for the group was supposed 
                to be shown at the Universal Exhibition which opened on 6 May 
                1889. Unfortunately, Jean Turcan, the practicien who was responsible 
                for carving the group in marble, stopped working on it at the 
                beginning of 1889. Rodin left it in abeyance ... and the marble 
                version was only shown at the Salon of the Soci&amp;eacute;te 
                Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1898, at the same time as the large 
                model of Balzac. Aware of the scandal the latter would arouse, 
                Rodin thought it would be prudent to exhibit a more traditional 
                work as well. As he anticipated, all the praise went to The Kiss 
                while his Balzac was showered with criticism. Yet he himself realized 
                the progress accomplished by both. &quot;The embrace of The Kiss 
                is undoubtedly very attractive&quot;, he acknowledged. &quot;But 
                I have found nothing in this group. It is a theme frequently treated 
                in the academic tradition, a subject complete in itself and artifically 
                isolated from the world surrounding it; it is a big ornament sculpted 
                according to the usual formula and which focuses attention on 
                the two personages instead of opening up wide horizons to daydreams&quot; 
                (Paul Gsell, &quot;Propos de Rodin sur l'art et les artistes&quot;, 
                La Revue, 1st November 1907).</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">　　After being 
                presented again at the Universal Exhibition of 1900, The Kiss 
                entered the Mus&amp;eacute;e du Luxembourg before being deposited 
                at the Rodin Museum, when it was created in 1918. But in 1900, 
                two other marble replicas were ordered from Rodin, one by Carl 
                Jacobsen for the sculpture museum he was setting up in Copenhagen, 
                and the other by an art lover, Edward Perry Warren, for his own 
                collection (now in the Tate Gallery in London). The three marble 
                versions were exhibited together at the Mus&amp;eacute;e d'Orsay 
                in 1995 where it was possible to observe that the main differences 
                lay in the way the blocks were carved and the degree of finish, 
                The Kiss belonging to the Rodin Museum having an unfinished aspect 
                which can be explained by the fact that work on it was suddenly 
                stopped in early 1889.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">　　However 
                much Rodin protested about the traditional character of The Kiss, 
                it still remains one of his most famous works, and in the 20th 
                century it continued to inspire other artists, culminating in 
                Constantin Brancusi. While denying that he was influenced by Rodin 
                (in whose studio he had spent a few months on his arrival in Paris), 
                Brancusi treated this theme many times, from 1907 to 1945, and 
                a fine example of The Kiss can be seen at Pompidou Centre. </font></p>

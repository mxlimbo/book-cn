              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt"><b>Q: You started 
                singing professionally in 1989, and released Coming Home in 1992.</b><br>
                Faye: Yes. 1992.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt"><strong>Q: 
                I've always been curious about how totally changed you were when 
                you returned from New York.</strong><br>
                Faye: It's more accurate to say that I had changed back to the 
                real me. From 1989 to 1991, I felt very lost. I wasn't myself 
                at all. When I returned in 1992, people perceived a drastic change, 
                but that was actually the true Faye Won. Before that, being new 
                to Hongkong, I just let my record company make most of the decisions. 
                I didn't know what was happening and thus lacked a lot of self-confidence.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt"><strong>Q: 
                What happened in New York?</strong><br>
                Faye: New york was another cultural shock as it was different 
                from bothe Beijing (where Faye was born and bred) and Hongkong. 
                But this time it shocked me into consciousness. You must have 
                heard of real-life cases where someone loses his memory in the 
                first accident, then regains it in another. It's a similar senario 
                for me: a double cultural shock. It was about time I woke up and 
                became myself again.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt"><strong>Q: 
                Have you decided to move back to Beijing now and use Hongkong 
                as a base for promotion?</strong><br>
                Faye: I'll be spending most of my time in Beijing as most of my 
                music collaborators are there and it's difficult for them to travel 
                to Hongkong.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt"><strong>Q: 
                What's your daily routine like? Is it anything like what you did 
                in Chuingking Express (which marked Faye's acting debut)?</strong><br>
                Faye: Of course not! I've never done so much housework is real 
                life! The director Wong Kar Wai, wanted me to mop the floor, wipe 
                the table, perform all kinds of cleaning jobs which I usually 
                wouldn't do. Besides I'm not as neurotic as the character in the 
                film.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt"><strong>Q: 
                Let's talk about your latest album, Exaperation. This album - 
                where you wrote all but 2 songs - seems to marl the start of 'Faye 
                Wong's Creative Era'. So we can say goodbye to the old Faye Wong! 
                Looking back now, how do you feel about your early songs?<br>
                </strong>Faye: It wasn't that bad then. But the way I'm now, my 
                mental state and mood being totally different, I feel I'm artistically 
                much better now.</span></font></p>

    style="font-size: 9pt">Q: You used to cover alternative songs. And now you're 
                writing them.<br>
                </span></font></strong><font face="Verdana"><span
    style="font-size: 9pt">Faye: I've always wanted to do something like this. 
                But the timing wasn't right until now.</span></font></p>
              <p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 10px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px"> <strong><font face="Verdana"><span
    style="font-size: 9pt"><strong>Q: Your lyrics seem to give the impression 
                that you are a despondent person by nature.</strong><br>
                </span></font></strong><font face="Verdana"><span
    style="font-size: 9pt">Faye: Taken at face value, my lyrics might seem pessimistic 
                with song titles like 'Degenerate' and 'Doomsday'. These are parts 
                of me like that, a 'greyish' kind of personality. What I wanted 
                to do was to express a kind of inner struggle. Sometimes I see 
                something in myself which I don't like, so I write about it hoping 
                that this way, I can change it. But it's not so easy. Human beings 
                have a lot of weaknesses which are hard to overcome. And it's 
                also mixed with a sense of helplessness.</span></font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt"><strong>Q: 
                Your songs in <em>Exaperation</em> make the listener feel like 
                that's a good state of mind to be in...</strong><br>
                Faye: ...It's not a state I want to be in, but it's something 
                I can't run away from. I feel that being exaperated is a human 
                emotion, so it's neither good nor bad. Mentally, we all have our 
                ups and downs. When things become too mundane, we start getting 
                grouchy... </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt"><strong>Q: 
                I especially like your last line: &quot;Everything is fine; the 
                only lacking is trouble.&quot;</strong><br>
                Faye: I actually meant the opposite. When your life is uneventful, 
                you begin to yearn for trouble.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt"><strong>Q: 
                How do you create your music? Do you jam with the band? </strong><br>
                Faye: We usually start with a music 'base', then follow that by 
                writing the melody. In most cases, the lyrics come last. There's 
                only one song in the current album where I wrote the lyrics first.</span></font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt"><strong><strong><strong><strong>Q: 
                Which was that?</strong><br>
                </strong></strong></strong>Faye: 'Doomsday'. I wrote it one day 
                while lying in bed in Hongkong. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt"><strong><strong><strong><strong>Q: 
                A line from the song says, &quot;Desire buys everyting.&quot; 
                That sounds very 'Hongkong' but why the tittle?</strong><br>
                </strong></strong></strong>Faye: I named the song 'Doomsday' because 
                I wanted to write about the uglier side of life.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt"><strong><strong><strong><strong>Q: 
                Is the world 'ugly' to you?</strong><br>
                </strong></strong></strong>Faye: Perhaps I'm more sensitive to 
                the less pleasant things in life. The more material desires you 
                have, the more spiritually empty you feel. Which leads some to 
                look for instant gratification. I'm quite pessimistic about things.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt"><strong>Q: 
                So what can alleviate the imperfection?</strong><br>
                Faye: Well, life is not all suffering. If it were, then you might 
                as well not go on living! In between the suffering, there will 
                be some wonderful things which attract you and give you a sense 
                of hope. But then later it becomes...</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt"><strong>...disappointment.</strong><br>
                Faye: Yes, nothing is certain. And that's life. There's no way 
                you can change it. So the only thing you can do is have some fun 
                in the midst of suffering.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt"><strong>Fun 
                in the midst of suffering!</strong><br>
                Faye: Whenever there's pleasure, there's bound to be pain.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt"><strong>Q: 
                So is singing pleasurable?</strong><br>
                Faye: Half the time, I'd say.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt"><strong>Q: 
                Then again, you're no longer the 'Shirley Wong' [Faye's original 
                moniker when she entered showbiz] of 1989. You're the 'Faye Wong' 
                of 1996, someone who's got more say over what you do.</strong><br>
                Faye: Yes, things are much better now. But one still worries about 
                the future. Like, what's my next album going to be like? Will 
                I still have the inspiration?</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt"><strong>Q: 
                Your recording contract is also a subject which arouses a lot 
                of interest...</strong><br>
                Faye: <em>(Deep sigh) </em>Actually, a lot of this news is unfounded.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt"><strong>Q: 
                That's because we're all curious about you. Even when you're 'hiding' 
                in Beijing, the tabloids still manage to track you down.</strong><br>
                Faye: (Another sigh) What can I do? I'm already trying to keep 
                as low profile as possible. I can understand the pressure [on 
                the tabloid reporters] to unearth scoops. Granted, they have their 
                press freedom, but as human being, I too have my rights. If the 
                media want me to respect them, then they should respect me instead 
                of printing hurtful reports. I know ultimately it's entertainment 
                news, with the emphasis on 'entertainment'. But they shouldn't 
                go too far.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt"><strong>You 
                should take it easier.</strong><br>
                Faye: I'm already taking it very easy. I just hope everyone will 
                give me a break.</span></font></p>

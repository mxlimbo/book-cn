              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Faye Wong, 
                who was born in Beijing and is 28 years old, has become popular 
                as well in Japan by a Wong Kar-wai directed movie &quot;Chungking 
                Express&quot;. A decade ago, she first came to Hong Kong, which 
                she regarded just as a passage to go studying abroad. For some 
                accidental reasons, she debuted as a singer there to be the top 
                Asian artist who is now respected by Europe and American artists 
                as well. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Since there 
                has not been any independent &quot;artists&quot; in the Europe-American 
                sense in Hong Kong show business, Faye's very way of life has 
                caused a lot of sensation and controversies. The more faithful 
                to her belief she acts, the more frictions occur, and strange 
                rumors about her intention spread. To act faithfully to one's 
                own principle -- such a simple thing couldn't be tolerated in 
                the world of the show business. Considering the level of gossip-chasing 
                mass media in Hong Kong and Taiwan, her negative attitude toward 
                any promotions and interviews is reasonable. Even her simplest 
                hope for working contentedly and cherishing her style of music 
                has given rise to strange rumors, only to have established her 
                image in people's brains that she is irritable and selfish.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">During our 
                interview and photographing session in Beijing, however, she arrived 
                at studio in advance to make up; though I have met her several 
                times,she has never been late or moody, other staffs said so, 
                too. She just hates to be forced to do what she doesn't accept.

                news that she had left Hong Kong and settled at a new apartment 
                in Beijing, just when people began to wondering if she would come 
                back to the world of music as she had stopped all the work ever 
                since the release of &quot;Anxiety (Fuzao)&quot; in the summer 
                of 1996. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">In Beijing, 
                she restored her private life with her partner Dou Wei and other 
                close friends. This change of her surrounding seems to make her 
                relaxed; staffs close to Faye says that she now never insists 
                her opinion when others go on talking. It is said that in previous 
                record company, Faye was forced to waste a lot of energy just 
                in speaking out her own idea, only to see it denied. Faye says 
                that whether her demand can be fulfilled was one of the focus 
                in the process of negotiation with EMI. </span></font></p>

                year, she has been awfully busy in all the stuff ranging from 
                childbirth to establishment of her own production company; now 
                that she has completed the recording for the latest album, I could 
                have an opportunity to meet her in Beijing calmly. Although she 
                is famous for her short answer in interviews, she talked about 
                her feeling very honestly this time. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">When the interview 
                began, she smiled finding the names of the people who helped Faye 
                in her early days on her profile document made by me as a part 
                of data for the interview. The atomosphere was quite a lot relaxed.

                a little perplexed at the direction of the photographer Fuzishiro 
                Meisa (in Hong Kong, artists rarely communicate a camera man but 
                just pose as they like), she after all seemed to have enjoyed 
                the session. She also agreed to take a picture on the street's 
                intersection and accepted the ask by passer-bys for her autograph. 
                I guess that such relaxed Faye can't be seen in Hong Kong. This 
                should be the first time for her to take photos in her hometown 
                since the album &quot;Coming Home&quot;. </span></font></p>

                her close friends, different from any of her earlier produced-in-Hong 
                Kong albums. The concept of this epoch-making album is quite simple, 
                and we can hear her comfortable voice with its alternative melody 
                lines. Beautifully rhyming lyrics are full of significance in 
                spite of their simplicity. Some songs don't have any lyrics, which

                such as recording or mixing, she is eager to produce in Beijing

                Kong than in Beijing. In comparison with &quot;Anxiety&quot;, 
                her brand-new album might seem a little bit retrograde. But her 
                voice really gets softer and more unique than ever. As Faye said

    style="font-size: 9pt">Before flying off to Hong Kong to have my interview 
                with Faye, the record company promotions manager told me :&quot; 
                this is faye since she entered into the music scene to date, first 
                ever formally accept a singapore face to face media interview, 
                it is really considered a very rare chance. She jokingly said 
                : &quot;can be considered is like ' the big empress' specially 
                give face, rite ?&quot;</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">But then, not 
                till the last second, no one can guarantee this interview with 
                faye can go smoothly, if didn't see her real person, there's no 
                confirmed outcome.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Maybe is because 
                of this reason, or maybe listen to too many reports, everyone's 
                hearts is feeling worried, especially is the reporter from &quot;8 
                days&quot; that is going on this trip too, who was very interesting. 
                Before starting off to the interview, was quickly browsing through 
                all her information, taking deep breathes, in the end almost resulted 
                in her gastric pain to happen.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">I consoled 
                her :&quot; you relax a bit okie, faye is not any three heads 
                or six shoulders creature, she is also just a person.&quot; Just 
                like this, we got onto the record company's car and reached the 
                Jiu Long Zhuo Dun Dao &quot; Ye Kuang Shang Ye Da Sha.&quot;</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">When the big 
                door is pushed open, in the small meeting room, faye who was chatting 
                with the make-up artist, zing turn around and look at us, was 
                smiling and said hello to us. A simple light colour T-shirt, a 
                pair of blue jeans, a calm face. Interview starts, interview ends. 
                All we saw, is but a person.</span></font></p>

                &quot;Fei&quot; represents Faye Wong, &quot; Jie&quot; represents 
                Liu Jie Qi)</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Jie : In your 
                this new album, the style seems to go into many different types 
                of direction, what is the most important thing that you wish to 
                express to music listeners ? Fei : Express what thing ah ? also 
                not expressing much lah , actually ..how to say ah , actually 
                every time before do one album, I also never think of what to 
                express a particular issue or what, only wish to make this album 
                to be very good, if I can be totally involved into the compositions, 
                that is the best lah ! However, mostly I dun make many compositions, 
                but will try my best to put in more of my own things inside, just 
                like that. Actually express something or not is open to the audience's 
                opinions, I only wish to do a good album.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Jie : In your 
                albums, there is more and more of your own compositions, in the 
                near future will there be a full album of all of your own things 
                ? Fei : Really hope can be like this, but I feel that currently 
                I still cannot fully do that. Because although now, I only release 
                one album per year, but I still feel that the time is not short.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Jie : Then 
                what u feel is the most ideal time to complete one album ? Fei 
                : This is very hard to say, cannot guarantee is 3 or 5 years , 
                8 years or ....keke (Faye's laughter : is between those ha and 
                he, not those haha ...big laugh type, also not those from the 
                sound that comes from the nose, so is &quot;kekeke&quot; this 
                type.) Actually my ideal thought is to make my album as my interest 
                and not a job, maybe I can do that.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Jie : Many 
                singers hope to at least release 2 albums and above per year to 
                let their popularity to be stable and to get a stable income. 
                As for your style of only releasing one album per year, as compared 
                with the normal singers who follow the pattern, is there any bad 
                points to that ? Is there any problems to maintain ? Fei : I dun 
                feel is hard to maintain, living can still maintain ah ! keke 
                ....but if spend a very long time to produce an album that yourself 
                likes a lot, I feel is really worth it. Maybe you one year release 
                2 albums, but if is of a poor quality, the effect that comes out 
                is not good ....I feel the most important is still quality.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">(At this time, 
                Andy asked her about the conflict between interest and work , 
                she replied :&quot; now is already very hard to differentiate 
                between interest and work, so sometimes will be in a dilemma, 
                because music , itself is not a business product, but now is already 
                as a business product that is popular, thus very naturally will 
                result in this very hard to solve dilemma. &quot;Unless I dun 
                continue to sign on with any record company, only purely doing 
                my own music, but can also stably maintain my life, that I think 
                will be my most happiest time.&quot; As she says this, she smiles 
                again.)</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Jie : Will 
                u feel you are under no choice when faced with those questions 
                regarding the selling amounts of your albums and the market problems, 
                like you are living in a very hard to control surroundings ? Fei 
                : Yes, thus need to make a balance, but I feel it should not be 
                like that. Like the environment that I am now in, I feel should 
                go and face it, and not just feel no choice, thus I feel have 
                to make a balance. To do it is quite hard, but I will try my best 
                to do it.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">(Andy wish 
                to understand why the song she wrote for her daughter &quot;Tong&quot; 
                goes a dancing style kind, she replied : &quot; many songs that 
                are written for kids are those heart-warming and soft types, actually 
                heart-warming things need not be only express in soft ways, because 
                she is very active. This song is douwei who arranges it together, 
                before that we got discussed to co-operate to make a dance kind 
                of song, thus when this is finished , we feel is very suitable 
                for Tong Tong.&quot;</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Jie : This 
                song, have u let Tong Tong listen ? Did she dance with the music 
                ? Fei : Yes, yes !</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Jie : She likes 
                this song ? Fei : Yup, I think she likes it. (smiles)</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Jie : In the 
                song, the instruments that are used brings out a bit of Indian 
                taste, is this what u want ? Fei : Got meh ? This question u have 
                to ask douwei, music is he who arranges it, personally I dun feel 
                the song have any Indian taste.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Jie : The image 
                in this album seems to give people the feeling of going back to 
                the innocent look type, just like what the case wrote :&quot; 
                Faye never before pure innocent romantic, just like under the 
                sun, because of playfulness got a sunburnt on the face like a 
                kid&quot;, is this your most innocent and best reflection ? Fei 
                : ( immediately turned to sitting next to her, Zing) you explain 
                lah ........case sometimes is not really .....actually I never 
                really think carefully of what image to use, also never really 
                seriously go and plan, I all give to Zing , art director, hairstylist 
                and photographer, they will have meetings and discuss about it 
                , actually is all very natural, goes with the feelings .......I 
                think the main thing they want is still to represent me ? ....keke 
                ....represents character, look more natural !</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">&quot; Actually 
                I'm not like what the outside people discussed me as so cold, 
                maybe is because due to my character, I'm not good at socializing, 
                will not take the initiative, but if become friends, I'm quite 
                active one, and can be very wild .....&quot;</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Jie : That 
                is also the more true you ? Fei : There's no really true or false 
                I guess ? No matter what, he do what ever make-up or drew anything 
                on my face, still need me to express it out, thus no need to say 
                true or false, all is me.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Jie : Basically 
                you will not have any objections ? Fei : Sometimes , some images 
                I cannot accept or dun like ...but usually will not have, because 
                we have been working together for very long, are friends, they 
                all understand me, all have a kind of chemistry, kno what suits 
                me, what I dun like.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Jie : You give 
                people the impression of &quot; I do my own business&quot; kind 
                of image, towards music is also the same manner, basically do 
                u concern about the direction of the music industry ? concern 
                about the whole of the music world ? Fei : Is not that I am not 
                concern, my music still starts from myself, I will not do what 
                is popular in the market now, I dun necessarily follow it, main 
                thing still lies from my own likes.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Jie : Your 
                good friend, Naying in a recent telephone interview told the audience 
                : &quot; privately faye is very friendly to guests, love friends, 
                love fun, sometimes can get wild , she is like a totally different 
                person from what you all see her&quot;. To what she said, you 
                have any agree or disagree points? Fei : I dun disagree, actually 
                me ...how to say leh ? Actually I'm not like what the outside 
                people say me as that cold, maybe is to strangers. Maybe is because 
                of my character, I'm not too good at socializing, will not take 
                the initiative, but if become friends, I'm quite active one, and 
                can be very wild, keke....but no choice lah, audience still is 
                audience, no matter how he likes my songs, there's still a distance 
                between us, it is not possible that he can fully understand me. 
                I feel there is also no choice here, I also dun wish to force 
                them to fully understand me, as long they listen to my songs, 
                like my songs, that is good enough.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">( Based on 
                character questions, Andy asked Faye what matters will make her 
                feel very happy? Faye think for a while and said :&quot; many 
                things can make me very happy and not happy, a small matter can 
                make me very happy, but can also make me unhappy, I feel I am 
                a sensitive person, emotions tend to change quite greatly. Actually 
                I'm not much different from the past, still in the state of dilemma 
                .....human basically is a dilemma ! &quot; When she was saying 
                this, she was smiling , but there seems to have some dilemma expression

                having Tong Tong, your attitude towards life , is there any changes 
                ? Fei : Actually many thing have two sides, being a mother of 
                course is very happy, but also have many worries, many troubles....being 
                a person is like that, good and bad, right and wrong both sides

                a optimistic person, even if my emotions is in a bad times, I 
                will still try to find a good direction to think, past is like

                ? Fei : I cannot say be very enthusiastic, also not enthusiastic, 
                I will try my best, main thing is let nature take its own course

                not force what ? Fei : Right ah, many things you cannot force 
                one.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Jie : What 
                is your ideal life ? Fei : Ideal life ? Ideal life ....( stoned 
                for almost 18secs, can sense that she is seriously thinking about 
                this question) actually I feel that there is no really an ideal 
                life, what I mean is &quot; if now you think the future you will 
                be &quot; like this like this&quot; thats good enough, but when 
                reached &quot;like this like this &quot; later, you might still 
                not be satisfied, will always wish for more things. Thus I will 
                not go and think next time what I wish to be like, I only wish 
                to face the problems in the current times, I feel this is life, 
                dun think too far.</span></font></p>

                Andy asked her what she feels for Kit Chan performance in the 
                &quot; Slowly walk life&quot;. Faye's first expression is laughing 
                greatly:&quot;she finished acting already meh ? haven't yet right 
                !&quot; But after a short while, she realizes she seems to be 
                a bit overdoing it and think have misunderstood if the reply to 
                the question is not good, thus she immediately calm down and say 
                something:&quot; Kit Chan not bad, I always feel she is someone 
                who can sing, she is quite suitable in the music world too, as 
                compared to me, I'm always scared of acting.&quot; These few words 
                dissolve the almost reach awkward situation.)</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Jie : Because 
                you are scared of acting, thus after &quot;Chungking Express&quot;, 
                there's no more new works ? Fei : At this point no yet, but I 
                will not say I throw away acting in movies totally, but I must 
                defintely have the interest, and I must have confidence in myself.</span></font></p>

                reach the final decision.</span></font></p>

                album called &quot; Songs of Wanderlust&quot;, is the production 
                crew's idea or yours ? Fei : Is the production crew. Actually 
                my thought is to call it &quot;Faye Wong&quot;, because I have 
                no concept, I only wish to do a better listening album, I dun 
                have any particular thing to express out, not much concept. I 
                suggested named &quot;Faye Wong&quot; is good, but they say is 
                the same as the last album ......</span></font></p>

                right ? Really that is too horrible! haha.....</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Jie : In 1994 
                &quot;Movies double issue &quot;, there's an article interview 
                and you said the job that you dun wish to take is do &quot;interviews&quot;, 
                wonder after so many years, have your attitude towards media change 
                ? Will you be soften down a bit ? Fei : The situation now does 
                not allows me to soften down, I feel that the HongKong media is 
                overdoing it now, becomes more serious. Actually my attitude changes 
                in the past is not because after I became famous, then change 
                to not being co-operative. Is because I feel that some Hong Kong 
                media are too unreasonable, I dun wish to have anything to do 
                with them. If in doing work, I will not mind , what makes me feel 
                dislike them is their too much of their following you and chasing. 
                Like today we here doing the interview, I did not have any objections. 
                Because if they did something that makes me feel uncomfortable, 
                I will use one attitude towards them. I always dun like people 
                to interfere with my personal matters, I feel everyone always 
                dun wish that. Some artists will feel is part of their job, cannot 
                avoid, but I will not allow such thing to happen, if they have 
                ways to secretly take photos, whatever, I have no way to stop 
                them, but its not possible for me to work with them on this matter, 
                attitude will not soften down, I'm forever like this.</span></font></p>

                media seems like I haven't have contact before, I only live there, 
                very rarely have interviews .....actually the media that I have 
                most contact is the Hong Kong media, I think the most uncomfortable 
                is the Hong Kong media, because they are nearer to me, I spend 
                a lot of time in Hong Kong, Thus they have many chances to follow 
                me, maybe if I live in Taiwan will also have such things ?</span></font></p>

                Two feet away story</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">When the interview 
                was over, Faye open her eyes big big and asked :&quot; finished 
                liao ?&quot; cannot believe we so easily &quot;let her go&quot;.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">But I still 
                hear her softly gave a sign of relief, smiling stood up and twist 
                her waist, continue to chat with her other company people happily, 
                the atmposhere was very easy and happy.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Actually, to 
                everyone present who wasn't give a sign of relief ?</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">When we came 
                out of the building, my companion, Daniel very excitedly said 
                :&quot; Faye is simply too good, I love her even more !&quot;</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Everyone was 
                very happy, feel that this interview was too perfect, no any hurting 
                event.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">After returned 
                to Singapore, with colleagues, friends and family, whenever I 
                talk about this interview, all have the same two questions : &quot; 
                You really face to face talk with her for 50 mins ? what is she 
                like ?&quot; Looks like , Faye leaves people the deep impression 
                of her like &quot; cannot be near, better not to trifle with, 
                very hard to handle&quot;. However, if you see the above live 
                interview , you should be able to make a decision on her character 
                now.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">The interview 
                of me and faye, was in a small meeting room, on a circular desk, 
                her every moment , every smile was clearly shown.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Frankly speaking, 
                Faye is just like anyone of us. When she talks, it is full of 
                expressions, black and big eyes always love to turn here and there, 
                looks like a naughty child. She also have her own friends, love 
                and family. Talk about them, when mention about some funny events, 
                she will also laugh hehe ..haha .....</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">If think carefully, 
                I feel that Faye is someone who cannot do business, Hong Kong, 
                Taiwan and China any one is a bigger market than Singapore rite 
                or not ? Why she rather choose our interview , and not spend more 
                time wih the other three medias ?</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">There's only 
                one sentence to say : Faye only wish to do things accordingly 
                to her own likes, she wants to be true to herself, because she 
                knows, people still need to face yourself in the end. Thus she 
                said :&quot; I am like that in the past, now is like that, forever 
                is like that.&quot;</span></font></p>

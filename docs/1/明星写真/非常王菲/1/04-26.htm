                The heat is on. Faye Wong's releasing a new album, and 8 DAYS 
                has been granted an exclusive interview with her. That's if she 
                doesn't get temperamental on us at the last minute... no, make 
                that the last second. Consider this: when was the last time the 
                Southeast Asian media was granted a face-to-face interview with 
                the notoriously withdrawn wunderkind?</span></font></p>
              <p><font
    face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">This is the 29-year-old superstar 
                whose relationship with the press has veen less than salubrious. 
                The Faye who's been known to trade insults with hecklers at her 
                concerts, who answers questions in monosyllabus and fires sarcastic 
                riposters at nosey scribes, and who has declared cold war against 
                the Hongkong media (after they splashed photos of her performing 
                sanitation duties). The Faye who's wilfully gone against the grain 
                of what's expected of Cantopop's cardboard cut-out stars: she 
                won't smile or spout inane pleasantries just to butter up tabloid 
                reporters.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">This is the 
                Faye I've been tasked to coax into upening up. Mine was a heart 
                that skipped a couple of beats, then another couple more. This 
                being the sole interview given to an English publication in Singapore, 
                there's no room for mistakes, I mean, what if the interview falls 
                through? What if she gets cranky and sews her lips shut? What 
                if she ups and shows me a clean pair of heels? What if, what if...?</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Before the 
                face-toface was pencilled in, there'd been much to-ing and fro-ing 
                between Faye's record company and us. First, we were told to fax 
                our questions to EMI's Hongkong office for Faye to record her 
                answers on a tape which would be sent to us. Later, it was to 
                be a phone interview.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">But when EMI 
                learned that we were going to be in Hongkong the week she, too, 
                was to be there, the possibility of an exclusive was raised. After 
                a flurry of phone calls, we were instructed to fax a list of proposed 
                questions for Faye's approval. They also recommended that we submit 
                as many questions as possible so Faye won't abort the interview 
                prematurely because of any surprise query. Like I said, no worries, 
                eh?</span></font></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt"><font face="Verdana">Is it really 
                possible to have a journalistic <em><small>t</small></em></font><em><small>阾<font face="Verdana">e-?t</font>阾<font face="Verdana">e

                doubts. After all, here's a pop star so elusived she could give 
                American author-cum-recluse J D Salinger a run for his media phobia. 
                Faye's mastered the art of playing hard to get, so she's been 
                accused.&nbsp; Before I leave for Hongkong, my e</font></span></p>

                right: Faye Wong, one of GQ magazine's 59 coolest women in 1996 
                and reigning Empress of Chinese popdom, in both name and acclaim. 
                Idiosyncrasies aside, Faye's arguably the most influential Asian 
                pop music figure in recent memory. Do you see Sammi Cheng or even 
                Jacky Cheung - the man dubbed 'god of songs' - on the cover of 
                Time magazine? And who else has so much clout in the shamelessly 
                commercial industry of pop as to release an album containing nary 
                a handful of intelligible lyrics in 35 minutes of music (1996's 
                <em>Exasperation</em>)? No one else with her degree of commercial 
                success (to date, her albums have racked up sales of about 10 
                mil) has ever been as non-conformist as Faye. Not in East Asia 
                anyway.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">ditor-in-chief 
                wishes me good luck and tells me to call her the moment the interview's 
                done - or not done, as the case may be. We're taking nothing for 
                granted until after the very bites of Faye's voice are secured 
                on tape.</span></font></p>

                It's 6.50pm. An EMI rep is supposed to have picked me up at the 
                hotel 20 minutes ago. Has Faye changed her mind? I cross my fingers 
                so hard they turn blue. Five minutes later, the van arrives. 8 
                DAYS' stylist and photograher, who're in Hongkong for ot<img src="8days98(5).jpg" tppabs="http://genry.my169.com/faye/articles/img/8days98(5).jpg"
    width="425" height="500" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">her assignments, 
                tag along for a glimpse of this celebrity enigma. After a short 
                journey through heavy peak-hour traffic, we're led to a nondescript 
                grey office block on the outskirts of Tsimshatsui. The lift takes 
                us up to the 12th floor. A sign on the door reads 'A Production 
                House' - it's the company Faye set up with producer Alvin Leong 
                and manager Katie Chan. Stepping into the crammed office, I uncross 
                my fingers slightly.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">There Faye 
                is, already seated inside a room cluttered with files, cabinets 
                and pieces of hi-fi equipment, throwing us a curious look. Catching 
                sight of this beauteous creature with a mystique of unicorn-like 
                proportions, I find my knees turning to jello. On the brighter 
                side, I feel the blood returning to my fingers. Chances are good 
                that the interview will come to pass. Faye's lithe 1.72m figure 
                is clad in a comfy plain brown t-shirt, blue jeans and a pair 
                of electric pink Converse All-Stars. Her straight, red-tinted 
                hair ends just above her shoulders. There is not a trace of make-up 
                on her elfin visage, out of which peers her bright, sparkling 
                eyes. Her flawless fair skin has a translucence that's radiant. 
                Faye's is, in word, sublime. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">That's she's 
                not togged up fussily for an official press interview she reportedly 
                dislike so very much must be a good sign, no? The casual homeliness 
                of her outfit suggests a relaxed Faye, in contrast to the hairnet 
                defensiveness of last year.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Espying the 
                notes in my hands, Faye gasps slightly bemused, &quot;Wah, so 
                thick! Are there many questions?&quot; Taken aback by the gentleness 
                of her soft lilting speaking voice, I find my opening banter catching 
                in my throat. Still, the walls of silence and non-cooperation 
                she normally erects to keep out intrusive tabloid hacks seem to 
                be missing. Slowly snuffing out the butterflies in my tummy, I 
                ask if she's seen the list of questions I had faxed over. She 
                shakes her head. Apparently, her notoriety is based as much on 
                truth as it is on myth. Things are starting to look up. My fingers 
                loosen up and begin to take notes.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">I wouldn't 
                have guessed that the Faye I'm about to encounter is thoughtful, 
                open (but don't hold your breath for details about her private 
                life) and funny. I couln't have hoped for more. Maybe playing 
                mummy to Dou Jingtong, her 20-month-old daughter with Beijing 
                musician Dou Wei, has mellowed her attitude towards the press?</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">&quot;It's 
                not a question of mellowing, I haven't refused to co-operate with 
                the media just because I've become more popular. Sections of the 
                Hongkong media are unreasonable<img src="8days98(6).jpg" tppabs="http://genry.my169.com/faye/articles/img/8days98(6).jpg"
    width="307" height="500" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10"> and that's 
                why I don't want to have anything to do with them,&quot; she asserts.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                &quot;I'm definitely not against them if they're interested in 
                my work. What turns me off is that there's no limit to the extent 
                they would hound me. Some other entertainers may think that answering 
                questions about their private lives is a part of the job and can't 
                be avoided. However, I feel I must draw the line somewhere. I 
                can't help it if they resort to all ways and means to take pictures 
                of me; but under such circumstances, there's no way I can bring 
                myself to co-operate with them. Right now, however, I'm quite 
                happy to be doing this interview.&quot;</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Faye's salvo 
                against the paparazzi and tabloid-mongers confirms what I've suspected 
                all along: leep the line of questioning to her music, respect 
                her privacy and you'll be okay. The problem arise when people 
                want t toll-free highway ride into Faye's innermost sanctuaries. 
                A public figure be default, she's more a music-lover who hadn't 
                expected her star to go supernova. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">&quot;No matter 
                how much my supporters love and know my songs, there'll always 
                be that distance between them and me. There's no way they'll fully 
                understand me. As long as they love my songs, it's good enough 
                for me,&quot; Faye says, stretching out to tap the singed tip 
                of her Marlboro menthol into an ashtray with her long, slender 
                index finger. Now and then, she turns to look at her close friend 
                and make-up guru, Zing, who's ensconced in a chair to her left. 
                You get the feeling that she's relaxed because there's a familar 
                face around. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">&quot;But I'm 
                not as cold as some people say I am. I hope not,&quot; she laughs 
                a tad shyly. (Wow, a laugh!) &quot;If I'm cold, it's only to people 
                I'm not familar with. When people become my friends, I believe 
                I'm rather lively and can get rather .... crazy.&quot; Another 
                self-conscious chuckle escapes her. (A chuckle!) Zing, who's Singaporean, 
                concurs that she's actually a very warm person who just happens 
                to be brutally honest. &quot;She's someone who'd rather risk of 
                fending you than lie to you. Once, she tried to tell a white lie 
                but failed miserable.&quot; </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">It's clear 
                Faye - 'A-Fei' to those close to her - surrounds herself only 
                with people she trusts and who reciprocate her sincerity. So there's 
                little chance of being hurt, misunderstood or misrepresented. 
                For a woman as guileless as a babe-in-the-woods, who says what 
                she thinks and acts on how she feels, the importance of a coterie 
                of confidantes can't be over-emphasised. A quick survey of her 
                recent album sleeves betrays a line-up of usual suspects: Leong, 
                Chan, Zing, composer Zhang Yadong, photographer Cheung Man Wah, 
                image designers Ti Ti Kwan and Thomas Chan, hairstylist Elaine 
                Wong, and, of course, hubby, Dou Wei.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">&quot;If we 
                [she and her collaborators] couldn't get along, then we wouldn't 
                have struck together for so long that we've all become friends. 
                Perhaps people may assume we hold endless meetings to plan an 
                album, but we're actually very easy-going, very relaxed. Our taste 
                and thoughts about music - among other things - tends to be quite 
                similar. That's why there's no real need to talk about it. When 
                Zhang Yadong writes a song for me, I'd almost certainly like it. 
                When I record an album, I never consciously plan a style. I just 
                follow my instincts.&quot;</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">There in lies 
                Faye's problem. Not that her insouciance is a problem, but it's 
                the reason why many critics and fans alike can't figure her out. 
                Artful dodger, master manipulator, sly schemer - Faye's often 
                mistaken for all of the above. Truth is, Faye's a simple Beijing 
                lass with Teresa Teng in her heart and playfulness in her soul. 
                Plying hard to get? More like just playing, period. Never mind 
                that she's a mum, all she wants to do is have some fun. &quot;I 
                love to play. As long as it's a game. I love to play it. Like 
                mahjong - does that count?&quot;</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Her inquisitive, 
                opalescent eyes frequently hold my gaze with equanimity. I even 
                detect a hint of liveliness, but that may be too mcu to ask for. 
                I've known her only a few minutes, and I'm still a reporter.<img

              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Laid-back as 
                she is, it's hardly a surprise that Faye has few words about her 
                new album, entittled <em>Chang You </em>(a clever pun that roughly 
                translates to <em>Songs of Wanderlust</em>). &quot;Convey what 
                kind of message? I've no real message that I wanted to convey. 
                Actually....&quot; she sighs ever so softly, &quot;how do I put 
                this? Whenever I start working on an album, I never have anything 
                concrete to convey. I'm only concerned with producing a good album. 
                If I'm able to have more involvement in the making of an album, 
                that'd be ideal. But at this point, I'm not yet able to record 
                an album that's written entirely by me. Ideally ... when music 
                is purely an interest and not my work, I might be able to do so.&quot;</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">&quot;That's 
                why making music poses me such a conflict. Music is my work. To 
                me, music is essentially not a product. It shouldn't be, but it's 
                become such. Naturally, I feel conflicted. This paradox is difficuly 
                to resolve. Mabe there'll come a time when I'm not signed to any 
                record company and will record albums purely for interest's sake 
                - and with financial security in place - that'll be when I'd be 
                really happy.&quot; she chuckles again, not unaware how unglamorously 
                practical this sounds.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Faye doesn't 
                hide the fact that all she wants in life is to be happy. Not unlike 
                her character in Wong Kar-Wai's <em>Chungking Express </em>who 
                wants to win the affection of a cop played by Tony Leung Chiu 
                Wai and to go to California. Although the singer insists that 
                she's &quot;very afraid of acting&quot;, she was showered with 
                numerous accolades near and far (nominated in Taipei for Best 
                Actress and won in Stockholm) in what was only her second film 
                role, and had many besotted fans confusing the film's Faye with 
                the real Faye. </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt"> I don't know 
                about real overlaping reel. All I know is I'm awestruck when Faye 
                turns and presents me with her right profile, the same right profile 
                <em>Chungking's </em>Faye shows the audience as she hides from 
                Leung on the travellator. Here, sitting not two metres from me, 
                is an iconic movie still soming to life miraculously.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">But the Faye 
                sitting across the table isn't so naive as to believe a sojourn 
                in California - or Paris, the other city she longs to live in 
                - is the be-all and end-all of happiness. Give her some credit: 
                she may be child-like but she's also wiser than her age suggests. 
                </span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">&quot;I don't 
                think I'm easily satisfied, but I hope to be. I feel that human 
                beings are not easy to please. Little things are enought to make 
                me happy and unhappy. Like how can you not be happy becoming a 
                mother and looking at your daughter? But these also come with 
                worries and concerns. Humans are basically paradoxical creatures.&quot;</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">These days, 
                Faye is locked into a lucrative recording deal said to be worth 
                S$10 million (with final artistic say on her output!) in the bag 
                and a lovely daughter to boot. Surely, then, she has found some 
                way to resolve the paradoz of human condition? Doesn't the carefree 
                jollity she expresses in the photos of &quot;Songs' album sleeves 
                mean she's quite happy? She won't be drawn into this directly. 
                &quot;Did you all think Faye Wong doesn't know how to smile? Wouldn't 
                that be horrible?&quot; She giggles amidst our hearty laughter. 
                (A giggle!) I might've struck gold here. The heavens are smiling 
                on me.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">The stylist 
                to my right must be thinking the same thing. Out of the corner 
                of my eyes, I realise he is staring unblinking - and unflinchingly 
                - at the ethereal figure. To quote a pop song, he's lost in her 
                bewitching eyes. Enchanted. Captivated. Spellbound. Later, during 
                dinner, he can't stop raving about how <small><em>bee-ewe-ti-fool</em></small> 
                Faye is, going so far as to claim no photos ca do her justice. 
                Dare I say I concur?</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Forty minutes 
                later, my job's done. &quot;Finished? Thank you, thanks you,&quot; 
                she pipes brightly before bounding out of the room. I imagine 
                she's eager to get back to her playground. Actually, the pleasure's 
                all mine.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">No, Faye, thank 
                you.</span></font></p>

    style="font-size: 9pt">Intro:</span></font></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt"><font face="Verdana">Normally when 
                Faye releases her albums, it</font>抯 <font face="Verdana">the 
                marketing department of her record company that is having headaches, 
                its because she</font>抯 <font face="Verdana">not too enthusiastic 
                about to do many interviews and having photo shoots. At most, 
                will only do a question and answer kind of interview for her company 
                to use as promotion gimmick. Is she co-operating? Is up to one 
                to decide.</font></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt"><font face="Verdana">Even though 
                so, Faye is still a branded name in the music pop scene. Her latest 
                album, </font>慜<font face="Verdana">nly Love Strangers? since 
                its first release, already tops the First Position for 4 continuous 
                weeks in our local best selling chart. Faye is still Faye, we 
                can only have one Faye.</font></span></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Report :</span></font></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt"><font face="Verdana">Last year, 
                September, during my trip to HongKong to have an interview with 
                Faye, it</font>抯 <font face="Verdana">a not bad experience. Her 
                friendly and cheerful and very co-operative attitude makes much 
                bad reports that purposely wanted to frame her all diminish by 
                themselves.</font></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt"><font face="Verdana">The fact is, 
                it</font>抯 <font
    face="Verdana">a matter of sense of respect of relationships between people, 
                if say its other people, maybe he/she will think that this is 
                inevitably in the entertainment line and will give in to their 
                manager</font>抯 <font face="Verdana">demands and requests. But 
                Faye is not other people, Faye is still Faye, what she wants to 
                do, how to love, is really not a business of other people than 
                herself. This is because to the end, she only needs to be responsible 
                for herself.</font></span></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Everyone is 
                also likewise.</span></font></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt"><font face="Verdana">But because 
                its very hard to get full satisfaction, thus have </font>慼<font face="Verdana">ate? 
                for those who finds it</font>抯 <font face="Verdana">hard to differentiate 
                between love and hate will understand.</font></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt"><font face="Verdana">Always know 
                that Faye is afraid of doing interviews, thus this interview, 
                which is under the request of the readers is purely trying our 
                luck. We received Faye</font>抯 <font face="Verdana">tape before 
                she left Hong Kong for Taiwan to help out in the charity shows 
                after the earthquakes in Taiwan. Her replies are easy and relax 
                ,with lots of laughter and her mood is beautiful.</font></span></p>

                sentence, actually it should be said by Dou Ying ( Dou Wei</font>抯 
                <font face="Verdana">sister, one of Faye</font>抯 <font

    face="Verdana">pectacular?this songs is a very personal feeling, this is the 
                only song that I am involved in the making of the song, I only 
                feel that among all my compositions, this song is not the most 
                satisfied, so there</font>抯 <font face="Verdana">not much wrong 
                rite?</font>卙<font face="Verdana">aha?. ! But the songs I dun

              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt"><font face="Verdana">I ?In the album,

    face="Verdana">more than half of the songs are written by Lin Xi, do u especially 
                like his compositions? What reasons in his lyrics that attracts

              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt"><font face="Verdana">Fei ?I have 
                always like Lin Xi</font>抯 <font face="Verdana">lyrics all along, 
                this is because we have been working together for a very long 
                time already, every time I get his lyrics, there</font>抯 <font face="Verdana">always 
                a surprise element. His way of writing at many times is very special, 
                in fact you do not really understand what he is trying to say, 
                but you can feel that feeling and scene that he is trying to mean. 
                I like this kind of method, besides his words are all very unique.</font></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt"><font face="Verdana">I ?In the </font>慚<font

                there</font>抯 <font face="Verdana">your childhood years, when 
                filming this song which consists part of the past memories, do 
                u have any feelings? Do u have ?remembering of the past events?kind 
                of feeling?</font></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt"><font face="Verdana">Fei ?Actually 
                when doing the filming, of course there</font>抯 <font face="Verdana">some 
                ?.for example when doing the somersaults reminds me of my days 
                in physical education lessons. Its not that throughout the filming 
                of the whole Mtv, I am immersed in that past memories, not that 
                serious lah !</font></span></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">I ?Are you 
                one who only looks forward, always walk into the future? Is there 
                any person or thing that will make you stop for a while and look 
                back, think for a while?</span></font></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt"><font face="Verdana">Fei ?I think 
                I cannot control this ?sometimes, I dun think I</font>抦 <font face="Verdana">one 
                who is always looking forward, never turn back person. (Smile) 
                I quite often will turn back and see. I think everyone is also 
                the same, rite? But after looking back, you can only continue 
                to walk forward. Sometimes, stop for a while and look, think for 
                a while, can say its kind of adjusting our mood, one kind of feeling 
                that we need I guess. But no matter what, everyone still needs 
                to continue to walk forward?</font></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt"><font face="Verdana">I ?Recently,

                filming Wong Kar Wai</font>抯 <font face="Verdana">movie, although 
                its been a few years since we work together, but because we have 
                one experience of working together for &quot;ChungKing Express&quot;, 
                I can better understand what he really wants? There</font>抯 <font face="Verdana">more 
                chemistry, and can better understand the situations I guess. Because 
                for the last time, I really totally do not know what is going 
                on. But I feel this may not be what the director wants, maybe 
                what he hopes is I never know what is happening.</font></span></p>

                express that kind of feeling like times are lost. We forever cannot 
                see the past and future of ourselves, if &quot;they&quot; can 
                be together, what is the feeling? This Mtv has many different 
                Faye, main idea is to bring out this concept. Many shots by the 
                director requires calculations and markings to be made beforehand, 
                then later lets the computer to handle with it. Thus, the filming

                as its reasonable and goes with the content, I can accept. Actually, 
                I am a very active person. In the past, there was once I thought 
                of myself as a Cambodian.</span></font></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt"><font face="Verdana">Qn : You once

              <p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Ans : Idols 
                at least have to be a good example, I am only a normal person,

            <p><b>Lyrics by Bjork</b></p>
            <p> If travel is searching<br>
              and home has been found<br>
              i'm not stopping<br>
              i'm going hunting<br>
              i'm the hunter<br>
              i'll bring back the goods<br>
              but i don't know when<br>
              thought i could organise freedom<br>
              how Scandinavian of me<br>
              you sussed it out, didn't you ?<br>
              you could smell it<br>
              so you left me on my own<br>
              to complete the mission<br>
              now i'm leaving it all behind<br>
              i'm going hunting<br>
              i'm the hunter.....<br>
              (you just didn't know me!)<br>
              (you just didn't know me!)</p>

            <p> all the accidents that happen<br>
              follow the dot<br>
              coincidence makes sense<br>
              only with you<br>
              you don't have to speak<br>
              i feel<br>
              emotional landscapes<br>
              they puzzle me<br>
              --then the riddle gets solved and you push me up to this :<br>
              .....state of emergency.....<br>
              .....how beautiful to be!.....<br>
              .....state of emergency.....<br>
              .....is where i want to be.....<br>
              all that no-one sees<br>
              you see<br>
              what's inside of me<br>
              every nerve that hurts you heal<br>
              deep inside of me<br>
              you don't have to speak - i feel<br>
              emotional landscapes<br>
              they puzzle me<br>
              confuse<br>
              --then the riddle gets solved and you push me up to this :<br>

            <p> while you are away<br>
              my heart comes undone<br>
              slowly unravels<br>
              in a ball of yarn<br>
              the devil collects it<br>
              with a grin<br>
              our love<br>
              in a ball of yarn<br>
              he'll never return it<br>
              so when you come back<br>
              we'll have to make new love</p>

            <p>i'm a fountain of blood (my love)<br>
              in the shape of a girl<br>
              you're the bird on the brim (my love)<br>
              hypnotized by the whirl<br>
              drink me - make me real (my love)<br>
              wet your beak in the stream<br>
              the game we're playing is life (my love)<br>
              love is a two way dream<br>
              leave me now - return tonight<br>
              the tide will show you the way<br>
              forget my name go astray<br>
              killer whale trapped in a bay<br>
              (the ocean miles away)<br>
              i'm a path of cinders (my love)<br>
              burning under your feet<br>
              you're the one who walks me (my love)<br>
              i'm your one way street<br>
              i'm a tree that grows hearts (my love)<br>
              one for each that you take<br>
              your the ground i feed on (my love)<br>
              we're circle noone can break<br>
              leave me now - return tonight<br>
              the tide will show you the way<br>
              forget my name go astray<br>
              killer whale trapped in a bay<br>
              (the ocean miles away)<br>
              i'm a whisper in water (my love)<br>
              a secret for you to hear<br>
              you are the one who grows distant (my love)<br>
              when i beckon you near<br>
              life is a necklace of fears (my love)<br>
              your uncried tears on a string<br>
              our love will untie them - come here (my love)<br>

            <p> you think you're denying me of something<br>
              well, i've got plenty<br>
              you're the one who's missing out<br>
              but you won't notice<br>
              until after five years<br>
              if you'll live that long<br>
              you'll wake up<br>
              all love - less<br>
              i dare you<br>
              to take me on<br>
              i dare you<br>
              to show me your palms<br>
              i'm so bored of cowards<br>
              who say what they want<br>
              then they can't handle<br>
              can't handle love<br>
              i dare you<br>
              to take me on<br>
              i dare you<br>
              to show me your palms<br>
              what's so scary ?<br>
              not a threat in sight<br>

              play a joyous tune<br>
              and free the human race from suffering &quot;<br>
              &quot; I'm no fucking Buddhist but this is enlightenment &quot;<br>

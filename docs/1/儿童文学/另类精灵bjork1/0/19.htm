              I've tried a lot and most things excite me.<br>
              But what tops it all is doing two things at a time.<br>

              I'm into trying a lot and most things excite me.<br>
              But what tops it all is doing two things at a time.<br>
              <br>
              Knife and fork<br>
              Tar and feathers<br>

              To watch tv and cuddle<br>
              Creme de la creme<br>
              Is doing two things at a time<br>
              <br>
              to do two things twice at once<br>
              its so nice is there a point?<br>
              ????? not to happen<br>

            <p><b>HAPPY NURSE</b></p>
            <p> After watching this ???? lady<br>
              I noticed that she was a poor nurse<br>
              She knows exactly what people need<br>
              Without them having to tell her<br>
              She's a poor nurse<br>
              She knows what you hunger for<br>
              And feeds it to you<br>
              <br>
              The Nurse was also my friend<br>
              She gave me friendship in abundance<br>
              Smothered me with hugs and kisses<br>
              I've got used to her injection<br>
              And they often send me stupid<br>
              It could become a habit<br>
              She gave me friendship in abundance<br>
              Smothered me with hugs and kisses<br>
              <br>
              She invites me to a soft room<br>
              And hands me a piece of confidence<br>
              She injects me with a dose of warmth<br>
              It dawns upon me that humans are the only drug<br>
              <br>
              She's a poor nurse<br>
              She knows what you hunger for<br>
              And feeds it to you<br>
              <br>
              But then I bought myself a<br>
              Small rubber dingy when she told me<br>
              He who was up a mountain (??)<br>
              Because she wanted everyone<br>
              To give her<br>
              Love and affection<br>
              Her breast was<br>
              Great and soft<br>
              Incredibly great,<br>
              Great and soft<br>
              And could squirt<br>
              A long way!<br>
              A great distance...<br>
              <br>
              She's a poor nurse<br>
              This careless woman<br>
              Don't hate her<br>
              She's a poor nurse<br>
              She knows what you<br>
              Hunger for<br>
              And feeds it to you<br>
              She's a poor nurse<br>
              This careless woman<br>

              Right with you.<br>
              That's where I'm staying,<br>
              Where no-one can find me<br>
              In the depths of the valleys<br>
              Magnificent landscape<br>
              <br>
              Delicious boy,<br>
              With animal eyes,<br>
              Beautiful buttocks,<br>
              Haunting movements.<br>
              But the thing that makes me love you<br>
              Is the unforgettable smell of your skin.<br>

              between the hills!<br>
              There's a cove and there's a ship,<br>
              That goes in and out of the harbour.<br>
              <br>
              The heavy pear,<br>

              Crawl into the canyon<br>
              Into the rain forest<br>
              Crawl up the crevasse<br>
              Jog along the tundra<br>
              Walk up the slope<br>
              Have a breather between the hills<br>
              Admire the view<br>
              Not yet on the peak<br>
              Walk further and rest<br>
              Between two tranquil pools<br>
              Then climb the peak<br>

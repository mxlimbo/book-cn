                And human behaviour<br>
                Be ready to get confused</p>
              <p>There's definitely no logic<br>
                To human behaviour<br>
                But yet so irristible</p>
              <p>There's no map<br>
                To human behaviour</p>
              <p>They're terribly moody<br>
                Then all of a sudden turn happy<br>
                But, oh, to get involved in the exchange<br>
                Of human emotions is ever so satisfying</p>
              <p>There's no map<br>
                And a compass<br>

            <p>It's a hot day<br>
              And I'm dressed lightly<br>
              I move carefully<br>

            <p>Only if a ship would sail in <br>

            <p>Come on girl<br>
              Let's sneak out of this party<br>
              It's getting boring<br>
              There's more to life than this<br>
              It's still early morning<br>
              We could go down to the harbour<br>
              And jump between the boats<br>
              And see the sun come up</p>
            <p>We could nick a boat<br>
              And sneak off to this island<br>
              I could bring my little ghettoblaster<br>
              There's more to life than this<br>
              But then we'd have to rush back<br>
              To the town's best baker<br>
              To get the first bread of the morning<br>
              There's more to life than this</p>

            <p><b>J. Van Heusen/J. Burke</b></p>
            <p>Lately I find myself out gazing at stars<br>
              Hearing guitars like someone in love<br>
              Sometimes the things I do astound me<br>
              Mostly whenever you're around me</p>
            <p>Lately I seem to walk as though I have wings<br>
              And to sing like someone in love<br>
              Each time I look at you I'm light as a cloud<br>
              And feeling like someone in love</p>
            <p>Sometimes the things I do astound me<br>

            <p>Lately I seem to walk as though I have wings<br>
              Run into things like someone in love<br>

              One word on the phone<br>

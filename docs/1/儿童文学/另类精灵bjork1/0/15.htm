            <p>The diesel is so nice I just need something<br>
              The barometer's falling down, I feel so sultry<br>
              Something is simmering and boiling inside me<br>
              If I ignore it and squeeze out laughter<br>
              I charge up with a typhoon, hurricanes and storms</p>
            <p>I just need the diesel<br>
              I just find the smell<br>
              I just sniff it and I can feel the harbour just close by<br>
              I just try to sniff the diesel but I can't</p>
            <p>A tide with an undertow, the sea is swelling<br>
              Impatience makes me foam<br>
              A wave inside me forces out big words<br>
              They splash and sprinkle<br>
              An angry torrent breaking loose, a flush or rushing joy</p>
            <p>The diesel,<br>
              It just makes me feel<br>
              It just fills my veins so quickly<br>
              I don't know why it just does<br>
              I'm down by the harbour<br>
              A cigarette would be ideal<br>
              Then I remember that the diesel...</p>
            <p>And I can't help it, I'm exploding again<br>
              I'm calling weather station NOMAD<br>
              And satellite NIMBUS<br>
              It's a blizzard inside me, a bomb ticking<br>
              This is the tidal wave<br>
              Here comes the tidal wave.</p>

            <p><b>DREAM TV</b></p>
            <p> Last night a good dream woke me up</p>
            <p>I'm a T.V.<br>
              Transforming T.V.</p>
            <p>I was entertained and smiled<br>
              Jumped straight out of my bed<br>
              Humming this and that<br>
              And got myself a glass of water<br>
              And sat down in my favourite chair<br>
              And kept smiling but not for long<br>
              Because I realised that all my dreams are<br>
              Nothing but the repetition<br>
              Of last week's television<br>
              I was no longer amused by my dream.</p>
            <p>I'm on my knees<br>
              Down on all four follows<br>
              Antennae<br>
              Thrust out through my forehead</p>
            <p>Like a lame turtle I paced the room<br>
              This new found knowledge could only blame myself<br>
              And no one else tried to sleep again<br>
              Not a dream, not again<br>
              But then remembered<br>
              That all my dreams are<br>
              Nothing but the repetition<br>
              Of last week's television</p>
            <p>I've turned into a T.V.<br>
              My screen is smiling to get your attention<br>
              I want you</p>
            <p>So I jumped out of my bed<br>
              And into the T.V. room<br>
              And in my anger<br>
              Threw the T.V. set out the window<br>
              Regretted instantly<br>
              Because this was a brand new 26 inch T.V.<br>
              Set in my bed once again,<br>
              Couldn't sleep<br>
              Because all my life,<br>
              All my dreams had gone out the window<br>
              With this new T.V. set</p>
            <p></p>

            <p>When I've been just by myself<br>
              I start thinking too much<br>
              Unhealthy things start to happen<br>
              Like gastric disorders</p>
            <p>I just go out walking<br>
              With my favourite piece of wood<br>
              With a 4 inch nail driven through it</p>
            <p>When I am just by myself<br>
              I think too much<br>
              I start polishing my behaviour<br>
              Without any mercy</p>
            <p>Somehow people<br>
              Don't seem to like me,<br>
              I don't know why,<br>
              I really don't want to hurt them</p>
            <p>When I've been just by myself<br>
              I start thinking too much<br>
              I know I'm not talkative<br>
              What! I've become dry?<br>
              An emotional biscuit<br>
              That's nonsense!<br>
              Sir, this nail of yours is rusty<br>
              It's evil</p>
            <p>I like them but when I hit them<br>
              They scream and run away<br>
              Even though I say I'm sorry.<br>
              I like meeting people.</p>

              Bite an apple<br>
              Suck an oragne<br>

              My friends the alchemists<br>
              Told me everything was natural<br>
              And will always be that way<br>
              And possible to make gold from dirt</p>
            <p>Plastic<br>
              Nylon<br>
              Dear plastic<br>
              Be proud<br>
              Don't imitate anything<br>
              You're pure, pure, pure<br>
              Plastic<br>
              Nylon</p>
            <p>I believed I was their dustbin for knowledge<br>
              Took everything and digested<br>
              Of course I became big and strong<br>
              Today I'm old and withering away<br>
              My friends the alchemists<br>
              Long disappeared into dust<br>
              I no longer get anything fruity<br>
              No longer gold made from dirt<br>
              Now I only get spacefood on a tray</p>

              <b>WATER</b></p>
            <p> Wait for me underneath the water<br>
              Wait for me I have to go now<br>
              Into the big city<br>
              She pulls me firmly towards her<br>
              Wait for me underneath the water<br>
              Wait for me here<br>
              You'll be fine underneath the water<br>
              I'll be back early next summer</p>
            <p>We met again at the lake<br>
              After all these years,<br>
              You said &quot;want a drink?&quot;</p>
            <p>I love you<br>
              And you know I will be back<br>
              Hold your breath<br>
              And nestle into the ice<br>
              Wait for me underneath the water<br>
              Wait for me and count to ten<br>
              You'll look up and I will be there<br>
              Wait for me</p>
            <p>The lake was frozen,<br>
              You took me for a walk over the ice,<br>
              I cracked<br>
              The ice cracked<br>
              I fell into the lake<br>
              I watched you through the eyes</p>
            <p>Love into you<br>
              Wait for me underneath the water<br>
              Wait for me and singalong<br>
              &quot;She's coming, coming, coming&quot;<br>
              Wait for me</p>
            <p>I watched you through the ice<br>
              I expected you to crawl for help<br>
              I smiled, you just stood there<br>
              I tried to kiss you through the ice,<br>
              You just walked away</p>
            <p></p>

            <p> <b>A DAY CALLED ZERO</b></p>
            <p> A day called zero<br>
              Is the day we'll all relax<br>
              Mountains will tumble<br>
              With a long and heavy thump<br>
              Dust spreads on the sky<br>
              So the sun will grow pale<br>
              Oil tanks tear open<br>
              And the city livens up<br>
              A day called zero<br>
              Will be such a busy day<br>
              Whistling marches?<br>
              I'll hoover my past away<br>
              Controlling a bulldozer<br>
              I will improve my town<br>
              Stacking concrete slabs<br>
              Me and you my pluto<br>
              Will you be with me on that day?<br>
              We'll be watching and smiling<br>
              At last it's over<br>
              Nothing stops us now<br>
              Come and enter<br>
              Me let's multiply<br>
              On a day called zero</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><br>
              <b>PLANET</b></p>
            <p> The universe it is so big<br>
              I feel dizzy when I think about it<br>
              My head swims I get giddy<br>
              Still I realize that long ago<br>
              It was so small I could have kept it<br>
              Underneath my little skirt<br>
              At least until the big bang happened</p>
            <p>Every man, every woman</p>
            <p>Sun planet the universe and me<br>
              When I'm excited and have to wait<br>
              My organs start to move, my lungs pump<br>
              Cells flow faster on tracks inside me<br>
              I demand to see myself from within<br>
              Be a cell for a day</p>
            <p>Every man, every woman</p>
            <p>Sun planet the universe and me<br>
              The planets and me we get along so well together<br>
              Gliding down imaginary rollercoaster-paths along the sky<br>
              I can do somersaults around Jupiter if I feel like it<br>
              Nothing can stop a planet<br>
              But a planet can stop anything at all</p>
            <p>Every man, every woman</p>
            <p>Sun planet the universe and me</p>
            <p></p>

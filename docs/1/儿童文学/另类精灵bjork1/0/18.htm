            <p>my punctuality is well known, when the revolution takes place i'll 
              be shot as a traitor. when the sun rises, i will not see, i regret 
              nothing, it was worth it, going through life without a timepiece 
              did pay off. my reward to be free and alone even now at the pillar, 
              blindfold at sunrise, hearing the drums of catalan beating my time 
              away, my heartbeat keeps time with the drums. but soon my only pulse 
              will fade away, i smile just knowing when the sun rises i will not 
              see.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="center"><b>MOTORCRASH</b></p>
            <p>riding on my bicycle i saw a motorcrash, a proper motorcrash and 
              lots of spectators. I rushed to the centre saw the injured parents, 
              cuts on the children, an awful motorcrash. dangerous terribly bloody 
              motorcrash, destructive motorcrash. took the mother, sneaked with 
              her secretly all the way to my home, and nursed her gently put on 
              her bandages, gave her milk and biscuits, she sighed pleasantly 
              after this awful motorcrash. that girl on that bicycle showed great 
              interest in all the motorcrashes in the neighbourhood, she look 
              quite innocent, but believe you me i know what innocence looks like 
              and it wasn't there, after she got that bicycle. then we disguised 
              ourselves, took a taxi to her home, when her husband opened the 
              door she introduced her-self, he said &quot;where have you been 
              all this time?&quot; </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="center"><b>BIRTHDAY</b></p>
            <p>she lives in this house over there, has her world outside it. grapples 
              with the earth with her fingers and her mouth--she's five years 
              old. thread worms on a string, keeps spiders in her pocket, collects 
              fly-wings in a jar scrubs horse flies and pinches them on a line. 
              she's got one friend he lives next door, they listen to the weather, 
              he knows how many freckles she's got, she scratches his beard. she's 
              painting huge books, glues them together, they saw a big raven; 
              it glided down the sky--she touched it. today's a birth-dat--they're 
              sucking cigars, he got a chain of flowers, sows a bird in her knickers, 
              they're sucking cigars, lie in the bathtub, chain of flowers.</p>

            <p align="center"><b>DELICIOUS DEMON</b></p>
            <p>one person calls someone to pour the water, because it takes two 
              to pour the water, to plough takes two as well, but only one to 
              hold up the sky. one plays the harp, beats a rock with a stick, 
              becomes a priest at least, a delicious demon. two men need one money 
              one money needs no man, one is on ones knees, loses ones head, except 
              maybe a delicious demon, then one is no longer, so delicious! </p>
            <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="center"><b>MAMA</b></p>
            <p>i saw a woman walking down my street, with grace so beautifully 
              care-fully. she's a big and pretty mother swinging her handbag back 
              and forth so joyfully she's drawing circles with her breasts in 
              her jumper. give me a big mother, huge and loving one, i can crawl 
              upon a cling to, a large woman, warm and cuddly wet lady, strong 
              mother. she's walking down the street, in front of my window whistling 
              funky tunes in the ears of my neighbours. give me a big mother, 
              one that would always want me. hot embracing mother, i can crawl 
              upon and cling to you can't be safer can't be more secure than with 
              a breast in each palm, thats the way i was born and thats the way 
              i want to die. give me a big mother, soft and wet one, that would 
              caress me in all those special places. where's a strong mother, 
              one that squeezes me, one i can crawl upon and cling to? </p>

            <p align="center"><b>BLUE EYED POP</b></p>
            <p>this blue eyed pop it's just fabulous to go twisting, boogie-ing, 
              in beat with the thousand pound snare sound, after boogieing we 
              all crave for a hot dog splashed with noise, queue and spew then 
              back home to our love nest, need i say more. oh! this blue eye pop 
              is just pure ecstasy. this is too much fun, everyone is so close 
              to laughing, this kind of joy won't last, something wonderful is 
              about to happen. i feel perfectly ready don't know yet what it is, 
              i will look here inside this disco, this is so hot hot, we melt 
              together like tigers and we are dancing together.</p>
            <p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
            <p align="center"><b>DEUS</b></p>
            <p>deus does not exist. but if he does, he lives in the sky above 
              me, in the fattest largest cloud up there. he is whiter than white 
              and cleaner than clean. he wants to reach me. deus does not exist. 
              but if he does i always notice him. getting ready in his airy room. 
              he is picking his gloves so gently off. he wants to touch me. i'm 
              walking humbly down a tiny street. pulling my collar it gets bigger. 
              i once met him. it really surprised me. he put me in a bath tub. 
              made me squeeky clean. really clean. to create a universe you must 
              taste the forbidden fruit. he said hi. i said hi. i was still clean. 
              deus does not exist. but if he does he'd want to get down from that 
              cloud. first marzipan fingers than marble hands. more silent than 
              silence and slower than slow. diving towards me. my collar is huge 
              room for two hands, they start at the chest and move slowly down. 
              i thought i had seen everything. he wasn't white and fluffy. he 
              just had sideburns. he just had sideburns. and a quiff. he said 
              hi. i said hi. i was still clean. i was squeeky clean. i was surprised. 
              just as you would be. deus deus. he does not exist. deus deus. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>SICK FOR TOYS</b></p>
            <p>this girl i know she's sick for toys. she needs a brand new toy 
              she's tired of her old toys. she's got a big house full of old toys 
              what can she do? she disposes of her old toys and in a small garden 
              she finds a small boy. she smiles, she's happy she found her new 
              toy a small boy. she uses the new toy to watch her comb her hair, 
              day in day out, night in night out. in the end she fell asleep exhausted, 
              the boy cut off all of her hair, she was bald, she might not now 
              bee sick for toys... </p>
            <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="center"><b>F***ING INRHYTHM AND SORROW</b></p>
            <p>a divorced lady arrives home from a bar, guess what she sees? there 
              is a naked person in my flat he's got a weird expression on his 
              face! oh my god and jesus as well, what are you doing here, are 
              you hurting your chest, offending yourself, forcing yourself into 
              pain like there is no tommorow? you should use the pain and sorrow 
              to fill you up with power, life's both sweet and sour. he looks 
              at me hopeless with tears in his eyes, goes out of the window and 
              up on the roof. naked man calm down, i'll give you some strawberry

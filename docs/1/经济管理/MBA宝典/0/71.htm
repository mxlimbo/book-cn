                　　Everyone was Korean in Seoul. No one was Korean in Prichard. 
                Motorcycles and mopeds crammed Seoul＇s roads. Trees and flowers 
                lined Prichard＇s streets. In cosmopolitan Seoul, I was a favorite 
                son showered with attention from a large circle of extended family. 
                In suburban Prichard, knowing no one but my parents, I was the 
                only Asian child in the neighborhood. Indeed immigrating to the 
                U.S. from Korea and settling down in a suburb of Mobile as a twelve-year 
                old child dramatically changed my life. Uprooted from the people 
                I knew and the things I was used to, I felt lonely, helpless, 
                and uncomfortable in my new surroundings. However, I redirected 
                the negative feelings into a force of strength that propelled 
                me to excel in academics. Furthermore, the immigrant experience 
                gave me adaptation skills that helped me as a foreign exchange 
                student in Japan and as a businessman working with people of different 
                cultures and backgrounds. <br>
                <br>
                　　Pampered materially and nurtured emotionally in Seoul, I lived 
                with relatives close by and a helping hand available whenever 
                I needed it. My school, while stiflingly competitive and committed 
                to regular doses of corporal punishment, presented a system which 
                I understood and was familiar with. Although the neighborhood 
                lacked open areas, it was a close-kit community where children 
                addressed the lady next door as &quot;aunt&quot; and housewives 
                frequently shared recipes. I was completely at home, ethnically, 
                linguistically, and in every other respect. <br>
                <br>
                　　My new life in Prichard contrasted sharply with my old one in 
                Seoul. The neighborhood, while serene, lacked the extended support 
                network of friends and family I had back home. School frustrated 
                and demoralized me because I had learned only the first fourteen 
                letters of the English alphabet and a few basic words before our 
                arrival. After a fourteen-hour workday in the family restaurant, 
                my exhausted parents were unable to help me. Further compounding 
                my difficulties, I experienced racial bigotry for the first time 
                in my life. Ethnic slurs and insults, which I managed to understand 
                with rapidity, made me painfully aware I was different from others. 
                <br>
                <br>
                　　In the face of these obstacles, I started to question the purpose 
                behind immigrating to the U.S. Seeing my parents＇ exhausted silhouettes 
                seven times a week, I began to understand the motivation behind 
                the move that forever altered my life: a chance at a brighter 
                future in the U.S. Because no one could help us, we had to help 
                ourselves. Armed with this reinvigorating realization, I began 
                to hoist myself out of loneliness, helplessness, and discomfort. 
                <br>
                <br>
                　　Since my school did not offer remedial English classes for immigrant 
                students, I began studying with only the help of an English-Chinese 
                dictionary. Although I was focused and determined, streams of 
                below average grades accompanied my first year in school. Nonetheless, 
                by expending two to three times the effort of others, I started 
                to notice signs of improvement. A well-timed vote of confidence 
                came from my seventh-grade reading instructor, Mr. John Smith. 
                In his class, the highest possible grade —— a B —— was given to 
                only one student per school year. Aiming for that coveted prize, 
                I managed to improve my grades from a D in the first semester 
                to the B in the final semester. At the year-end award ceremony, 
                Mr. Smith specifically commended my achievement in front of the 
                student body. While I received many other academic accolades in 
                later years, no one validated my efforts and boosted my self-confidence 
                more than that short yet significant praise. <br>
                <br>
                　　Although it has been fourteen years since I arrived in Prichard, 
                the immigrant experience has strengthened my character in ways 
                that will be professionally and socially beneficial for years 
                to come. As an immigrant child, I learned how to transition from 
                one culture to another. This skill helped me when I had to make 
                that transition again as a foreign exchange student in Japan. 
                Additionally, having experienced the degradation of ethnic bigotry, 
                I have learned to be sensitive toward different people and cultures.

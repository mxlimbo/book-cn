              <p>（From A Professor） <br>
                <br>
                　　Dear Addimissions Officer: <br>
                <br>
                　　I am writing this letter to support the admission of Wenli Lee 
                to the Harvard Business School. I was Mr. Lee＇s teacher and advisor 
                for several years between 1993 and 1995. We have met and talked 
                several times since. <br>
                <br>
                　　Mr. Lee＇s academic credentials are truly exceptional. He not 
                only knows how to reason with numbers, but how to render incisive 
                and imaginative arguments in English. Unlike most of the students 
                I have taught from China(about 60 over the past 20 years) Lee 
                immersed himself in American culture. He composed a joke as part 
                of his first presentation analyzing a local plan. It worked. His 
                classmates laughed and I was witness to masterful culture spanning. 
                Lee came to us a confident individualist uniquely suited to cultural 
                cross fertilization. He earned straight A grades in all my classes. 
                Whether rendering a spread sheet analysis, crafting a graphic 
                or writing a report, Lee always demonstrated uncanny mastery combined 
                with critical wit. While many of the Chinese I have taught performed 
                excellently in class, Lee alone has composed essays and talks 
                that met the sensibilities and tastes of American classmates. 
                Even more importantly he offered new ideas which they (and myself) 
                could comprehend and even assimilate. <br>
                <br>
                　　Lee has a deep reservoir of talent and ambition. He has already 
                accomplished a great deal in the face of considerable challenge. 
                He has worked hard bridging the cultural gulf separating the Chinese 
                and American ways of life, and produced an impressive record for 
                one who has enjoyed no special privilege. Lee possesses and uses 
                an easygoing manner and spirited conviviality to put people at 
                ease. He can make small talk, but quickly moves conversation toward 
                more challenging and interesting topics. Lee＇s group leadership 
                combines small &quot;d&quot; democracy, intelligent judgment and 
                gentle persistence. He learned early on the painful lessons of 
                coercive collectivism, and has learned how to anticipate and even 
                tame adversarial relations. I have every confidence that he will 
                use these considerable skills to tackle organizational problems 
                on a larger scale. <br>
                <br>
                　　While a student in our graduate program, Lee took a job helping 
                recovering drug addicts in the suburban community of Harvey. Harvey, 
                an aging industrial suburb with an impoverished African American 
                population, does not usually attract the interest and attention 
                of foreign students from Asia. Lee swam against the strong currents 
                of racism and fear associated with minority neighborhoods. Furthermore, 
                he did so in a manner that added value to the community. Lee has 
                labored for the ABC Authority, a large public bureaucracy, and 
                currently works as a private marketing and research firm. This 
                diversity of experience represents a crucial resource for Lee. 
                He does not simply take jobs, but weaves these experiences together 
                into a framework for understanding American institutions from 
                the inside out. Finally, Lee plays with Americans. He does not 
                hide out in Chinatown or the Chinese cultural center. He rock 
                climbs and sails. He can tell hip from hoopla. <br>
                <br>
                　　Lee is smart. But more important he has acquired wisdom in the 
                culture of both China and the U.S. He wants to expand his considerable 
                fund of wisdom and use it to provide cultural scaffolding for 
                commercial ties between the U.S. and China. Lee＇s ambitions and 
                abilities are in sync. He is poised and prepared to take this 
                next step in an exciting journey. Not only will faculty and students 
                thank you for admitting such a fine candidate, but so too will 
                those employees, customers and citizens who will benefit from 
                his future employ. <br>
                <br>
                　　Sincerely, <br>
                <br>

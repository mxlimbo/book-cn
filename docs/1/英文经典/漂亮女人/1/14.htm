              INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> Edward enters the living room. Vivian slowly enters behind <br>
              him. Edward opens the front door. Mr. Kross slowly enters.<br>
              He looks very old and tired; so much so that Edward has to mask<br>
              his surprise.</p>
            <p> KROSS<br>
              Mr. Harris.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              How are you, Mr. Kross.</p>
            <p> KROSS<br>
              Not bad for a man who hasn't<br>
              slept in four nights. I'll get<br>
              used to it.</p>
            <p> An angry, reluctant looking David Kross is behind his father.<br>
              Stuckey brings up the rear. Edward and David give one another<br>
              perfunctory nod. Stuckey smugly winks at Edward. Edward closes<br>
              the door and leads them all down the stairs.</p>
            <p> Vivian is very troubled at Kross's appearance. He gently nods<br>
              at Vivian.</p>
            <p> KROSS<br>
              Young lady.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Hello.<br>
              (to David)<br>
              Hi.</p>
            <p> DAVID<br>
              Hello, Vivian.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Let's not waste time here, shall<br>
              we? Mr. Kross, you said this<br>
              morning, you wished to speak with<br>
              Mr. Harris. Mr. Harris is now<br>
              listening.</p>
            <p> Kross has to fight down his humiliation at Stuckey's tone. He<br>
              turns to Edward.</p>
            <p> KROSS<br>
              Yes. I'm here to tell you that<br>
              I've reconsidered my position on<br>
              your acquisition offer.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Expected... offer.</p>
            <p> KROSS<br>
              Of course, yes. After the<br>
              expected filing period is over,<br>
              I'm going to recommend to the<br>
              board that we accept your bid.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (a moment)<br>
              You're making the right decision,<br>
              sir.</p>
            <p> Stuckey glances triumphantly at Edward. He is surprised to<br>
              see that there doesn't seem to be any victory in Edward's face.<br>
              Edward is silent. Kross interprets his silence as second<br>
              thoughts.</p>
            <p> KROSS<br>
              I'll see you on one condition.<br>
              I'm not so concerned for me but<br>
              the people who have worked for<br>
              me...</p>
            <p> Vivian is disturbed watching this tired looking man.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              (quickly)<br>
              They'll be taken care of. Won't<br>
              they, Edward?</p>
            <p> Kross ignores Stuckey. He looks to Edward. Edward slowly<br>
              nods.</p>
            <p> KROSS<br>
              I'll sign anything you want then.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Today.</p>
            <p> Kross nods tiredly. His voice is very soft.</p>
            <p> KROSS<br>
              Today.</p>
            <p> Vivian abruptly turns and disappears into the bedroom,<br>
              obviously upset. The men all watch her go. Edward hesitates.<br>
              He turns to Kross:</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Excuse me, please?</p>
            <p> He heads to the bedroom.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> Vivian is sitting on the bed, on the phone.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Hello. Is Kit DeLuca there?<br>
              When she comes in will you have<br>
              her call Vivian Wells at 560-30000.<br>
              Yes. Okay.</p>
            <p> She hangs up as Edward comes in.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              What did you do to him?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              What do you mean?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Last time I saw him he was this<br>
              strong guy. Now he's beaten.<br>
              And you liked him.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Vivian, I want you to listen to<br>
              me. The man realized that it<br>
              would be better for his future<br>
              and his son's future, if he<br>
              cooperated.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Right.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              It's not your concern. It's...<br>
              business, that's all.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Business.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Yes. The man made a business<br>
              decision.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              It's all just business to you.<br>
              Him. Me. Your life.<br>
              Everything's business.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              It's what I do for a living.<br>
              It's how I make money.</p>
            <p> Silence.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I'll be back in a few hours.<br>
              We'll talk about this later.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> Edward enters the living room. The men look at him<br>
              expectantly.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              We'll continue this down at the<br>
              office.</p>
            <p> He heads for the door.</p>
            <p> EXT. PENTHOUSE PATIO - DAY</p>
            <p> Vivian stands at the railing, unhappily looking out at the city<br>
              beyond. The phone RINGS. She turns and hurries inside.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> Vivian answers the phone.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Lo?</p>
            <p> INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY - INTERCUT</p>
            <p> Mr. Thomas is standing behind the front desk, a rather strained<br>
              expression on his face.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              Barnard Thomas here. Miss<br>
              Vivian, I wonder if you might come<br>
              down to the front desk. There's<br>
              someone here to see you.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Me?</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              I'd send them up, but sadly, I<br>
              don't trust the young lady to find<br>
              you on her own.</p>
            <p> A hand reaches out and wrenches the phone away from Mr. Thomas.<br>
              Kit, heavy make-up, skimpy outfit, chewing gum, cigarette and<br>
              all, keeps her voice just below a bellow.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              Viv? Where are you, babe?<br>
              (glaring at Mr. Thomas)<br>
              The sphincter-police won't let<br>
              me through.</p>
            <p> INT. HOTEL LOUNGE - DAY</p>
            <p> Kit finishes slurping on a big, frosty ice cream soda. She<br>
              smacks her lips like a happy, little girl. Vivian isn't having<br>
              anything.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Yes, I'm glad you're clean but<br>
              I've been calling and calling.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              Was that you?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Who did you think?</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              Carlos. I still owe him two<br>
              hundred bucks...</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Kit, I left that money for you<br>
              days ago.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              Yeah. I just got it.</p>
            <p> An OLDER COUPLE walk past the table. They stare at Kit.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              Fifty bucks, grampa. For<br>
              seventy-five, the wife can watch.</p>
            <p> Horrified, the elderly couple hurry away.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Kit...</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              Everybody keeps starin' at me.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Yeah... I know what you mean.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              What do you know? You look good.<br>
              All dressed up.<br>
              (meaning it)<br>
              You clean up real nice.<br>
              (giggling)<br>
              You sure don't fit in down on<br>
              the Boulevard, lookin' like you<br>
              do. Not that you ever did anyway.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              You think I fit here where they<br>
              just about chew your food for you?</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              Where do you fit?</p>
            <p> Vivian is silent, then.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (suddenly)<br>
              I kissed him, Kit. On the mouth.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              Honey, you're not supposed to<br>
              do that.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I know. I stopped pretending<br>
              and started liking it with him<br>
              for real.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              Oh, my god, you mean it was good?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (miserably)<br>
              It was great.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              Dummy.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              He wants to set me up in a place,<br>
              give me some money.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              I pray for that.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (nods)<br>
              All I'm doing is feeling lousy<br>
              about it. I don't know what to<br>
              do. What do I do, Kit?</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              Go for the bucks.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I don't care about bucks.<br>
              (a beat)<br>
              I might love this guy.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              Wow, are you in deep shit.<br>
              (a sigh)<br>
              You know he'll break your heart.</p>
            <p> Vivian is silent again.</p>
            <p> KIT (cont'd)<br>
              I blame myself here. First time<br>
              I laid eyes on ya', I knew you<br>
              were too complicated to be a<br>
              whore.</p>
            <p> Vivian nods. Her face is filled with confusion.</p>
            <p> INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> Edward stands at the window looking out. There is something<br>
              about his somber demeanor that both reflects the look we've just<br>
              seen on Vivian and suggests the way we saw him at the top of<br>
              the story.</p>
            <p> Jake enters, a pile of papers under his arm. He begins laying<br>
              them out on the conference table.</p>
            <p> JAKE<br>
              Congratulations, sir.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> JAKE<br>
              Mr. Kross is just getting off<br>
              the phone with his stock broker.<br>
              It's finished. You've won.</p>
            <p> Edward says nothing.</p>
            <p> JAKE<br>
              Who are you going after next, sir?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Who indeed...</p>
            <p> He turns as Stuckey, James and David Kross, and Vance enter<br>
              the room. They surround a conference table. Kross sits, the<br>
              papers laid out in front of him. Stuckey hands Kross a pen.<br>
              A SECRETARY lays out finger food. They wait for her to leave<br>
              before they speak.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              If we can get these letters of<br>
              intent out of the way now... Mr.<br>
              Harris and I would like to ask<br>
              you some questions about your<br>
              company.</p>
            <p> DAVID<br>
              Dad, excuse me, but that's<br>
              inappropriate. You're under no<br>
              obligation to answer any questions<br>
              at all.</p>
            <p> KROSS<br>
              Could we at least wait till after<br>
              the filing period?</p>
            <p> Stuckey glances to Edward for help. Edward is silent; indeed<br>
              it's as if something is twisting inside of him. Stuckey plunges<br>
              ahead.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Mr. Harris is preparing a bid<br>
              based on our speculation of the<br>
              corporation's net worth. The<br>
              price he ultimately pays for your<br>
              father's stock will be based on<br>
              that bid. The more we know, the<br>
              higher our bid can be.</p>
            <p> KROSS<br>
              It's in my best interest to<br>
              cooperate, David.</p>
            <p> DAVID<br>
              If he throws himself on your<br>
              sword, you promise to take care<br>
              of him and his family, huh?</p>
            <p> David stares at him.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              That's unfair!</p>
            <p> DAVID<br>
              You bed it is.<br>
              (to Edward)<br>
              You're everything he said you<br>
              were.<br>
              (to his father)<br>
              Do what you have to do, Dad.<br>
              Just don't expect me to watch it.</p>
            <p> He exits. A moment. Kross looks at Edward with a resigned<br>
              smile.</p>
            <p> KROSS<br>
              He's young. He hasn't learned<br>
              how to lose gracefully yet. I'll<br>
              sign your papers. And I'll answer<br>
              your questions. Whatever you<br>
              want.</p>
            <p> He sighs. He picks up the pen. He's about to sign.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Stop. For just a moment.<br>
              (a moment)<br>
              Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you<br>
              a few questions before you sign.<br>
              You realize that you're a target.<br>
              If you weren't mine, you'd be<br>
              someone elses, correct?</p>
            <p> KROSS<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              If you had a... reprieve, what<br>
              would do?</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              (quickly)<br>
              I don't think there's any sense<br>
              in --</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Let him answer.</p>
            <p> KROSS<br>
              I... I would take advantage of<br>
              it.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              How?</p>
            <p> Kross looks uncertain. He gropes for an answer.</p>
            <p> KROSS<br>
              I... I don't know. There...<br>
              there wasn't time...</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I suppose you'd find out soon<br>
              enough that you have assets you<br>
              presently don't seem aware of,<br>
              wouldn't you? The waste<br>
              processing licenses at that<br>
              abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd<br>
              certainly find out about that.</p>
            <p> Surprise suddenly flares in Stuckey's eyes.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Oh, my god... Edward, no!</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I suppose you'd use them as<br>
              collateral on new loans, wouldn't<br>
              you?</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Have you lost your mind?</p>
            <p> KROSS<br>
              (to Stuckey)<br>
              Quiet.<br>
              (to Edward)<br>
              Would I get the loans?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              This time I imagine you would,<br>
              yes.<br>
              (as if thinking about it)<br>
              Hmm...<br>
              (a moment)<br>
              With all this in mind, Mr. Kross,<br>
              I can't logically make a formal<br>
              bid on your company, can I?</p>
            <p> KROSS<br>
              (a small smile)<br>
              You'd be initiating a financial<br>
              battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr.<br>
              Harris.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              You're very right. I think the<br>
              best thing we could all do is go<br>
              home.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              What!?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Have a good day, gentlemen.</p>
            <p> He exits from the room. Stuckey follows.</p>

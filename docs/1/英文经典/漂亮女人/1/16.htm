              EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - DAY</p>
            <p> A long silver limo drives down Hollywood Blvd.</p>
            <p> INT. LIMO - DAY</p>
            <p> The LIMO DRIVER pushes the button that rolls down the screen<br>
              between back and front seats.</p>
            <p> DRIVER<br>
              You're sure this is the right<br>
              street, ma'am?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Yes. 1312. It's a big apartment<br>
              building.</p>
            <p> EXT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY</p>
            <p> The limo pulls to a stop in front of a rundown apartment<br>
              building on a dirty Hollywood side street. The Limo Driver,<br>
              a large Latino man, steps out of the car and walks around to<br>
              the passenger door. As he does, he surveys the surroundings<br>
              uncomfortably. Ths is rough neighborhood. He opens the door.<br>
              Vivian steps out.</p>
            <p> LIMO DRIVER<br>
              Maybe I should go with you. This<br>
              doesn't look like a good place<br>
              for a lady to be alone.</p>
            <p> Several PEOPLE pass. All of them stare at the car, at the<br>
              driver, at Vivian in her lovely clothes.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I'll be okay. I'm home. Thank<br>
              you.</p>
            <p> The driver, confused, watches her hurry up the steps to the<br>
              apartment building. He drives off.</p>
            <p> INT. APARTMENT LOBBY - DAY</p>
            <p> Vivian walks toward her apartment. The Landlord is sitting<br>
              at the front desk in a dirty undershirt.</p>
            <p> LANDLORD<br>
              Hey, we announce guests here.<br>
              You a relative of somebody?</p>
            <p> Vivian lowers her sunglasses.</p>
            <p> LANDLORD (cont'd)<br>
              Viv -- is that you?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Yeah, it's me.</p>
            <p> She keeps walking.</p>
            <p> LANDLORD<br>
              You lookin' good, Viv'. Nice<br>
              threads. I gotta find time to<br>
              shop.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE - DAY</p>
            <p> Edward stands at the penthouse window, looking out. He is<br>
              dressed now, ready for travel. There is something about his<br>
              expression, his somber demeanor that suggests the way we saw<br>
              him at the very top of the story. A BELLMAN enters from the<br>
              bedroom, rolling a luggage loaded dolly along in front of him.</p>
            <p> BELLMAN<br>
              Is that everything, sir?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (turning from the<br>
              window)<br>
              That's everything.</p>
            <p> The Bellman exits, closing the door behind him. The phone<br>
              rings. Edward crosses to it, picks it up. The Maid comes in,<br>
              looks around.</p>
            <p> MAID<br>
              The lady, she go?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Yes. She go.</p>
            <p> INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY</p>
            <p> Edward with the Bellhop heads to the front door. He's leaving.</p>
            <p> BELLHOP<br>
              Do you have a car taking you to<br>
              the airport, sir?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> INT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> Vivian, looking fresh scrubbed without make-up, is wearing<br>
              clean jeans, a nice looking shirt and a suit jacket. Her<br>
              bureau's are open. She is packing. Kit is watching. She takes<br>
              the photo of her and Kit dressed up hot in hooker clothes and<br>
              packs it.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              So whatta' you going to do in<br>
              San Francisco?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Get a job and probably go back<br>
              to school. Figure out what I'm<br>
              gonna be.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              What kind of school?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              School, school. Regular. I used<br>
              to get pretty good grades in<br>
              school, you know.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              So did I. I made it with the<br>
              principal.<br>
              (recites)<br>
              Study hard And get a &quot;B.&quot; Lift<br>
              your dress and an &quot;A&quot; you'll see.</p>
            <p> They both laugh but too hard.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Want a pair of boots?</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              Do I!? Momma!</p>
            <p> Taking them, she sits on the bed and puts them on.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              You sure you won't come with me?</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              And leave all this? Not in a<br>
              million.</p>
            <p> They laugh together.</p>
            <p> KIT (cont'd)<br>
              What time's your bus?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Couple a hours.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              Yeah. Well... I gotta split.<br>
              Goodbye's make me crazy.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Cool your jets a second.<br>
              (going to her purse)<br>
              Here's some money.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              No. You took care of rent,<br>
              that's enough.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I want to. For food, got it?<br>
              Eat something before the wind<br>
              blows you away.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              I'm gonna pay you back next time<br>
              I see ya, babe. Just wait, I'm<br>
              gonna do something real nice for<br>
              you some day.</p>
            <p> They hug.</p>
            <p> KIT (cont'd)<br>
              Shit, I'm gettin' all weepy now.</p>
            <p> Kit begins backing out of the room.</p>
            <p> KIT (cont'd)<br>
              Take care of you, okay? Take<br>
              care of you. Love ya...</p>
            <p> Kit turns and hurries out of the apartment.</p>
            <p> EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - DAY</p>
            <p> Kit enters the falafel stand on Hollywood Boulevard.</p>
            <p> INT. FALAFEL STAND - DAY</p>
            <p> Kit enters, sits at the counter.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              Coffee, Chan. And maybe a<br>
              grilled cheese on white, okay?</p>
            <p> A very young GIRL is sitting just down the counter from Kit.<br>
              Kit nods at her.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              Hey, how you doin'. You new,<br>
              huh?</p>
            <p> GIRL<br>
              Yeah. Got a cigarette?</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              Sure.</p>
            <p> She passes the girl down the pack. She strikes a match, lights<br>
              her cigarette for her. The girl inhales deep, lets it out with<br>
              a sigh. She looks towards the window.</p>
            <p> GIRL<br>
              Jeez, did the wacko in the suit.</p>
            <p> Kit turns to look.</p>
            <p> KIT'S P.O.V. - HOLLYWOOD BLVD.</p>
            <p> Outside, across the street, Edward has accosted two <br>
              PROSTITUTES; one blonde, one a red haired black one.</p>
            <p> INT. FALAFEL STAND - DAY - BACK TO SCENE</p>
            <p> Kit rises.</p>
            <p> KIT<br>
              Chan? Keep the sandwich warm,<br>
              I'll be back.</p>
            <p> She heads out the door.</p>
            <p> EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - DAY</p>
            <p> Edward is still talking to the prostitutes.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I'm looking for a girl, Vivian,<br>
              young, dark hair, big eyes...?</p>
            <p> They shake their heads.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              She's mouthy. Sort of<br>
              difficult...?</p>
            <p> PROSTITUTE 1<br>
              Ain't seen her, wouldn't know<br>
              her.</p>
            <p> PROSTITUTE 2<br>
              What's wrong with us, man? Two<br>
              for the price a one, what ya say?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (disappointed)<br>
              Thank you. No.</p>
            <p> They turn and walk away. Edward stands there, not knowing <br>
              what to do next. He looks discouraged and lost.</p>
            <p> KIT (O.S.)<br>
              Edward Harris, as I live and<br>
              breathe!</p>
            <p> Edward quickly turns to find Kit staring at him. Kit smiles,<br>
              triumphantly.</p>
            <p> KIT (cont'd)<br>
              Yeah. Boy, you're just like she<br>
              said.</p>
            <p> She turns and starts away. She stops, turns back.</p>
            <p> KIT (cont'd)<br>
              You comin' or not? I don't got<br>
              all day, I got a grilled cheese<br>
              waitin'.</p>
            <p> Edward follows Kit.</p>
            <p> INT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY</p>
            <p> Vivian sits on her bed, lost in thought. Her bags are packed,<br>
              ready to go. With a sigh she rises. She picks up the bags,<br>
              exits the room.</p>
            <p> Vivian stands in the dreary living room, looking at it, taking<br>
              it all in for the last time. She suddenly looks more than a<br>
              little bit frightened to be leaving. She musters resolve. She<br>
              goes to the door, opens it and exits, closing it behind her.<br>
              Silence. Vivian suddenly comes back in. She puts down her<br>
              bags. She crosses to the kitchen where she takes coffee<br>
              can/piggy bank from the shelf. She puts some more bills into<br>
              it, places it back where Kit will find it.</p>
            <p> She turns and starts again for the door.</p>
            <p> She stops. She hears something. MUSIC. An aria from La<br>
              Boheme. Faint. Seemingly coming from nowhere. She dismisses<br>
              it -- she's hearing things. She opens the door. Stops. The<br>
              music is louder and getting louder now -- it's not her<br>
              imagination. She hurries over to the window.</p>
            <p> EXT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY</p>
            <p> Vivian comes out onto the fire escape. She stares in wonder.</p>
            <p> A snow white limo comes up the street. A necktie has been tied<br>
              to the antennae like a knight's token. The MUSIC from La Boheme<br>
              is BLARING from the car's stereo. Edward is standing on the<br>
              car's seat, his head and body up through the open sunroof. The<br>
              wind blows at his hair. He is smiling.</p>
            <p> Everywhere on the street people are staring; the BUMS, the<br>
              PUSHERS, the PASSERBY'S, the TOURISTS.</p>
            <p> Vivian doesn't know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
            <p> The car comes to a stop in front of the Vivian's building.<br>
              Vivian's landlord comes out the front door. His eyes go wide <br>
              in disbelief.</p>
            <p> Edward disembarks from the limo by coming up through the<br>
              sunroof. He leaps nimbly to the ground. He crosses to the entrance 
              <br>
              of the alleyway, looking up at Vivian on the fire escape.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              You are really lost this time.</p>
            <p> Edward wordlessly holds up a hand for her.</p>
            <p> With a sudden cry of joy, Vivian comes down the fire escape.<br>
              She stops at the bottom stair. Edward comes forward and sweeps<br>
              her into his arms. They kiss.</p>
            <p> He carries her to the limo as if she's weightless. Her feet<br>
              never touch the ground.</p>
            <p> The car door closes behind them. The limo drives away.</p>
            <p> The people of the street watch it go.</p>

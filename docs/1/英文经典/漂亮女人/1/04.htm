            <p><br>
              EDWARD<br>
              It's a very good year.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Oooh, thank god.</p>
            <p> Edward laughs softly. She sips it. To her surprise, really<br>
              likes it. Edward lifts a lid on a silver bowl to reveal a dozen<br>
              enormous strawberries.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Try a strawberry.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Why?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Because they bring out the flavor<br>
              of the champagne.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Jesus, you act like you're<br>
              seducing some Valley girl you<br>
              picked up in a dance club.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Vivian... the meter's running...<br>
              cooperate.</p>
            <p> A moment. She slowly eats a strawberry. The juice of it stains<br>
              her lips. Her eyes are like smoke as she takes a sensuous sip<br>
              of champagne, licks away the stain of the strawberry. His eyes<br>
              haven't left her.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (softly)<br>
              You really are a very beautiful<br>
              girl.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (husky-voiced)<br>
              Just a romantic, that's you.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Yes...</p>
            <p> Her mouth is so wet and inviting... he leans closer...</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Me too.</p>
            <p> He's about to kiss her...</p>
            <p> VIVIAN (cont'd)<br>
              Not on the lips.</p>
            <p> He freezes. She pulls his head down to her breast.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Edward and Vivian on the bed. He is on his back, his shoulder<br>
              and head resting against the headboard. She is astride him,<br>
              hands resting on his chest, rocking... in control, confident...<br>
              very much liking the fire she's kindled in his eyes.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - CLOSE ANGLE ON THEIR FACES - NIGHT</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (touching her breasts)<br>
              What do you like?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              If I want you to turn me on I'll<br>
              pay you three hundred. Just lay<br>
              back and let me drive.</p>
            <p> Smiling, Vivian reaches behind her, touching him. He tries not<br>
              to groan. She's moving faster now. Edward suddenly pulls her<br>
              violently to him, he rolls her over...</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - SHOWER - NIGHT</p>
            <p> A heavy spray of water comes down upon Edward. He stands there<br>
              quietly letting it wash over him. He turns off the shower,<br>
              steps out of the stall, picks up a towel and dries himself.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Edward stares. His expensive clothes are on the floor,<br>
              haphazardly dropped everywhere. Vivian's clothes, as tattered<br>
              as they are, are neatly folded and piled on a chair. The<br>
              incongruity of it touches Edward in a sad way. He looks toward<br>
              the bed. Vivian is fast asleep. Her heavy makeup has long since<br>
              been rubbed off. Asleep, her wary, smart-ass attitude is gone.</p>
            <p> She looks like a sweet, gentle girl. He stares at her a moment<br>
              longer. He turns, goes into the living room. Vivian opens her<br>
              eyes. Through the open door she sees Edward sitting in a living<br>
              room chair. He is reading contracts.</p>
            <p> EXT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - MORNING</p>
            <p> The sun is coming up as HOTEL EMPLOYEE hoses down the sidewalk 
              in front of the hotel.</p>
            <p> INT. HOTEL LOBBY - MORNING</p>
            <p> A WOMAN EMPLOYEE is vacuuming the lobby. She sees something and 
              pauses. She pulls a dead leaf from one of the potted<br>
              plants.</p>
            <p> INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - MORNING</p>
            <p> The elevator doors open and A WAITER rolls a cart out into the<br>
              hallway. He takes it to the doors of the penthouse. He rings<br>
              the bell.</p>
            <p> EDWARD (O.S.)<br>
              It's open.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - MORNING</p>
            <p> The Waiter wheels in a table of food, coffee, champagne and<br>
              orange juice. Edward dressed in suit pants, white shirt and<br>
              suspenders, stands in the living room talking into a cordless<br>
              phone. Edward points the Waiter to the dining table.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (into the phone)<br>
              Sorry. Go ahead.</p>
            <p> INT. STUCKEY'S HOUSE - MORNING - INTERCUT</p>
            <p> William Stuckey is behind his desk.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Kross knows we're after his<br>
              company. He wants to talk with<br>
              you. I don't think you should.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - MORNING</p>
            <p> The Waiter returns. Edward signs the bill. The Waiter exits.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I want to.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Edward, if the three of us sit<br>
              down together we might as well<br>
              announce our plans in the Wall<br>
              Street Journal.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I'll see him alone. Everyone<br>
              knows you're my muscle. We'll<br>
              make it social. Tell Kross I'll<br>
              meet him for dinner. Tonight if<br>
              you can arrange it.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              You shouldn't go alone. He might<br>
              claim that you tried to black mail<br>
              him.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Bill, we're businessmen, not the<br>
              damn mafia. I'll see you in the<br>
              office. By the way, about your<br>
              car...</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Oh, god, what?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (smiling)<br>
              I'll bring it back.</p>
            <p> Edward hangs up. He pours a glass of orange juice and takes<br>
              a sip, thinking. Something makes him turn. Vivian, wearing<br>
              a monogrammed hotel terry robe, is standing uncertainly in the<br>
              bedroom doorway.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Good morning.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              You didn't wake me. I'll be out<br>
              of here in a minute.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              No hurry. Would you like some<br>
              breakfast?</p>
            <p> She's hungry and the breakfast looks great.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Only if you do.</p>
            <p> Edward sits. Waits. Vivian sits across from him. Edward<br>
              serves them breakfast.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Did you sleep well?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Yeah. Too good. I forgot where I was.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Occupational hazard?</p>
            <p> She looks at him sharply, sees that he means no offense,<br>
              relaxes.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Where'd you go?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I took the couch. I had some work to do.<br>
              (hesitating)<br>
              About last night...</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Oooh, Baby, you were the best.<br>
              I was beside myself.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Mmm, I could tell.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I just hope it was worth three<br>
              hundred bucks.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I'd say you give a good dollar<br>
              value.</p>
            <p> They share a small smile. They eat.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Do you ever... enjoy it?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I like guys if that's what you're<br>
              asking. Not that I trust'm.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              No? Why's that?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              &quot;Occupational hazard&quot;.</p>
            <p> A moment. Edward chuckles. Vivian grins.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN (cont'd)<br>
              what do you do anyway?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I buy companies.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              No shit. They expensive?</p>
            <p> He almost smiles. She almost smiles back.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              The one I'm buying this week will<br>
              cost around 150 million.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              ... dollars?</p>
            <p> He nods. This time Vivian is impressed.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN (cont'd)<br>
              You are major league, baby. Your<br>
              mother must be very proud.</p>
            <p> Edward is oddly pleased at her reaction.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> The closet door is open. Edward reaches for a tie. In the<br>
              closet are about a dozen expensive looking suits, shirts, shoes,<br>
              ext. She follows him in.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              So what a ya do with the companies<br>
              once you buy'm?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (fumbling with the tie)<br>
              I sell them.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              What? Why?</p>
            <p> She undoes his knot and starts over.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN (cont'd)<br>
              At ease, let me do that. Part<br>
              of the all night services.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              By breaking up a company's assets<br>
              --</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              What are assets?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Vivian --</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              C'mon, I might buy a company some<br>
              day.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Assets are anything of value a<br>
              company owns. Sometimes the<br>
              pieces are worth more than the<br>
              whole. By selling them off, I<br>
              make a profit.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Sorta like stealing cars and<br>
              selling'm for parts, huh?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Not... quite.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              There, see? Now the emblem is<br>
              right in the middle of the knot.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Where'd you learn to do this?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (sarcastic)<br>
              I fucked the debate team in high<br>
              school. Tsk. I had a grampa.<br>
              He liked ties on Sundays. You<br>
              mind if I take a swim in your<br>
              bathtub before I hit it?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Don't drown.</p>
            <p> Vivian turns and heads toward the bathroom. He follows her<br>
              into the bathroom.</p>

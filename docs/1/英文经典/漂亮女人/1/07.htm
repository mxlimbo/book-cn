              INT. STUCKEY'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON - INTERCUT</p>
            <p> Edward is in a private office.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Never answer the phone. Ever.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Tsk, believe me, this will be the<br>
              last time.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Did you buy some clothes?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I got a dress, yeah.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Just one? Christ... I hope it's<br>
              appropriate.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              It's very tasteful. I think<br>
              you'll especially like the zipper<br>
              in the crotch.<br>
              (silence)<br>
              I'm -- joking.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Let's hope so. You'll get some<br>
              more clothes tomorrow. I'll be<br>
              pushed for time so meet me in the<br>
              hotel lobby at seven forty-five<br>
              sharp. Got it?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              No, I don't &quot;got it&quot;. Even the<br>
              farmboys back in Georgia come to<br>
              the door when they're taking you<br>
              on a date.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              This isn't a date.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Go by yourself then. Where you<br>
              taking me anyway?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              The Rex.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Any good?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I think you'll approve.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              ... all right. I'll meet you in<br>
              the lobby. But only cause you're<br>
              paying me to.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Thank you very much.</p>
            <p> Vivian slowly sets the phone down. The phone rings again.<br>
              Vivian, very carefully, punches the flashing 
              button and picks<br>
              it up.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Hello?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I thought I told you not to answer<br>
              the phone.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Oooh!</p>
            <p> Edward hangs up. He smiles to himself.</p>
            <p> Vivian bites her fingernails, looking nervous. The doorbell<br>
              RINGS. Vivian looks up, startled. She rises, moves to answer<br>
              it.</p>
            <p> It's the Spanish MAID. She nods politely at Vivian.</p>
            <p> MAID<br>
              Housekeeping. I come to turn<br>
              down the bed. 5:00, I turn down<br>
              the bed.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> The Maid points to her hotel badge, trying to explain.</p>
            <p> MAID<br>
              Housekeeping. I come to turn<br>
              down the bed.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Okay.</p>
            <p> The Maid enters.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Is there a trick to it?</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
            <p> The Maid turns down the bedspread.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Is that all? You just fold back<br>
              the bedspread?</p>
            <p> MAID<br>
              I also place las chocolates on<br>
              the pillow.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Oooh, I love those.</p>
            <p> MAID<br>
              I leave extras, miss.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Thanks! Consuelo, are all rich<br>
              people so lazy they can't do this<br>
              on their own?</p>
            <p> Consuelo shrugs.</p>
            <p> INT. HOTEL LOBBY - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
            <p> Mr. Thomas is still behind the desk, working when a soft voice<br>
              startles him.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Barney.</p>
            <p> He looks up. He sighs. Vivian still hasn't changed.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              What is it, Miss Vivian?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Edward is taking me to some fancy<br>
              place for dinner. The Rex. Ever<br>
              been there?</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              It's a bit beyond my... range,<br>
              shall we say.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Yeah, mine too. Is it like,<br>
              y'know, normal?</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              I think you'll find it normal<br>
              enough.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Will I like it?</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              You'll like it fine.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Okay. Thanks, Barney. You're<br>
              the best.</p>
            <p> She turns away.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              Just mind which fork you use.</p>
            <p> Vivian turns abruptly back, a horrified look on her face.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Fork?</p>
            <p> INT. HOTEL DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
            <p> CLOSE ANGLE - PLACESETTING</p>
            <p> An elegant formal placesetting complete with a myriad of<br>
              different size forks, spoons, stacked china plates and crystal<br>
              glassware.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON MR. THOMAS AND VIVIAN</p>
            <p> sit across from one another at a fully set table.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              In fifteen minutes I can teach<br>
              you everything you need to know<br>
              to dine with the Queen. First,<br>
              as you pick up the knife you shift<br>
              your fork to the left hand.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              But I always eat like this.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              Either you're European or badly<br>
              brought up.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Hmmm... I vonder vich.<br>
              (giggles)</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              Actually, some of the richest<br>
              people I know have the worst<br>
              manners. Of course, Mr. Harris,<br>
              being of old money, knows his way<br>
              around a table. All right now,<br>
              pay attention please. Salad fork.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              What if they serve soup?</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              They will serve salad.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              But what if they serve soup?</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              Then you use your soup spoon.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (smiles)<br>
              I like steak.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              (picking up the<br>
              appropriate utensil)<br>
              Then you would use your--</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Steak spoon!<br>
              (laughs)</p>
            <p> Mr. Thomas swallows his exasperation.</p>
            <p> WE PULL BACK from their table to reveal the cavernous, empty<br>
              banquets room, each table is set and ready for the dinner<br>
              service.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              Miss Vivian --</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Maybe I'll just order a burger,<br>
              Barney, that way I can eat with<br>
              my hands.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              Miss Vivian... there's a salon<br>
              here in the hotel. Instead of<br>
              worrying unnecessarily about table<br>
              manners, why don't you just have<br>
              your hair done instead?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Professionally?</p>
            <p> INT. SALON - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
            <p> Vivian sits in a salon chair. The last customer, THANE, a<br>
              young man of about twenty with his long hair pulled back in a<br>
              pony tail, tilts her head one way and then another, eyeing her<br>
              professionally.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I have a friend who has a friend<br>
              who does Cher's wigs.</p>
            <p> THANE<br>
              I hate him already.<br>
              (a beat)<br>
              All set?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Yeah... what a ya say we chop<br>
              it all off and bleach the tips.</p>
            <p> THANE<br>
              Darling? Trust me.</p>
            <p> INT. HOTEL LOBBY - EVENING</p>
            <p> Edward enters and looks around the lobby. No Vivian. Annoyed.<br>
              Edward crosses to a house phone and picks it up. He's about<br>
              to dial when:</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              Good evening, Mr. Harris.</p>
            <p> Edward looks at him blankly.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              Barnard Thomas, manager of the<br>
              hotel.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Of course, yes. If you'll excuse<br>
              me just a moment --</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              I have a message for you from your<br>
              &quot;niece&quot;, sir.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              My what?</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              The young lady staying in your room?</p>
            <p> Edward's eyes narrow. He hangs up the phone.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I think we both know she's not<br>
              my niece.</p>
            <p> Mr. Thomas looks uncomfortable.</p>
            <p> EDWARD (cont'd)<br>
              Does this hotel have any problem<br>
              with that?</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is<br>
              a guest of ours and shall be<br>
              treated accordingly. The young<br>
              lady asked me to tell you that<br>
              she is waiting for you in the<br>
              lounge.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p> He starts towards the lounge.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              Very intriguing young woman, Miss<br>
              Vivian.</p>
            <p> His tone stops Edward in his tracks.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS (cont'd)<br>
              Have a good evening, sir.</p>
            <p> And off he goes, leaving Edward to wonder what the hell<br>
              transpired during the afternoon.</p>
            <p> INT. HOTEL LOUNGE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Edward enters the lounge. He looks around, not seeing Vivian.<br>
              And suddenly his eyes go back to... the beautiful girl with the<br>
              beautifully styled hair in the beautiful black cocktail dress<br>
              at the piano bar. Edward tries to hide his surprise as Vivian<br>
              rises, moves elegantly towards him. She smiles.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              You're late.</p>
            <p> Such a beautiful woman deserves an apology and so, without<br>
              thinking:</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I'm sorry.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              You're forgiven.</p>
            <p> She waits expectantly. He holds out an arm. She takes it.</p>

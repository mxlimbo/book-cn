              INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING</p>
            <p> Vivian is asleep. She turns over, slowly waking. Her hand <br>
              goes out to touch Edward and encounters nothing but empty bed.<br>
              Vivian comes awake with a sudden start. She look around<br>
              momentarily frightened, not sure where she is. Sighing with<br>
              relief, she lies back down. She sees Edward's American Express<br>
              card on the pillow next to her.</p>
            <p> EDWARD (O.S.)<br>
              Wake up, Vivian. Time to shop.</p>
            <p> Edward comes out of the bathroom and moves toward the bed.<br>
              He is tying his tie. Vivian sits up and ties it for him. He<br>
              smiles at her.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I still don't understand why you<br>
              only bought one dress.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I wasn't as much fun as I<br>
              thought it was going to be.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Why not?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Well, you know those cold bitches<br>
              that work in those stores and try<br>
              to intimidate you? It works.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Was someone rude to you?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I had a little problem in one<br>
              store. I wasn't dressed right.<br>
              I don't know what to say. I don't<br>
              belong there. Maybe I'll just<br>
              go back to Bridget. She was cool.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Vivian, you belong wherever you<br>
              are. I don't care how you were<br>
              dressed, they were the ones who<br>
              were wrong, not you.</p>
            <p> Edward sits on the bed.</p>
            <p> EDWARD (cont'd)<br>
              People aren't going to respect<br>
              you unless you respect yourself.<br>
              (a beat)<br>
              The next time someone is rude to<br>
              you, you stare at them right here.</p>
            <p> He softly touches her, right between the eyes.</p>
            <p> EDWARD (cont'd)<br>
              It's an old trick I use,<br>
              especially with bankers. Works<br>
              every time. Will you try it?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (confidently)<br>
              Okay.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Good.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (a beat)<br>
              Come with me?</p>
            <p> Edward looks at his watch. Vivian covers it with her hand.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Please.</p>
            <p> INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY</p>
            <p> A beautiful, chic women's shop. The haughty SALESGIRL<br>
              approaches Vivian near a rack of dresses. Edward hovers in the<br>
              b.g.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (nervous)<br>
              Hello. Can you help me?</p>
            <p> The Salesgirl looks Vivian up and down. A Pause. Vivian gives<br>
              her &quot;the stare&quot; and straightens up. We see the Salesgirl's<br>
              reaction change.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (confidently)<br>
              I'm looking for a dress, nothing<br>
              too flashy, not too sexy,<br>
              conservative. In a size six.</p>
            <p> SALESGIRL<br>
              (uncomfortable under<br>
              Vivian's stare)<br>
              Do... do you have a charge<br>
              account with us?</p>
            <p> Vivian smiles and draws out Edward's American Express card.<br>
              The Salesgirl nods and quickly moves to a rack of dresses to<br>
              find Vivian's size.</p>
            <p> INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY - IN A SERIES OF CUTS</p>
            <p> Vivian tries on different clothes under Edward and the<br>
              Salesgirl's supervision.</p>
            <p> Vivian comes happily out of the dressing room wearing a low<br>
              cut, spangled and fringed outfit. Edward shakes his hand. The<br>
              Salesgirl holds a classic tweed ensemble over Vivian's outfit.<br>
              Vivian scowls.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (sighing)<br>
              I look like fucking Nancy Reagan.</p>
            <p> INT. BOUTIQUE - ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
            <p> The Salesgirl shows Edward clothes by Ann Taylor. He turns <br>
              to find Vivian happily holding up a tiny, low cut leather dress.<br>
              Edward shakes his head in mock disapproval. Vivian scowls.</p>
            <p> INT. BOUTIQUE - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATER</p>
            <p> Vivian is wearing an elegant pastel dress. Edward is standing<br>
              at the store's bar, watching and talking on the telephone.</p>
            <p> INT. STUCKEY'S OFFICE - DAY - INTERCUT WITH EDWARD</p>
            <p> Stuckey and Vance are pouring over stock reports, talking to <br>
              Edward on the speaker phone.</p>
            <p> VANCE<br>
              Kross came out of his corner<br>
              swinging. He started buying up<br>
              all available stock as soon as<br>
              the market opened.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (almost to himself)<br>
              He's a tough old son of a<br>
              bitch...</p>
            <p> Edward is watching Vivian. She pulls the hem of her skirt up<br>
              to mid thigh. She looks hopefully over to Edward. Edward<br>
              shakes his head.</p>
            <p> VANCE<br>
              It's up to ten and a quarter.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Offer nine and a half. Bring<br>
              them back down to earth.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Goddamit! Where is he getting<br>
              the money to fight?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Someone's loaning it to him.<br>
              Get on it right away.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Our contract guys are working<br>
              on the Kross pension funds.<br>
              There's another forty million<br>
              there. We can bleed'm dry.</p>
            <p> There is a sudden hesitation in Edward's eyes. He watches as<br>
              Vivian tries on a hat. She preens for him. He smiles.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (to Vance &amp; Stuckey)<br>
              Put the pension funds on hold<br>
              until I say otherwise.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              (surprised)<br>
              We're letting them slide?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I want the treatment plant<br>
              licenses to be top priority right<br>
              now.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              But, Edward...</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Do it.</p>
            <p> Edward hangs up and takes a long look at Vivian. She moves<br>
              to him.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (looks at his watch)<br>
              You're on your own now, Vivian.<br>
              I've got to get to work. Be<br>
              sensible and you can keep<br>
              everything. Spend too much and<br>
              it all goes back.</p>
            <p> Vivian hugs him again.</p>
            <p> EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY</p>
            <p> Vivian walks along Rodeo Drive. She looks lovely in the pink<br>
              dress and new, white shoes. A pretty, white hat is the final<br>
              touch. She carries a bag containing her old clothes. She stops<br>
              and a trashcan and ceremonially throws the offending items away.</p>
            <p> INT. TORIE STEELE BOUTIQUE - SHOPPING MONTAGE</p>
            <p> We SEES Vivian in each department within the store with<br>
              different SALESPEOPLE. She happily and confidently tries on<br>
              a variety of dresses, hats, shoes, accesarries, etc.</p>
            <p> 1) Vivian is in a dressing stall. She tosses a dress out<br>
              to a waiting SALESWOMAN.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Not me!</p>
            <p> 2) A SALESWOMAN holds a long, purple evening gown.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (imitating Bridget)<br>
              Horrid!</p>
            <p> 3) Vivian is admiring a pair of beautiful suede dress pumps.<br>
              Her attention is drawn to the SALESMEN'S exotic hand-painted<br>
              tie.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Where'd you get your tie?</p>
            <p> 4) Vivian stands in front of an enormous tie rack with the<br>
              Salesman, a dozen wild, swirling designed ties are hanging over<br>
              his outstretched arm. Vivian picks out the brightest one and<br>
              smiles.</p>
            <p> EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY</p>
            <p> Vivian's arms are filled with clothing boxes and bags. She<br>
              feels like she owns the block. A well-dressed MAN passes by,<br>
              smiling politely. Vivian's nose lifts as she happily ignores<br>
              him.</p>
            <p> Suddenly Vivian stops. She's about to pass the shop she was<br>
              thrown out of. Vivian takes a breath and enters the shop.</p>
            <p> INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY</p>
            <p> Vivian enters. The moment she steps through the door, Vivian's<br>
              courage leaves her.</p>
            <p> The saleswoman is waiting on a CUSTOMER.</p>
            <p> SALESWOMAN<br>
              (to the customer)<br>
              Isn't this lovely? I think it<br>
              would look wonderful on you.</p>
            <p> Vivian musters her courage. She takes a deep breath and starts<br>
              forward.</p>
            <p> SALESWOMAN<br>
              (to her customer)<br>
              Would you like to try it on?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              'Scume me.</p>
            <p> Both the saleswoman and her customer look up. The saleswoman<br>
              smiles pleasantly.</p>
            <p> SALESWOMAN<br>
              Yes?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Do you remember me?</p>
            <p> SALESWOMAN<br>
              No, I'm sorry, I don't.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I was in here yesterday.</p>
            <p> Vivian slowly raises her middle finger. The recognition starts<br>
              to dawn in the saleswoman's eyes. Vivian's courage begins to<br>
              return.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Yeah. That's right. It's me.<br>
              I want you to know something.<br>
              You made me feel terrible. I<br>
              wasn't dressed right and you said<br>
              I didn't belong here. Well, I<br>
              do. You're the one that was<br>
              wrong, not me. And I want to tell<br>
              you something else. I'm never<br>
              gonna shop here again as long as<br>
              I live.</p>
            <p> And with that, Vivian turns and walks out.</p>
            <p> The saleswoman is stunned. A beat. The customer thrusts the<br>
              dress into the saleswoman's arm as if offended by Vivian's<br>
              speech and leaves the store also.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

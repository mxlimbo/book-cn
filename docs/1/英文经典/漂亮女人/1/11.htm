              EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
            <p> In another group of PEOPLE.</p>
            <p> ANOTHER MAN<br>
              You look awfully familiar, Vivian.<br>
              Haven't we run into one another<br>
              at the spa in La Costa?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Well, I do often spa there.</p>
            <p> EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
            <p> Edward and Elizabeth Stuckey watch Vivian laugh and chat with<br>
              a group of WOMEN.</p>
            <p> ELIZABETH STUCKEY<br>
              Edward, she's marvelous. Warm<br>
              and witty and down to earth.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (with pleasure)<br>
              She is, isn't she.</p>
            <p> ELIZABETH STUCKEY<br>
              So unlike your usuals. Where on<br>
              earth did you find her?</p>
            <p> Edward smiles enigmatically. Taking an hors d'oeuvres off a<br>
              passing WAITERS's tray, he starts forward.</p>
            <p> EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
            <p> A WOMAN<br>
              We're good together. He has to<br>
              admit it. I've been just what<br>
              he wants me to be. I say the<br>
              right things, I know the right<br>
              people, I give wonderful parties.<br>
              No question, no arguments, no<br>
              embarrassments. It works for both<br>
              of us.</p>
            <p> That makes Vivian think. And then she smiles as she sees Edward<br>
              approaching. Vivian moves to him.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Edward, these women here, I don't<br>
              think any of'm like the guys<br>
              they're with. They're just into<br>
              it for the money.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I'm sure that's true for some of them.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I thought I was the pro. These<br>
              women make me feel like an<br>
              amateur.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (a beat)<br>
              Ready to stomp sod?</p>
            <p> EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ON THE FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
            <p> IN A SERIES OF SHOTS TO MUSIC</p>
            <p> The CROWD engages in sod stomping. They drink champagne. They 
              make a dance out of it. They laugh. Shoes get stuck in the<br>
              mud. It's ludicrous -- these people in their suits and fancy<br>
              clothes, replacing divots and stepping over the horse shit.<br>
              In a corner of the field, grazing horses stare, seemingly in<br>
              disbelief.</p>
            <p> Vivian is having a wonderful time. And then, as she moves<br>
              towards the outside of the crowd she sees someone staring at<br>
              her from over among some of the riders and grazing horses.<br>
              David Kross smiles at Vivian. She hesitates... and then she<br>
              crosses towards him.</p>
            <p> EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
            <p> DAVID KROSS<br>
              Hi.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Hi. I never thought stomping<br>
              in grass could be so much fun.</p>
            <p> DAVID<br>
              (laughs)<br>
              I like your hat.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Huh? Oh... yeah. S'okay?<br>
              (pleased; a moment)<br>
              Uhm... how're... business things<br>
              going.</p>
            <p> DAVID<br>
              Let's not talk about it, it's too<br>
              depressing. Come on, I'll show<br>
              you Thunder.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Please, we hardly know each other.</p>
            <p> DAVID<br>
              Thunder's a horse. Come on.</p>
            <p> EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
            <p> They approach the sweating mount. David Kross caresses the<br>
              horses muzzle.</p>
            <p> DAVID<br>
              Hey, big guy, you getting tired,<br>
              yet? I am. This is Vivian.<br>
              (a beat; and then:)<br>
              You two been together long? You<br>
              and Edward?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> DAVID<br>
              Hope to be?</p>
            <p> To Vivian's surprise, the question causes a pang inside.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              It's... it's not like that.</p>
            <p> DAVID<br>
              I see. Well. Maybe that means<br>
              you'd have lunch with me sometime<br>
              then.</p>
            <p> Vivian is suddenly silent. She looks away.</p>
            <p> DAVID (cont'd)<br>
              I'm sorry, am I being too forward?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              You don't know anything about me.</p>
            <p> DAVID<br>
              I'd like to find out. You don't<br>
              know anything about me either.<br>
              That's why people have lunch.</p>
            <p> But something holds Vivian back, a feeling.</p>
            <p> EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - IN THE CROWD - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
            <p> William Stuckey turns... stops... stares. He sees Vivian and<br>
              David Kross standing together. He stares, his mind racing, and<br>
              anxious, angry look on his face.</p>
            <p> EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
            <p> Stuckey has Edward off to the side. He is talking to him in<br>
              a low, earnest voice.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Fill me in on this. How'd you<br>
              and Vivian meet?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              We just did.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              (grinning)<br>
              Come on, you can tell me. I sure<br>
              would like to know where a guy<br>
              runs into a girl as attractive<br>
              as this.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              The night I left your house, I<br>
              was lost. I was looking for<br>
              directions.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              And you just happened to run into<br>
              her. Great. What's she do? She<br>
              work?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Yes...</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Doing what?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Vivian's in sales.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Sales, really? That's great.<br>
              What does she sell?</p>
            <p> Edward's eyes narrow.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Why do you want to know?</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Hear me out. I've known you a<br>
              long time. I see a difference<br>
              in you this week. Like that tie.<br>
              I'm suddenly wondering if this<br>
              girl's not the difference.<br>
              Especially when I see her talking<br>
              with David Kross.</p>
            <p> EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANGLE ON VIVIAN</p>
            <p> Vivian turns away from the bar, now holding two glasses of<br>
              champagne. She scans the crowd for Edward.</p>
            <p> EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANGLE ON EDWARD AND STUCKEY</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              She met him at dinner last<br>
              night... I like this tie.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              So now they're best friends?<br>
              Edward, this girl appears out of<br>
              nowhere and now I see her talking<br>
              to a guy whose company we're <br>
              trying to buy. It's too<br>
              convenient.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              You're being ridiculous.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Industrial espionage is not<br>
              ridiculous. Edward, how do you<br>
              know she hasn't attached herself<br>
              to you so she can bring Kross back<br>
              information?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Christ, Bill, she's not a spy,<br>
              she's a hooker. I picked her up<br>
              off Hollywood Boulevard.</p>
            <p> EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANGLE ON VIVIAN</p>
            <p> as she hear loud sudden LAUGHTER. She turns. She sees that<br>
              it's Stuckey laughing. Smiling, Vivian starts towards them with<br>
              two glasses of champagne.</p>
            <p> EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANGLE ON STUCKEY AND EDWARD</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              I swear to God, you are the only<br>
              millionaire I ever heard of who'd<br>
              go looking for a goddam bargain<br>
              streetwalker!</p>
            <p> Edward sees Vivian coming.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Let's drop it, shall we?</p>
            <p> Edward turns. He smiles gently as Vivian quietly approaches<br>
              and hands him his glass of champagne.</p>
            <p> A group of BUSINESSMEN are standing a short distance away.<br>
              One of them calls out:</p>
            <p> MAN<br>
              Edward! May we have your opinion<br>
              on something?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (to Vivian and Stuckey)<br>
              Excuse me a moment.</p>
            <p> He moves to join the group of men. Stuckey gives Vivian a<br>
              broad smile.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Having a good time, Vivian?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Yeah. Thanks.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              All this must be quite a change<br>
              from Hollywood Boulevard.</p>
            <p> Vivian looks as if she's been struck.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              It's okay. Edward told me. Your<br>
              secret's safe with me.</p>
            <p> Stuckey runs his hand up her arm.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY (cont'd)<br>
              What do you charge, Vivian?<br>
              Maybe you and I could get together<br>
              after Edward leaves.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (forcing a bitter smile)<br>
              Yeah. Sure. Why not. Call me<br>
              at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              I just might do that.</p>
            <p> He moves away. Vivian turns. Edward looks up from his<br>
              conversation, sees her looking at him. He smiles, raises his<br>
              glass in a small toast. A moment. Vivian toasts him back.</p>

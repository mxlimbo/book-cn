              EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY</p>
            <p> Vivian comes out onto the street and stands, lost. She takes<br>
              a deep breath, trying to control herself. Two WOMEN, in elegant<br>
              designer outfits, stroll by, eyeing Vivian as if she were a<br>
              freak. Vivian suddenly feels naked. She turns and hurries<br>
              away.</p>
            <p> INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY</p>
            <p> Vivian enters the lobby, upset, nervous and paranoid. She feels<br>
              an emptiness in her stomach at the sight of all the luxury<br>
              around her. She hurries toward the elevators.</p>
            <p> At the front desk, Mr. Thomas, once again spots her. He crosses<br>
              the lobby and deftly cuts her off from the elevator.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              May I help you Miss?</p>
            <p> Vivian stops, practically shaking with terror.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I'm just going to my room.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              You're a guest here?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I'm -- I'm with a friend.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              And who is that?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I... Edward...</p>
            <p> Vivian's face is filled with confusion. She doesn't know his<br>
              name. The elevator doors open behind them. She spots the<br>
              Operator.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (blurting it out)<br>
              He knows me.</p>
            <p> Mr. Thomas turns and eyes the Operator curiously. The Operator<br>
              looks back at them innocently. With a smooth gesture Mr. Thomas<br>
              waves the Operator over.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              Do you know this young lady?</p>
            <p> The Operator nods.</p>
            <p> OPERATOR<br>
              She's with Mr. Harris.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              (surprised)<br>
              Mr. Harris?</p>
            <p> OPERATOR<br>
              She apparently joined him last<br>
              night.</p>
            <p> Mr. Thomas waves the Operator away.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              Why don't you come with me. We'll<br>
              chat for just a moment.</p>
            <p> He takes Vivian gently but firmly by the arm and leads her off.</p>
            <p> INT. HOTEL OFFICE - DAY</p>
            <p> In a richly furnished office, Mr. Thomas places Vivian in a<br>
              comfortable chair and then leans against the edge of his desk.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              What's your name?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Vivian.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              Miss Vivian... things that go<br>
              on in other hotels don't happen<br>
              at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.</p>
            <p> Vivian says nothing.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS (cont'd)<br>
              Mr. Harris, however, is a very<br>
              special customer. And we like<br>
              to think of our special customers<br>
              as friends. As a customer, we<br>
              would expect Mr. Harris to sign<br>
              in any additional guests. But<br>
              as a friend, we're willing to<br>
              overlook it, I'm assuming you're<br>
              a... relative?</p>
            <p> Vivian finds herself nodding.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS (cont'd)<br>
              I thought so. You must be his...?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Niece?</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              Of course. Naturally when Mr.<br>
              Harris leaves, I won't see you<br>
              in this hotel again.</p>
            <p> Vivian bites her lower lip, nods.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS (cont'd)<br>
              Good. We understand one another.<br>
              (as a gentle afterthought:)<br>
              I would also encourage you to<br>
              dress in a more appropriate<br>
              manner.</p>
            <p> Vivian's face screws up as she tries hard not to cry.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              That's what I was trying to do.</p>
            <p> She can't help it, the tears come. Vivian pulls out the money<br>
              Edward gave her. She drops it on the desk. It's a moist-<br>
              looking wad now.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN (cont'd)<br>
              I was trying to get some other<br>
              clothes... but... <br>
              they wouldn't... they made me feel<br>
              like shit...</p>
            <p> She can't go on. Mr. Thomas politely glances at the money.<br>
              He unfolds it, smoothes it and hands it back to her. He sighs.<br>
              He picks up the phone. He dials.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              (into the phone)<br>
              Women's clothing.<br>
              (beat)<br>
              Bridget, please.</p>
            <p> Vivian is staring at him.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS (cont'd)<br>
              Bridget, hello, this is Barnard<br>
              Thomas over at the Regent Beverly<br>
              Wilshire. Well, thank you, that's<br>
              flattering. I'd like to ask a<br>
              favor of you. I'm going to send<br>
              someone over. Her name is Vivian.<br>
              She's a guest of ours. A very <br>
              special guest.</p>
            <p> He glances at Vivian. With those simple words, he'd made her<br>
              feel better.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS (cont'd)<br>
              She's from out of town and she<br>
              needs a little help in dressing.<br>
              Perhaps you could help her out.<br>
              Thank you very much. She'll be<br>
              right over.</p>
            <p> He sets the phone down and smiles patronizingly at Vivian.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS (cont'd)<br>
              There you are. If you have any<br>
              other problems, come ask for me<br>
              personally. I'm Mr. Thomas.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Barney.</p>
            <p> She smiles mischievously.</p>
            <p> EXT. FORT OF LOS ANGELES - DAY</p>
            <p> A sleek corporate helicopter flies over the port.</p>
            <p> EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - DAY</p>
            <p> Edward, Vance, Stuckey and Jake walk toward the building's<br>
              edge. They look out over the empty shipyard as Vance describes<br>
              it.</p>
            <p> VANCE<br>
              Okay... this is the jewel in<br>
              Kross's crown. We can strip out<br>
              all the heavy equipment. Some<br>
              of the cranes are very valuable<br>
              overseas. The Japanese are<br>
              salivating for them.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Prime industrial property<br>
              straddling the Port of Long Beach<br>
              and Los Angeles. It gives me a<br>
              hard-on.</p>
            <p> Edward points toward one of the edges of the shipyard.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              What's that long building over<br>
              there?</p>
            <p> JAKE<br>
              Storage, I think.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Not with those smokestacks it's <br>
              not.</p>
            <p> VANCE<br>
              Let me check.</p>
            <p> Vance pulls out a notebook.</p>
            <p> JAKE<br>
              The real estate possibilities<br>
              are endless. Most of the yard<br>
              we'll just level. I talked to<br>
              a couple of developers, under the<br>
              table, of course, and they said<br>
              --</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              You what?</p>
            <p> JAKE<br>
              I talked to some developers about<br>
              the land.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              What kind of an idiot are you?<br>
              You don't talk about this to<br>
              anyone.</p>
            <p> JAKE<br>
              They're close friends, they'd<br>
              never breathe a word --</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              (to Vance)<br>
              Where did you dig this moron up?</p>
            <p> VANCE<br>
              He's right, Jake, that was an<br>
              incredibly stupid thing to do.<br>
              It won't happen again, Edward.<br>
              I'll pull him off the project<br>
              immediately.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Don't bother.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              What!?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              We don't have the time to bring<br>
              someone new up to speed.<br>
              Besides...<br>
              (not unkindly, to Jake)<br>
              You've already impressed everyone<br>
              you need to, haven't you?</p>
            <p> JAKE<br>
              It won't happen again, Mr. Harris.</p>
            <p> Vance has found what he was looking for in his notebook.</p>
            <p> VANCE<br>
              This is interesting. That<br>
              building is storage now, but it<br>
              used to be a smelting plant. They<br>
              closed it down after World War<br>
              II.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I want our lawyers to check into<br>
              the toxic waste licences on them<br>
              right away. I want to know if the<br>
              permits are still valid and what<br>
              kind of limits are on them.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Jesus, yes. It's a long shot but<br>
              if the permits are still in<br>
              effect, they're worth a fortune.</p>
            <p> He turns away. The other follow Edward back toward the<br>
              stairs.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              What time's diner tonight?</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Eight o'clock. Kross is bringing<br>
              his son. Very bright kid, watch<br>
              yourself with him. Who's this<br>
              girl you're taking?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              No one you know.</p>
            <p> INT. SAKS - SECOND FLOOR - DAY</p>
            <p> The elevator opens and Vivian walks out and surveys the room<br>
              nervously. She walks toward the women's clothing section.<br>
              BRIDGET, a large friendly woman, spots her and quickly<br>
              approaches.</p>
            <p> BRIDGET<br>
              You must be Vivian.</p>
            <p> Vivian nods.</p>
            <p> BRIDGET (cont'd)<br>
              Let's look at you...</p>
            <p> She steps back, regards Vivian with a professional eye.</p>
            <p> BRIDGET (cont'd)<br>
              Where are you from, dear?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (pause)<br>
              Georgia.</p>
            <p> BRIDGET<br>
              No wonder. For starts, you should<br>
              know that hot pants are horrid,<br>
              even when you do have the legs<br>
              to carry them off. What are your<br>
              plans while you're in town?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Well... I might be going out to<br>
              dinner.</p>
            <p> BRIDGET<br>
              You'll want a cocktail dress<br>
              then. Turn. You have a beautiful<br>
              figure. A little too out in the<br>
              open but simply lovely. Size six?<br>
              Do you need shoes?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I dunno. Do thigh high, leather<br>
              boots go with a cocktail dress?</p>
            <p> BRIDGET<br>
              (calling out)<br>
              Philip! We'll need shoes!</p>
            <p> Bridget leads Vivian towards the racks of clothes. She pulls<br>
              out a dress.</p>
            <p> BRIDGET<br>
              Your uncle will like this.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              He's not really my uncle.</p>
            <p> BRIDGET<br>
              They never are, dear.</p>
            <p> INT. HOTEL LOBBY - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
            <p> Mr. Thomas is behind the desk. He looks up. Vivian is standing<br>
              there, a happy look on her face. She holds up a garment bag.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I got a dress.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              (dryly)<br>
              I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              I didn't want to get it messed.<br>
              I got shoes too. Wanna see?</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              That's all right. I'm sure<br>
              they're quite lovely.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              They were real nice to me there.<br>
              They treated me, y'know... nice.<br>
              Thanks, Barney.</p>
            <p> Mr. Thomas tries not to wince at the familiarity.</p>
            <p> MR. THOMAS<br>
              You're very welcome, Miss Vivian.</p>
            <p> She smiles at him. He watches as Vivian turns and walks toward<br>
              the elevator. The provocative way her hips move just naturally<br>
              attracts the attention of a MALE PASSERBY. And the white gloved<br>
              ELEVATOR MAN literally leaps to press the elevator button for<br>
              Vivian who rewards him with a happy smile. Mr. Thomas sighs.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
            <p> The phone is ringing Vivian enters. She hurries to pick it up.</p>

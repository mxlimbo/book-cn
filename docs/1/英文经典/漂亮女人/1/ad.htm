              PRETTY WOMAN</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. A HOUSE IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The view of downtown Los Angeles from the enormous, ornate house<br>
              is extraordinary. A small outdoor dinner party is in progress.</p>
            <p> A MAGICIAN is entertaining guests. Playing cards and coins<br>
              appear and disappear in his nimble hands.</p>
            <p> INT. HOUSE STUDY - NIGHT</p>
            <p> EDWARD HARRIS stands at the window, impassively looking down<br>
              at the party. Edward is a handsome, well groomed man of around<br>
              forty. He looks tired; the kind of fatigue that can't be cured<br>
              by a night's sleep.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (a murmur)<br>
              Left pocket.</p>
            <p> And indeed, down below, the magician pulls the coin from the<br>
              left pocket of the incredulous WOMAN's silk blazer. More<br>
              laughter and applause.</p>
            <p> The study is in keeping with the rest of the house. Luxurious.<br>
              Everything the best. WILLIAM STUCKEY, Edward's contemporary,<br>
              is a crafty looking lawyer who is the party host. VANCE is an<br>
              investment banker. His assistant JAKE, is a financial<br>
              researcher. The other men are INVESTMENT BANKERS. They are<br>
              in dark suits and power ties. On the table are stacks of <br>
              documents and folders, the name &quot;KROSS INDUSTRIES&quot; is 
              prominent<br>
              on many of the folders.</p>
            <p> INVESTMENT BANKER 1<br>
              Our banks certainly doesn't want<br>
              to discourage Harris Enterprises<br>
              from investing in California.<br>
              We think this is a great new venue<br>
              for you but you've got to<br>
              understand the mergers and<br>
              acquisitions market is changing.<br>
              With the upswing in inflation we<br>
              have to make these offerings<br>
              tempting to offset the risk.</p>
            <p> VANCE<br>
              Look, we're talking about hard<br>
              assets and a straight liquidation.<br>
              We have over a thousand man hours<br>
              in this deal.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              (losing patience)<br>
              This is a &quot;no brainer&quot;. There's<br>
              no risk for you. No one has ever<br>
              lost money backing Mr. Harris.</p>
            <p> INVESTMENT BANKER 2<br>
              Not yet. But ship building is<br>
              a new endeavor for you...</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              (cuts him off)<br>
              Come on. You know we're not <br>
              going to go into ship building.<br>
              &lt;i&gt;Besides&lt;/i&gt;, you're the ones with the<br>
              troubled track record, not us!</p>
            <p> INVESTMENT BANKER 3<br>
              Bill, be reasonable. If you're<br>
              really going to digest Kross<br>
              Industries that quickly eighteen<br>
              should not be such a problem.<br>
              &lt;i&gt;Besides&lt;/i&gt;, I don't think there's<br>
              anywhere else you can go for the<br>
              money in the time you have.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              It's unacceptable.</p>
            <p> Edward turns from the window. He hasn't miss a thing. All<br>
              eyes are on him.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Draymen Heux has offered me<br>
              seventy-five in the pool at<br>
              sixteen and a half. I can secure<br>
              the other half personally. You<br>
              have until tomorrow morning to<br>
              make me a better offer.</p>
            <p> The bankers speechlessly stare at him.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              The meeting is over, gentlemen.</p>
            <p> He turns away. The bankers look at one another. They rise.<br>
              Silence as they exit. When the door closes. Stuckey explodes<br>
              with laughter.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Hah! Did you see the look on <br>
              their faces?</p>
            <p> VANCE<br>
              You don't think we pushed too<br>
              hard?</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              NO way! They'll come back. They<br>
              can't afford not to. Edward,<br>
              that bluff was beautiful.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Maybe I should have made it<br>
              rhyme.</p>
            <p> The others stare at him, uncertain. Stuckey laughs. The<br>
              others follow suit.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (looking at his watch)<br>
              Well! It's late. We've been<br>
              at this long enough.</p>
            <p> Stuckey rises. Edward ushers Vance and Jake toward the door.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Gentlemen, enjoy the party. The<br>
              magician's wonderful.</p>
            <p> Vance and Jake exit.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (calling after them)<br>
              Watch your left pocket.</p>
            <p> A BUTLER has entered the room.</p>
            <p> BUTLER<br>
              Phone call, Mr. Harris. It's Miss<br>
              Charles.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Cynthia? Is she coming out?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              We're about to find out. Go on.<br>
              Take care of your guests.</p>
            <p> Stuckey exits the room as Edward crosses to the telephone.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (into phone)<br>
              Where are you, Cynthia?<br>
              (beat)<br>
              I see.<br>
              (pausing, getting angry)<br>
              No, I don't expect you to be at<br>
              my beck-and-call. Are you coming<br>
              or not?</p>
            <p> INT. HOUSE - STAIRWAY - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Edward descends the long, curved stairway. He has Vance in<br>
              tow.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (all business)<br>
              Prepare the filing papers. Have<br>
              them ready by the middle of the<br>
              week. I'll tell you when to <br>
              submit them.</p>
            <p> The PEOPLE talking and drinking on the stairway gravitate<br>
              toward Edward.</p>
            <p> A MAN<br>
              &lt;i&gt;Edward&lt;/i&gt;!</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (turning on the charm)<br>
              Yes!</p>
            <p> THE MAN<br>
              Will we see you at the polo<br>
              matches Wednesday?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Wouldn't miss it.<br>
              (abruptly; to Vance)<br>
              I want this done fast and easy.<br>
              No slip-ups. I want to be back<br>
              in New York by Saturday. Got it?</p>
            <p> He deftly keeps making his way through the crowd.</p>
            <p> INT. HOUSE - THE DOWNSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Stuckey is sipping champagne and talking to a beautiful<br>
              WOMAN in a tight sheath of an evening dress. An elegant woman<br>
              ELIZABETH STUCKEY approaches from behind him. She taps him on<br>
              the shoulder and he turns, startled.</p>
            <p> ELIZABETH<br>
              Bill?</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              (flustered)<br>
              Oh... Hi, honey... Millicent,<br>
              uh, uh, Millicent.</p>
            <p> MILLICENT<br>
              Lowell.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Lowell, right. My wife,<br>
              Elizabeth.</p>
            <p> ELIZABETH<br>
              (ignoring her)<br>
              Is Edward leaving?</p>
            <p> Stuckey looks up to see Edward moving quickly toward the door.<br>
              Stuckey abruptly leaves the two woman together to follow Edward.</p>
            <p> EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Edward comes out of the house. Jags, a limo with waiting<br>
              DRIVER and two BMW's pack the circular driveway behind a black<br>
              Ferrari. The limo driver leaps to attention at the sight of<br>
              Edward. Edward stands, making an obvious effort to keep his<br>
              impatience under control. Stuckey comes out of the house and<br>
              down the walk.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              What's up, where you going?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Give me your car keys, will you,<br>
              I'm going back to my hotel.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              At least stay for a drink. This<br>
              party's for you.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Apologize to Elizabeth for me.</p>
            <p> Stuckey gropes uncertainly in his pocket for keys.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Listen, there're some major local<br>
              talent inside just dying to meet<br>
              you...</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (as if delighted)<br>
              Really? Some high class gold<br>
              digger who speaks French better<br>
              than I do?<br>
              (turning away)<br>
              No, thank you. I just got off<br>
              the phone with one.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Cynthia's not coming?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> Edward grabs the keys out of Stuckey's hand. He crosses to a<br>
              black Ferrari and gets in.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Let your driver take you. We'll<br>
              move the cars...</p>
            <p> Edward starts the car.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Can you drive a stick?</p>
            <p> The car lurches forward with a squeal of wheels and promptly<br>
              stalls.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Edward, give me a break!</p>
            <p> With a squeal of tires, the Ferrari bucks out of the driveway<br>
              and... stalls again.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Love this car! Is it new?</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              Yes! And you don't even know<br>
              where you're going!</p>
            <p> Edward starts it again and heads uncertainly uphill. Stuckey<br>
              watching, throws up his hands.</p>
            <p> STUCKEY<br>
              That's the wrong way!</p>
            <p> CREDITS BEGIN AS IN A SERIES OF CROSSCUTS:</p>
            <p> EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The Ferrari, moving fast through the Hollywood Hills, passes<br>
              large, beautiful homes... Edward shifts, grinding gears...</p>
            <p> EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The Ferrari comes to a red light and pulls up next to a Dodge 
              Colt.<br>
              The GIRL in the Colt looks at Edward and his car admiringly.<br>
              Edward feeling confident now, revs the engine. The light turns<br>
              green. Edward immediately stalls the Ferrari. The Colt leaves<br>
              him in the dust.</p>
            <p> INT. FERRARI - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Edward drives. He blinks, shakes his head as if trying to rid<br>
              himself of his own tired thoughts.</p>
            <p> EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The Ferrari comes to the intersection of OUTPOST and FRANKLIN,<br>
              stops. Edward gets out of the car. He looks at the street<br>
              signs. He has no idea where he is. He signs. He gets back <br>
              in the car and takes off on Franklin heading East.</p>
            <p> EXT. A SIDE STREET IN HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT</p>
            <p> A crumbling old apartment building. Dark alley ways, deserted<br>
              parking lot.</p>
            <p> The Ferrari -- blink and you miss it -- motors past the building,<br>
              looking very out of place on the street.</p>
            <p> PANNING UP A building facade of lit windows and metal fire<br>
              escape. One window in particular. A GIRL stands there in a<br>
              short kimono, looking down. And then she turns away.</p>
            <p> INT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> A SERIES OF SHOTS to see her dressing.</p>
            <p> INT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> VIVIAN turns and stares at herself in a grainy, cracked bedroom<br>
              mirror. She is twenty years old and a prostitute. Make-up<br>
              applied to give her a hard, older look doesn't quite succeed.<br>
              She'd be innocently beautiful without it. She is wearing tiny<br>
              shorts, a tight tube top, thigh high boots. She stares at<br>
              herself, not really liking what she sees. A moment. She signs,<br>
              turns off the light and walks out of the bedroom.</p>
            <p> INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Faded, peeling walls. Thread bare, dirty carpet. Vivian locks<br>
              the apartment door behind her and starts down the dim hallway.<br>
              A door suddenly opens, startling her. An unshaved, enormously<br>
              pot bellied MAN in a stained t-shirt stares at Vivian with pig<br>
              eyes.</p>
            <p> LANDLORD<br>
              Vivian.</p>
            <p> Vivian turns some &quot;tough&quot; on him.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Yeah, what?</p>
            <p> LANDLORD<br>
              Rent. You're late.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Don't give me that. Kit gave it<br>
              to you yesterday, cash.</p>
            <p> LANDLORD<br>
              Kit give me nothin'.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (suddenly uncertain)<br>
              You bullshittin' me?</p>
            <p> LANDLORD<br>
              Of rent I do not bullshit.</p>
            <p> Vivian hurries at a run back down the hallway.</p>
            <p> LANDLORD<br>
              By the end of the week or you're<br>
              otta here.<br>
              (a beat)<br>
              By the way, you look very nice<br>

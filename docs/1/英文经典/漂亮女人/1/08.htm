              INT. REX RESTAURANT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Vivian comes out of the ladies room. She walks forward past<br>
              the MATRE'D'S station. She stops. She takes a breath... and<br>
              then walks forward.</p>
            <p> INT. REX - ANOTHER ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN</p>
            <p> Vivian moves down a marble starircase, through the elegant<br>
              restaurant toward a far table. Her beauty and natural grace<br>
              draw approving stares. She is like a queen moving through a<br>
              ballroom.</p>
            <p> At a secluded table, Edward sits in conversation with two men.<br>
              JAMES KROSS, in his early 70's, a bulky self-made millionaire<br>
              industrialist. Sitting next to him is his son and second in<br>
              command, DAVID KROSS, a handsome man in his early thirties.<br>
              All of them rise as Vivian comes to the table. David Kross<br>
              holds out Vivian's chair for her. Surprised, she nods her<br>
              thanks. In front of her is an enormous placesetting. She<br>
              smiles down at the utensils, filled with confidence.</p>
            <p> Waiters have placed a delicate salad down in front of each of<br>
              them. Vivian proudly reaches for her salad fork. But then she<br>
              sees that Kross has picked up the fork closest to his plate and<br>
              is digging into his salad with that.</p>
            <p> Vivian looks to see what Edward will do. He doesn't seem<br>
              interested in eating yet. Neither does David Kross. Feeling<br>
              a sudden panic, Vivian puts her fork down.</p>
            <p> KROSS<br>
              So young man, I understand you<br>
              are trying to take over my<br>
              company.</p>
            <p> A moment. The abruptness of the question takes Edward back for<br>
              a moment. But then he almost smiles.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Please don't patronize me, Mr.<br>
              Kross. Our ages mean nothing<br>
              here.</p>
            <p> Kross and David look at each other.</p>
            <p> DAVID<br>
              Mr. Harris, we know you've<br>
              purchased at least twenty percent<br>
              of our stock. We also know you<br>
              plan to file a formal bid for a<br>
              majority share.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Twenty-five percent.</p>
            <p> KROSS<br>
              Mr. Harris, I built Kross<br>
              Enterprises myself. I know every<br>
              man who ever worked there by his<br>
              first name. I know their wives...<br>
              and their children. If your<br>
              intention is to take over my<br>
              company and turn it into a<br>
              glorified real estate deal, think<br>
              again.</p>
            <p> Edward, thankfully, now reaches for his salad fork and begins<br>
              to eat. Relieved, Vivian picks up hers. They all eat for a<br>
              moment.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              What do you suggest, Mr. Kross?</p>
            <p> WAITERS approach, some to clear the salad plates, some to put<br>
              down the next course. Vivian, thinking she's got to finish,<br>
              quickly stuffs her mouth with the rest of her salad. She is<br>
              reluctant to let the Waiter take her fork.</p>
            <p> KROSS<br>
              What would it take to buy our<br>
              stock back? Name your price.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              To get me in a mood to sell --<br>
              double what I paid. But your<br>
              company doesn't have enough<br>
              capital right now to buy anything.</p>
            <p> DAVID<br>
              We're on the verge of closing<br>
              a large navy contract. Double<br>
              is ridiculous but we can assure<br>
              you a healthy profit on your<br>
              shares. We would give you a<br>
              promissory note...</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              You're not getting any navy<br>
              contracts.</p>
            <p> Vivian can see that both father and son are stunned by this<br>
              news.</p>
            <p> DAVID<br>
              There's no way you could know<br>
              that.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              But I do know. I also know your<br>
              lines of credit are over-extended.<br>
              If I don't buy your company,<br>
              someone else will...<br>
              (looking up)<br>
              Ah, the escargot.</p>
            <p> Escargot are put down in front of everyone. Vivian stares at<br>
              them dubiously. She picks up what she assumes is the next<br>
              &quot;right&quot; fork. She picks up a snail. The two do not fit.<br>
              Flustered, she doesn't know what to do. No one else seems to<br>
              be eating. And now a Waiter comes and places escargot forks<br>
              at each place. Vivian picks it up with a sigh of relief.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (softly, to the Waiter)<br>
              Scume me, what are these things?</p>
            <p> WAITER<br>
              (bending to whisper)<br>
              Escargot, mademoiselle.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (leaning close to<br>
              whisper)<br>
              Snails.</p>
            <p> Vivian stares at them, horrified. She, like James and David<br>
              Kross, no longer seem interested in eating. Edward eats with<br>
              pleasure.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell<br>
              you my stock. On the contrary,<br>
              I'm here to buy yours.</p>
            <p> KROSS<br>
              (angry)<br>
              You've got a lot of nerve.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              No. What I have is a lot of<br>
              money.</p>
            <p> KROSS<br>
              I know all about you, Mr. Harris.<br>
              When you buy companies, they have<br>
              a way of disappearing. Even the<br>
              pension funds are stripped clean.<br>
              The last three companies you took<br>
              over were cut up in so many<br>
              pieces, widows were left without<br>
              their retirement checks.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (calmly)<br>
              What I did with those companies<br>
              was perfectly legal.</p>
            <p> KROSS<br>
              I don't question the legality<br>
              of what you do. It's your<br>
              morality that makes me sick. I<br>
              will not allow my company to be<br>
              raped by a man like you.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (angry now)<br>
              It is not your company. It's a<br>
              public company. And I am going<br>
              to acquire it. Either I buy from<br>
              the other stock holders, or I buy<br>
              from you.</p>
            <p> Vivian struggles with her escargot.</p>
            <p> EDWARD (cont'd)<br>
              I would suggest that you and your<br>
              board cooperate with me, rather<br>
              than fight a battle you don't have<br>
              the ammunition to win.</p>
            <p> Vivian suddenly ZINGS her snail across the table. Everyone<br>
              looks to her.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Slippery little suckers...</p>
            <p> Kross rises.</p>
            <p> KROSS<br>
              If you'll excuse me young lady,<br>
              Mr. Harris...<br>
              (turns to David)<br>
              Deal with this, David, you know<br>
              where we stand. I need to go<br>
              someplace and puke.</p>
            <p> He rises. He exits.</p>
            <p> DAVID<br>
              (to Edward and Vivian)<br>
              Men like my father built this<br>
              country. He was no saint. He<br>
              screwed people. But for every<br>
              guy he stepped on, he gave a <br>
              hundred a good job.</p>
            <p> Edward is silent.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              He seems like a nice man.</p>
            <p> David looks at Vivian as if seeing her for the first time.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              We can reach an understanding on<br>
              this.</p>
            <p> DAVID<br>
              I don't think so. You should<br>
              know we're going to fight you with<br>
              every resource we have.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Do what you have to do. I don't<br>
              take it personally.</p>
            <p> DAVID<br>
              I do. I take it all very<br>
              personally.<br>
              (to Vivian)<br>
              Very nice meeting you, Vivian.</p>
            <p> David Kross gets up and leaves. Vivian and Edward sit in<br>
              silence.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              (a beat)<br>
              And that's the way the game is<br>
              played.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Some game. Screwin' some poor<br>
              slob out of his retirement.</p>
            <p> Edward says nothing. But Vivian can see she's hit a nerve.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Snails for dinner. No wonder<br>
              everybody is in such a bad mood.</p>
            <p> A Waiter appears at the table.</p>
            <p> WAITER<br>
              Are we ready for the next course,<br>
              sir?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              No. Bring a check, please.</p>
            <p> INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Edward's face is pensive and thoughtful as he stares out of <br>
              the glass window down at the city lights. He quickly drains <br>
              his champagne glass. Vivian moves to stand next to him. <br>
              She refills his glass from the bottle.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p> He drinks. Silence.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              You're upset, huh?</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Upset. No. I never get upset<br>
              about business.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              You liked the guy, though.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Whether I liked him or not is<br>
              irrelevant. It's business.<br>
              There's no emotion involved in<br>
              business... if you want to<br>
              survive.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              (excited)<br>
              We're the exactly the same! Kit<br>
              keeps telling me don't get<br>
              emotional when you turn tricks<br>
              -- that's why no kissing -- it's<br>
              too personal.<br>
              The key is like you're saying,<br>
              stay numb, don't get involved --<br>
              when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot,<br>
              I just do it.<br>
              (realizing what she's<br>
              saying and quickly<br>
              recovers)<br>
              Except with you. At your price<br>
              I give my all...</p>
            <p> Edward laughs.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN (cont'd)<br>
              Let's not talks about this heavy<br>
              stuff. Come on, relax.</p>
            <p> Vivian comes up behind him. She begins to rub his shoulders.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              That... is very good.</p>
            <p> A moment. Edward is silent. Turns him, unknots his tie,<br>
              unbuttons his collar.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Know what we're gonna do in a<br>
              little while then? We're gonna<br>
              call Domino's and have'm deliver<br>
              a bigass pizza. We're gonna eat<br>
              it in bed. We're gonna veg' out<br>
              and watch television.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              Television?</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Yeah, it's this box, it has<br>
              pictures, sound. You don't have<br>
              to use your brain at all.</p>
            <p> EDWARD<br>
              I have work to do.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN<br>
              Uh-uh. No work.</p>
            <p> Smiling, she softly kisses his throat.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN (cont'd)<br>
              See... what you haven't figured<br>
              out yet...</p>
            <p> She kissed his neck. She fumbles with his belt.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN (cont'd)<br>
              Is that while you're the boss<br>
              everyplace else... I'm the one<br>
              in charge here.</p>
            <p> She kisses his chest.</p>
            <p> VIVIAN (cont'd)<br>
              You... just think you are.</p>
            <p> She starts to kneel down. He stops her. They stare at one<br>
              another for a moment. He releases her. She smiles. She <br>
              starts to undress him</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Ah, double my money, eh? You tell me you want double my money (JOE 
            </p>
            <p>(waving his hand up at him, reassuring him)</p>
            <p>Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.) that way? </p>
            <p><br>
              (Repeating to himself, after Joe has walked past)</p>
            <p>Eh, tomorrow. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
            <p>(Ann walks out onto the busy city street, dodging a motorbike as 
              she arrives from a side-street. She looks out fascinated at all 
              the activity, momentarily intimidated, but then venturing out confidently 
              as she enjoys the bustle of the city around her.)</p>
            <p>(Joe peers down the street after her, running between the people 
              in order to keep within sight. He follows her into a market as Ann 
              wanders along, taking her time, just enjoying herself. She walks 
              past several vendors offering her their goods.)</p>
            <p>(As Ann stops to look at a stall Joe has to back off, and is instantly 
              targetted by the nearest vendor who offers him some of his huge 
              melons. He shakes his head at him, more interested in keeping an 
              eye on Ann who tries on a pair of shoes at the stall, then pays 
              the woman vendor for them. Joe's vendor persists and Joe finally 
              buys the melon off him, which at once quietens him down. So, carrying 
              the melon, he follows Ann down to another street where she stops, 
              looking out at the Fontana di Trevi: a magnificent facade ornamented 
              with statues, fronted by a pool.)</p>
            <p>(Ann continues down the street that runs beside the fountain, stopping 
              outside a salon to look at the drawings of hairstyles in the window 
              which surround a mirror. She appears disappointed at the way she 
              looks in the mirror and, after smiling at the hair of someone who 
              walks past, decides to go inside.)</p>
            <p>(Joe walks up the the shop, smiling when he sees where she has 
              gone.)</p>
            <p><br>
              (Inside the hair salon Ann sits on one of the seats in front of 
              the large mirror, holding up her long hair as the hairdresser (Mario 
              Delani) fastens the cover around her.)</p>

              MARIO DELANI</p>

            <p>What a wonderful er, hair you have. </p>
            <p><br>
              (He asks her something in Italian.)</p>

              ANN</p>
            <p>Just cut, thank you. </p>

              ANN</p>

              melon.)</p>

            <p>(uncomfortable as he starts cutting off her long hair)</p>
            <p>Off. </p>
            <p>(Joe goes outside, looking round, then walks away down the street.)</p>
            <p>(Ann sits in the salon still, her hair covering her face.)</p>
            <p><br>
              MARIO DELANI</p>
            <p>(pulling apart her hair to see her)</p>

            <p><br>
              ANN</p>

              MARIO DELANI</p>

            <p>Yes. </p>

              (As he cuts her locks off, working his way round)</p>
            <p>Off! off; off.. </p>
            <p><br>
              (wipes his forehead with his arm.)</p>
            <p>(Joe finds a public phone down the street opposite the fountain. 
              Joe waits impatiently, studying his melon, as another person speaks 
              on the phone, in Italian. Then, seeing a group of children playing 
              on the statue, goes over to one of them, passing his melon to a 
              boy.)</p>
            <p>(Back in the salon, the hairdresser cuts of the last lock of her 
              hair.)</p>
            <p><br>
              MARIO DELANI</p>
            <p>Off! </p>
            <p><br>
              (He stands to the side of her as they both study the end result 
              as Ann moves her head slightly from side to side. She looks down 
              at something but, engrossed in her, the hairdresser jerks her head 
              back to the centre to get a better view.)</p>
            <p>(Outside, Joe sees a group of American schoolgirls, playing and 
              talking around the fountain. He approaches one who carries a camera.)</p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>(gently coaxing her to get a look at the camera)</p>
            <p>That's a nice little camera you have there. Ah, it's nice. Mmmm. 
              Er, you don't mind if I just borrow it, do you? </p>
            <p><br>
              (He tries to coax it off her but the strap is around her neck.)</p>
            <p><br>
              SCHOOLGIRL 1</p>
            <p>(calling out; putting her hand up)</p>
            <p>Miss Weber! </p>
            <p><br>
              JOE</p>
            <p>I'll give it back... just for a couple of minutes. </p>

              SCHOOLGIRL 2</p>
            <p>(trying to resist him)</p>
            <p>No. Go, it's my camera. </p>
            <p>(Their teacher comes over, looking over Joe darkly. He lets go 
              of the camera as the teacher leads the student away, then holds 
              his head in his hand, embarrassed.)</p>
            <p>(In the salon someone sweeps the hair up off the floor. Mario Delani 
              is combing her hair, touching up the ends.)</p>

              towards the Spanish Steps. He keeps a safe distance as she waits

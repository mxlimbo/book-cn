            <p>　　Continuing the shark scene.</p>
            <p>　　The shark is bobbin in front of him, practically wagging its 
              tail. </p>
            <p>　　Richard is smiling.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　And at that instant, it was either the shark or me. The shark 
              knew it, I knew it.</p>
            <p>　　Richard's arms flex. The spear travels up. It stops. Richard 
              grips the spear tightly as it shakes.</p>
            <p>　　Blood spurts out towards Richards' mask in pulses and the sea 
              turns red around him.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　Nothing personal, of course. It's the way of nature. But I swear 
              that in the last flicker of its dying eyes there was a moment between 
              us, when it said -</p>
            <p>　　INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Richard continues his story.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Hey Richard - enjoy your dinner.&quot;</p>
            <p>　　There are cheers to the end of his story.</p>
            <p>　　Bugs waits until these die down.</p>
            <p>　　BUGS</p>
            <p>　　Strange thing, killing a shark, isn't it?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Just a big fish, Bugs.</p>
            <p>　　BUGS</p>
            <p>　　Just a big fish? Maybe. Maybe when it's still a baby and it hasn't 
              really learned to kill yet, then maybe it's just a big fish. But 
              when it's a great white angry mother with the taste of human blood 
              on its tongue, well then it's a different story.</p>
            <p>　　Richard yawns noisily. Some people laugh.</p>
            <p>　　He notice Bugs scowling at him.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Sorry, Bugs. Is it just me or does this wet weather make everybody 
              tired? Maybe we can hear your &quot;very different&quot; and I'm 
              sure &quot;very fascinating&quot; story some other time.</p>
            <p>　　There is a flurry of exaggerated yawning, sniggering, extinguishing 
              of candles and calls of &quot;goodnight&quot;.</p>
            <p>　　Bugs does not laugh. He stares at Richard.</p>
            <p>　　Richard is smiling as he extinguishes the final candle.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BEACH. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　A sunny day. A game of cricket, under the supervision of Keaty, 
              is about to begin.</p>
            <p>　　KEATY</p>
            <p>　　Wicketkeeper. First slip. Second slip. Gully. Square leg. Long 
              leg. Silly mid-off. Cover point.</p>
            <p>　　At low tide, two sets of cricket stumps have been set up on the 
              beach some twenty yards apart. The stumps and bats have been roughly 
              hewn.</p>
            <p>　　At one end, Sten stands with a bat, ready to defend his stumps. 
              At the other end stands Keaty, who is umpiring. Behind them, the 
              bowler warms up, holding a small rubber ball.</p>
            <p>　　Among the ten fielders are Etienne and Francoise.</p>
            <p>　　Richard, the second batsman, walks toward Keaty, practicing with 
              an air of exuberance.</p>
            <p>　　KEATY </p>
            <p>　　(Continuing)</p>
            <p>　　We thank you Lord, for the twin pillars of civilization, Christianity 
              and cricket, even when played by those of another faith., Amen. 
              Ok, right arm over the wicket; first ball.</p>
            <p>　　The bowler runs up and bowls. Sten hits the ball and it is fielded 
              for no run at leaisurly pace by Etienne. Keaty and Richard watch.</p>
            <p>　　KEATY</p>
            <p>　　(Continuing)</p>
            <p>　　You do realize that killing a defenseless shark won't make any 
              difference.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Difference to what?</p>
            <p>　　KEATY</p>
            <p>　　You and Francoise, that's what.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Sorry Keaty, but I don't know what you're talking about.</p>
            <p>　　KEATY</p>
            <p>　　That is why you killed it, isn't it? Ducked one way then the 
              other! All to impress her, I suppose.</p>
            <p>　　The second ball is bowled and fielded.</p>
            <p>　　KEATY</p>
            <p>　　(Continuing)</p>
            <p>　　But you haven't got a chance in hell. I'm not saying you won't 
              get a quick fumble in her knickers down the back of the longhouse 
              but in the long run.</p>
            <p>　　Third ball</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I don't need to discuss this with you.</p>
            <p>　　KEATY</p>
            <p>　　No ball!</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Also, you're wrong.</p>
            <p>　　Third ball re-bowled and hit well.</p>
            <p>　　KEATY</p>
            <p>　　Four runs!</p>
            <p>　　He turns back to Richard.</p>
            <p>　　KEATY</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　Richard, you are a novelty act. He is the main attraction.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Thank you for your opinion, Father.</p>
            <p>　　Fourth ball.</p>
            <p>　　KEATY</p>
            <p>　　I don't mean to bring you down. I just wouldn't want anyone to 
              get hurt</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　If you don't shut up, you're the one that's going to get hurt.</p>
            <p>　　Silence</p>
            <p>　　KEATY</p>
            <p>　　One other thing.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　What?</p>
            <p>　　KEATY</p>
            <p>　　He's better looking than you.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Thanks.</p>
            <p>　　Fifth ball bowled and hit. The batsmen both run, Richard and 
              Sten exchanging places.</p>
            <p>　　Richard prepares to face the bowler</p>
            <p>　　KEATY</p>
            <p>　　Right arm over the wicket. One ball remaining.</p>
            <p>　　The ball is bowled. Richard hits it in the air.</p>
            <p>　　KEATY</p>
            <p>　　Catch it! Catch it!</p>
            <p>　　Etienne catches it.</p>
            <p>　　Keaty signals &quot;out&quot;.</p>
            <p>　　Richard walks away from the wicket, past Keaty and the celebrating 
              fielders, Francoise among them, who have gathered around Etienne.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BEACH. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Richard reaches the fringe of the beach where Sal is sitting 
              alone, half watching the game.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Aren't you going to stay and watch the game?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　No. As a matter of fact, I'm going to go for a long walk.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Don't forget about this evening. You wouldn't want to miss it.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Why? What happens this evening? Another obscure English sport 
              with which to humiliate the Americans?</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　It's the anniversary, Richard.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. CLEARING. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　A pair of hands, Sten's, tap loud and fast on a small drum.</p>
            <p>　　The inhabitants are sitting in a group. They are all holding 
              half coconut shells.</p>
            <p>　　Sonja walks along with a large clay bottle, filling each shell 
              with a milky liquid.</p>
            <p>　　Sal is standing up.</p>
            <p>　　The drumming stops.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　To the first six years.</p>
            <p>　　They all drink.</p>
            <p>　　Richard cringes at the unpleasant taste.</p>
            <p>　　Beside him, Etienne proudly gulps down the whole drink.</p>
            <p>　　Sonja refills the cups, pouring freely.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　And looking forward to the next one.</p>
            <p>　　They all drink again.</p>
            <p>　　Once again, Richard sips while Etienne empties his cup.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　So who was actually the first here?</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Well, technically, Daffy was the first person on the island.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　So why did he leave?</p>
            <p>　　There is an immediate silence.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　What?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Why did Daffy leave? What made him unhappy?</p>
            <p>　　The silence persists.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　Sorry. Have I broken a rule?</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　No, Richard, don't worry. Daffy left because he felt that in 
              coming to paradise we had inevitably destroyed it.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Because you built a shelter.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　He was a purist.</p>
            <p>　　MIRJANA</p>
            <p>　　He was crazy.</p>
            <p>　　There is a general murmur of agreement.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Must have been.</p>
            <p>　　The atmosphere is still slightly awkward.</p>
            <p>　　Guitarman breaks the silence by plunging into a rendition of 
              a popular favorite.</p>
            <p>　　Sonja refills the cups.</p>
            <p>　　Once again, Etienne tilts back his head and drinks.</p>
            <p>　　INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　The longhouse is empty. Outside a different, slower tune is being 
              played.</p>
            <p>　　The door is kicked open.</p>
            <p>　　Richard struggles in, carrying Etienne draped over his shoulder.</p>
            <p>　　Francoise follows.</p>
            <p>　　Richard lets Etienne slide off onto his bed where he lies, inert 
              and comatose.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Look at him. It's disgraceful to drink so much.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I think he just got carried away with the excitement of the occasion.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Don't make excuses for him. I'm so embarrassed. </p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　Now, I thought, this si my moment. It's now or never. Now or 
              never. Now or -</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Francoise -</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Richard, would you like to go tot the beach with me.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Yes!</p>
            <p>　　EXT BEACH. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Richard and Francoise walk down the shore to the moonlit sea.</p>
            <p>　　Francoise wades in up to her thighs. Richard follows.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Do you like it here, Richard?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I love this island.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Do you think about home?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　No.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Nor do I. Do you think that I ignore you?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Me? No.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　It's because I am with Etienne. It's difficult to spend time 
              with you.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I don't suppose there's any special reason that you should, spend 
              time with me, that is.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Of course there is: I like you, a lot.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　And have you mentioned this to Etienne.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　No. It's our secret.</p>
            <p>　　They are very close now, looking into each others' eyes. </p>
            <p>　　Suddenly Francoise looks away.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　There!</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　What?</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Look! The plankton. Shrimps. In the dark, when they are disturbed, 
              they glow.</p>
            <p>　　She dives in. He follows.</p>
            <p>　　UNDERWATER. NIGHT.</p>
            <p>　　Their faces, close together, are illuminated by the phosphorescent 
              plankton.</p>

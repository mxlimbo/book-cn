            <p>　　Richard lights up and looks around.</p>
            <p>　　He looks through the tapes at a stall.</p>
            <p>　　INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY </p>
            <p>　　Richard walks along the corridor towards his room, his new tape 
              playing on his walkman.</p>
            <p>　　On his door, a folded sheet of paper is attached with a pin.</p>
            <p>　　Richard lifts it off and unfolds it.</p>
            <p>　　It is a detailed and carefully drawn map of a cluster of islands. 
              Some are named. One is unnamed. On it, some features are marked; 
              hills, forest, river and a letter X.</p>
            <p>　　In the corner it reads &quot;X = beach&quot;.</p>
            <p>　　Richard switches his Walkman off.</p>
            <p>　　He studies the map then walks to Daffy's door and knocks.</p>
            <p>　　No reply.</p>
            <p>　　Richard twists the handle and pushes gently. The door opens.</p>
            <p>　　INT DAFFY'S ROOM. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　The room is dim, be even so the blood can be seen sprayed and 
              smeared around the walls, sheets and floor.</p>
            <p>　　There is no sign of Daffy.</p>
            <p>　　Richard treads carefully, avoiding the pools of blood on the 
              floor.</p>
            <p>　　He reaches the other side of the room. There, wedged in the narrow 
              gap between bed and wall, is Daffy's corpse. His wrists have been 
              cut.</p>
            <p>　　Richard studies the map again.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　You hope and you dream, but you never believe that something's 
              going to happen for you, not like it does in the movies. And when 
              it does, you sort of expect it to feel different. More visceral. 
              More real. Like IMAX maybe. I was waiting for it to hit me, but 
              it didn't. And just for the record, I never did get my ten dollars 
              back.</p>
            <p>　　Richard switches his walkman back on.</p>
            <p>　　INT. POLICE STATION. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　In an office, two policemen, one in UNIFORM and the other a DETECTIVE, 
              stand over Richard while he signs a statement.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　The police didn't want to waste any time on it. They were just 
              pissed off becase he was traveling on a false passport, name of 
              Mr Daffy</p>
            <p>　　Duck, birthplace Ruritania, which kind of fucked up all the paperwork. 
              They pulled everyone in from the hotel, but all they wanted form 
              me was a statement saying I found him and it looked like he cut 
              his wrists. No problem.</p>
            <p>　　The detective studies Richard's passport.</p>
            <p>　　DETECTIVE</p>
            <p>　　What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Traveler.</p>
            <p>　　DETECTIVE</p>
            <p>　　You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from 
              pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I don't think so.</p>
            <p>　　DETECTIVE</p>
            <p>　　Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the 
              world. Thai dope best in the world.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.</p>
            <p>　　INT. POLICE STATION CORRIDOR. DAY </p>
            <p>　　The door of the office opens and Richard walks out.</p>
            <p>　　Lined up in the corridor, slouching against the walls, are several 
              other travelers from the hotel. At the front of the queue are Francoise 
              and Etienne.</p>
            <p>　　The officer beckons Etienne into the office and closes the door.</p>
            <p>　　Richard and Francoise acknowledge each other with a smile.</p>
            <p>　　INT. RICHARD'S HOTEL ROOM. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Richard is seated at the top of his bed, addressing his speech 
              out of shot while he holds the map.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　OK, this island may not actually exist. And even if it does, 
              we might not be able to get there. But look at it like this: what 
              else is there to do around here?</p>
            <p>　　Richard is alone.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　So what do you think? Are you going to come or not. I'd be thrilled 
              if you'd join me, you and your…you and your boyfriend.</p>
            <p>　　INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY </p>
            <p>　　Richard knocks on his neighbors' door.</p>
            <p>　　Etienne opens it.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Hi. You want to take a hike? I mean a trip. A journey. With your 
              girlfriend and me. I mean the two of you, and me. It's a secret 
              island. Paradise. You know the kind of thing I'm talking about.</p>
            <p>　　Francoise appears behind Etienne.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Hi.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Hi there. Here, take a look.</p>
            <p>　　He shows Etienne the map.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　It's a map. The dead guy left it for me; I think it's the place 
              he tried to sell you. It's going to be just fucking great. You want 
              to come? I'd be thrileld if…</p>
            <p>　　Francoise and Etienne are looking at him.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　I realized that I had absolutely no idea of how I was going to 
              get there.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. RAILWAY/THAI COUNTRYSIDE. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　A train travels at night alongside fields.</p>
            <p>　　INT. TRAIN. NIGHT </p>
            <p>　　Richard is awake. Opposite him, Etienne and Francoise are slumped 
              together in sleep.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　Etienne, however, and I have to hand it to the guy, was fucking 
              great. He organized the whole thing: tickets, timetables, best route, 
              the whole damn trip.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. SEA. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　The bow of a passenger ferry crashes through a wave.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BOAT DAY. </p>
            <p>　　The decks are crowded with travelers and their packs. Amongst 
              them are Richard, Francoise, and Etienne. Maps and guidebooks are 
              being studied by many. The noise of the engines and the wind deters 
              conversation.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　Thanks to him we hit the final stop on the tourist trail inside 
              twenty-four hours, where, Etienne assured me, we would hire what 
              he called a &quot;local fisherman&quot; to take us on the last stage 
              of our journey.</p>
            <p>　　INT EXT. TRUCK. DAY </p>
            <p>　　Inside back of a covered, converted pick-up, four people are 
              seated down each side, amongst them Richard, Francoise, and Etienne.</p>
            <p>　　Behind them as they bump along, can be seen the dusty red road 
              bordered with dense green shrubs.</p>
            <p>　　The truck stops.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. ROAD. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Richard unloads the final of the three rucksacks from the roof 
              of the truck, passing it down to Etienne who stands at the back 
              with Francoise.</p>
            <p>　　The truck pulls away, revealing as sign, &quot;Seashell Bungalows&quot;.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BUNGALOW. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　A simple wooden shack on stilts, one of several standing in a 
              line at the edge of the beach. There is a small porch to the front.</p>
            <p>　　INT. BUNGALOW. DAY </p>
            <p>　　A spartan room: bed, mosquito nets, chair, cupboard, fan.</p>
            <p>　　Richard dumps his rucksack.</p>
            <p>　　Ext. SEA/BEACH. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　A long inflatable tube is towed past by a motorboat, its passengers 
              whooping with delight.</p>
            <p>　　As it passes, Francoise is revealed, standing in the water, looking 
              in towards the shore. She begins to walk in.</p>
            <p>　　On the beach there are sunbathers, games of beach volley ball, 
              and vendors selling food and sunglasses.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　This was just the kind of place I didn't want to hang around. 
              Not that it's lacking in comfort. Quite the opposite. It's got everything. 
              Everything you could possibly need to make you feel at home. And 
              what's the point of that.</p>
            <p>　　On the beach Francoise picks up a towel.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BEACH RESTAURANT. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　The restaurant fronts on to the beach. At the back there is a 
              bar.</p>
            <p>　　Richard sits alone at a table with a drink, watching the scene 
              on the beach, including Francoise.</p>
            <p>　　Etienne pulls up a chair and sits down.</p>
            <p>　　Francoise will join them as the dialogue proceeds.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　It's arranged. Tomorrow morning. Eight hundred baht.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Nice work.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　There is one problem.</p>
            <p>　　Etienne opens the map on the table.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　He will not take us to the island. It's in the National Park 
              and it is forbidden to go there. But we are allowed to travel to 
              this one to stay for one night.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　That's the wrong one.</p>
            <p>　　ETINENNE</p>
            <p>　　I know that.</p>
            <p>　　Francoise sits down with a drink.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　So from there to there?</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　We swim.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Swim?</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　You can swim?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　One or two kilometers.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do 
              you think we should let someone know where we're going?</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　Why?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　We're going to swim &quot;one or two kilometers&quot; across 
              open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes 
              wrong. What then?</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Have you told someone?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　No.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　I think it's a bad idea to tell anyone.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Yeah, OK. Foreget it. We won't tell anyone.</p>
            <p>　　Richard picks up the map</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BUNGALOW. DAY </p>
            <p>　　Richard sits on his veranda, under cover. Beyond him is a tropical 
              downpour.</p>
            <p>　　He hears two sets of footsteps rushing up the stairs of the next 
              door bungalow. Two men, Americans, Zeph and Sammy, try to open their 
              door but cannot.</p>
            <p>　　ZEPH</p>
            <p>　　Fuck, I knew we locked it. We should have left it unlocked.</p>
            <p>　　Sammy addresses Richard</p>
            <p>　　SAMMY</p>
            <p>　　We lost our key</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Where did you lose it?</p>
            <p>　　ZEPH</p>
            <p>　　On the beach. Or in the water.</p>
            <p>　　SAMMY</p>
            <p>　　The truth is we don't know.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　You try reception?</p>
            <p>　　ZEPH</p>
            <p>　　Closed. Back later. We hope.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Pretty annoying</p>
            <p>　　SAMMY</p>
            <p>　　It's a disaster, to which there is only one sensible, considered, 
              appropriate, and timely response.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BUNGALOW. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　All three are stoned. A joint is passed around while Zeph sings 
              badly.</p>
            <p>　　ZEPH</p>
            <p>　　I smoke two joints in the morning, and I smoke two joints at 
              night, and I smoke two joints in the afternoon, and then I feel 
              alright. I smoke two joints in time of peace, and two in time of 
              war. I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints and then I smoke 
              some more. I can't remember the rest.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Perhaps you smoked too much dope.</p>
            <p>　　ZEPH</p>
            <p>　　Not possible</p>
            <p>　　SAMMY</p>
            <p>　　Do you know the Kentucky friend mouse story?&quot;</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's 
              an urban myth.</p>
            <p>　　SAMMY</p>
            <p>　　Exactly. Always happened to someone else.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　So?</p>
            <p>　　SAMMY</p>
            <p>　　So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around 
              here at the moment. It's about a beach.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Uh-huh.</p>
            <p>　　ZEPH</p>
            <p>　　Yea. This beach is perfect. It's on an island, right, hidden 
              from the sea. Imagine: pure white sand and enough dope to smoke 
              all day every day for the rest of your life. Only a few know exactly 
              where it is and they won't tell anyone.</p>
            <p>　　SAMMY</p>
            <p>　　Of course no one's actually ever met any of these people, only 
              met someone who has. You know what I mean. It's a Kentucky fried 
              mouse.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I hadn't heard that one before. But it's good. It's a good story.</p>
            <p>　　A torch shines on them, jolting them into some sort of reaction 
              and a woman's voice calls out.</p>

            <p>　　They flit thorugh a lest dense forest, up a slope, looking carefully 
              around as they go.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　The most satisfying aspec, of course, was that Monseigneur Practical, 
              Mr. Timetable, Mr I'll-sort-it-out-with-a-local-fisherman, he turned 
              out to be not so hot in your actual primordial fight or flight situation, 
              your combat zone, where what it takes to stay alive is quick thinking 
              and nerves of steel. I didn't need to say anything. I knew it, and 
              so did he.</p>
            <p>　　They reach the top of the hill. Richard looks back. Down below 
              they can see the dope fields.</p>
            <p>　　They continue</p>
            <p>　　EXT. FOREST. DAY.</p>
            <p>　　They are travelling downhill now, beside a stream.</p>
            <p>　　They stop to drink from it.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　If we follow this down, it should lead us all the way to the 
              lagoon.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　That's right, all the way down.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V. O.)</p>
            <p>　　He was right. All we had to do was follow the water and we'd 
              be in paradise. Only I twasn't going to be that easy.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. WATERFALL. DAY.</p>
            <p>　　Water thunders from a clifftop to a pool</p>
            <p>　　Etienne and Francoise are lying flat on a rock, peering over 
              the edge of this high waterfall. It falls in a single giant step.</p>
            <p>　　On either side of the waterfall, cliffs curve away to form a 
              massive circle enclosing the lagoon and an area of land covered 
              in forest.</p>
            <p>　　Etienne crawls back a few paces to where Richard is sitting on 
              a rock. Francoise continues to look over.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　Well, Richard, how are we going to get down?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Why are you asking me?</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　Why shouldn't I?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Because you can have an opinion too.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　I have an opinion</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　OK, so let's hear it.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　We'll jump.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Don't be stupid. Etienne?</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　We'll climb down over there.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　There?</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　So, what do you think?</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Listen to me - we can jump.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　No, if we try to climb there we'll all be killed. Over there 
              looks better.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　Maybe we could make a rope out of some creepers.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Yes, or maybe we could build a hang glider and a giant staircase.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　(Shouting)</p>
            <p>　　Please!</p>
            <p>　　They turn to her. She is standing with her back to the drop.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　What?</p>
            <p>　　She turns around.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　No!</p>
            <p>　　She jumps.</p>
            <p>　　She falls towards and into the pool.</p>
            <p>　　Richard and Etienne scramble to the edge and peer over.</p>
            <p>　　She surfaces and waves.</p>
            <p>　　Richard and Etienne look at each other.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　OK, so we'll jump.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. WATERFALL. DAY.</p>
            <p>　　Richard and Etienne jump.</p>
            <p>　　They sink and then surface.</p>
            <p>　　All three are ecstatic and elated, charged with the excitement 
              of the fall and the joy of a journey's end. They exchange hugs and 
              kisses.</p>
            <p>　　They become aware of a single person clapping slowly.</p>
            <p>　　They turn to see Keaty, a young Afro-Caribbean Londoner, standing 
              a few paces away.</p>
            <p>　　KEATY</p>
            <p>　　Congratulation. It took me the best part of an hour to work up 
              the balls to do that. Mind you, I was alone, so you have to make 
              allowances.</p>
            <p>　　They say nothing.</p>
            <p>　　KEATY</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　I'm Keaty.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Are there many people here?</p>
            <p>　　Keaty raises a hand to stop Richard's question.</p>
            <p>　　KEATY</p>
            <p>　　The Q and A comes later. First of all, I think you'd better meet 
              Sal.</p>
            <p>　　INT. LONGHOUSE. DAY.</p>
            <p>　　Sal, a woman in her early thirties, is seated on the floor opposite 
              Richard, Francoise, and Etienne.</p>
            <p>　　Sal is studying Daffy's map. She hands it back to Richard.</p>
            <p>　　Gathered around them are about twenty assorted inhabitants of 
              various nationalities, all weathered travelers in their twenties 
              or thirties.</p>
            <p>　　The longhouse is single story building made from wood and bamboo 
              lattice, about thirty meters long. It is divided up by low partitions 
              into single or double sleeping areas, some of which are personalized, 
              others not. There is also an open area where this action takes place.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　At first they were more interested in the map than us. It seems 
              that Daffy, the guy who drew it, he was a founding father, he discovered 
              this places and set up the community five years ago. Then about 
              one year ago he starts to get depressed, six months later he leaves 
              and that's the last they hear till we turn up.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　He's dead. He cut his wrists open in a hotel room on the Khao 
              San Road. The police didn't know what to do with the body. I guess 
              they'll incinerate him or something.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Do you tink he gave a mpa like this to anyone else.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I don't know. I don't think so.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　And you, have you told anyone or shown anyone this map?</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　No.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　No.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　No.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Good.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. ISLAND SCENES. DAY/NIGHT.</p>
            <p>　　Commence a montage of various scenes of island life involving 
              its citizens and the newcomers.</p>
            <p>　　The longhouse stands at one edge of a clearing, dominating it. 
              Scattered around are several other smaller huts and a few tents. 
              Other locations are the beach, the garden, and the forest.</p>
            <p>　　We see the inhabitants</p>
            <p>　　at work in the garden </p>
            <p>　　in the lagoon </p>
            <p>　　relaxing on the beach </p>
            <p>　　around the fire at night</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　Now I've got to say that my first impressions were not favorable. 
              Oh God, I thought, it's a tribe of hippies. I thought we'd have 
              to talk about our positive energies a lot, kiss the earth every 
              morning and recycle our waste products by some unspeakable mechanism. 
              Fortunately not. It really was some kind of a paradise. We grew 
              some fruit and some dope. The farmers on the other side left us 
              alone and we didn't trespass on their turf.</p>
            <p>　　INT. LONGHOUSE. DAY </p>
            <p>　　Everyone, including Francoise, Etiennne and Richard is sitting 
              around a big wooden table set for dinner. Two people are serving 
              side dishes of vegetables and rice.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　Sal was the leader but it wasn't a big deal. There wasn't any 
              ideology or shit like that, it was just a beach resort for people 
              who don't like beach resorts.</p>
            <p>　　One man begins drumming softly on the table with his hands. Another 
              joins in, then another. Soon everyone is tapping out a rhythm, against 
              the table or a bottle or a coconut shell, using their hands or a 
              knife or chopsticks.</p>
            <p>　　This is intercut with the following scene to the point where 
              the newcomers have joined in and it reaches a crescendo as the main 
              dish -a massive complete swordfish, is served.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. ISLAND SCENES. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Various characters are introduced in different locations; at 
              work or at rest; speaking to Richard or (as if to him) to camera.</p>
            <p>　　First the three Swedes.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD(V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　There was the Swedes: Christo, Sten, and Karl.</p>
            <p>　　CHRISTO</p>
            <p>　　We like fishing</p>
            <p>　　KARL</p>
            <p>　　Fishing. Yeah.</p>
            <p>　　STEN</p>
            <p>　　Yeah.</p>
            <p>　　CHRISTO</p>
            <p>　　And in the winter we like skiing.</p>
            <p>　　KARL</p>
            <p>　　Yeah.</p>
            <p>　　STEN</p>
            <p>　　Yeah.</p>
            <p>　　CHRISTO</p>
            <p>　　But in Thailand - there is no skiing.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　Then there were the Yugoslavian girls.</p>
            <p>　　SONJA</p>
            <p>　　We are from Sarajevo.</p>
            <p>　　MIRJANA</p>
            <p>　　Our hearts are full of loss</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I'm sorry.</p>
            <p>　　They start laughing at him</p>
            <p>　　SONJA</p>
            <p>　　It's alright.</p>
            <p>　　MIRJANA</p>
            <p>　　We tell everyone that.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　There was the Weathergirl.</p>
            <p>　　WEATHERGIRL</p>
            <p>　　I feel a tightness in my pelvis; it's gonna rain.</p>
            <p>　　Heavy rain falls.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　And yes, unfortunately, there was a man with a guitar.</p>
            <p>　　GUITARMAN</p>
            <p>　　(singing badly)</p>
            <p>　　&quot;Come as you are, as you were, and as I want you to be…&quot;</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD(V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　The only person I didn't like was Sal's boyfriend, Bugs. He was 
              one of those pricks who just won't shut up about all the great things 
              they've seen and done, all of which are just that little bit better, 
              bigger, more dangerous, more extreme, more remote, more unusual, 
              more thi more that more fucking everything than anything you've 
              ever done.</p>
            <p>　　BUGS</p>
            <p>　　We were in the dessert for three weeks. It's forty-eight in the 
              shade and there's bugger all of that to speak of. We're on one and 
              half liters a day; it's practically suicide. But every morning we'd 
              look east and see the sunrise, and I'd thing, if I die today - it's 
              worth it.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　The local diet was pretty good and most evenings we'd smoke some 
              dope. Most afternoons too, as a matter of fact, but I had a personal 
              rule never to smoke before lunch, although as time went on I allowed 
              myself a certain number of - special occasions&quot;.</p>
            <p>　　Richard smokes dope.</p>
            <p>　　INT. LONGHOUSE. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　The drumming reaches its crescendo and the swordfish is laid 
              out.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　This became our world. Pretty soon nothing else mattered anymore: 
              family, friend, future achievements - who cares. Back home was just 
              standing behind a counter all day wearing a stupid fucking hat saying, 
              &quot;how can I help you sir, eat in or take away?&quot; All gone, 
              all faded away. I settled in. I found my vocation.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BEACH. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Richard, Etienne, and Francoise are standing in waist-deep water. 
              Each is holding a bamboo spear.</p>
            <p>　　Their hair is longer and their tans deeper than when they arrived.</p>
            <p>　　They are watching Christo who stands a short distance away, spear 
              poised for the kill while he talks through the process.</p>
            <p>　　CHRISTO</p>
            <p>　　OK. Now you stand still. You wait. The fish come. You wait until 
              the fish are still. They trust you. You wait.</p>
            <p>　　His speech is hypnotic, calming. His students take in the view.</p>
            <p>　　CHRISTO</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　And then-</p>
            <p>　　He suddenly throws the spear into the water. He lifts it out 
              triumphant.</p>
            <p>　　CHRISTO</p>
            <p>　　(continuing) </p>
            <p>　　You kill</p>
            <p>　　A dying fish wriggles on the end of the spear.</p>
            <p>　　CHRISTO</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　Now, you try.</p>
            <p>　　Richard, Etienne and Francoise wade apart a little and into deeper 
              water. They wait and look.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. UNDERWATER. DAY &amp; EXT. SURFACE. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Their feet and legs are visible. At first nothing is happening, 
              then a few fish swim into view.</p>
            <p>　　Richard throws and misses. The other two throw and miss.</p>
            <p>　　CHRISTO</p>
            <p>　　No, no, no. Too fast. Slowly.</p>
            <p>　　They pause</p>
            <p>　　Richard throws. He hauls his spear from the water.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Yo!</p>
            <p>　　A decent sized fish wriggles on the end.</p>
            <p>　　CHRISTO</p>
            <p>　　You are a natural!</p>
            <p>　　They all congratulate him.</p>

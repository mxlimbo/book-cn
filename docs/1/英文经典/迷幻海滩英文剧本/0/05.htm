            <p>　　A bamboo spear, loaded with fish like a giant kebab, is carried 
              across the clearing towards the cooking area wehre the chef and 
              his helpers are at work.</p>
            <p>　　The spear is held by richard who smiles as he deposits the fish 
              on the broad wooden chopping surface.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　That's right, I had an aptitude, a hidden talent. All these years 
              I'm good for nothing, turns out I'm a full-on old fashioned hunter 
              fucking gatherer.</p>
            <p>　　INT. LONGHOUSE. DAY </p>
            <p>　　As Richard enters there are only a few people inside.</p>
            <p>　　He walks to the partitioned area and looks for a packet of cigarettes 
              among his possessions.</p>
            <p>　　Opposite to him, Keaty is lying down, reading the Bible.</p>
            <p>　　KEATY</p>
            <p>　　Ah, the hunter gatherer returns. Satisfied with a good day's 
              killing amongst the fruits of the sea?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　That's me: a good day's killing.</p>
            <p>　　KEATY</p>
            <p>　　God has smiled on you.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　He has?</p>
            <p>　　KEATY</p>
            <p>　　He has made you sharp of eye and swift of limb. In other words, 
              you catch a lot of fish, you'll be very popular around here.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Great.</p>
            <p>　　KEATY</p>
            <p>　　Don't forget to thank Him, will you?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I'll try.</p>
            <p>　　KEATY</p>
            <p>　　He'd appreciate that. Anyway, first day's fishing, first day's 
              catch, you lot are just about ready to join the community.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I thought we already had.</p>
            <p>　　KEATY</p>
            <p>　　Not yet baptized, my son, not yet baptized.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. CLEARING. NIGHT </p>
            <p>　　A blade burns in the fire.</p>
            <p>　　Keaty lifts the knife from the fire.</p>
            <p>　　The entire community is assembled, watching. </p>
            <p>　　He takes Etienne's wrist.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　Every society must have its rituals. They're what binds you together, 
              they tell you that you belong. Ours was simple. Last one to arrive 
              tattoos the next.</p>
            <p>　　KEATY</p>
            <p>　　It hurts. OK?</p>
            <p>　　Etienne nods.</p>
            <p>　　Keaty swiftly cuts the simple symbol just below Etienne's shoulder 
              and smears blue powder into the cut.</p>
            <p>　　Etienne winces.</p>
            <p>　　Keaty finishes and hands the knife to Etienne who heats the blade 
              briefly in the fire before he turns to Francoise. He kisses her 
              arm before he cuts.</p>
            <p>　　Francoise takes the knife.</p>
            <p>　　Richard offers his arm. She grips it tightly. She hesitates.</p>
            <p>　　He looks into her eyes.</p>
            <p>　　She cuts. He grimaces. She works on, holding his arm.</p>
            <p>　　INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　A few candles still burn as people prepare to turn in for the 
              night. Richard is lying in his sleeping area. He is watching Francoise.</p>
            <p>　　She is standing, visible only from the waist up above a partition. 
              She is inspecting her tattoo.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　All the excitement of arrival had given me something to think 
              about, but it wasn't enough to displace my major preoccupation. 
              You can go to the most beautiful place in the world, but the sunlight 
              shall not bleach they passion, nor the tide wash away thy desire.</p>
            <p>　　A hand. Etienne's appears from below, beckoning her down.</p>
            <p>　　She takes the hand.</p>
            <p>　　Just for a moment her eyes meet Richard's and then she lowers 
              herself towards the ground, disappearing from view.</p>
            <p>　　The last candle is extinguished.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BEACH. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　A game of soccer is in progress, involving most of the population, 
              men and woman.</p>
            <p>　　Etienne is playing well.</p>
            <p>　　A few people, not involved in the game, are scattered along the 
              beach, relaxing. Amongst these are Francoise and Richard, who is 
              watching the game.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　He's good.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Who?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Etienne. He's good at soccer.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Oh, I wouldn't know.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　You don't like soccer?</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　No. It's so boring.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Yea, but he is good. Look. Nearly scored.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Is that good or bad?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I think it's good. Not that I think there's anything good about 
              being good at soccer. Anyone could do that. I could do it if I wanted 
              to. I just don't want to. That's all.</p>
            <p>　　She sits up.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Richard.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Yes?</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　What are you talking about?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I don't know. Just conversation.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Do you have a girlfriend?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Here?</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Anywhere</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　No. Why?</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Just conversation.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I'm not jealous, if that's what you're thinking.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　No, it's what you are thinking. You are far from home. You meet 
              a girl. It's exciting, why not? You are attracted to her - it's 
              in your eyes. Perhaps in hers as well. So you think something might 
              happen; it's easy to believe, it's exciting. But she has a boyfriend 
              so you are jealous. Don't worry. It's natural. Now I have seen enough 
              football. Shall we swim?</p>
            <p>　　Richard is stunned.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　So would I be wrong?</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　What?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　If I thought something might happen - would I be wrong?</p>
            <p>　　She touches him.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Richard, how would I know? I don't know any more than you.</p>
            <p>　　She walks away.</p>
            <p>　　Richard watches her go. He turns to the football.</p>
            <p>　　Etienne scores.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　And that's all it takes. Nothing more than a few words and the 
              softest touch and your life is different, won't ever be the same 
              again. Man dies, leaves you the mystery map to the secret island: 
              happens every day. But you get a smile from someone you want: well 
              that's special, that's worth the journey.</p>
            <p>　　INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT.</p>
            <p>　　Richard is sitting in his bed.</p>
            <p>　　He is watching Francoise in conversation with Keaty across the 
              other side of the room. During Richards (V.O.) their conversation 
              ends and Keaty walks away, leaving Francoise momentarily alone.</p>
            <p>　　Most of the population is present in the room. Sal is reading.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　I would have liked to have continued our discussion, to thrash 
              out the details of our forthcoming affair, but every time I had 
              the chance to catch her alone, something always got in the way.</p>
            <p>　　Francoise is alone now. Richard is about to move across when 
              the center of the room is occupied by commotion.</p>
            <p>　　At the heart of this are Bugs, and an Italian man, Gregorio. 
              Bugs is holding a pair of pliers. Gregorio is in pain.</p>
            <p>　　Richard watches.</p>
            <p>　　BUGS</p>
            <p>　　I can deal with it!</p>
            <p>　　GREGORIO</p>
            <p>　　I don't want you to deal with it.</p>
            <p>　　BUGS</p>
            <p>　　It won't take a minute.</p>
            <p>　　GREGORIO</p>
            <p>　　No! Please, no! I must go to the mainland.</p>
            <p>　　Onlookers join in.</p>
            <p>　　VARIOUS</p>
            <p>　　No way/ You can't go to the mainland/ No, etc.</p>
            <p>　　GREGORIO</p>
            <p>　　Sal!</p>
            <p>　　Sal looks up for the first time.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　Sorry, I wasn't really tuned in. You want to go to the mainland? 
              To see a dentist, is that it?</p>
            <p>　　GREGORIO</p>
            <p>　　Yes.</p>
            <p>　　Sal is casual but firm.</p>
            <p>　　SAL</p>
            <p>　　No. It's out of the question.</p>
            <p>　　She returns to the book.</p>
            <p>　　With help from two or three other people, Bgs drags Gregorio 
              to the floor and rips out the offending tooth with a pair of pliers. 
              Gregorio screams.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　I was sort of disturbed by this, but really only by the method, 
              by the way that Bugs handled it. But the guy couldn't leave; I could 
              see that. When you have something secret, everyone's got to take 
              responsibility to keep it that way.</p>
            <p>　　Francoise has gone.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. BEACH. DAY </p>
            <p>　　A tropical lightening storm is in progress.</p>
            <p>　　At the edge of the beach, Christo, Richard, Sten, and Karl are 
              standing under the ineffectual shelter of a palm tree, ecah holding 
              their spear. A short distance away, under anotehr tree, sit Francoise 
              and Etienne, hand in hand.</p>
            <p>　　They are all contemplating the sea and the sky. Christo has a 
              swimming mask and a snorkel.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　In any case, I was more concerned about the Francoise situation. 
              After such a promising start, it just didn't seem to be reaching 
              its natural conclusion. In truth it was beginning to annoy me; I 
              mean what's the use of being in paradise if you can't have whatever 
              you want. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that the whole idea?</p>
            <p>　　CHRISTO</p>
            <p>　　The problem is seeing the fish. With the rain and the poor light, 
              they are very difficult to catch. It could last for days. Sometimes 
              when it rains, we get hungry.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Hey, Etienne, you going fishing?</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　I don't know, maybe if - </p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Don't' worry. You just sit there. I'll go, OK? I'll go. You just 
              sit there.</p>
            <p>　　He takes the mask and snorkel from Christo and marches down towards 
              the sea.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　Good luck</p>
            <p>　　Richard looks back at them but says nothing. He pulls the mask 
              on and resumes his march into the sea.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. LAGOON. DAY. AND UNDERWATER. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　Richard swims along near the sea-bed past rocks and coral but 
              can see no fish.</p>
            <p>　　He surfaces and swims further out.</p>
            <p>　　He hears shouts from the shore. He turns and treads water.</p>
            <p>　　The shouts from his colleagues are indistinct, carried away by 
              the wind and the rain.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　(Shouting)</p>
            <p>　　I can't hear.</p>
            <p>　　He takes the mask off to clean the lens.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　(Continuing)</p>
            <p>　　And you can't hear me.</p>
            <p>　　He puts the mask back on and turns away from the shore.</p>
            <p>　　He freezes.</p>
            <p>　　There is a shark's fin in the water, moving towards him.</p>
            <p>　　He looks around. The shore seems far away. He starts swimming 
              frantically towards it.</p>
            <p>　　The shark closes in.</p>
            <p>　　Richard submerges and turns to face the shark.</p>
            <p>　　The shark approaches head on. It is about five feet long with 
              the appropriate teeth.</p>
            <p>　　Richard is terrified, convinced he is about to die.</p>
            <p>　　The shark swoops towards him at speed.</p>
            <p>　　It stops, its teeth centimeters from his mask. It pauses then 
              flicks its tail and swims past Richard.</p>
            <p>　　He is astonished.</p>
            <p>　　It circles him and approaches again, pausing just in front.</p>
            <p>　　Tentatively, Richard raises a hand.</p>
            <p>　　The shark does not react.</p>
            <p>　　Richard pats it gently on its snout.</p>
            <p>　　It swims around him again.</p>
            <p>　　Richard sees small fish swimming around him. He spears one and 
              holds it out on the tip of his spear.</p>
            <p>　　The shark snatches it off and repeats its circle but does not 
              threaten Richard.</p>
            <p>　　He smiles.</p>
            <p>　　As it approaches again, he holds the spear in both hands and 
              lowers it by his side.</p>
            <p>　　The shark bobs in front of him, curious and friendly.</p>
            <p>　　Richard's arms begin their forward motion as his V.O. commences.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　I ducked to one side, then to the other as it passed me. First 
              on my left, then on my right. </p>
            <p>　　INT. LONGHOUSE. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Grilled shark steaks have been passed around and eaten by all 
              while Richard stands and relates his adventure. He cannot resist 
              a glance at Francoise, who listens with rapt attention.</p>

            <p>　　A single headlamp in close up shines directly and brightly out</p>
            <p>　　Extreme noise and light.</p>
            <p>　　Beyond its glare can be seen the outline of a motorized tricycle 
              (&quot;tuk-tud&quot;) and its Thai driver</p>
            <p>　　A young man, Richard, sits in the back, his rucksack beside him, 
              swaying with the motion of the vehicle. He is worn and sweating.</p>
            <p>　　They travel through nocturnal Bangkok: fleets of tuk-tuks, taxis, 
              road works, food vendors, dogs, tourists.</p>
            <p>　　Music and credits.</p>
            <p>　　EXT. KHAO SAN ROAD. NIGHT </p>
            <p>　　The bright headlight comes to a halt. </p>
            <p>　　Richard climbs down from the tuk-tuk</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　When you hit Bangkok, there's really only one place to go.</p>
            <p>　　The street is busy, full of Thai's and travelers.</p>
            <p>　　Richard picks his way through the crowd, his rucksack on his 
              back.</p>
            <p>　　He absorbs the scene as he passes boarding houses and hotels, 
              and the shops and stalls selling food, clothes, pirated tapes, jewelry, 
              travel tickets, and international phone calls. Restaurantes are 
              filled with western travelers watching American films or European 
              sport.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　The Khao San Road is a decompression chamber between east and 
              west. It's where you learn to breathe car fumes and tropical air 
              for the very first time, or else carefully rearrange your memories 
              before you catch your flight home.</p>
            <p>　　Richard is approached by a young male Thai Hustler who walks 
              backwards in front of him while making his pitch.</p>
            <p>　　HUSTLER</p>
            <p>　　You need somewhere to stay?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD </p>
            <p>　　I'll be OK, Thanks.</p>
            <p>　　Richard politely ignores each of his subsequent offers.</p>
            <p>　　HUSTLER</p>
            <p>　　What do you want? Sell your passport? Buy passport? Airline tickets? 
              You want silk? I'll take you to the best silk place? You get a suit 
              in twenty-four hours. Diamonds? You want to come with me, you get 
              present for your girlfriend. Maybe no girlfriend. You want a girl, 
              no problem. Good time. Boy girl fucking no problem. You want to 
              drink some snake blood?</p>
            <p>　　At this last one Richard stops and addresses the Hustler.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　No thanks.</p>
            <p>　　Richard walks on, the hustler fading out behind him.</p>
            <p>　　HUSTLER</p>
            <p>　　You want designer clothes? I get you Versache, Gucci, Armani, 
              no problem. You want a camera, all the best makes: Nikon, Leica, 
              Canon I can get you.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.) </p>
            <p>　　Yeah, it's all here: you an phone home, meet up with strangers, 
              split up with your friends, watch Hollywood movies while you sip 
              Budweiser and eat a burger or get some massage and green chicken 
              soup. You could be anywhere in the world bu you could only find 
              it here. And what do they want, all these people?</p>
            <p>　　EXT. KHAO SAN ROAD. NIGHT./ INT. BARS AND SHOPS. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Various young travelers, male and female, in snapsho9t exerpts, 
              address their comments to the camera or each other.</p>
            <p>　　TRAVELER 1</p>
            <p>　　Where you been?</p>

            <p>　　Where you going?</p>
            <p>　　TRAVELER 3</p>
            <p>　　I've been there</p>
            <p>　　TRAVELER 4</p>
            <p>　　It's a waste of time</p>
            <p>　　TRAVELER1</p>
            <p>　　We just got back</p>
            <p>　　TRAVELER2</p>
            <p>　　Fantastic</p>
            <p>　　TRAVELER 3</p>
            <p>　　How much did it cost?</p>
            <p>　　TRAVELER5</p>
            <p>　　A complete rip off.</p>
            <p>　　TRAVELER3</p>
            <p>　　Too many people. There's a much better place along the coast.</p>
            <p>　　TRAVELER 4</p>
            <p>　　We're going exploring. We've read this book. It tells us all 
              the best places to explore.</p>
            <p>　　TRAVELER 2</p>
            <p>　　I know a place that everyone says is really unspoiled.</p>
            <p>　　TRAVELER 1</p>
            <p>　　I heard they built a big hotel there.</p>
            <p>　　TRAVELER 5</p>
            <p>　　Some sort of sewage problem, apparently.</p>
            <p>　　TRAVELER 1</p>
            <p>　　We're going anyway: all the rooms have got air conditioning.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　But for me it's all about finding out something about a place, 
              and something about yourself. And when you get off the beaten track, 
              that's where you find out what there is to find out.</p>
            <p>　　Richard turns into one of the restaurants.</p>
            <p>　　INT. RESTAURANT. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　The restaurant extends deeply back away from the street. Richard 
              passes many diners not dissimilar to himself. Some are talking, 
              many are engrossed in the video entertainment.</p>
            <p>　　At the back he reaches a reception desk where he drops his pack.</p>
            <p>　　A Thai female HOTEL RECEPTIONIST sits behind the desk. She immediately 
              shows Richard a &quot;menu&quot; of available rooms. The menu offers 
              a spread of prices for single/double/window/fan/aircon/bathroom.</p>
            <p>　　Richard points to the cheapest combination and hands over 300 
              baht.</p>
            <p>　　The Receptionist becomes aware that he is being started at.</p>
            <p>　　A worn, disheveled man in his mid-thirties is standing at the 
              nearby bar, a bottle in his hand, studying Richard. This is Daffy.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Good evening.</p>
            <p>　　Daffy says nothing but continues to stare and takes a drink.</p>
            <p>　　Richard will not be stared down. Neither turns away.</p>
            <p>　　The Receptionist passes over a key and smiles broadly.</p>
            <p>　　HOTEL RECEPTIONIST</p>
            <p>　　Welcome to Thailand.</p>
            <p>　　Richard turns to her.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Thank you.</p>
            <p>　　INT SHOWER. NIGHT </p>
            <p>　　In a small windowless shower room, Richard stands motionless, 
              eyes closed, facing with pleasure the spray of cold water.</p>
            <p>　　INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. NIGHT </p>
            <p>　　The sound of the shower can be heard through a door marked with 
              a shower sign.</p>
            <p>　　The sound stops and the door is opened. Richard emerges with 
              a towel wrapped around his waist, carrying his key and washbag.</p>
            <p>　　He walks the short distance to his room. He puts the key in the 
              door but the lock is stiff and he has to fiddle with it, bent over 
              and dripping water on the floor.</p>
            <p>　　While he is doing so, the sound of footsteps climbing nearby 
              stairs can be heard.</p>
            <p>　　There is the sound of a loud wolf-whistle.</p>
            <p>　　Richard turns to the source of the whistle.</p>
            <p>　　A beautiful European woman is smiling at him. This is Francoise. 
              She approaches and takes the key from his hand. She turns the key 
              in one direction, then the other, while twisting the handle.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOIS</p>
            <p>　　Et voila.</p>
            <p>　　The door swings gently open. She stands back</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Thank you.</p>
            <p>　　Footsteps approach from the stair.</p>
            <p>　　Francoise is joined by a young man, ETIENNE, who catches up with 
              her. He nods at Richard as he takes her arm. They walk away from 
              Richard to the next door.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Bonsoir.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Eh - bonsoir.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　Goodnight.</p>
            <p>　　The couple reach their door. They enter their room and the door 
              is closed behind them.</p>
            <p>　　Alone in the corridor again, Richard contemplates their presence.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD (V.O.)</p>
            <p>　　I was traveling alone for two reasons. First of all, being alone 
              allows you more opportunity to absorb your experiences on a personal 
              level. Secondly, and this I felt acutely at that moment, there was 
              no one who wanted to go with me.</p>
            <p>　　INT RESTAURANT. NIGHT </p>
            <p>　　Richard is in the restaurant which is quiet now.</p>
            <p>　　He is alone at a table eating and drinking. On a high shelf several 
              feet away a Hollywood action film, all gunshots, car chases, and 
              explosions, plays on the television.</p>
            <p>　　Most of the tables around him are empty.</p>
            <p>　　Richard is interrupted by the man he met earlier, Daffy, who 
              pulls up a chair beside him.</p>
            <p>　　DAFFY</p>
            <p>　　Excuse me.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Yes?</p>
            <p>　　DAFFY</p>
            <p>　　I'm Daffy.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Richard. Hi.</p>
            <p>　　DAFFY</p>
            <p>　　Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could 
              help me out.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Help you out?</p>
            <p>　　DAFFY</p>
            <p>　　Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I'm sorry, I don't think so.</p>
            <p>　　DAFFY</p>
            <p>　　I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the 
              moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the 
              street in Bangkok, that's bad.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget 
              myself. I just can't afford it.</p>
            <p>　　DAFFY</p>
            <p>　　Just five dollars, please.</p>
            <p>　　He leans in close to Richard</p>
            <p>　　DAFFY</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　I'll share something with you.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.</p>
            <p>　　Daffy retreats.</p>
            <p>　　Richard turns back to the video and his food.</p>
            <p>　　Daffy approaches two young women sitting at a nearby table.</p>
            <p>　　DAFFY</p>
            <p>　　Excuse me, ladies, is there any chance you could help me out. 
              I'm down on my luck at the moment.</p>
            <p>　　The two young women seem uncomfortable. Richard notices.</p>
            <p>　　DAFFY</p>
            <p>　　(continuing)</p>
            <p>　　if you could see your way to lending me some cash -</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Here.</p>
            <p>　　He leans across and holds out a ten dollar note for Daffy.</p>
            <p>　　DAFFY</p>
            <p>　　Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Just take it, OK.</p>
            <p>　　Daffy takes it.</p>
            <p>　　Richard returns to the video as a big yellow explosion is reflected 
              on his face.</p>
            <p>　　INT. RICHARD'S HOTEL ROOM. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Some light enters from the street through a small window.</p>
            <p>　　Richard lies on his bed, watching the fan rotate above him.</p>
            <p>　　He is listening to the sound of Etienne and Francoise engaging 
              in noisy sex. They reach the climax of their activity and fall silent.</p>
            <p>　　Richard just has time to enjoy the silence when a new disturbance 
              begins, this time from the next room in the other direction. It 
              is a man, Daffy, banging on the wall just above Richard's head and 
              shouting in time.</p>
            <p>　　DAFFY (O.S.)</p>
            <p>　　Have. You. Got. Anything. To. Smoke.</p>
            <p>　　Have. You. Got. Anything. To. -</p>
            <p>　　INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. NIGHT. </p>
            <p>　　Richard knocks sharply on the door of Daffy's room.</p>
            <p>　　The door is opened immediately by Daffy, looking even worse then 
              before.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　No, I don't have anything to smoke.</p>
            <p>　　Daffy stares at him for a moment. Recognition dawns.</p>
            <p>　　DAFFY</p>
            <p>　　You. You're the guy that lent me the money.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some 
              sleep.</p>
            <p>　　DAFFY</p>
            <p>　　Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like 
              to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No 
              one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What 
              do you say?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some 
              sleep. So if you could be quiet -</p>
            <p>　　DAFFY</p>
            <p>　　Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Thanks.</p>
            <p>　　Richard turns away.</p>
            <p>　　DAFFY</p>
            <p>　　Richard -</p>
            <p>　　He turns back.</p>
            <p>　　DAFFY</p>
            <p>　　(Continuing)</p>
            <p>　　Been nice knowing you.</p>
            <p>　　He sticks his hand out.</p>
            <p>　　Richard politely reciprocates.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Sure.</p>
            <p>　　They shake hands.</p>
            <p>　　INT. EXT. RESTAURANT. DAY. </p>
            <p>　　The restaurant fronts on to the street where a new day's activity 
              is beginning.</p>
            <p>　　Richard watches this as he eats his breakfast.</p>
            <p>　　He notices Etienne and Francoise sti down at the next table.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Bonjour.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　Good morning.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　Did you sleep well?</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Not too bad.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　I hope our noise did not keep you awake.</p>
            <p>　　Richard looks from one to the other.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　She means your neighbor. The Scotsman</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　We moved rooms because of him.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　He tried to borrow money from us.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　It's on an island that no one get to.</p>
            <p>　　FRANCOISE</p>
            <p>　　But he has been there, off course.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.</p>
            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You 
              know, that no one could get to.</p>
            <p>　　ETIENNE</p>
            <p>　　Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, 
              they'd all be there.</p>
            <p>　　INT. TRAVEL AGENT'S. DAY </p>

            <p>　　RICHARD</p>
            <p>　　Twenty Marlboro light, please.</p>
            <p>　　Instantly the Travel Agent produces the packet of cigarettes 
              from a shelf and lays them on the counter.</p>

                It was an accident. They got in<br>
                the line of fire.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                Four shootings in five years. All<br>

                You want a name from the present?<br>
                How about Hazel Dobkins?</p>
              <p>She looks at him a long beat, sips her drink, never takesher

                Noah was my counselor in my<br>
                freshman year.<br>
                (she smiles)<br>
                That's probably where I got the<br>
                idea for the icepick. For my book.<br>
                Funny how the subconscious works.<br>

                Yes. She's helped me understand<br>
                homicidal impulse.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Didn't you study it in school?</p>

                You know all about homicidal<br>

                in theory -- in practice.</p>

                What happened, Nick? Did you get<br>
                sucked into it? Did you like it too<br>
                much?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>

                (quietly)<br>
                Tell me about the coke, Nick. The<br>
                day you shot those two tourists --<br>
                how much coke did you do?</p>
              <p>She steps closer to him.</p>

                I didn't.</p>

                Yes, you did. They never tested<br>
                you, did they? But Internal<br>
                Affairs knew.</p>
              <p>They are face to face. He is still holding her roughly bythe

                Your wife knew, didn't she? She<br>
                knew what was going on. Nicky got<br>
                too close to the flame. Nicky<br>
                liked it.</p>
              <p>He twists her arm back behind her -- their bodies arepressed 
                against each other -- their eyes digging into eachother.</p>

                That's why she killed herself?</p>
              <p>He is twisting her arm, staring at her, pulling her againsthim. 
                We hear the DOOR behind them. A beat, and he letsher go, turns 
                away from her.</p>
              <p>Roxy stands there, staring at them. Her hair is up. Shewears 
                a black motorcycle jacket, a black T-shirt, and blackjeans and 
                cowboy boots.</p>

                Hiya, hon. You two have met,<br>
                haven't you?</p>
              <p>Roxy looks at Nick. Catherine goes to her, kisses herbriefly 
                on the lips, stands there with her arm around her --both of them 
                looking at Nick.</p>
              <p>He walks by them, opens the door to go, his face a mask.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                You're going to make a terrific<br>
                character, Nick.</p>
              <p>He doesn't look at her; he's gone.</p>
              <p>INT. BETH GARDNER'S OFFICE - DAY</p>
              <p>He comes in. He looks like he's going to kill someone. ARECEPTIONIST 
                sits there.</p>
              <p> RECEPTIONIST<br>
                She's on the phone -- she'll be<br>
                right with you, detective --</p>
              <p>He sweeps by her into Beth's inner office. She hangs upwhen she 
                sees the look on his face.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Who has access to my file?</p>

                what's wrong with you?</p>

                Who's got access to my goddamn file?</p>
              <p>She gets up -- he goes closer to her; she backs away fromhim.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                Nobody.</p>

                record, it'd be illegal --</p>
              <p>She backs into a wall. She looks very scared. He comesvery close 
                to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Don't, Beth. Don't lie to me.</p>
              <p>She says nothing, looks scared.</p>

              <p> NICK<br>

                (blurts it)<br>
                Nilsen.</p>
              <p>INT. THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS DIVISION - DAY</p>
              <p>He storms into the big room. He sees MARTY NILSEN. He issitting 
                behind his desk in his glass-enclosed office insidethis big room. 
                About a dozen plainclothes policemen are inthe big room.</p>
              <p>He goes by them into Nilsen's office.</p>
              <p>INT. MARTIN NILSEN'S OFFICE</p>
              <p>He closes the door. Nilsen sees the look on his face,backs his 
                chair away towards the wall.</p>
              <p> NILSEN<br>
                What do you want, Curran?</p>
              <p> 45.</p>
              <p>He goes to him, picks him up by his lapels, slams himagainst 
                the wall.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (out of control)<br>
                You sold her the file, didn't you?</p>
              <p> NILSEN<br>
                (scared)<br>
                What are you talking about?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (out of control)<br>
                What'd she pay you?</p>
              <p>He slams him against the wall again. The glass EXPLODESbehind 
                them -- a chair comes into the room. Nick isfrozen, holding Nilsen 
                by the throat against the wall.</p>
              <p> ONE OF THE I.A. GUYS<br>
                Let him go, Curran. Nice and easy.</p>
              <p>He looks back, sees two Internal Affairs men with theirguns drawn, 
                pointed at him.</p>
              <p>A beat, and he lets Nilsen go.</p>
              <p>He turns calmly and starts to walk out.</p>
              <p> NILSEN<br>
                You're on sick leave, Shooter. As<br>
                of right now. Pending the outcome<br>

              <p>EXT. THE POLICE PARKING LOT - DUSK</p>
              <p>He gets into his old Porsche. He STARTS the car up. GusMoran

              <p> GUS<br>
                No, sir. You won't. There's smoke<br>
                off yonder on the horizon. They're<br>
                gonna want your badge.</p>

                (after a beat)<br>
                You sure got real conclusive ways<br>
                of demonstrating that.</p>
              <p>They almost smile at each other, then --</p>
              <p> NICK<br>

                She knows where I live and breathe.<br>
                She's coming after me.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                (after a long beat)<br>
                What is it you got between you?</p>

              <p> GUS<br>
                Somethin', though.</p>
              <p>A beat, and then Nick looks at him.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Yeah.<br>
                (a beat)<br>

              <p>INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
              <p>He sits in front of the TV, watching a lame sitcom. Abottle of 
                Jack Daniels is half-empty in front of him. Heis smoking a cigarette.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>

                I still have my key.</p>
              <p>He looks at her, looks away at the sitcom.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                I don't want to see you, Beth.</p>
              <p>He keeps watching the sitcom. A long beat.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                (suddenly angry)<br>
                Damnit! Don't shut me out! You<br>
                owe me more than that?</p>
              <p> 47.</p>
              <p>He goes to the TV, shuts it off.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                I don't owe you anything; you don't<br>
                owe me anything.<br>
                (he looks at her)<br>
                We went to bed -- what was it? --<br>
                ten or fifteen times?<br>
                (he smiles)<br>
                It wasn't memorable enough to carry<br>
                any obligations.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                (after a long beat)<br>
                Sometimes I really hate you.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (smiles)<br>
                Yeah? Well why don't you find some<br>
                friendly therapist and work some of<br>
                that hostility out.<br>
                (a beat)<br>
                But take my advice. Put a little<br>
                more life into it than you usually<br>
                do.</p>
              <p>A beat, and she suddenly hurls herself at him in absolutefury, 
                trying to claw at his face. He grabs her, blocksher. They look 
                at each other a long beat and then he letsher go.</p>
              <p>The emotion of the moment is gone now -- they turn awayfrom each 
                other.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                (finally)<br>
                I'm sorry... I don't usually... act<br>
                like that.</p>
              <p>Nick looks at her a beat.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                How could you let him have my file,<br>
                Beth?</p>
              <p>A long beat, then --</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                (not looking at him)<br>
                He was going to recommend your<br>
                discharge: a behavioral<br>
                disability. I made a deal with<br>
                him. He could review the session<br>
                notes himself. It was the only way<br>
                I could keep you on the force.</p>
              <p> 48.</p>
              <p>She looks at him. He looks away from her.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                You did it for me.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                Yes. I care about you. I did it<br>
                for you.</p>
              <p>He turns away from her.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (quietly)<br>
                Get out of here, Beth.<br>
                (a beat)<br>
                Please?</p>
              <p>He goes to the Jack Daniel's, pours some more. She looksat him 
                pour it and turns to go.</p>
              <p>INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
              <p>He is asleep on the couch -- the TV is on to a blankscreen. The 
                Jack Daniel's is mostly gone. The phone onthe coffee table RINGS. 
                It RINGS again. He wakes, picksit up, listens.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Yeah.<br>
                (a beat)<br>
                Okay.</p>
              <p>He hangs it up. He sits there a long beat, staring. Helooks disturbed.</p>
              <p>EXT. THE ALLEY BEHIND THE TEN-FOUR BAR - NIGHT</p>
              <p>He walks down the alley. There are lots of police cars,flashing 
                lights, uniformed men, coroner's men.</p>
              <p>As he walks down the alley, he sees Lt. Walker, Gus, andseveral 
                of the Internal Affairs men we saw earlier inNilsen's office. 
                They are standing around a Lincoln TownCar.</p>
              <p>They look at him as he comes closer to them -- then moveaside.</p>
              <p>He can see into the car now. Martin Nilsen lies againstthe front 
                seat. He has been shot in the head. Nick stares.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                One shot. Close range. Probably<br>
                a .38 caliber revolver.</p>
              <p><br>
                49.</p>
              <p>Nick stares at Nilsen's body. They watch him.</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                Give me your gun, Nick.</p>
              <p>A beat, and then Nick gives him his gun. Walker smells it,shakes 
                his head, gives it to one of the Internal Affairsmen.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (to Walker)<br>
                You think I --</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                I don't son, but I got the minority<br>
                opinion.</p>
              <p>INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT</p>
              <p>He sits in the same room that Catherine sat in --surrounded by 
                four or five Internal Affairs men, Lt.Walker, Gus, and Captain 
                Talcott. Lt. Walker and Gus sortof sit back -- I.A. is running 
                the investigation. The samepolice stenographer -- the same plain 
                young woman -- issitting in the room who was there with Catherine.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Okay. I went after him. I lost my<br>
                temper.</p>
              <p> AN I.A. MAN<br>
                Do you have any evidence that he<br>
                showed your psychiatric file to<br>
                anyone?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                No.</p>
              <p>Beth Gardner comes into the room. They look at her.</p>
              <p> AN I.A. MAN<br>
                We'll speak to you afterwards, Dr.<br>
                Gardner.</p>
              <p>Nick gives her a look.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                I'd like to sit-in if you don't<br>
                mind.</p>
              <p> THE I.A. MAN<br>
                I'd really rather --</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> 50.</p>
              <p><br>
                TALCOTT<br>
                I don't see anything wrong with Dr.<br>
                Gardner sitting-in if Detective<br>
                Curran doesn't object.</p>
              <p>Nick looks at her, shrugs.</p>
              <p> AN I.A. MAN<br>
                Where were you tonight?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Home. Watching TV.</p>
              <p> AN I.A. MAN<br>
                All night?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Yeah.</p>
              <p> AN I.A. MAN<br>
                Were you drinking?</p>
              <p>He looks at Beth.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Yeah, I was drinking.</p>
              <p> AN I.A. MAN<br>
                When did you start drinking again?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                A couple days ago.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                I saw Detective Curran at his<br>
                apartment around ten o'clock. He<br>
                was sober and lucid. I asked him<br>
                in my capacity as his departmental<br>
                therapist about his altercation<br>
                with Lt. Nilsen. He expressed<br>
                regret and displayed no hostility.</p>
              <p> AN I.A. MAN<br>
                (to Beth)<br>
                How long were you at his apartment?</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                About fifteen minutes. I saw there<br>
                was no reason for my concern and<br>
                left.</p>
              <p>She and Nick look at each other. He looks away and lightsa cigarette.</p>

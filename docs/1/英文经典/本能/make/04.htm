              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                Maybe she did, Gus. Maybe she grew<br>
                herself an Afro and learned a left<br>
                hook and put shoe polish on her<br>
                face. Let's polygraph her again<br>
                and ask her about it.</p>

                Jack, Harry.</p>
              <p>Gus looks at him with concern.</p>
              <p>A man in his 50's -- LT. MARTIN NILSEN is suddenly there.He is 
                overweight, florid.</p>

                Black Jack, Shooter?</p>
              <p>He grins. Nick doesn't look at him.</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                We're discussing a case, Marty.</p>
              <p> NILSEN<br>
                I know that. I had no doubt of<br>

                Double, huh, Shooter?</p>
              <p>Nick turns to him. He's sitting in the booth; Nilsen isstanding

                NICK<br>
                I'm off-duty, Nilsen. You hear me?<br>
                I'm off-duty discussing a case.<br>
                Internal Affairs shouldn't have any<br>
                trouble with that. Maybe I should<br>
                put in for overtime.</p>

                You do that, Shooter. Why don't<br>
                you send it to me? I'll give it<br>
                special attention.</p>
              <p>A beat, and then Nick gets up, faces him.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                I'm gonna tell you once more,<br>
                Nilsen --</p>
              <p>Lt. Walker and Gus get up and hold Nick back.</p>
              <p>Beth Gardner, the police psychologist, is suddenly there.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                What's the problem?</p>
              <p> NILSEN<br>

                No problem, Doctor. Here comes the<br>
                Doctor just in time to save her<br>
                patient. Take care, Shooter.</p>
              <p>And he walks away. Nick still looks like he wants to goafter 
                him. Beth pulls him away from the booth.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                You okay?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>

                What else is new?</p>
              <p>A beat. He looks at her again.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                You want to get out of here?</p>

                Yes.</p>
              <p>At the booth, Gus and Lt. Walker watch the two of themleave.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                Maybe it's for old-time's sake.</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                (watches them go<br>
                out)<br>
                Sometimes I think he started<br>
                banging her just to get himself off<br>
                the hook with Internal Affairs.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>

                smiles)<br>
                He ain't that way. He's got heart.</p>

              <p>He is kissing her -- hard, rough. He forces her againstthe wall.</p>

                Don't -- please, Nick --</p>
              <p>We hear her dress RIP. He kisses her harder -- we hear herpanties 
                RIP. He gets the dress off, pushes his hands underher bra --</p>

                Please don't -- don't --</p>
              <p>He puts his mouth to her shoulder, bites it -- as they movedown 
                to the floor.</p>

                He lies on his back, staring at the ceiling.She lies next to him 
                -- the torn dress wound around her.There is a bite mark on her 
                shoulder. A long beat,silence -- then --</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                What was she like?</p>

                She said what you said she'd say.</p>
              <p>She sits up, looks away. He looks at her, puts his fingeron the 
                bite mark idly, gently. A beat, and he kisses hershoulder gently, 
                then lies back down.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                I met her at Berkeley.</p>

                You weren't making love.</p>

              <p>He walks in. He looks hung-over. He sees Gus withHarrigan and

                the end of this big room.</p>

                There was a killing. A professor.<br>

              <p>EXT. THE BEACH HOUSE AT STINSON - DAY</p>
              <p>The black Ferrari is in the driveway. He sits in anunmarked police 
                car on a hillside above the house,watching. It is a bleak, leaden 
                gray day.</p>
              <p>Catherine comes out of the house. She is dressed casually.She 
                gets into the Ferrari.</p>
              <p>INT. HIS POLICE CAR</p>
              <p>He stays behind her at a safe distance on the windingpanoramic 
                highway -- a two-lane mountain road which leadsfrom Stinson Beach 
                into Marin County.</p>
              <p> ☆☆37.</p>
              <p>She suddenly starts speeding up on this dangerous road,cutting 
                in and out, passing cars very fast.</p>
              <p>He has to start cutting around cars to keep up. This womanreally 
                drives.</p>
              <p>He cuts out and can barely pass a car without hitting aGrey Lines 
                Tour Bus head-on. Close call: sheer drops oneither side.</p>
              <p>He looks frazzled.</p>
              <p>INT. HIS POLICE CAR</p>
              <p>He is behind her at a distance on a hilly Mill Valleyroad -- 
                little streets, terraced hillsides, sharp turns.He goes slowly, 
                looks around, thinks he's lost her. Andthen he sees the black 
                Ferrari parked in front of a houseobscured by hedges.</p>
              <p>He parks the car a distance behind the Ferrari, sits therea long 
                beat. He gets out, goes carefully up to the hedges,looks. A small, 
                nondescript house. He watches. He can'tsee anything inside the 
                house.</p>
              <p>A beat, he reaches over to the mailbox and opens it. Hetakes 
                an envelope out, looks at the name: Hazel Dobkins.</p>
              <p>INT. HIS POLICE CAR - NIGHT</p>
              <p>He watches as she comes out of the house. A frail oldwoman in 
                her 70's is with her. She hugs the old woman,gets into the Ferrari, 
                STARTS it up.</p>
              <p>He waits a beat and then STARTS after her. He stays behindher 
                at a distance -- she is going slowly. And then shesuddenly GUNS 
                it, cuts her lights -- her wheels SCREECH.He GUNS his car after 
                her. He makes a turn. She is gone.There is a fork in the road. 
                He turns one way, goes a fewhundred feet.</p>
              <p>Nothing. Blackness. He stops.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (quietly)<br>
                Shit.</p>
              <p>INT. HIS POLICE CAR - NIGHT</p>
              <p>He pulls his car up to her house at Stinson Beach. Theblack Ferrari 
                is in the driveway.</p>
              <p>A light goes on in an upstairs bedroom. The curtain isdrawn. 
                He sees the outline of her body now.</p>
              <p><br>
                38.</p>
              <p>She starts to take her clothes off -- there in the window,behind 
                the curtain. He watches her body as she does analmost languorous 
                strip. His eyes are intense... ravishing.</p>
              <p>INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - NIGHT</p>
              <p>He is alone, nobody else in the big room.</p>
              <p>He sits in front of a computer. We see the screen. He haspunched 
                in:</p>
              <p> HAZEL DOBKINS, WF, 145 ALBION RD., MILL VALLEY.</p>
              <p>He is waiting for a response. We see it come on screen:</p>
              <p> NOTHING CURRENT.</p>
              <p>A long beat, as he stares at the screen, and then we seethese 
                words:</p>
              <p> RELEASED, SAN QUENTIN, JULY 7, 1965.</p>
              <p>We see him type in the words:</p>
              <p> PRIOR ARREST RECORD.</p>
              <p>A long beat, and then it comes up:</p>
              <p> HOMICIDE, JANUARY 10, 1956<br>
                SAN FRANCISCO</p>
              <p>He stares at the screen a long beat.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                (behind him)<br>
                Ain't you go nothin' better to do<br>
                than to come in here and jack off<br>
                the damn machine?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a beat; lost<br>
                in his thoughts)<br>
                What are you doing here, Pop?</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                (grins)<br>
                I came in here to jack off the damn<br>
                machine.<br>
                (a beat)<br>
                One dead psychology professor.<br>
                Noah Goldstein. Dr. Noah<br>
                Goldstein. And guess what? He was<br>
                her counselor.</p>
              <p>Nick looks at him a beat.</p>
              <p> 39.</p>
              <p><br>
                NICK<br>
                Was she ever suspect?</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                No, sir. They never even got a<br>
                statement from her.</p>
              <p>Nick sits back a long beat, his eyes off somewhere.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (slowly)<br>
                Do you remember a case -- 1956 --<br>
                Hazel Dobkins?</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                (grins)<br>
                Hell yes! Couldn't get it outta my<br>
                head for years. Still can't. Nice<br>
                little kids -- nice husband, wasn't<br>
                porkin' around -- no financial<br>
                problems. One day -- outta the<br>
                clear blue sky -- she does 'em.<br>
                All of 'em. Used a knife she got<br>
                for a wedding present. Didn't even<br>
                deny it. Sweet as honey. Said she<br>
                didn't know why she done it.</p>
              <p>Nick just stares at him.</p>
              <p>EXT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE - NEXT DAY</p>
              <p>He pulls up to the house, gets out of his unmarked policecar. 
                He stands there a beat, thinking. He walks down tothe beach entrance 
                of the house. He hears a Rolling StonesSONG playing inside. He 
                stands there. The door suddenlyopens. Catherine stands there, 
                smiles. She wears verytight-fitting spandex leotards.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                Hi.</p>
              <p>He looks at her a beat, then --</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Am I... disturbing you?</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                No. Come in.</p>
              <p>They have their eyes on each other. A beat, and she turnsto go 
                in.</p>
              <p><br>
                40.</p>
              <p>INT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE</p>
              <p>She goes in ahead of him -- he follows her inside. Hewatches 
                her body. His movements are tentative, off-balance. She turns 
                the Stones DOWN.</p>
              <p>On a table by the window, he sees a word processor. Spreadaround 
                it are newspaper clippings. They are all about him.We see the 
                headline on one: KILLER COP TO FACE POLICEREVIEW. She sees him 
                glancing at the clips.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                I'm using you for my detective. In<br>
                my book. You don't mind, do you?</p>
              <p>She smiles. He looks at her, expressionless.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                Would you like a drink? I was just<br>
                going to have one.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                No, thanks.</p>
              <p>She goes to the bar.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (smiles)<br>
                That's right. You're off the Jack<br>
                Daniels too, aren't you?</p>
              <p>She is making herself a drink. She takes the ice out andthen 
                opens a drawer and gets an icepick. It has a fatwooden end. She 
                uses the icepick on the ice, her back tohim. He watches her.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                I'd like to ask you a few more<br>
                questions.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                I'd like to ask you some, too.</p>
              <p>She turns to him, icepick in hand, smiles.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                For my book.</p>
              <p>She turns back to the ice, works on it with the pick. Sheraises 
                her arm, plunges it. Raises it, plunges it. Hewatches her.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (wary)<br>
                What kind of questions?</p>

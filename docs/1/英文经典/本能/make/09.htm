                I was just a kid. I was<br>
                experimenting. It was just that<br>
                one time.<br>
                (a beat)<br>
                She developed a... fixation... on<br>
                me. She styled her hair like mine.<br>
                She wore the same kind of clothes I<br>
                did. It scared me.</p>
              <p> 88.</p>
              <p>She looks at him, sees his look.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                Isn't that what she told you?</p>
              <p>He looks at her a long beat.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                She told me it was you. You wore<br>
                the same kind of clothes. You dyed<br>
                your hair blonde.</p>
              <p>A long beat as they look at each other.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                I did dye my hair. It didn't have<br>
                anything to do with her. I was a<br>
                redhead for a while, too.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                Did you know Noah Goldstein?</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                I had him in two classes.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                You saw all the reports, Beth!<br>
                Phil had you copied. You never<br>
                said anything!</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                What do I say -- Hey, listen, guys,<br>
                I'm not gay, but I did fuck your<br>
                suspect.<br>
                (she turns away)<br>
                I was embarrassed. It's the only<br>
                time I've been with a woman.</p>
              <p>She turns to him.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                She's really sick you know. Don't<br>
                you know what she's doing? She<br>
                knows I went to Berkeley. She<br>
                knows I knew Noah. She makes up<br>
                that story about me. She's handing<br>
                you somebody who's obsessed with he<br>
                her.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                She didn't hand you to me. She<br>
                doesn't even know who you are. She<br>
                told me about Lisa Henderson.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p></p>
              <p><br>
                ☆☆89.</p>
              <p><br>
                BETH<br>
                She knew you'd find out who Lisa<br>
                Henderson is. You're a good cop --<br>
                what did she do? Tell you casually<br>
                and make it seem irrelevant?<br>
                (she smiles)<br>
                Did she tell you in bed, Nick?<br>
                That's how I'd do it.</p>
              <p>Nick looks at her a long beat.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Why did you change your name?</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                I got married.<br>
                (a beat)<br>
                He was on staff at the clinic. I<br>
                was down in Salinas. It didn't...<br>
                last long.</p>
              <p>He gets up. He looks at her a long beat.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                Nick -- Do you really think I...<br>
                that I could kill someone... I<br>
                never even met Johnny Boz. What<br>
                about Nilsen? What possible motive<br>
                would I have to kill him?</p>
              <p>He turns to go.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                You should do something about this<br>
                lock.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                She's evil. She's brilliant. Be<br>
                careful, Nick.</p>
              <p>He looks at her.</p>
              <p>EXT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
              <p>He gets out of his Porsche. He walks toward the door.</p>
              <p>INT. HIS APARTMENT HOUSE - THE STAIRWAY</p>
              <p>He starts going up the dark stairway. There is a hand onhis neck. 
                He spins.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (smiles)<br>
                Do I scare you, Nick?</p>
              <p><br>
                90.</p>
              <p>He looks at her, doesn't say anything.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (continuing; smiles)<br>
                I just thought I'd surprise you.<br>
                (a beat)<br>
                What's the matter?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                I found Lisa Henderson.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                Did you? What's she doing?</p>
              <p>He looks at her, doesn't say anything.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                You're not going to tell me what<br>
                she's doing.<br>
                (a beat)<br>
                I thought we weren't playing games<br>
                anymore.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                I did, too.<br>
                (a beat)<br>
                She told me it was backwards -- she<br>
                said you even styled your hair the<br>
                way she did.</p>
              <p>Catherine looks at him a beat, then smiles.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                And you believed her? I even went<br>
                down to the campus police and made<br>
                out a report about her.</p>
              <p>He just looks at her.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                You still think I kill people,<br>
                don't you?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                No.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                Liar.</p>
              <p>And she's gone.</p>

                I know what that's like.</p>
              <p>INT. JOHNNY BOZ'S CLUB - NIGHT</p>
              <p>It is dark, cavernous: there are a thousand people inhere. The 
                MUSIC is ear-splitting, pulsing. Lights flash.The floor is huge. 
                At one time, this club was a church.</p>
              <p>He walks around the sides, a drink in his hand, looking forher. 
                He doesn't see her.</p>
              <p>The he catches a glimpse of Roxy. She is dancing withanother 
                woman. He watches her. She is wearing pants and ajacket, her hair 
                off to the side. She looks very masculinetonight.</p>
              <p>Roxy laughs at the other woman, leaves her on the floor,starts 
                moving through the sea of dancers. He follows herthrough the press 
                of bodies. She goes towards the men'sroom. She walks in.</p>
              <p>INT. THE MEN'S ROOM</p>
              <p>It is large, dark, shadowy: It was once the sacristy.</p>
              <p>A crowd scene: men and women. Roxy presses through them.</p>
              <p>A haze of crack smoke; we see people doing poppers.</p>
              <p>She opens the door to a toilet stall, walks in. Nick isbehind 
                her. As the door opens, he sees Catherine.</p>
              <p>She wears a black motorcycle jacket, a very short skirt,stiletto 
                heels. Her hair is up. He make-up is severe, Ithe darkness, in 
                the shadows she looks about 19. A hot 19.A hot flash-trash 19.</p>
              <p>She is in there with two men -- one of them is a big, body-built 
                black guy. She has a vial of something near her face.</p>
              <p>She sees Nick watching her. She whispers something to thetall 
                black guy. He looks at Nick, smiles a condescendingsmile. The 
                door to the stall closes</p>
              <p>INT. THE CLUB</p>
              <p>He is walking along the side, watching the floor, a drinkin his 
                hand. The song ends and it seques right into theStones's &quot;Miss 
                You.&quot;</p>
              <p>He sees her. Her black leather jacket is off.</p>
              <p><br>
                62.</p>
              <p>She wears a very tight, flimsy top, the short skirt, theheels. 
                She is dancing with Roxy and the black guy. Hewatches her move... 
                watches her body.</p>
              <p>She turns, sees him, dances, watches him... gets betweenRoxy 
                and the black guy... they sandwich her with theirbodies... keeps 
                moving, turning... eyes on him... playingto him with her body. 
                He watches.</p>
              <p>A long beat, and he goes up to them. His movements arealmost 
                trance-like. They look at each other. A long beat.Catherine stops 
                dancing. he reaches for her. She movesaway. A beat: their eyes 
                are on each other. She moves astep towards her. A beat, as they 
                look at each other...and they start to move together.</p>
              <p>Their eyes are on each other as they move, the eyesburning... 
                the movements tighter, hotter... and he suddenlygrabs her and 
                kisses her... as they keep moving... the songseques into the Stones's 
                &quot;Gimme Shelter.&quot;</p>
              <p>She is melting into him now, kissing him... Tex watches,expressionless... 
                the black guy is gone... he holds her bythe back of the neck, 
                kissing her... their bodies pressedinto each other... his hands 
                are on her butt now, pullingher into him now, almost holding her 
                up now... and thenunder her skirt, under her panties... as he 
                kisses her neck.</p>
              <p>People around them stare... he moves his hands under hertop as 
                she keeps moving with the song, her head back, herback almost 
                arching... cups her breasts now... she keepsmoving... the song 
                sweeping them into its rhythm: &quot;it'sjust a shot away, it's 
                just a kiss away, a kiss away...&quot;</p>
              <p>They devour each other. Right there on the floor. Barelyable 
                to hold it back. As Tex watches expressionless. Aspeople stop 
                dancing and stare.</p>

                She is asleep nest to him, naked.</p>

              <p>The light is too bright. He looks at himself in themirror. He 
                pours the water, lowers his head, puts coldwater on his face. 
                A long beat, he comes back up, openshis eyes. Roxy is in the mirror 
                behind him. She startleshim.</p>
              <p>He looks at her in the mirror a long beat, doesn't turn.She is 
                expressionless; she wears the same thing she wore atthe club.</p>

              <p>Roxy watches him, expressionless, from an upstairs windowof the

                We're alike, you know.</p>
              <p>A beat, he looks at her --</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Are you kidding? You think this is<br>
                my idea of morning-after<br>
                conversation?</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (keeps walking)<br>
                Do you want personal insights and<br>
                adolescent secrets? I don't do<br>
                those.</p>
              <p>The keep walking.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                You mean getting inside you isn't<br>
                going to get me any deeper into<br>
                your character.</p>
              <p>She looks a him. A beat. She smiles slowly.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                Not unless you confuse my character<br>
                with my body parts.</p>
              <p>They keep walking. A long beat.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                Were you frightened, Nicky?</p>
              <p>He looks at her.</p>
              <p> 68.</p>
              <p><br>
                NICK<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                I thought that business with the<br>
                scarf was pretty nifty.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                I told you I had a vivid<br>
                imagination.</p>
              <p>They look at each other. A long beat.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                You shouldn't play this game.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                I don't have a choice.</p>
              <p>Their eyes are into each other.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                You're in over your head.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                I know.</p>
              <p>A long beat. They look at each other.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                I've got a book to write. I'll see<br>
                you around, Shooter.</p>
              <p>A beat, and she walks away towards the house. He watchesher.</p>
              <p>INT. A COUNTRY AND WESTERN BAR - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Nick walks in. Waylon Jennings is on the JUKEBOX. Gus issitting

                What is this place? Hillbilly<br>
                heaven?</p>
              <p>He glances around.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                (loud)<br>
                Where in the fuck you been? I went<br>
                over to your place.</p>

              <p>He is drunk, slurring. Nick sees it.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Easy there, partner -- I wasn't<br>
                there.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                I went over last night, too.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (grins)<br>
                I wasn't there last night, either.</p>
              <p>Gus takes a long, drunken look at him.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                You... fucked her! Goddamn dumb<br>
                sonofabitch... You fucked her!<br>

                I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --<br>
                don't worry about it. I always use<br>
                a rubber.</p>

                You oughta use a rubber, pop. You<br>
                really should.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                (loud)<br>
                What in the hell for? You think<br>
                I'm gettin' any at my age? I don't<br>
                like blue-haired women. I don't<br>
                like 'em.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>

                You don't like punk rockers?</p>

                (loud)<br>
                Say what?</p>

                I feel fine!</p>
              <p>Nick pours him more coffee; Gus guzzles it.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                (continuing; loud)<br>
                How could you fuck her?</p>
              <p>It gets some looks from the other people in her -- Nickshushes 
                him, pours him more coffee. He drinks it.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                (continuing;<br>
                quietly)<br>
                You wanna die, son? What is it --<br>
                those goddamn tourists -- you still<br>
                feel so bad about that you're<br>
                wigglin' your way into an icepi --<br>
                (suddenly louder)<br>
                We got too many goddamn tourists<br>
                comin' here anyway -- plenty more<br>
                goddamn tourists where they goddamn<br>
                came from.</p>
              <p>Some people here really give him the looks now. Gus looksangrily 
                away from them, drinks more coffee.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a beat;<br>
                quietly)<br>
                I'm not afraid of her.</p>

                Why the hell not?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                I don't know. I'm just not.</p>

                That's her pussy talkin' --</p>
              <p>He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating acheeseburger. 
                He winks at her. The woman looks away fromhim, shaking her head.</p>

              <p>But we don't see the face itself -- the head is down, thehood 
                up. There is an icepick in the figure's hand. Thefigure explodes 
                into Gus. The icepick goes into his neck.</p>
              <p>INT. THE STAIRWAY</p>
              <p>Nick tears desperately up the stairway -- he hits thefourth floor 
                door. It explodes open.</p>
              <p>INT. THE FOURTH FLOOR</p>
              <p>He stands there a beat, sees the elevator door open. Heruns there, 
                He sees Gus, crumpled into the corner of theelevator.</p>
              <p>INT. THE ELEVATOR</p>
              <p>He goes into the elevator -- holds Gus. He is dead. Along beat. 
                He sees the gun in Gus' hand -- he takes thegun out of his hand. 
                He runs out of the elevator.</p>
              <p>INT. THE FOURTH FLOOR</p>
              <p>He hears something. Gun in hand, he runs towards theSOUND. He 
                stops, gun in hand, listens again. He runsagain, hears nothing.</p>
              <p>Behind him, we see a figure.</p>
              <p>He spins suddenly, gun, in hand. Beth Gardner is there.She wears 
                a windbreaker. She has her hands in the pockets.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                What are you doing here?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (screaming)<br>
                Put your hands up!</p>
              <p>She stares at him.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (continuing;<br>
                screams)<br>
                Put your fucking hands up! Don't<br>
                move.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                I got a message on my machine to<br>
                meet Gus here. Where is he?</p>
              <p>She smiles a strange smile. She takes a step toward him.</p>
              <p> 101.</p>
              <p><br>
                NICK<br>
                (screams)<br>
                Don't!<br>
                (a beat)<br>
                I know about your husband. You<br>
                still like girls, Beth?</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                What?</p>
              <p>She smiles strangely again, takes a step toward him.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (screams)<br>
                Take your hands out of your pockets!</p>
              <p>She moves a hand in a pocket and moves towards him fast --</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                What is wrong with you?</p>
              <p>And he FIRES the gun. She is hit in the chest, goes down.A long 
                beat, and then he goes to her. He gets down on theground. Her 
                eyes are open. He empties the pockets of thewindbreaker -- first 
                one, then the other: the pockets areempty.</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                (continuing; in a<br>
                whisper)<br>
                I loved you.</p>
              <p>And she dies.</p>
              <p>INT. THE FOURTH FLOOR - LATER</p>
              <p>A lot of policemen, coroner's guys, photos being taken.Nick stands 
                there with Lt. Walker, Harrigan, and some ofthe Internal Affairs 
                guys.</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                (upset)<br>
                What made you think she had a gun?</p>
              <p>Nick says nothing; he looks like a zombie.</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                What the hell was she doing here?<br>
                What was Gus doing here?</p>
              <p>Andrews yells to them from the stairway door.</p>
              <p> ANDREWS<br>
                Lieutenant.</p>
              <p><br>
                102.</p>
              <p>INT. THE STAIRWAY</p>
              <p>A FORENSICS MAN very carefully handles a hooded rain coatin a 
                stair landing. He wears gloves.</p>
              <p>Nick is there with Lt. Walker.</p>
              <p>The Forensics Man picks the raincoat up -- a long blondewig falls 
                out of it. There are flecks of blood on it.</p>
              <p>He reaches into the pocket and pulls out an icepick. Ithas a 
                thin steel handle and is bloody. He hands theicepick to an assistant.</p>
              <p>He looks at the raincoat. It has blood on it.</p>
              <p> THE FORENSICS MAN<br>
                It's departmental issue.</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                (quietly)<br>
                Jesus.</p>
              <p>INT. BETH GARDNER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Nick with Lt. Walker. Nick looks like a zombie.</p>
              <p>Andrews comes up to them. He has a gun in his hands.</p>
              <p> ANDREWS<br>
                Thirty-eight caliber revolver.<br>
                Bottom drawer, bureau in the<br>
                bedroom.</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                Have ballistics check it for<br>
                Nilsen.</p>
              <p>Harrigan comes out.</p>
              <p> HARRIGAN<br>
                Lieutenant, you'd better come in<br>
                here.</p>
              <p>Lt. Walker goes into the kitchen. Nick follows him.</p>
              <p>There are several cops around a kitchen cabinet. A draweris open.</p>
              <p>Walker looks -- we look with him. We see a copy of Lovehurts, 
                Catherine's paperback book, and a stack of photos ofCatherine.</p>
              <p>Walker picks the photos up, goes through them -- we seeshots 
                of Catherine in college -- Catherine at a fight --Catherine with 
                Johnny Boz -- Catherine with Roxy.</p>
              <p> 103.</p>
              <p>He hands the photos to Nick.</p>
              <p>Nick stares at them.</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                I guess that's it.</p>
              <p>INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Nick sits, his feet up. He looks like a zombie. With himare Lt. 
                Walker, Andrews, and Captain Talcott. We see otherplainclothesmen 
                in the b.g. -- a flurry of activity, peopleon phones. A long beat.</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                She must've heard you on the<br>
                stairway and dumped the stuff.</p>
              <p>Nick says nothing, stares off.</p>
              <p>A DETECTIVE comes over to them.</p>
              <p> DETECTIVE<br>
                There was no suite 405 in that<br>
                building. Catherine Tramell's<br>
                roommate in her freshman year is<br>
                dead. She died of leukemia two<br>
                years ago.</p>
              <p>An INTERNAL AFFAIRS MAN comes over to them.</p>
              <p> INTERNAL AFFAIRS MAN<br>
                Our files on Dr. Gardner show<br>
                nothing about a police report in<br>
                Berkeley -- nothing related to<br>
                Salinas, either.</p>
              <p>A long beat -- the phone RINGS. Andrews picks it up,listens.</p>
              <p> ANDREWS<br>
                Thanks.</p>
              <p>He hangs up.</p>
              <p> ANDREWS<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                Ballistics says the .38 we found in<br>
                her apartment matches Nilsen. No<br>
                registration. They're checking<br>
                with Salinas. The icepick is the<br>
                same brand and model as the Boz<br>
                weapon.</p>
              <p>A long beat -- Nick just stares.</p>
              <p><br>
                104.</p>
              <p>Harrigan comes up to them.</p>
              <p> HARRIGAN<br>
                We checked the tape machines at Dr.<br>
                Gardner's apartment and at her<br>
                office -- both here and the one on<br>
                Van Ness. No message from Gus on<br>
                any of 'em. The one at her<br>
                apartment was broken.<br>
                (a beat)<br>
                Johnny Boz's psychiatrist says he<br>
                thinks he remembers Dr. Gardner and<br>
                Boz meeting at a Christmas party at<br>
                his house a year ago.</p>
              <p>A long beat.</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                (after a long beat,<br>
                sadly)<br>
                You just can't tell about people,<br>
                can you. Even the ones you think<br>
                you know inside-out.</p>
              <p>He and Nick look at each other a beat.</p>
              <p> CAPTAIN TALCOTT<br>
                Congratulations, Curran.</p>
              <p>Nick looks at him, expressionless.</p>
              <p>EXT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
              <p>He parks his car. It is dark. Foggy.</p>
              <p>He starts heading inside.</p>
              <p>INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
              <p>He goes in. He starts to walk up the dark stairway, we seehim 
                walking up several flights of steps.</p>
              <p>INT. THE CORRIDOR TO HIS APARTMENT</p>
              <p>He opens his door with his key.</p>
              <p>INT. HIS APARTMENT</p>
              <p>He walks in. The apartment is dark.</p>
              <p> A VOICE<br>
                (behind him)<br>
                Hi.</p>
              <p><br>
                105.</p>
              <p>It is a whisper, almost a hiss. He spins, fast. Catherinestands 
                there, pressing herself against a wall. They lookat each other 
                a long beat. She looks like she is almost ina trance.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                I heard about it... on TV.</p>
              <p>He looks at her, expressionless. A long beat, their eyesare into 
                each other. She looks like she is almostshivering.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                I can't allow myself to care about<br>
                you -- I can't allow myself to<br>
                care -- I can't -- I can't --</p>
              <p>She looks very emotional. He moves towards her, puts hisarms 
                around her, holds her very close.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (continuing; in a<br>
                whisper)<br>
                I don't want to do this -- please --<br>
                I don't want to do this -- I lose<br>
                everybody -- I don't want to lose<br>
                you -- I don't want to --</p>
              <p>He presses her closer and closer to himself, holds her.</p>
              <p>INT. HIS BEDROOM - NIGHT</p>
              <p>It is dark; we can't see clearly.</p>
              <p>Atop her... he makes love to her... gently... tenderly...hardly 
                moving inside her... there are tears in her eyes...</p>
              <p> DISSOLVE TO:</p>
              <p>INT. HIS BEDROOM - LATER</p>
              <p>Atop him... she is on her knees, straddling him... he is onhis 
                back, his eyes are closed... her head arches back...her breasts 
                high... he strains toward her with his body...she holds her arms 
                high... her right hand is in a fist...(we only see the back of 
                her hand and arm)... it comes downsuddenly... he bucks... writhes... 
                then her whole bodyfalls on top of him.</p>
              <p>A very long beat...</p>
              <p>We can't see him... her body completely covers him...</p>
              <p>And then finally he moves... turns her to the side...kisses her.</p>
              <p> DISSOLVE TO:</p>
              <p></p>
              <p></p>
              <p> ☆☆106.</p>
              <p>INT. HIS BEDROOM - LATER</p>
              <p>The Stones play &quot;Sympathy For The Devil&quot; in the b.g.; 
                theMUSIC is low.</p>
              <p>They lie next to each other on the bed. The CAMERA facesthem. 
                He lies, staring at the ceiling, on the left side ofthe bed, smoking 
                a cigarette. She is curled away from himtoward the right side 
                of the bed. A long beat, then --</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                What do we do now, Nick?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a long beat)<br>
                We fuck like minks. We raise<br>
                rugrats. We live happily ever<br>
                after.</p>
              <p>We see her right arm go to the side of the bed and thenover. 
                He stares at the ceiling.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                I hate rugrats.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a long beat)<br>
                We fuck like minks. We forget the<br>
                rugrats. We live happily ever<br>
                after.</p>
              <p>We see from an ANGLE to the left side of the bed now:</p>
              <p>Her face is expressionless. Her right arm dangles over theright 
                side of the bed. Her right hand is clenched. Is sheholding something 
                in it against her arm?</p>
              <p>We see them from an ANGLE to the left side of the bed now:</p>
              <p>He turns his body away from her to put out his cigarette.</p>
              <p>We see her behind him slowly turning towards him and theCAMERA. 
                A beat, and he turns towards her.</p>
              <p>They look at each other. A long beat as the SONG getslouder. 
                We see them in CLOSEUP. We don't see her rightarm.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>

                with smoking?</p>

                I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the<br>
                record: Did you kill him?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                No.</p>

                his office in front of everybody in<br>
                the afternoon and then that night<br>
                I'm going to kill him? I'd have to<br>
                be really dumb to do that.</p>
              <p> AN I.A. MAN<br>
                Going after him before gets you off<br>
                the hook for killing him: that's<br>
                your alibi.</p>

                Like writing a book about killing a<br>

                It's the least I could do...<br>

                What was she like in school?</p>
              <p> BETH<br>
                I hardly knew her. She gave me the<br>
                creeps, though. I don't know why.</p>

                Beth. I didn't mean what I said.<br>

              <p>He is cleaning his desk out, putting things into a duffelbag. 
                Only Andrews is in the room. We see Lt. Walkersitting in his glass-enclosed

                You're on leave, man.<br>
                (a beat)<br>
                You're on psycho leave. I'm<br>
                talking to a possible whacko here.</p>

                You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd<br>
                you find?</p>

              <p> ANDREWS<br>
                The boat blew. There was a leak in<br>
                the gas line. There were two<br>
                previous repairs. There was a five-<br>
                mil policy on both of 'em. A real<br>
                heavy investigation. Zilch. Goose-<br>
                egg. It was an accident.</p>

                I.A.'s going to talk to you more<br>

                First you've got her buying your<br>
                file. Now you've got her killing<br>
                Nilsen. Forget her, willya? Go<br>
                someplace. Sit in the sun. Get<br>
                away from this goddamn fog. Get<br>
                her out of your system.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                You don't but it, do you? She knew<br>
                nobody would but it.<br>
                (he smiles)<br>
                She knew I'd say she did it. And<br>
                she knew nobody would buy it.</p>
              <p>Lt. Walker looks at him a long beat.</p>
              <p> LT. WALKER<br>
                She's screwing with your head,<br>
                Nick. Pretty soon you're gonna<br>
                look in the mirror and think you're<br>

              <p>EXT. HIS APARTMENT</p>
              <p>It is in the Marina District; on a street like Cervantes.He gets 
                out of his old Porsche; he sees her black Ferrarithere. She is 
                sitting on the front stoop. She wears anIndian jacket, jeans and 
                a T-shirt. He goes up to her.She looks at him a beat.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                I heard about what happened. What<br>
                good's a shooter without his gun?</p>
              <p> 55.</p>
              <p>She smiles.</p>

              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                I have attorneys. They have<br>
                friends. I have friends. Money<br>
                buys you a lot of attorneys and<br>
                friends.</p>

                (after a beat)<br>
                I don't know about that: I don't<br>
                have any money: I don't have any<br>
                attorneys: Gus is my only real<br>
                friend.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (smiles)<br>
                I wasn't talking about real<br>
                friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                I like you.</p>

              <p> NICK<br>
                (smiles)<br>
                Yeah. Would you like to come up<br>
                and have a drink?</p>
              <p>She looks at him a beat.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                I didn't think you'd ask me.</p>

                (smiles)<br>
                I'm not that easy to figure.</p>
              <p>They start walking inside. She walks ahead of him. Hewatches 
                her. She turns suddenly.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                You're not easy to figure. I'm<br>
                just very good at figuring.</p>

                Why not?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                You can make a mistake.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (smiles)<br>
                Not me.</p>
              <p>And she turns, heads inside; he follows her.</p>
              <p>INT. HIS APARTMENT - DAY</p>
              <p>They walk in. She looks at the bareness of the place.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                You should put some warmth into it.<br>
                You don't want it to reflect on<br>
                your personality.</p>
              <p>She turns, smiles at him. He looks at the bottle of JackDaniel's; 
                there's not much left.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Jack Daniel's okay? It's gonna<br>
                have to be.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                Fine.</p>

                (smiles)<br>
                Please.</p>
              <p>There is a palpable tension between them.</p>
              <p>He takes the ice out, opens a drawer, takes out an icepick.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                Let me do that. You like to watch<br>
                me doing it, don't you?</p>
              <p>She smiles; a beat and he hands her the icepick. She takesit, 
                starts to us the icepick, her back to him. He lights acigarette.</p>

                Can I have a cigarette, please? I<br>
                told you you'd start smoking again.</p>
              <p>He watches her working on the ice.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                Light it for me, will you?</p>
              <p>He does, steps to her. She parts her lips -- he puts it onher 
                lip, watches it. Their eyes are on each other.</p>

                Thank you.</p>

                What if I call you Nicky?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                My wife used to call me that.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (smiles)<br>
                I know, Nicky, but I like it.</p>
              <p>She hands him his drink, holds hers.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                Cheers. My friends call me<br>
                Catherine.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                What did Bobby Vasquez used to call<br>
                you?</p>
              <p> 58.</p>
              <p><br>
                CATHERINE<br>
                Bitch mostly, but he meant it<br>
                affectionately. You don't have any<br>
                coke, do you? I love coke and Jack<br>
                Daniel's.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                There's Pepsi in the fridge.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (smiles)<br>
                It's not the same thing, is it?</p>
              <p>They look at each other a long beat, their eyes veryinvolved.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (quietly)<br>
                Where's it going? What do you want<br>
                from me?</p>
              <p>Their faces are close together.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                Say -- &quot;What do you want from me,<br>
                Catherine?&quot;</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a beat,<br>
                quietly)<br>
                What do you want from me, Catherine?</p>
              <p>A beat, and she suddenly turns away.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (brightly)<br>
                I brought you something.</p>
              <p>She goes to her purse, takes a paperback book out of it.We see 
                it -- The First Time, by Catherine Smith. He looksat it.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (continuing; smiles)<br>
                Aren't you going to thank me?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                What's it about?</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                A boy kills his parents. They have<br>
                a plane. He makes it look like an<br>
                accident.</p>
              <p><br>
                59.</p>
              <p>He stares at her. A long beat, then --</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Why does he do it?</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                To see if he can get away with it.</p>
              <p>They look at each other a beat.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                When did you write it?</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                You mean did I write it before my<br>
                parents died?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                Yes.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                No. I wrote it years afterwards.</p>
              <p>He watches her; she has turned away from him -- and thenshe turns 
                back to him in a different mood.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (continuing; smiles)<br>
                You're not going to stop following<br>
                me around now just because you're<br>
                on leave -- are you?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                No.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                Good. I'd miss you.<br>
                (a beat)<br>
                You can get into trouble, though.<br>
                You're not really a cop anymore.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                I'll risk it.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                Why take the risk?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                To see if I can get away with it.</p>
              <p>She looks at him: she smiles.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                How's your new book?</p>
              <p></p>
              <p></p>
              <p><br>
                ☆☆60.</p>
              <p><br>
                CATHERINE<br>
                I'm getting deeper and deeper into<br>
                my character.</p>
              <p>They look at each other a long beat.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                Thanks for the drink.</p>
              <p>He nods, say nothing as she goes to the door --</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (continuing)<br>
                I'm leaving the house around<br>
                midnight. In case you're going to<br>
                follow me.<br>
                (a beat)<br>
                I'm going down to Johnny's club.</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                I'll meet you there.</p>
              <p>She looks at him a long beat; and she's gone.</p>
              <p>INT. THE STAIRWAY</p>
              <p>As she is going down the stairs, Gus Moran is coming up.He does 
                a real double-take as he goes by her.</p>
              <p> CATHERINE<br>
                (smiles)<br>
                Hi, Gus.</p>
              <p>He looks at him a long beat, and he goes upstairs, intoNick's 
                apartment.</p>
              <p>INT. NICK'S APARTMENT</p>
              <p>Nick stands at the window, watching her outside. A longbeat, 
                and he looks at Gus.</p>
              <p> GUS<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                Forgive me for askin', son, and I<br>
                don't mean to belabor the obvious,<br>
                but why is it that you've got your<br>
                head so far up your own ass?</p>
              <p> NICK<br>
                (after a beat)<br>
                She want to play? Fine. I can<br>
                play.</p>

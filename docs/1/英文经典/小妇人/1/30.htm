              <br>
              Mrs. Chester's fair was so very elegant and select that it was considered 
              a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood to be invited 
              to take a table, and everyone was much interest in the matter. Amy 
              was asked, but Jo was not, which was fortunate for all parties, 
              as her elbows were decidedly akimbo at this period of her life, 
              and it took a good many hard knocks to teach her how to get on easily. 
              The `haughty, uninteresting creature' was let severely alone, but 
              Amy's talent and taste were duly complimented by the offer of the 
              art table, and she exerted herself to prepare and secure appropriate 
              and valuable contributions to it. </p>
            <p>Everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened, 
              then there occurred one of the little skirmishes which it is almost 
              impossible to avoid, when some five-and-twenty women, old and young, 
              with all their private piques and prejudices, try to work together. 
            </p>
            <p>May Chester was rather jealous of Amy because the latter was a 
              greater favorite than herself, and just at this time several trifling 
              circumstances occurred to increase the feeling. Amy's dainty pen-and-ink 
              work entirely eclipsed May's painted vases--that was one thorn. 
              Then the all conquering Tudor had danced four times with Amy at 
              a late party and only once with May--that was thorn number two. 
              But the chief grievance that rankled in her soul, and gave an excuse 
              for her unfriendly conduct, was a rumor which some obliging gossip 
              had whispered to her, that the March girls had made fun of her at 
              the Lambs'. All the blame of this should have fallen upon Jo, for 
              her naughty imitation had been too lifelike to escape detection, 
              and the frolicsome Lambs had permitted the joke to escape. No hint 
              of this had reached the culprits, however, and Amy's dismay can 
              be imagined, when, the very evening before the fair, as she was 
              putting the last touches to her pretty table, Mrs. Chester, who, 
              of course, resented the supposed ridicule of her daughter, said, 
              in a bland tone, but with a cold look... </p>
            <p>&quot;I find, dear, that there is some feeling among the young 
              ladies about my giving this table to anyone but my girls. As this 
              is the most prominent, and some say the most attractive table of 
              all, and they are the chief getters-up of the fair, it is thought 
              best for them to take this place. I'm sorry, but I know you are 
              too sincerely interested in the cause to mind a little personal 
              disappointment, and you shall have another table if you like.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Chester fancied beforehand that it would be easy to deliver 
              this little speech, but when the time came, she found it rather 
              difficult to utter it naturally, with Amy's unsuspicious eyes looking 
              straight at her full of surprise and trouble. </p>
            <p>&quot;Amy felt that there was something behind this, but would 
              not guess what, and said quietly, feeling hurt, and showing that 
              she did, &quot;Perhaps you had rather I took no table at all?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Now, my dear, don't have any ill feeling, I beg. It's merely 
              a matter of expediency, you see, my girls will naturally take the 
              lead, and this table is considered their proper place. I think it 
              very appropriate to you, and feel very grateful for your efforts 
              to make it so pretty, but we must give up our private wishes, of 
              course, and I will see that you have a good place elsewhere. Wouldn't 
              you like the flower table? The little girls undertook it, but they 
              are discouraged. You could make a charmingthing of it, and the flower 
              table is always attractive you know.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;Especially to gentlemen,&quot; added May, with a look which 
              enlightened Amy as to one cause of her sudden fall from favor. She 
              colored angrily, but took no other notice of that girlish sarcasm, 
              and answered with unexpected amiability... </p>
            <p>&quot;It shall be as you please, Mrs. Chester. I'll give up my 
              place here at once, and attend to the flowers, if you like.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;You can put your own things on your own table, if you prefer,&quot; 
              began May, feeling a little conscience-stricken, as she looked at 
              the pretty racks, the painted shells, and quaint illuminations Amy 
              had so carefully made and so gracefully arranged. She meant it kindly, 
              but Amy mistook her meaning, and said quickly . .. </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, certainly, if they are in your way,&quot; and sweeping 
              her contributions into her apron, pell-mell, she walked off, feeling 
              that herself and her works of art had been insulted past forgiveness. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Now she's mad. Oh, dear, I wish I hadn't asked you to speak, 
              Mama,&quot; said May, looking disconsolately at the empty spaces 
              on her table. </p>
            <p> &quot;Girls' quarrels are soon over,&quot; returned her mother, 
              feeling a trifle ashamed of her own part in this one, as well she 
              might. </p>
            <p>The little girls hailed Amy and her treasures with delight, which 
              cordial reception somewhat soothed her perturbed spirit, and she 
              fell to work, determined to succeed florally, if she could not artistically. 
              But everything seemed against her. It was late, and she was tired. 
              Everyone was too busy with their own affairs to help her, and the 
              little girls were only hindrances, for the dears fussed and chattered 
              like so many magpies, making a great deal of confusion in their 
              artless efforts to preserve the most perfect order. The evergreen 
              arch wouldn't stay firm after she got it up, but wiggled and threatened 
              to tumble down on her head when the hanging baskets were filled. 
              Her best tile got a splash of water, which left a sephia tear on 
              the Cupid's cheek. She bruised her hands with hammering, and got 
              cold working in a draft, which last affliction filled her with apprehensions 
              for the morrow. Any girl reader who has suffered like afflictions 
              will sympathize with poor Amy and wish her well through her task. 
            </p>
            <p>There was great indignation at home when she told her story that 
              evening. Her mother said it was a shame, but told her she had done 
              right. Beth declared she wouldn't go to the fair at all, and Jo 
              demanded why she didn't take all her pretty things and leave those 
              mean people to get on without her. </p>
            <p>&quot;Because they are mean is no reason why i should be. I hate 
              such things, and though I think I've a right to be hurt, I don't 
              intend to show it. They will feel that more than angry speeches 
              or huffy actions, won't they, Marmee?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;That's the right spirit, my dear. A kiss for a blow is always 
              best, though it's not very easy to give it sometimes,&quot; said 
              her mother, with the air of one who had learned the difference between 
              preaching and practicing. </p>
            <p>In spite of various very natural temptations to resent and retaliate, 
              Amy adhered to her resolution all the next day, bent on conquering 
              her enemy by kindness. She began well, thanks to a silent reminder 
              that came to her unexpectedly, but most opportunely. As she arranged 
              her table that morning, while the little girls were in the anteroom 
              filling the baskets, she took up her pet production, a little book, 
              the antique cover of which her father had found among his treasures, 
              and in which on leaves of vellum she had beautifully illuminated 
              different texts. As she turned the pages rich in dainty devices 
              with very pardonable pride, her eye fell upon one verse that made 
              her stop and think. Framed in a brilliant scrollwork of scarlet, 
              blue and gold, with little spirits of good will helping one another 
              up and down among the thorns and flowers, were the words, &quot;Thou 
              shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I ought, but I don't,&quot; thought Amy, as her eye went 
              from the bright page to May's discontented face behind the big vases, 
              that could not hide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled. 
              Amy stood a minute, turning the leaves in her hand, reading on each 
              some sweet rebuke for all heartburnings and uncharitableness of 
              spirit. Many wise and true sermons are preached us every day by 
              unconscious ministers in street, school, office, or home. Even a 
              fair table may become a pulpit, if it can offer the good and helpful 
              words which are never out of season. Amy's conscience preached her 
              a little sermon from that text, then and there, and she did what 
              many of us do not always do, took the sermon to heart, and straightway 
              put it in practice.</p>
            <p>A group of girls were standing about May's table, admiring the 
              pretty things, and talking over the change of saleswomen. They dropped 
              their voices, but Amy knew they were speaking of her, hearing one 
              side of the story and judging accordingly. It was not pleasant, 
              but a better spirit had come over her, and presently a chance offered 
              for proving it. She heard May say sorrowfully... </p>
            <p>&quot;It's too bad, for there is no time to make other things, 
              and I don't want to fill up with odds and ends. The table was just 
              complete then. Now it's spoiled.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I dare say she'd put them back if you asked her,&quot; suggested 
              someone. </p>
            <p>&quot;How could I after all the fuss?&quot; began May, but she 
              did not finish, for Amy's voice came across the hall, saying pleasantly... 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;You may have them, and welcome, without asking, if you want 
              them. I was just thinking I'd offer to put them back, for they belong 
              to your table rather than mine. Here they are, please take them, 
              and forgive me if I was hasty in carrying them away last night.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>As she spoke, Amy returned her contribution, with a nod and a smile, 
              and hurried away again, feeling that it was easier to do a friendly 
              thing than it was to stay and be thanked for it. </p>
            <p>&quot;Now, I call that lovely of her, don't you?&quot; cried one 
              girl. </p>
            <p>May's answer was inaudible, but another young lady, whose temper 
              was evidently a little soured by making lemonade, added, with a 
              disagreeable laugh, &quot;Very lovely, for she knew she wouldn't 
              sell them at her own table.&quot; </p>
            <p>Now, that was hard. When we make little sacrifices we like to have 
              them appreciated, at least, and for a minute Amy was sorry she had 
              done it, feeling that virtue was not always its won reward. But 
              it is, as she presently discovered, for her spirits began to rise, 
              and her table to blossom under her skillful hands, the girls were 
              very kind, and that one little act seemed to have cleared the atmosphere 
              amazingly. </p>
            <p>It was a very long day and a hard one for Amy, as she sat behind 
              her table, often quite alone, for the little girls deserted very 
              soon. Few cared to buy flowers in summer, and her bouquets began 
              to droop long before night. </p>
            <p>The art table was the most attractive in the room. There was a 
              crowd about it all day long, and the tenders were constantly flying 
              to and fro with important faces and rattling money boxes. Amy often 
              looked wistfully across, longing to be there, where she felt at 
              home and happy, instead of in a corner with nothing to do. It might 
              seem no hardship to some of us, but to a pretty, blithe young girl, 
              it was not only tedious, but very trying, and the thought of Laurie 
              and his friends made it a real martyrdom. </p>
            <p>She did not go home till night, and then she looked so pale and 
              quiet that they knew the day had been a hard one, though she made 
              no complaint, and did not even tell what she had done. Her mother 
              gave her an extra cordial cup of tea. Beth helped her dress,and 
              made a charming little wreath for her hair, while Jo astonished 
              her family by getting herself up with unusual care, and hinting 
              darkly that the tables were about to be turned. </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't do anything rude, pray Jo. I won't have any fuss made, 
              so let it all pass and behave yourself,&quot; begged Amy, as she 
              departed early, hoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to refresh 
              her poor little table. </p>
            <p>&quot;I merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to 
              ever one I know, and to keep them in your corner as long as possible. 
              Teddy and his boys will lend a hand, and we'll have a good time 
              yet.&quot; returned Jo, leaning over the gate to watch for Laurie. 
              Presently the familiar tramp was heard in the dusk, and she ran 
              out to meet him. </p>
            <p>&quot;Is that my boy?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;As sure as this is my girl!&quot; And Laurie tucked her hand 
              under his arm with the air of a man whose every wish was gratified. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, teddy, such doings!&quot; And Jo told Amy's wrongs with 
              sisterly zeal. </p>
            <p>&quot;A flock of our fellows are going to drive over by-and-by, 
              and I'll be hanged if I don't make them buy every flower she's got, 
              and camp down before her table afterward,&quot; said Laurie, espousing 
              her cause with warmth. </p>
            <p>&quot;The flowers are not at all nice, Amy says, and the fresh 
              ones may not arrive in time. I don't wish to be unjust or suspicious, 
              but I shouldn't wonder if they never came at all. When people do 
              one mean thing they are very likely to do another,&quot; observed 
              Jo in a disgusted tone. </p>
            <p>&quot;Didn't Hayes give you the best out of our gardens? I told 
              him to.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I didn't know that, he forgot, I suppose, and, as your grandpa 
              was poorly, I didn't like to worry him by asking, though I did want 
              some.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Now, Jo, how could you think there was any need of asking? 
              They are just as much yours as mine. Don't we always go halves in 
              everything?&quot; began Laurie, in the tone that always made Jo 
              turn thorny. </p>
            <p>&quot;Gracious, I hope not! Half of some of your things wouldn't 
              suit me at all. But we mustn't stand philandering here. I've got 
              to help Amy, so you go and make yourself splendid, and if you'll 
              be so very kind as to let Hayes take a few nice flowers up to the 
              Hall, I'll bless you forever.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Couldn't you do it now?&quot; asked Laurie, so suggestively 
              that Jo shut the gate in his face with inhospitable haste, and called 
              through the bars, &quot;Go away, Teddy, I'm busy.&quot; </p>
            <p>Thanks to the conspirators, the tables were turned that night, 
              for Hayes sent up a wilderness of flowers, with a loverly basket 
              arranged in his best manner for a centerpiece. Then the March family 
              turned out en masse, and Jo exerted herself to some purpose, for 
              people not only came, but stayed, laughing at her nonsense, admiring 
              Amy's taste, and apparently enjoying themselves very much. Laurie 
              and his friends gallantly threw themselves into the breach, bought 
              up the bouquets, encamped before the table, and made that corner 
              the liveliest spot in the room. Amy was in her element now, and 
              out of gratitude, if nothing more, was as spritely and gracious 
              as possible, coming to the conclusion, about that time, that virtue 
              was it's own reward, after all. </p>
            <p>Jo behaved herself with exemplary propriety, and when Amy was happily 
              surrounded by her guard of honor, Jo circulated about the hall, 
              picking up various bits of gossip, which enlightened her upon the 
              subject of the Chester change of base. She reproached herself for 
              her share of the ill feeling and resolved to exonerate Amy as soon 
              as possible. She also discovered what Amy had done about the things 
              in the morning, and considered her a model of magnanimity. As she 
              passed the art table, she glanced over it for her sister's things, 
              but saw no sign of them. &quot;Tucked away out of sight, I dare 
              say,&quot; thought Jo, who could forgiver her own wrongs, but hotly 
              resented any insult offered her family. </p>
            <p>&quot;Good evening, Miss Jo. How does Amy get on?&quot; asked May 
              with a conciliatory air, for she wanted to show that she also could 
              begenerous.</p>
            <p>&quot;She has sold everything she had that was worth selling, and 
              now she is enjoying herself. The flower table is always attractive, 
              you know, `especially to gentlemen'.&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo couldn't resist giving that little slap, but May took it so 
              meekly she regretted it a minute after, and fell to praising the 
              great vases, which still remained unsold. </p>
            <p>&quot;Is Amy's illumination anywhere about&quot; I took a fancy 
              to buy that for Father,&quot; said Jo, very anxious to learn the 
              fate of her sister's work. </p>
            <p>&quot;Everything of Amy's sold long ago. I took care that the right 
              people saw them, and they made a nice little sum of money for us,&quot; 
              returned May, who had overcome sundry small temptations, as well 
              as Amy had, that day. </p>
            <p>Much gratified, Jo rushed back to tell the good news, and Amy looked 
              both touched and surprised by the report of May's word and manner. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Now, gentlemen, I want you to go and do your duty by the 
              other tables as generously as you have by mine, especially the art 
              table,&quot; she said, ordering out `Teddy's own', as the girls 
              called the college friends. </p>
            <p>&quot;`Charge, Chester, charge!' is the motto for that table, but 
              do your duty like men, and you'll get your money's worth of art 
              in every sense of the word,&quot; said the irrepressible Jo, as 
              the devoted phalanx prepared to take the field. </p>
            <p>&quot;To hear is to obey, but March is fairer far than May,&quot; 
              said little Parker, making a frantic effort to be both witty and 
              tender, and getting promptly quenched by Laurie, who said... </p>
            <p>&quot;Very well, my son, for a small boy!&quot; and walked him 
              off, with a paternal pat on the head. </p>
            <p>&quot;Buy the vases,&quot; whispered Amy to Laurie, as a final 
              heaping of coals of fire on her enemy's head.</p>
            <p>To May's great delight, Mr. Laurence not only bought the vases, 
              but pervaded the hall with one under each arm. The other gentlemen 
              speculated with equal rashness in all sorts of frail trifles, and 
              wandered helplessly about afterward, burdened with wax flowers, 
              painted fans, filigree portfolios, and other useful and appropriate 
              purchases. </p>
            <p>Aunt Carrol was there, heard the story, looked pleased, and said 
              something to Mrs. March in a corner, which made the latter lady 
              beam with satisfaction, and watch Amy with a face full of mingled 
              pride and anxiety, though she did not betray the cause of her pleasure 
              till several days later. </p>
            <p>The fair was pronounced a success, and when May bade Amy goodnight, 
              she did not gush as usual, but gave her an affectionate kiss, and 
              a look which said `forgive and forget'. That satisfied Amy, and 
              when she got home she found the vases paraded on the parlor chimney 
              piece with a great bouquet in each. &quot;The reward of merit for 
              a magnanimous March,&quot; as Laurie announced with a flourish. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You've a deal more principle and generosity and nobleness 
              of character than I ever gave you credit for, Amy. You've behaved 
              sweetly, and I respect you with all my heart,&quot; said Jo warmly, 
              as they brushed their hair together late that night. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, we all do, and love her for being so ready to forgive. 
              It must have been dreadfully hard, after working so long and setting 
              your heart on selling your own pretty things. I don't believe I 
              could have done it as kindly as you did,&quot; added Beth from her 
              pillow. </p>
            <p> &quot;Why, girls, you needn't praise me so. I only did as I'd 
              be done by. You laugh at me when I say I want to be a lady, but 
              I mean a true gentlewoman in mind and manners, and I try to do it 
              as far as I know how. I can't explain exactly, but I want to be 
              above the little meannesses and follies and faults that spoil so 
              many women. I'm far from it now, but I do my best, and hope in time 
              to be what Mother is.&quot; </p>
            <p>Amy spoke earnestly, and Jo said, with a cordial hug, &quot;I understand 
              now what you mean, and I'll never laugh at you again. You are getting 
              on faster than you think, and I'll take lessons of you in true politeness, 
              for you've learned the secret, I believe. Try away, deary, you'll 
              get your reward some day, and no one will be more delighted than 
              I shall.&quot; </p>
            <p>A week later Amy did get her reward, and poor Jo found it hard 
              to be delighted. A letter came from Aunt Carrol, and Mrs. March's 
              face was illuminated to such a degree when she read it that Jo and 
              Beth, who were with her, demanded what the glad tiding were. </p>
            <p>&quot;Aunt Carrol is going abroad next month, and wants...&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Me to go with her!&quot; burst in Jo, flying out of her 
              chair in an uncontrollable rapture. </p>
            <p>&quot;No, dear, not you. It's Amy.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, Mother! She's too young, it's my turn first. I've wanted 
              it so long. It would do me so much good, and be so altogether splendid. 
              I must go!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm afraid it's impossible, Jo. Aunt says Amy, decidedly, 
              and it is not for us to dictate when she offers such a favor.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;It's always so. Amy has all the fun and I have all the work. 
              It isn't fair, oh, it isn't fair!&quot; cried Jo passionately. </p>
            <p> &quot;I'm afraid it's partly your own fault, dear. When Aunt spoke 
              to me the other day, she regretted your blunt manners and too independent 
              spirit, and here she writes, as if quoting something you had said--`I 
              planned at first to ask Jo, but as `favors burden her', and she 
              `hates French', I think I won't venture to invite her. Amy is more 
              docile, will make a good companion for Flo, and receive gratefully 
              any help the trip may give her.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, my tongue, my abominable tongue! Why can't I learn to 
              keep it quiet?' groaned Jo, remembering words which had been her 
              undoing. When she had heard the explanation of the quoted phrases, 
              Mrs. March said sorrowfully... </p>
            <p>&quot;I wish you could have gone, but there is no hope of it this 
              time, so try to bear it cheerfully, and don't sadden Amy's pleasure 
              by reproaches or regrets.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'll try,&quot; said Jo, winking hard as she knelt down to 
              pick up the basket she had joyfully upset. &quot;I'll take a leaf 
              out of her book, and try not only to seem glad, but to be so, and 
              not grudge her one minute of happiness. But it won't be easy, for 
              it is a dreadful disappointment.&quot; And poor Jo bedewed the little 
              fat pincushion she held with several very bitter tears. &quot;Jo, 
              dear, I'm very selfish, but I couldn't spare you, and I'm glad you 
              are not going quite yet,&quot; whispered Beth, embracing her, basket 
              and all, with such a clinging touch and loving face that Jo felt 
              comforted in spite of the sharp regret that made her want to box 
              her own ears, and humbly beg Aunt Carrol to burden her with this 
              favor, and see how gratefully she would bear it. </p>
            <p>By the time Amy came in, Jo was able to take her part in the family 
              jubilation, not quite as heartily as usual, perhaps, but without 
              repinings at Amy's good fortune. The young lady herself received 
              the news as tidings of great joy, went about in a solemn sort of 
              rapture, and began to sort her colors and pack her pencils that 
              evening, leaving such trifles as clothes, money, and passports to 
              those less absorbed in visions of art than herself. </p>
            <p>&quot;It isn't a mere pleasure trip to me, girls,&quot; she said 
              impressively, as she scraped her best palette. &quot;It will decide 
              my career, for if I have any genius, I shall find it out in Rome, 
              and will do something to prove it.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Suppose you haven't?&quot; said Jo, sewing away, with red 
              eyes, at the new collars which were to be handed over to Amy. </p>
            <p>&quot;Then I shall come home and teach drawing for my living,&quot; 
              replied the aspirant for fame, with philosophic composure. But she 
              made a wry face at the prospect, and scratched away at her palette 
              as if bent on vigorous measures before she gave up her hopes. </p>
            <p>&quot;No, you won't. You hate hard work, and you'll marry some 
              rich man, and come home to sit in the lap of luxury all your days,&quot; 
              said Jo. </p>
            <p>&quot;Your predictions sometimes come to pass, but I don't believe 
              that one will. I'm sure I wish it would, for if I can't be an artist 
              myself, I should like to be able to help those who are,&quot; said 
              Amy, smiling, as if the part of Lady Bountiful would suit her better 
              than that of a poor drawing teacher. </p>
            <p>&quot;Hum!&quot; said Jo, with a sigh. &quot;If you wish it you'll 
              have it, for your wishes are always granted--mine never.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Would you like to go?&quot; asked Amy, thoughtfully patting 
              her nose with her knife. </p>
            <p>&quot;Rather!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, in a year or two I'll send for you, and we'll dig in 
              the Forum for relics, and carry out all the plans we've made so 
              many times.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Thank you. I'll remind you of your promise when that joyful 
              day comes, if it ever does,&quot; returned Jo, accepting the vague 
              but magnificent offer as gratefully as she could. &quot;There was 
              not much time for preparation, and the house was in a ferment till 
              Amy was off. Jo bore up very well till the last flutter of blue 
              ribbon vanished, when she retired to her refuge, the garret, and 
              cried till she couldn't cry any more. Amy likewise bore up stoutly 
              till the steamer sailed. Then just as the gangway was about to be 
              withdrawn, it suddenly came over her that a whole ocean was soon 
              to roll between her and those who loved her best, and she clung 
              to Laurie, the last lingerer, saying with a sob... </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, take care of them for me, and if anything should happen... 
              &quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I will, dear, I will, and if anything happens, I'll come 
              and comfort you,&quot; whispered Laurie, little dreaming that he 
              would be called upon to keep his word. </p>
            <p>So Amy sailed away to find the Old World, which is always new and 
              beautiful to young eyes, while her father and friend watched her 
              from the shore, fervently hoping that none but gentle fortunes would 
              befall the happy-hearted girl, who waved her hand to them till they 
              could see nothing but the summer sunshine dazzling on the sea. </p>

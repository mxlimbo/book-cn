            <p><br>
              &quot;Girls, where are you going?&quot; asked Amy, coming into their 
              room one Saturday afternoon, and finding them getting ready to go 
              out with an air of secrecy which excited her curiosity. </p>
            <p>&quot;Never mind. Little girls shouldn't ask questions,&quot; returned 
              Jo sharply. </p>
            <p>Now if there is anything mortifying to out feelings when we are 
              young, it is to be told that, and to be bidden to &quot;run away, 
              dear&quot; is still more trying to us. Amy bridled up at this insult, 
              and determined to find out the secret, if she teased for an hour. 
              Turning to Meg, who never refused her anything very long, she said 
              coaxingly, &quot;Do tell me! I should think you might let me go, 
              too, for Beth is fussing over her piano, and I haven't got anything 
              to do, and am so lonely.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I can't, dear, because you aren't invited,&quot; began Meg, 
              but Jo broke in impatiently, &quot;Now, Meg, be quiet or you will 
              spoil it all. You can't go, Amy, so don't be a baby and whine about 
              it.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;You are going somewhere with Laurie, I know you are. You 
              were whispering and laughing together on the sofa last night, and 
              you stopped when I came in. Aren't you going with him?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, we are. Now do be still, and stop bothering.&quot; </p>
            <p>Amy held her tongue, but used her eyes, and saw Meg slip a fan 
              into her pocket. </p>
            <p>&quot;I know! I know! You're going to the theater to see the SEVEN 
              CASTLES!&quot; she cried, adding resolutely, &quot;and I shall go, 
              for Mother said I might see it, and I've got my rag money, and it 
              was mean not to tell me in time.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Just listen to me a minute, and be a good child,&quot; said 
              Meg soothingly. &quot;Mother doesn't wish you to go this week, because 
              your eyes are not well enough yet to bear the light of this fairy 
              piece. Next week you can go with Beth and Hannah, and have a nice 
              time.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't like that half as well as going with you and Laurie. 
              Please let me. I've been sick with this cold so long, and shut up, 
              I'm dying for some fun. Do, Meg! I'll be ever so good,&quot; pleaded 
              Amy, looking as pathetic as she could. </p>
            <p>&quot;Suppose we take her. I don't believe Mother would mind, if 
              we bundle her up well,&quot; began Meg. </p>
            <p>&quot;If she goes I shan't, and if I don't, Laurie won't like it, 
              and it will be very rude, after he invited only us, to go and drag 
              in Amy. I should think she'd hate to poke herself where she isn't 
              wanted,&quot; said Jo crossly, for she disliked the trouble of overseeing 
              a fidgety child when she wanted to enjoy herself. </p>
            <p>Her tone and manner angered Amy, who began to put her boots on, 
              saying, in her most aggravating way, &quot;I shall go. Meg says 
              I may, and if I pay for myself, Laurie hasn't anything to do with 
              it.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You can't sit with us, for our seats are reserved, and you 
              mustn't sit alone, so Laurie will give you his place, and that will 
              spoil our pleasure. Or he'll get another seat for you, and that 
              isn't proper when you weren't asked. You shan't stir a step, so 
              you may just stay where you are,&quot; scolded Jo, crosser than 
              ever, having just pricked her finger in her hurry. </p>
            <p>Sitting on the floor with one boot on, Amy began to cry and Meg 
              to reason with her, when Laurie called from below, and the two girls 
              hurried down, leaving their sister wailing. For now and then she 
              forgot her grown-up ways and acted like a spoiled child. Just as 
              the party was setting out, Amy called over the banisters in a threatening 
              tone, &quot;You'll be sorry for this, Jo March, see if you ain't.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Fiddlesticks!&quot; returned Jo, slamming the door. </p>
            <p>They had a charming time, for THE SEVEN CASTLES OF THE DIAMOND 
              LAKE was as brilliant and wonderful as heart could wish. But in 
              spite of the comical red imps, sparkling elves, and the gorgeous 
              princes and princesses, Jo's pleasure had a drop of bitterness in 
              it. The fairy queen's yellow curls reminded her of Amy, and between 
              the acts she amused herself with wondering what her sister would 
              do to make her `sorry for it'. She and Amy had had many lively skirmishes 
              in the course of their lives, for both had quick tempers and were 
              apt to be violent when fairly roused. Amy teased Jo, and Jo irritated 
              Amy, and semioccasional explosions occurred, of which both were 
              much ashamed afterward. Although the oldest, Jo had the least self-control, 
              and had hard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually 
              getting her into trouble. Her anger never lasted long, and having 
              humbly confessed her fault, she sincerely repented and tried to 
              do better. Her sisters used to say that they rather liked to get 
              Jo into a fury because she was such an angel afterward. Poor Jo 
              tried desperately to be good, but her bosom enemy was always ready 
              to flame up and defeat her, and it took years of patient effort 
              to subdue it. </p>
            <p>When they got home, they found amy reading in the parlor. She assumed 
              an injured air as they came in, never lifted her eyes from her book, 
              or asked a single question. Perhaps curiosity might have conquered 
              resentment, if Beth had not been there to inquire and receive a 
              glowing description of the play. On going up to put away her best 
              hat, Jo's first look was toward the bureau, for in their last quarrel 
              Amy had soothed her feelings by turning Jo's top drawer upside down 
              on the floor. Everything was in its place, however, and after a 
              hasty glance into her various closets, bags, and boxes, Jo decided 
              that Amy had forgiven and forgotten her wrongs. </p>
            <p>There Jo was mistaken, for next day she made a discovery which 
              produced a tempest. Meg, Beth, and Amy were sitting together, late 
              in the afternoon, when Jo burst into the room, looking excited and 
              demanding breathlessly, &quot;Has anyone taken my book?&quot; </p>
            <p>Meg and Beth said, &quot;No.&quot; at once, and looked surprised. 
              Amy poked the fire and said nothing. Jo saw her color rise and was 
              down upon her in a minute. </p>
            <p>&quot;Amy, you've got it!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;No, I haven't.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You know where it is, then!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;No, I don't.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;That's a fib!&quot; cried Jo, taking her by the shoulders, 
              and looking fierce enough to frighten a much braver child than Amy. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;It isn't. I haven't got it, don't know where it is now, 
              and don't care.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You know something about it, and you'd better tell at once, 
              or I'll make you.&quot; And Jo gave her a slight shake.</p>
            <p>&quot;Scold as much as you like, you'll never see your silly old 
              book again,&quot; cried Amy, getting excited in her turn. </p>
            <p>&quot;why not?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I burned it up.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;What! My little book I was so fond of, and worked over, and 
              meant to finish before Father got home? Have you really burned it?&quot; 
              said Jo, turning very pale, while her eyes kindled and her hands 
              clutched Amy nervously. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, I did! I told you I'd make you pay for being so cross 
              yesterday, and I have, so...&quot; </p>
            <p>Amy got no farther, for Jo's hot temper mastered her, and she shook 
              Amy till her teeth chattered in her head, crying in a passion of 
              grief and anger... </p>
            <p>&quot;You wicked, wicked girl! I never can write it again, and 
              I'll never forgive you as long as I live.&quot; </p>
            <p>Meg flew to rescue Amy, and Beth to pacify Jo, but Jo was quite 
              beside herself, and with a parting box on her sister's ear, she 
              rushed out of the room up to the old sofa in the garret, and finished 
              her fight alone. </p>
            <p>The storm cleared up below, for Mrs. March came home, and, having 
              heard the story, soon brought Amy to a sense of the wrong she had 
              done her sister. Jo's book was the pride of her heart, and was regarded 
              by her family as a literary sprout of great promise. It was only 
              half a dozen little fairy tales, but Jo had worked over them patiently, 
              putting her whole heart into her work, hoping to make something 
              good enough to print. She had just copied them with great care, 
              and had destroyed the old manuscript, so that Amy's bonfire had 
              consumed the loving work of several years. It seemed a small loss 
              to others, but to Jo it was a dreadful calamity, and she felt that 
              it never could be made up to her. Beth mourned as for a departed 
              kitten, and Meg refused to defend her pet. Mrs. March looked grave 
              and grieved, and Amy felt that no one would love her till she had 
              asked pardon for the act which she now regretted more than any of 
              them. </p>
            <p>When the tea bell rang, Jo appeared, looking so grim and unapproachable 
              that it took all Amy's courage to say meekly... </p>
            <p> &quot;Please forgive me, Jo. I'm very, very sorry.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I never shall forgive you,&quot; was Jo's stern answer, and 
              from that moment she ignored Amy entirely. </p>
            <p>No one spoke of the great trouble, not even Mrs. March, for all 
              had learned by experience that when Jo was in that mood words were 
              wasted, and the wisest course was to wait till some little accident, 
              or her own generous nature, softened Jo's resentment and healed 
              the breach. It was not a happy evening, for though they sewed as 
              usual, while their mother read aloud from Bremer, Scott, or Edgeworth, 
              something was wanting, and the sweet home peace was disturbed. They 
              felt this most when singing time came, for Beth could only play, 
              Jo stood dumb as a stone, and Amy broke down, so Meg and Mother 
              sang alone. But in spite of their efforts to be as cheery as larks, 
              the flutelike voices did not seem to chord as well as usual, and 
              all felt out of tune. </p>
            <p>As Jo received her good-night kiss, Mrs. March whispered gently, 
              &quot;My dear, don't let the sun go down upon your anger. Forgive 
              each other, help each other, and begin again tomorrow.&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom, and cry 
              her grief and anger all away, but tears were an unmanly weakness, 
              and she felt so deeply injured that she really couldn't quite forgive 
              yet. So she winked hard, shook her head, and said gruffly because 
              Amy was listening, &quot;It was an abominable thing, and she doesn't 
              deserve to be forgiven.&quot; </p>
            <p>With that she marched off to bed, and there was no merry or confidential 
              gossip that night. </p>
            <p>Amy was much offended that her overtures of peace had been repulsed, 
              and began to wish she had not humbled herself, to feel more injured 
              than ever, and to plume herself on her superior virtue in a way 
              which was particularly exasperating. Jo still looked like a thunder 
              cloud, and nothing went well all day. It was bitter cold in the 
              morning, she dropped her precious turnover in the gutter, Aunt March 
              had an attack of the fidgets, Meg was sensitive, Beth would look 
              grieved and wistful when she got home, and Amy kept making remarks 
              about people who were always talking about being good and yet wouldn't 
              even try when other people set them a virtuous example. &quot;Everybody 
              is so hateful, I'll ask Laurie to go skating. He is always kind 
              and jolly, and will put me to rights, I know,&quot; said Jo to herself, 
              and off she went. </p>
            <p>Amy heard the clash of skates, and looked out with an impatient 
              exclamation. </p>
            <p>&quot;There! She promised I should go next time, for this is the 
              last ice we shall have. But it's no use to ask such a crosspatch 
              to take me.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't say that. You were very naughty, and it is hard to 
              forgive the loss of her precious little book, but I think she might 
              do it now, and I guess she will, if you try her at the right minute,&quot; 
              said Meg. &quot;Go after them. Don't say anything till Jo has got 
              good-natured with Laurie, than take a quiet minute and just kiss 
              her, or do some kind thing, and I'm sure she'll be friends again 
              with all her heart.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'll try,&quot; said Amy, for the advice suited her, and 
              after a flurry to get ready, she ran after the friends, who were 
              just disappearing over the hill. </p>
            <p>It was not far to the river, but both were ready before Amy reached 
              them. Jo saw her coming, and turned her back. Laurie did not see, 
              for he was carefully skating along the shore, sounding the ice, 
              for a warm spell had preceded the cold snap. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'll go on to the first bend, and see if it's all right before 
              we begin to race,&quot; Amy heard him say, as he shot away, looking 
              like a young Russian in his fur-trimmed coat and cap. </p>
            <p>Jo heard Amy panting after her run, stamping her feet and blowing 
              on her fingers as she tried to put her skates on, but Jo never turned 
              and went slowly zigzagging down the river, taking a bitter, unhappy 
              sort of satisfaction in her sister's troubles. She had cherished 
              her anger till it grew strong and took possession of her, as evil 
              thoughts and feelings always do unless cast out at once. As Laurie 
              turned the bend, he shouted back... </p>
            <p>&quot;Keep near the shore. It isn't safe in the middle.&quot; Jo 
              heard, but Amy was struggling to her feet and did not catch a word. 
              Jo glanced over her shoulder, and the little demon she was harboring 
              said in her ear... </p>
            <p>&quot;No matter whether she heard or not, let her take care of 
              herself.&quot; </p>
            <p>Laurie had vanished round the bend, Jo was just at the turn, and 
              Amy, far behind, striking out toward the the smoother ice in the 
              middle of the river. For a minute Jo stood still with a strange 
              feeling in her heart, then she resolved to go on, but something 
              held and turned her round, just in time to see Amy throw up her 
              hands and go down, with a sudden crash of rotten ice, the splash 
              of water, and a cry that made Jo's heart stand still with fear. 
              She tried to call Laurie, but her voice was gone. She tried to rush 
              forward, but her feet seemed to have no strength in them, and for 
              a second, she could only stand motionless, staring with a terror-stricken 
              face at the little blue hood above the black water. Something rushed 
              swiftly by her, and Laurie's voice cried out... </p>
            <p> &quot;Bring a rail. Quick, quick!&quot; </p>
            <p>How she did it, she never knew, but for the next few minutes she 
              worked as if possessed, blindly obeying Laurie, who was quite self-possessed, 
              and lying flat, held Amy up by his arm and hockey stick till Jo 
              dragged a rail from the fence, and together they got the child out, 
              more frightened than hurt.</p>
            <p>&quot;Now then, we must walk her home as fast as we can. Pile our 
              things on her, while I get off these confounded skates,&quot; cried 
              Laurie, wrapping his coat round Amy, and tugging away at the straps 
              which never seemed so intricate before. </p>
            <p>Shivering, dripping, and crying, they got Amy home, and after an 
              exciting time of it, she fell asleep, rolled in blankets before 
              a hot fire. During the bustle Jo had scarcely spoken but flown about, 
              looking pale and wild, with her things half off, her dress torn, 
              and her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles. 
              When Amy was comfortably asleep, the house quiet, and Mrs. March 
              sitting by the bed, she called Jo to her and began to bind up the 
              hurt hands. </p>
            <p>&quot;Are you sure she is safe?&quot; whispered Jo, looking remorsefully 
              at the golden head, which might have been swept away from her sight 
              forever under the treacherous ice. </p>
            <p>&quot;Quite safe, dear. she is not hurt, and won't even take cold, 
              I think, you were so sensible in covering and getting her home quickly,&quot; 
              replied her mother cheerfully. </p>
            <p>&quot;Laurie did it all. I only let her go. Mother, if she should 
              die, it would be my fault.&quot; And Jo dropped down beside the 
              bed in a passion of penitent tears, telling all that had happened, 
              bitterly condemning her hardness of heart, and sobbing out her gratitude 
              for being spared the heavy punishment which might have come upon 
              her. &quot;It's my dreadful temper! I try to cure it, I think I 
              have, and then it breaks out worse than ever. OH, Mother, what shall 
              I do? What shall I do?&quot; cried poor Jo, in despair. </p>
            <p>&quot;Watch and pray, dear, never get tired of trying, and never 
              think it is impossible to conquer your fault,&quot; said Mrs. March, 
              drawing the blowzy head to her shoulder and kissing the wet cheek 
              so tenderly that Jo cried even harder. </p>
            <p>&quot;You don't know, you can't guess how bad it is! It seems as 
              if I could do anything when I'm in a passion. I get so savage, I 
              could hurt anyone and enjoy it. I'm afraid I shall do something 
              dreadful some day, and spoil my life, and make everybody hate me. 
              Oh, Mother, help me, do help me!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I will, my child, I will. Don't cry so bitterly, but remember 
              this day, and resolve with all your soul that you will never know 
              another like it. Jo, dear, we all have our temptations, some far 
              greater than yours, and it often takes us all our lives to conquer 
              them. You think your temper is the worst in the world, but mine 
              used to be just like it.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Yours, Mother? Why, you are never angry!&quot; And for the 
              moment Jo forgot remorse in surprise. </p>
            <p>&quot;I've been trying to cure it for forty years, and have only 
              succeeded in controlling it. I am angry nearly every day of my life, 
              Jo, but I have learned not to show it, and I still hope to learn 
              not to feel it, though it may take me another forty years to do 
              so.&quot; </p>
            <p>The patience and the humility of the face she loved so well was 
              a better lesson to Jo than the wisest lecture, the sharpest reproof. 
              She felt comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given 
              her. The knowledge that her mother had a fault like hers, and tried 
              to mend it, made her own easier to bear and strengthened her resolution 
              to cure it, though forty years seemed rather a long time to watch 
              and pray to a girl of fifteen. </p>
            <p>&quot;Mother, are you angry when you fold your lips tight together 
              and go out of the room sometimes, when Aunt March scolds or people 
              worry you?&quot; asked Jo, feeling nearer and dearer to her mother 
              than ever before. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, I've learned to check the hasty words that rise to my 
              lips, and when I feel that they mean to break out against my will, 
              I just go away for a minute, and give myself a little shake for 
              being so weak and wicked,&quot; answered Mrs. March with a sigh 
              and a smile, as she smoothed and fastened up Jo's disheveled hair. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;How did you learn to keep still? That is what troubles me, 
              for the sharp words fly out before I know what I'm about, and the 
              more I say the worse I get, till it's a pleasure to hurt people's 
              feelings and say dreadful things. Tell me how you do it, Marmee 
              dear.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;My good mother used to help me...&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;As you do us...&quot; interrupted Jo, with a grateful kiss. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;But I lost her when I was a little older than you are, and 
              for years had to struggle on alone, for I was too proud to confess 
              my weakness to anyone else. I had a hard time, Jo, and shed a good 
              many bitter tears over my failures, for in spite of my efforts I 
              never seemed to get on. Then your father came, and I was so happy 
              that i found it easy to be good. But by-and-by, when I had four 
              little daughters round me and we were poor, then the old trouble 
              began again, for I am not patient by nature, and it tried me very 
              much to see my children wanting anything.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Poor Mother! What helped you then?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Your father, Jo. He never loses patience, never doubts or 
              complains, but always hopes, and works and waits so cheerfully that 
              one is ashamed to do otherwise before him. He helped and comforted 
              me, and showed me that I must try to practice all the virtues I 
              would have my little girls possess, for I was their example. It 
              was easier to try for your sakes than for my own. A startled or 
              surprised look from one of you when I spoke sharply rebuked me more 
              than any words could have done, and the love, respect, and confidence 
              of my children was the sweetest reward I could receive for my efforts 
              to be the woman I would have them copy.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, Mother, if I'm ever half as good as you, I shall be satisfied,&quot; 
              cried Jo, much touched. </p>
            <p>&quot;I hope you will be a great deal better, dear, but you must 
              keep watch over your `bosom enemy', as father calls it, or it may 
              sadden, if not spoil your life. You have had a warning.Remember 
              it, and try with heart and soul to master this quick temper, before 
              it brings you greater sorrow and regret than you have known today.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I will try, Mother, I truly will. But you must help me, remind 
              me, and keep me from flying out. I used to see Father sometimes 
              put his finger on his lips, and look at you with a very kind but 
              sober face, and you always folded your lips tight and went away. 
              Was he reminding you then?&quot; asked Jo softly. </p>
            <p> &quot;Yes. I asked him to help me so, and he never forgot it, 
              but saved me from many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind 
              look.&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo saw that her mother's eyes filled and her lips trembled as she 
              spoke, and fearing that she had said too much, she whispered anxiously, 
              &quot;Was it wrong to watch you and to speak of it? I didn't mean 
              to be rude, but it's so comfortable to say all I think to you, and 
              feel so safe and happy here.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Mu Jo, you may say anything to your mother, for it is my 
              greatest happiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me 
              and know how much I love them.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I thought I'd grieved you.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;No, dear, but speaking of Father reminded me how much I miss 
              him, how much I owe him, and how faithfully I should watch and work 
              to keep his little daughters safe and good for him.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;Yet you told him to go, Mother, and didn't cry when he went, 
              and never complain now, or seem as if you needed any help,&quot; 
              said Jo, wondering. </p>
            <p>&quot;I gave my best to the country I love, and kept my tears till 
              he was gone. Why should I complain, when we both have merely done 
              our duty and will surely be the happier for it in the end? If I 
              don't seem to need help, it is because I have a better friend, even 
              than Father, to comfort and sustain me. My child, the troubles and 
              temptations of your life are beginning and may be many, but you 
              can overcome and outlive them all if you learn to feel the strength 
              and tenderness of your Heavenly Father as you do that of your earthly 
              one. The more you love and trust Him, and the less you will depend 
              on human power and wisdom. His love and care never tire or change, 
              can never be taken from you, but my become the source of lifelong 
              peace, happiness, and strength. Believe this heartily, and go to 
              God with all your little cares, and hopes, and sins, and sorrows, 
              as freely and confidingly as you come to your mother.&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo's only answer was to hold her mother close, and in the silence 
              which followed the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed left her 
              heart without words. For in that sad yet happy hour, she had learned 
              not only the bitterness of remorse and despair, but the sweetness 
              of self-denial and self-control, and led by her mother's hand, she 
              had drawn nearer to the Friend who always welcomes every child with 
              a love stronger than that of any father, tenderer than that of any 
              mother. </p>
            <p>Amy stirred and sighed in her sleep, and as if eager to begin at 
              once to mend her fault, l Jo looked up with an expression on her 
              face which it had never worn before. </p>
            <p>&quot;I let the sun go down on my anger. I wouldn't forgive her, 
              and today, if it hadn't been for Laurie, it might have been too 
              late! How could I be so wicked?&quot; said Jo, half aloud, as she 
              leaned over her sister softly stroking the wet hair scattered on 
              the pillow. </p>
            <p>As if she heard, Amy opened her eyes, and held out her arms, with 
              a smile that went straight to Jo's heart. Neither said a word, but 
              they hugged one another close, in spite of the blankets, and everything 
              was forgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss. </p>

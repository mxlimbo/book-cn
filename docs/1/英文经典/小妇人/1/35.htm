            <p> <br>
              Whatever his motive might have been, Laurie studied to some purpose that year, for he graduated with honor, and  gave the Latin oration with the grace of a Phillips and the eloquence of a Demosthenes, so his friends said. They were all there, his grandfather--oh, so proud--Mr. and Mrs. March, John and Meg, Jo and Beth, and all exulted over him with the sincere admiration which boys make light of at the time, but fail to win from the world by any after-triumphs. 
            <p>&quot;I've got to stay for this confounded supper, but I shall be home early tomorrow. You'll come and meet me as usual, girls?&quot; Laurie said, as he put the sisters into the carriage after the joys of the day were over. He said `girls', but he meant Jo, for she was the only one who kept up the old custom. She had not the heart to refuse her splendid, successful boy anything, and answered warmly...
            <p>&quot;I'll come, Teddy, rain or shine, and march before you, playing `Hail the conquering hero comes' on a jew's-harp.&quot; 
            <p>Laurie thanked her with a look that made her think in a sudden panic, &quot;Oh, deary me! I know he'll say something, and then what shall I do?&quot; Evening meditation and morning work somewhat allayed her fears, and having decided that she wouldn't be vain enough to think people were going to propose when she had given them every reason to know what her answer would be, she set forth at the appointed time, hoping Teddy wouldn't do anything to make her hurt his poor feelings. A call at Meg's, and a refreshing sniff and sip at the Daisy and Demijohn, still further fortified her for the tete-a-tete, but when she saw a stalwart figure looming in the distance, she had a strong desire to turn about and run away. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Where's the jew's-harp, Jo?&quot; cried Laurie, as soon as 
              he was within speaking distance. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I forgot it.&quot; And Jo took heart again, for that salutation 
              could not be called loverlike. </p>
            <p>She always used to take his arm on these occasions, now she did 
              not, and he made no complaint, which was a bad sign, but talked 
              on rapidly about all sorts of faraway subjects, till they turned 
              from the road into the little path that led homeward through the 
              grove. Then he walked more slowly, suddenly lost his fine flow of 
              language, and now and then a dreadful pause occurred. To rescue 
              the conversation from one of the wells of silence into which it 
              kept falling, Jo said hastily, &quot;Now you must have a good long 
              holiday!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I intend to.&quot; </p>
            <p>Something in his resolute tone made Jo look up quickly to find 
              him looking down at her with an expression that assured her the 
              dreaded moment had come, and made her put out her hand with an imploring, 
              &quot;No, Teddy. Please don't!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I will, and you must hear me. It's no use, Jo, we've got 
              to have it out, and the sooner the better for both of us,&quot; 
              he answered, getting flushed and excited all at once. </p>
            <p>&quot;Say what you like then. I'll listen,&quot; said Jo, with 
              a desperate sort of patience. </p>
            <p>Laurie was a young lover, but he was in earnest, and meant to `have 
              it out', if he died in the attempt, so he plunged into the subject 
              with characteristic impetuousity, saying in a voice that would get 
              choky now and then, in spite of manful efforts to keep it steady 
              . .. </p>
            <p>&quot;I've loved you ever since I've known you, Jo, couldn't help 
              it, you've been so good to me. I've tried to show it, but you wouldn't 
              let me. Now I'm going to make you hear, and give me an answer, for 
              I can't go on so any longer.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I wanted to save you this. I thought you'd understand... 
              began Jo, finding it a great deal harder than she expected. </p>
            <p>&quot;I know you did, but the girls are so queer you never know 
              what they mean. They say no when they mean yes, and drive a man 
              out of his wits just for the fun of it,&quot; returned Laurie, entrenching 
              himself behind an undeniable fact. </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't. I never wanted to make you care for me so, and I 
              went away to keep you from it if I could.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I thought so. It was like you, but it was no use. I only 
              loved you all the more, and I worked hard to please you, and I gave 
              up billiards and everything you didn't like, and waited and never 
              complained, for I hoped you'd love me, though I'm not half good 
              enough...&quot; Here there was a choke that couldn't be controlled, 
              so he decapitated buttercups while he cleared his `confounded throat'. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;You, you are, you're a great deal too good for me, and I'm 
              so grateful to you, and so proud and fond of you, I don't know why 
              I can't love you as you want me to. I've tried, but I can't change 
              the feeling, and it would be a lie to say I do when I don't.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Really, truly, Jo?&quot; He stopped short, and caught both 
              her hands as he put his question with a look that she did not soon 
              forget. </p>
            <p>&quot;Really, truly, dear.&quot; </p>
            <p>They were in the grove now, close by the stile, and when the last 
              words fell reluctantly from Jo's lips, Laurie dropped her hands 
              and turned as if to go on, but for once in his life the fence was 
              too much for him. So he just laid his head down on the mossy post, 
              and stood so still that Jo was frightened. </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, Teddy, I'm sorry, so desperately sorry, I could kill 
              myself if it would do any good! I wish you wouldn't take it so hard, 
              I can't help it. You know it's impossible for people to make themselves 
              love other people if they don't,&quot; cried Jo inelegantly but 
              remorsefully, as she softly patted his shoulder, remembering the 
              time when he had comforted her so long ago. </p>
            <p>&quot;They do sometimes,&quot; said a muffled voice from the post. 
              &quot;I don't believe it's the right sort of love, and I'd rather 
              not try it,&quot; was the decided answer. </p>
            <p>There was a long pause, while a blackbird sung blithely on the 
              willow by the river, and the tall grass rustled in the wind. Presently 
              Jo said very soberly, as she sat down on the step of the stile, 
              &quot;Laurie, I want to tell you something.&quot; </p>
            <p>He started as if he had been shot, threw up his head, and cried 
              out in a fierce tone, &quot;Don't tell me that, Jo, I can't bear 
              it now!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Tell what?&quot; she asked, wondering at his violence. </p>
            <p>&quot;That you love that old man.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;What old man?&quot; demanded Jo, thinking he must mean his 
              grandfather. </p>
            <p>&quot;That devilish Professor you were always writing about. If 
              you say you love him, I know I shall do something desperate.&quot; 
              And he looked as if he would keep his word, as he clenched his hands 
              with a wrathful spark in his eyes. </p>
            <p>Jo wanted to laugh, but restrained herself and said warmly, for 
              she too, was getting excited with all this, &quot;Don't swear, Teddy! 
              He isn't old, nor anything bad, but good and kind, and the best 
              friend I've got, next to you. Pray, don't fly into a passion. I 
              want to be kind, but I know I shall get angry if you abuse my Professor. 
              I haven't the least idea of loving him or anybody else.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;But you will after a while, and then what will become of 
              me?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You'll love someone else too, like a sensible boy, and forget 
              all this trouble.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I can't love anyone else, and I'll never forget you, Jo, 
              Never! Never!&quot; with a stamp to emphasize his passionate words. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;What shall I do with him?&quot; sighed Jo, finding that 
              emotions were more unmanagable than she expected. &quot;You haven't 
              heard what I wanted to tell you. Sit down and listen, for indeed 
              I want to do right and make you happy,&quot; she said, hoping to 
              soothe him with a little reason, which proved that she knew nothing 
              about love. </p>
            <p>Seeing a ray of hope in that last speech, Laurie threw himself 
              down on the grass at her feet, leaned his arm on the lower step 
              of the stile, and looked up at her with an expectant face. Now that 
              arrangement was not conducive to calm speech or clear thought on 
              Jo's part, for how could she say hard things to her boy while he 
              watched her with eyes full of love and longing, and lashes still 
              wet with the bitter drop or two her hardness of heart had wrung 
              from him? She gently turned his head away, saying, as she stroked 
              the wavy hair which had been allowed to grow for her sake--how touching 
              that was, to be sure! &quot;I agree with Mother that you and I are 
              not suited to each other, because our quick tempers and strong wills 
              would probably make us very miserable, if we were so foolish as 
              to...&quot; Jo paused a little over the last word, but Laurie uttered 
              it with a rapturous expression. </p>
            <p>&quot;Marry--no we shouldn't! If you loved me, Jo, I should be 
              a perfect saint, for you could make me anything you like.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;No, I can't. I've tried and failed, and I won't risk our 
              happiness by such a serious experiment. We don't agree and we never 
              shall, so we'll be good friends all our lives, but we won't go and 
              do anything rash.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, we will if we get the chance,&quot; muttered Laurie 
              rebelliously. </p>
            <p>&quot;Now do be reasonable, and take a sensible view of the case,&quot; 
              implored Jo, almost at her wit's end. </p>
            <p>&quot;I won't be reasonable. I don't want to take what you call 
              `a sensible view'. It won't help me, and it only makes it harder. 
              I don't believe you've got any heart.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I wish I hadn't.&quot; </p>
            <p>There was a little quiver in Jo's voice, and thinking it a good 
              omen, Laurie turned round, bringing all his persuasive powers to 
              bear as he said, in the wheedlesome tone that had never been so 
              dangerously wheedlesome before, &quot;Don't disappoint us, dear! 
              Everyone expects it. Grandpa has set his heart upon it, your people 
              like it, and I can't get on without you. Say you will, and let's 
              be happy. Do, do!&quot; </p>
            <p>Not until months afterward did Jo understand how she had the strength 
              of mind to hold fast to the resolution she had made when she decided 
              that she did not love her boy, and never could. It was very hard 
              to do, but she did it, knowing that delay was both useless and cruel. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;I can't say `yes' truly, so I won't say it at all. You'll 
              see that I'm right, by-and-by, and thank me for it...&quot; she 
              began solemnly. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'll be hanged if I do!&quot; And Laurie bounced up off the 
              grass, burning with indignation at the very idea. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, you will!&quot; persisted Jo. &quot;You'll get over 
              this after a while, and find some lovely accomplished girl, who 
              will adore you, and make a fine mistress for your fine house. I 
              shouldn't. I'm homely and awkward and odd and old, and you'd be 
              ashamed of me, and we should quarrel--we can't help it even now, 
              you see-and I shouldn't like elegant society and you would, and 
              you'd hate my scribbling, and I couldn't get on without it, and 
              we should be unhappy, and wish we hadn't done it, and everything 
              would be horrid!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Anything more?&quot; asked asked Laurie, finding it hard 
              to listen patiently to this prophetic burst. </p>
            <p>&quot;Nothing more, except that I don't believe I shall ever marry. 
              I'm happy as I am, and love my liberty too well to be in a hurry 
              to give it up for any mortal man.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I know better!&quot; broke in Laurie. &quot;You think so 
              now, but there'll come a time when you will care for somebody, and 
              you'll love him tremendously, and live and die for him. I know you 
              will, it's your way, and I shall have to stand by and see it.&quot; 
              And the despairing lover cast his hat upon the ground with a gesture 
              that would have seemed comical, if his face had not been so tragic. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Yes, I will live and die for him, if her ever comes and 
              makes me love him in spite of myself, and you must do the best you 
              can!&quot; cried Jo, losing patience with poor Teddy. &quot;I've 
              done my best, but you won't be reasonable, and it's selfish of you 
              to keep teasing for what I can't give. I shall always be fond of 
              you, very fond indeed, as a friend, but I'll never marry you, and 
              the sooner you believe it the better for both of us--so now!&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>That speech was like gunpowder. Laurie looked at her a minute as 
              if he did not quite know what to do with himself, then turned sharply 
              away, saying in a desperate sort of tone, &quot;You'll be sorry 
              some day, Jo.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, where are you going?&quot; she cried, for his face frightened 
              her. </p>
            <p>&quot;To the devil!&quot; was the consoling answer. </p>
            <p>For a minute Jo's heart stood still, as he swung himself down the 
              bank toward the river, but it takes much folly, sin or misery to 
              send a young man to a violent death, and Laurie was not one of the 
              weak sort who are conquered by a single failure. He had no thought 
              of a melodramatic plunge, but some blind instinct led him to fling 
              hat and coat into his boat, and row away with all his might, making 
              better time up the river than he had done in any race. Jo drew a 
              long breath and unclasped her hands as she watched the poor fellow 
              trying to outstrip the trouble which he carried in his heart.</p>
            <p>&quot;That will do him good, and he'll come home in such a tender, 
              penitent state of mind, that I shan't dare to see him.&quot; she 
              said, adding, as she went slowly home, feeling as if she had murdered 
              some innocent thing, and buried it under the leaves. &quot;Now I 
              must go and prepare Mr. Laurence to be very kind to my poor boy. 
              I wish he'd love Beth, perhaps he may in time, but I begin to think 
              I was mistaken about her. Oh dear! How can girls like to have lovers 
              and refuse them? I think it's dreadful.&quot;</p>
            <p>Being sure that no one could do it so well as herself, she went 
              straight to Mr. Laurence, told the hard story bravely through, and 
              then broke down, crying so dismally over her own insensibility that 
              the kind old gentleman, though sorely disappointed, did not utter 
              a reproach. He found it difficult to understand how any girl could 
              help loving Laurie, and hoped she would change her mind, but he 
              knew even better than Jo that love cannot be forced, so he shook 
              his head sadly and resolved to carry his boy out of harm's way, 
              for Young Impetuosity's parting words to Jo disturbed him more than 
              he would confess. </p>
            <p>When Laurie came home, dead tired but quite composed, his grandfather 
              met him as if he knew nothing, and kept up the delusion very successfully 
              for an hour or two. But when they sat together in the twilight, 
              the time they used to enjoy so much, it was hard work for the old 
              man to ramble on as usual, and harder still for the young one to 
              listen to praises of the last year's success, which to him now seemed 
              like love's labor lost. He bore it as long as he could, then went 
              to his piano and began to play. The window's were open, and Jo, 
              walking in the garden with Beth, for once understood music better 
              than her sister, for he played the `SONATA PATHETIQUE', and played 
              it as he never did before. </p>
            <p>&quot;That's very fine, I dare say, but it's sad enough to make 
              one cry. Give us something gayer, lad,&quot; said Mr. Laurence, 
              whose kind old heart was full of sympathy, which he longed to show 
              but knew not how. </p>
            <p>Laurie dashed into a livelier strain, played stormily for several 
              minutes, and would have got through bravely, if in a momentary lull 
              Mrs. March's voice had not been heard calling, &quot;Jo, dear, come 
              in. I want you.&quot; </p>
            <p>Just what Laurie longed to say, with a different meaning! As he 
              listened, he lost his place, the music ended with a broken chord, 
              and the musician sat silent in the dark. </p>
            <p>&quot;I can't stand this,&quot; muttered the old gentleman. Up 
              he got, groped his way to the piano, laid a kind hand on either 
              of the broad shoulders, and said, as gently as a woman, &quot;I 
              know, my boy, I know.&quot; </p>
            <p>No answer for an instant, then Laurie asked sharply, &quot;Who 
              told you?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Jo herself.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Then there's an end of it!&quot; And he shook off his grandfather's 
              hands with an impatient motion, for though grateful for the sympathy, 
              his man's pride could not bear a man's pity. </p>
            <p> &quot;Not quite. I want to say one thing, and then there shall 
              be an end of it,&quot; returned Mr. Laurence with unusual mildness. 
              &quot;You won't care to stay at home now, perhaps?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't intend to run away from a girl. Jo can't prevent 
              my seeing her, and I shall stay and do it as long as I like,&quot; 
              interrupted Laurie in a defiant tone. </p>
            <p>&quot;Not if you are the gentleman I think you. I'm disappointed, 
              but the girl can't help it, and the only thing left for you to do 
              is to go away for a time. Where will you go?&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;Anywhere. I don't care what becomes of me.&quot; And Laurie 
              got up with a reckless laugh that grated on his grandfather's ear. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Take it like a man, and don't do anything rash, for God's 
              sake. Why not go abroad, as you planned, and forget it?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I can't.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;But you've been wild to go, and I promised you should when 
              you got through college.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Ah, but I didn't mean to go alone!&quot; And Laurie walked 
              fast through the room with an expression which it was well his grandfather 
              did not see. </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't ask you to go alone. There's someone ready and glad 
              to go with you, anywhere in the world.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Who, Sir?' stopping to listen. </p>
            <p>&quot;Myself.&quot; </p>
            <p>Laurie came back as quickly as he went, and put out his hand, saying 
              huskily, &quot;I'm a selfish brute, but--you know-Grandfather--&quot;</p>
            <p> &quot;Lord help me, yes, I do know, for I've been through it all 
              before, once in my own young days, and then with your father. Now, 
              my dear boy, just sit quietly down and hear my plan. It's all settled, 
              and can be carried out at once,&quot; said Mr. Laurence, keeping 
              hold of the young man, as if fearful that he would break away as 
              his father had done before him. </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, sir, what is it?&quot; And Laurie sat down, without 
              a sign of interest in face or voice.</p>
            <p>&quot;There is business in London that needs looking after. I meant 
              you should attend to it, but I can do it better myself, and things 
              here will get on very well with Brooke to manage them. My partners 
              do almost everything, I'm merely holding on until you take my place, 
              and can be off at any time.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;But you hate traveling, Sir. I can't ask it of you at your 
              age,&quot; began Laurie, who was grateful for the sacrifice, but 
              much preferred to go alone, if he went at all. The old gentleman 
              knew that perfectly well, and particularly desired to prevent it, 
              for the mood in which he found his grandson assured him that it 
              would not be wise to leave him to his own devices. So, stifling 
              a natural regret at the thought of the home comforts he would leave 
              behind him, he said stoutly, Bless your soul, I'm not superannuated 
              yet. I quite enjoy the idea. It will do me good, and my old bones 
              won't suffer, for traveling nowadays is almost as easy as sitting 
              in a chair.&quot; </p>
            <p>A restless movement from Laurie suggested that his chair was not 
              easy, or that he did not like the plan, and made the old man add 
              hastily, &quot;I don't mean to be a marplot or a burden. I go because 
              I think you'd feel happier than if I was left behind. I don't intend 
              to gad about with you, but leave you free to go where you like, 
              while I amuse myself in my own way. I've friends in London and Paris, 
              and should like to visit them. Meantime you can go to Italy, Germany, 
              Switzerland, where you will, and enjoy pictures, music, scenery, 
              and adventures to your heart's content.&quot; </p>
            <p>Now, Laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely broken and 
              the world a howling wilderness, but at the sound of certain words 
              which the old gentleman artfully introduced into his closing sentence, 
              the broken heart gave an unexpected leap, and a green oasis or two 
              suddenly appeared in the howling wilderness. He sighed, and then 
              said, in a spiritless tone, &quot;Just as you like, Sir. It doesn't 
              matter where I go or what I do.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;It does to me, remember that, my lad. I give you entire liberty, 
              but I trust you to make an honest use of it. Promise me that, Laurie.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Anything you like, Sir.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Good,&quot; thought the old gentleman. &quot;You don't care 
              now, but there'll come a time when that promise will keep you out 
              of mischief, or I'm much mistaken.&quot; </p>
            <p>Being an energetic individual, Mr. Laurence struck while the iron 
              was hot, and before the blighted being recovered spirit enough to 
              rebel, they were off. During the time necessary for preparation, 
              Laurie bore himself as young gentleman usually do in such cases. 
              He was moody, irritable, and pensive by turns, lost his appetite, 
              neglected his dress and devoted much time to playing tempestuously 
              on his piano, avoided Jo, but consoled himself by staring at her 
              from his window, with a tragic face that haunted her dreams by night 
              and oppressed her with a heavy sense of guilt by day. Unlike some 
              sufferers, he never spoke of his unrequited passion, and would allow 
              no one, not even Mrs. March, to attempt consolation or offer sympathy. 
              On some accounts, this was a relief to his friends, but the weeks 
              before his departure were very uncomfortable, and everyone rejoiced 
              that the `poor, dear fellow was going away to forget his trouble, 
              and come home happy'. Of course, he smiled darkly at their delusion, 
              but passed it by with the sad superiority of one who knew that his 
              fidelity like his love was unalterable. </p>
            <p>When the parting came he affected high spirits, to conceal certain 
              inconvenient emotions which seemed inclined to assert themselves. 
              This gaiety did not impose upon anybody, but they tried to look 
              as if it did for his sake, and he got on very well till Mrs. March 
              kissed him, whit a whisper full of motherly solicitude. Then feeling 
              that he was going very fast, he hastily embraced them all round, 
              not forgetting the afflicted Hannah, and ran downstairs as if for 
              his life. Jo followed a minute after to wave her hand to him if 
              he looked round. He did look round, came back, put his arms about 
              her as she stood on the step above him, and looked up at her with 
              a face that made his short appeal eloquent and pathetic. </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, Jo, can't you?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Teddy, dear, I wish I could!&quot; </p>
            <p>That was all, except a little pause. Then Laurie straightened himself 
              up, said, &quot;It's all right, never mind,&quot; and went away 
              without another word. Ah, but it wasn't all right, and Jo did mind, 
              for while the curly head lay on her arm a minute after her hard 
              answer, she felt as if she had stabbed her dearest friend, and when 
              he left her without a look behind him, she knew that the boy Laurie 
              never would come again. </p>

            <p> <br>
              I cannot feel that I have done my duty as humble historian of the 
              March family, without devoting at least one chapter to the two most 
              precious and important members of it. Daisy and Demi had now arrived 
              at years of discretion, for in this fast age babies of three or 
              four assert their rights, and get them, too, which is more than 
              many of their elders do. If there ever were a pair of twins in danger 
              of being utterly spoiled by adoration, it was these prattling Brookes. 
              Of course they were the most remarkable children ever born, as will 
              be shown when I mention that they walked at eight months, talked 
              fluently at twelve months, and at two years they took their places 
              at table, and behaved with a propriety which charmed all beholders. 
              At three, Daisy demanded a `needler', and actually made a bag with 
              four stitches in it. She likewise set up housekeeping in the sideboard, 
              and managed a microscopic cooking stove with a skill that brought 
              tears of pride to Hannah's eyes, while Demi learned his letters 
              with his grandfather, who invented a new mode of teaching the alphabet 
              by forming letters with his arms and legs, thus uniting gymnastics 
              for head and heels. The boy early developed a mechanical genius 
              which delighted his father and distracted his mother, for he tried 
              to imitate every machine he saw, and kept the nursery in a chaotic 
              condition, with his `sewinsheen', a mysterious structure of string, 
              chairs, clothespins, and spools, for wheels to go `wound and wound'. 
              Also a basket hung over the back of a chair, in which he vainly 
              tried to hoist his too confiding sister, who, with feminine devotion, 
              allowed her little head to be bumped till rescued, when the young 
              inventor indignantly remarked, &quot;Why, Marmar, dat's my lellywaiter, 
              and me's trying to pull her up.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              Though utterly unlike in character, the twins got on remarkably 
              well together, and seldom quarreled more than thrice a day. Of course, 
              Demi tyrannized over Daisy, and gallantly defended her from every 
              other aggressor, while Daisy made a galley slave of herself, and 
              adored her brother as the one perfect being in the world. A rosy, 
              chubby, sunshiny little soul was Daisy, who found her way to everybody's 
              heart, and nestled there. One of the captivating children, who seem 
              made to be kissed and cuddled, adorned and adored like little goddesses, 
              and produced for general approval on all festive occasions. Her 
              small virtues were so sweet that she would have been quite angelic 
              if a few small naughtinesses had not kept her delightfully human. 
              It was all fair weather in her world, and every morning she scrambled 
              up to the window in her little nightgown to look our, and say, no 
              matter whether it rained or shone, &quot;Oh, pitty day, oh, pitty 
              day!&quot; Everyone was a friend, and she offered kisses to a stranger 
              so confidingly that the most inveterate bachelor relented, and baby-lovers 
              became faithful worshipers. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Me loves evvybody,&quot; she once said, opening her arms, 
              with her spoon in one hand, and her mug in the other, as if eager 
              to embrace and nourish the whole world. <br>
              <br>
              As she grew, her mother began to feel that the Dovecote would be 
              blessed by the presence of an inmate as serene and loving as that 
              which had helped to make the old house home, and to pray that she 
              might be spared a loss like that which had latelytaught them how 
              long they had entertained an angel unawares. Her grandfather often 
              called her `Beth', and her grandmother watched over her with untiring 
              devotion, as if trying to atone for some past mistake, which no 
              eye but her own could see. <br>
              <br>
              Demi, like a true Yankee, was of an inquiring turn, wanting to know 
              everything, and often getting much disturbed because he could not 
              get satisfactory answers to his perpetual &quot;What for?&quot; 
              <br>
              <br>
              He also possessed a philosophic bent, to the great delight of his 
              grandfather, who used to hold Socratic conversations with him, in 
              which the precocious pupil occasionally posed his teacher, to the 
              undisguised satisfaction of the womenfolk. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;What makes my legs go, Dranpa?&quot; asked the young philosopher, 
              surveying those active portions of his frame with a meditative air, 
              while resting after a go-to-bed frolic one night. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;It's your little mind, Demi,&quot; replied the sage, stroking 
              the yellow head respectfully. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;What is a little mine?&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;It is something which makes your body move, as the spring 
              made the wheels go in my watch when I showed it to you.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Open me. I want to see it go wound.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I can't do that any more than you could open the watch. God 
              winds you up, and you go till He stops you.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Does I?&quot; And Demi's brown eyes grew big and bright as 
              he took in the new thought. &quot;Is I wounded up like the watch?&quot; 
              <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Yes, but I can't show you how, for it is done when we don't 
              see.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              Demi felt his back, as if expecting to find it like that of the 
              watch, and then gravely remarked, &quot;I dess Dod does it when 
              I's asleep.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              A careful explanation followed, to which he listened so attentively 
              that his anxious grandmother said, &quot;My dear, do you think it 
              wise to talk about such things to that baby? He's getting great 
              bumps </p>
            <p>over his eyes, and learning to ask the most unanswerable questions.&quot; 
              <br>
              &quot;If he is old enough to ask the question he is old enough to 
              receive true answers. I am not putting the thoughts into his head, 
              but helping him unfold those already there. These children are wiser 
              than we are, and I have no doubt the boy understands every word 
              I have said to him. Now, Demi, tell me where you keep your mind.&quot; 
              <br>
              <br>
              If the boy had replied like Alcibiades, &quot;By the gods, Socrates, 
              I cannot tell,&quot; his grandfather would not have been surprised, 
              but when, after standing a moment on one leg, like a meditative 
              youngstork, he answered, in a tone of calm conviction, &quot;In 
              my little belly,&quot; the old gentleman could only join in Grandma's 
              laugh, and dismiss the class in metaphysics. <br>
              <br>
              There might have been cause for maternal anxiety, if Demi had not 
              given convincing proofs that he was a true boy, as well as a budding 
              philosopher, for often, after a discussion which caused Hannah to 
              prophesy, with ominous nods, &quot;That child ain't long for this 
              world,&quot; he would turn about and set her fears at rest by some 
              of the pranks with which dear, dirty, naughty little rascals distract 
              and delight their parent's souls. <br>
              <br>
              Meg made many moral rules, and tried to keep them, but what mother 
              was ever proof against the winning wiles, the ingenious evasions, 
              or the tranquil audacity of the miniature men and women who so early 
              show themselves accomplished Artful Dodgers? <br>
              <br>
              &quot;No more raisins, Demi. They'll make you sick,&quot; says Mamma 
              to the young person who offers his services in the kitchen with 
              unfailing regularity on plum-pudding day. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Me likes to be sick.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I don't want to have you, so run away and help Daisy make 
              patty cakes.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              He reluctantly departs, but his wrongs weigh upon his spirit, and 
              by-and-by when an opportunity comes to redress them, he outwits 
              Mamma by a shrewd bargain. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Now you have been good children, and I'll play anything you 
              like,&quot; says Meg, as she leads her assistant cooks upstairs, 
              when the pudding is safely bouncing in the pot. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Truly, Marmar?&quot; asks Demi, with a brilliant idea in his 
              well-powdered head. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Yes, truly. Anything you say,&quot; replies the shortsighted 
              parent, preparing herself to sing, &quot;The Three Little Kittens&quot; 
              half a dozen times over, or to take her family to &quot;Buy a penny 
              bun,&quot; regardless of wind or limb. But Demi corners her by the 
              cool reply... <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Then we'll go and eat up all the raisins.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              Aunt Dodo was chief playmate and confidante of both children, and 
              the trio turned the little house topsy-turvy. Aunt Amy was as yet 
              only a name to them, Aunt Beth soon faded into a pleasantly vague 
              memory, but Aunt Dodo was a living reality, and they made the most 
              of her, for which compliment she was deeply grateful. But when Mr. 
              Bhaer came, Jo neglected her playfellows, and dismay and desolation 
              fell upon their little souls. Daisy, who was fond of going about 
              peddling kisses, lost her best customer and became bankrupt. Demi, 
              with infantile penetration, soon discovered that Dodo like to play 
              with `the bear-man' better than she did him, but though hurt, he 
              concealed his anguish, for he hadn't the heart to insult a rival 
              who kept a mine of chocolate drops inhis waistcoat pocket, and a 
              watch that could be taken out of its case and freely shaken by ardent 
              admirers. <br>
              <br>
              Some persons might have considered these pleasing liberties as bribes, 
              but Demi didn't see it in that light, and continued to patronize 
              the `the bear-man' with pensive affability, while Daisy bestowed 
              her small affections upon him at the third call, and considered 
              his shoulder her throne, his arm her refuge, his gifts treasures 
              surpassing worth. <br>
              <br>
              Gentlemen are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration for 
              the young relatives of ladies whom they honor with their regard, 
              but this counterfeit philoprogenitiveness sits uneasily upon them, 
              and does not deceive anybody a particle. Mr. Bhaer's devotion was 
              sincere, however likewise effective--for honesty is the best policy 
              in love as in law. He was one of the men who are at home with children, 
              and looked particularly well when little faces made a pleasant contrast 
              with his manly one. His business, whatever it was, detained him 
              from day to day, but evening seldom failed to bring him out to see--well, 
              he always asked for Mr. March, so I suppose he was the attraction. 
              The excellent papa labored under the delusion that he was, and reveled 
              in long discussions with the kindred spirit, till a chance remark 
              of his more observing grandson suddenly enlightened him. <br>
              <br>
              Mr. Bhaer came in one evening to pause on the threshold of the study, 
              astonished by the spectacle that met his eye. Prone uponthe floor 
              lay Mr. March, with his respectable legs in the air, and beside 
              him, likewise prone, was Demi, trying to imitate the attitude with 
              his own short, scarlet-stockinged legs, both grovelers so seriously 
              absorbed that they were unconscious of spectators, till Mr. Bhaer 
              laughed his sonorous laugh, and Jo cried out, with a scandalized 
              face... <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Father, Father, here's the Professor!&quot; <br>
              <br>
              Down went the black legs and up came the gray head, as the preceptor 
              said, with undisturbed dignity, &quot;Good evening, Mr. Bhaer. Excuse 
              me for a moment. We are just finishing our lesson. Now, Demi, make 
              the letter and tell its name.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I knows him!&quot; And, after a few convulsive efforts, the 
              red legs tok the shape of a pair of compasses, and the intelligent 
              pupil triumphantly shouted, &quot;It's a We, Dranpa, it's a We!&quot; 
              <br>
              <br>
              &quot;He's a born Weller,&quot; laughed Jo, as her parent gathered 
              himself up, and her nephew tried to stand on his head, as the only 
              mode of expressing his satisfaction that school was over. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;What have you been at today, bubchen?&quot; asked Mr. Bhaer, 
              picking up the gymnast. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Me went to see little Mary.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And what did you there?&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I kissed her,&quot; began Demi, with artless frankness. &quot;Prut! 
              Thou beginnest early. What did the little Mary say to that?&quot; 
              asked Mr. Bhaer, continuing to confess the young sinner, who stood 
              upon the knee, exploring the waistcoat pocket. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Oh, she liked it, and she kissed me, and I liked it. Don't 
              little boys like little girls?&quot; asked Demi, with his mouth 
              full, and an air of bland satisfaction. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;You precious chick! Who put that into your head?&quot; said 
              Jo, enjoying the innocent revelation as much as the Professor. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;`Tisn't in mine head, it's in mine mouf,&quot; answered literal 
              Demi, putting out his tongue, with a chocolate drop on it, thinking 
              she alluded to confectionery, not ideas. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Thou shouldst save some for the little friend. Sweets to the 
              sweet, mannling.&quot; And Mr. Bhaer offered Jo some, with a look 
              that made her wonder if chocolate was not the nectar drunk by the 
              gods. Demi also saw the smile, was impressed by it, and artlessy 
              inquired. .. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Do great boys like great girls, to, 'Fessor?&quot; <br>
              <br>
              Like young Washington, Mr. Bhaer `couldn't tell a lie', so he gave 
              the somewhat vague reply that he believed they did sometimes, in 
              a tone that made Mr. March put down his clothesbrush, glance at 
              Jo's retiring face, and then sink into his chair, looking as if 
              the `precocious chick' had put an idea into his head that was both 
              sweet and sour. <br>
              <br>
              Why Dodo, when she caught him in the china closet half an hour afterward, 
              nearly squeezed the breath out of his little body with a tender 
              embrace, instead of shaking him for being there, and why she followed 
              up this novel performance by the unexpected gift of a big slice 
              of bread and jelly, remained one of the problems over which Demi 
              puzzled his small wits, and was forced to leave unsolved forever.

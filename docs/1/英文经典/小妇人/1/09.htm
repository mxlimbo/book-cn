              &quot;I do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that 
              those children should have the measles just now,&quot; said Meg, 
              one April day, as she stood packing the `go abroady' trunk in her 
              room, surrounded by her sisters. </p>
            <p>&quot;And so nice of Annie Moffat not to forget her promise. A 
              whole fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid,&quot; replied 
              Jo, looking like a windmill as she folded skirts with her long arms. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;And such lovely weather, I'm so glad of that,&quot; added 
              Beth, tidily sorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box, lent 
              for the great occasion. </p>
            <p>&quot;I wish I was going to have a fine time and wear all these 
              nice things,&quot; said Amy with her mouth full of pins, as she 
              artistically replenished her sister's cushion. </p>
            <p>&quot;I wish you were all going, but as you can't, I shall keep 
              my adventures to tell you when I come back. I'm sure it's the least 
              I can do when you have been so kind, lending me things and helping 
              me get ready,&quot; said Meg, glancing round the room at the very 
              simple outfit, which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes. </p>
            <p>&quot;What did Mother give you out of the treasure box?&quot; asked 
              Amy, who had not been present at the opening of a certain cedar 
              chest in which Mrs. March kept a few relics of past splendor, as 
              gifts for her girls when the proper time came. </p>
            <p>&quot;A pair of silk stockings, that pretty carved fan, and a lovely 
              blue sash. I wanted the violet silk, but there isn't time to make 
              it over, so I must be contented with my old tarlatan.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;It will look nice over my new muslin skirt, and the sash 
              will set it off beautifully. I wish I hadn't smashed my coral bracelet, 
              for you might have had it,&quot; said Jo, who loved to give and 
              lend, but whose possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of 
              much use. </p>
            <p>&quot;There is a lovely old-fashioned pearl set in the treasure 
              chest, but Mother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament 
              for a young girl, and Laurie promised to send me all I want,&quot; 
              replied Meg. &quot;Now, let me see, there's my new gray walking 
              suit, just curl up the feather in my hat, Beth, then my poplin for 
              Sunday and the small party, it looks heavy for spring, doesn't it? 
              The violet silk would be so nice. Oh, dear!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Never mind, you've got the tarlatan for the big party, and 
              you always look like an angel in white,&quot; said Amy, brooding 
              over the little store of finery in which her soul delighted. </p>
            <p>&quot;It isn't low-necked, and it doesn't sweep enough, but it 
              will have to do. My blue housedress looks so well, turned and freshly 
              trimmed, that I feel as if I'd got a new one. My silk sacque isn't 
              a bit the fashion, and my bonnet doesn't look like Sallie's. I didn't 
              like to say anything, but I was sadly disappointed in my umbrella. 
              I told Mother black with a white handle, but she forgot and bought 
              a green one with a yellowish handle. It's strong and neat, so I 
              ought not to complain, but I know I shall feel ashamed of it beside 
              Annie's silk one with a gold top,&quot; sighed Meg, surveying the 
              little umbrella with great disfavor. </p>
            <p>&quot;Change it,&quot; advised Jo. </p>
            <p>&quot;I won't be so silly, or hurt Marmee's feelings, when she 
              took so much pains to get my things. It's a nonsensical notion of 
              mine, and I'm not going to give up to it. My silk stockings and 
              two pairs of new gloves are my comfort. You are a dear to lend me 
              yours, Jo. I feel so rich and sort of elegant, with two new pairs, 
              and the old ones cleaned up for common.&quot; And Meg took a refreshing 
              peep at her glove box. &quot;Annie Moffat has blue and pink bows 
              on her nightcaps. Would you put some on mine?&quot; she asked, as 
              Beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins, fresh from Hannah's hands. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No, I wouldn't, for the smart caps won't match the plain 
              gowns without any trimming on them. Poor folks shouldn't rig,&quot; 
              said Jo decidedly. </p>
            <p>&quot;I wonder if I shall ever be happy enough to have real lace 
              on my clothes and bows on my caps?&quot; said Meg impatiently. </p>
            <p> &quot;You said the other day that you'd be perfectly happy if 
              you could only go to Annie Moffat's,&quot; observed Beth in her 
              quiet way. </p>
            <p>&quot;So I did! Well, I am happy, and I won't fret, but it does 
              seem as if the more one gets the more one wants, doesn't it? There 
              now, the trays are ready, and everything in but my ball dress, which 
              I shall leave for Mother to pack,&quot; said Meg, cheering up, as 
              she glanced from the half-filled trunk to the many times pressed 
              and mended white tarlatan, which she called her `ball dress' with 
              an important air. </p>
            <p>The next day was fine, and Meg departed in style for a fortnight 
              of novelty and pleasure. Mrs. March had consented to the visit rather 
              reluctantly, fearing that Margaret would come back more discontented 
              than she went. But she begged so hard, and Sallie had promised to 
              take good care of her, and a little pleasure seemed so delightful 
              after a winter of irksome work that the mother yielded, and the 
              daughter went to take her first taste of fashionable life. </p>
            <p>The Moffats were very fashionable, and simple Meg was rather daunted, 
              at first, by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its occupants. 
              But they were kindly people, in spite of the frivolous life they 
              led, and soon put their guest at her ease. Perhaps Meg felt, without 
              understanding why, that they were not particularly cultivated or 
              intelligent people, and that all their gilding could not quite conceal 
              the ordinary material of which they were made. It certainly was 
              agreeable to fare sumptuously, drive in a fine carriage, wear her 
              best frock every day, and do nothing but enjoy herself. It suited 
              her exactly, and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation 
              of those about her, to put on little airs and graces, use French 
              phrases, crimp her hair, take in her dresses, and talk about the 
              fashions as well as she could. The more she saw of Annie Moffat's 
              pretty things, the more she envied her and sighed to be rich. Home 
              now looked bare and dismal as she thought of it, work grew harder 
              than ever, and she felt that she was a very destitute and much-injured 
              girl, in spite of the new gloves and silk stockings. </p>
            <p>She had not much time for repining, however, for the three young 
              girls were busily employed in `having a good time'. They shopped, 
              walked, rode, and called all day, went to theaters and operas or 
              frolicked at home in the evening, for Annie had many friends and 
              knew how to entertain them. Her older sisters were very fine young 
              ladies, and one was engaged, which was extremely interesting and 
              romantic, Meg thought. Mr. Moffat was a fat, jolly old gentleman, 
              who knew her father, and Mrs. Moffat, a fat, jolly old lady, who 
              took as great a fancy to Meg as her daughter had done. Everyone 
              petted her, and `Daisey', as they called her, was in a fair way 
              to have her head turned. </p>
            <p>When the evening for the small party came, she found that the poplin 
              wouldn't do at all, for the other girls were putting on thin dresses 
              and making themselves very fine indeed. So out came the tarlatan, 
              looking older, limper, and shabbier than ever beside Sallie's crisp 
              new one. Meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another, 
              and her cheeks began to burn, for with all her gentleness she was 
              very proud. No one said a word about it, but Sallie offered to dress 
              her hair, and Annie to tie her sash, and Belle, the engaged sister, 
              praised her white arms. But in their kindness Meg saw only pity 
              for her poverty, and her heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself, 
              while the others laughed, chattered, and flew about like gauzy butterflies. 
              The hard, bitter feeling was getting pretty bad, when the maid brought 
              in a box of flowers. Before she could speak, Annie had the cover 
              off, and all were exclaiming at the lovely roses, heath, and fern 
              within. </p>
            <p>&quot;It's for Belle, of course, George always sends her some, 
              but these are altogether ravishing,&quot; cried Annie, with a great 
              sniff. </p>
            <p>&quot;They are for Miss March, the man said. And here's a note,&quot; 
              put in the maid, holding it to Meg. </p>
            <p>&quot;What fun! Who are they from? Didn't know you had a lover,&quot; 
              cried the girls, fluttering about Meg in a high state of curiosity 
              and surprise. </p>
            <p>&quot;The note is from Mother, and the flowers from Laurie,&quot; 
              said Meg simply, yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, indeed!&quot; said Annie with a funny look, as Meg slipped 
              the note into her pocket as a sort of talisman against envy, vanity, 
              and false pride, for the few loving words had done her good, and 
              the flowers cheered her up by their beauty. </p>
            <p>Feeling almost happy again, she laid by a few ferns and roses for 
              herself, and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the 
              breasts, hair, or skirts of her friends, offering them so prettily 
              that Clara, the elder sister, told her she was `the sweetest little 
              thing she ever saw', and they looked quite charmed with her small 
              attention. Somehow the kind act finished her despondency, and when 
              all the rest went to show themselves to Mrs. Moffat, she saw a happy, 
              bright-eyed face in the mirror, as she laid her ferns against her 
              rippling hair and fastened the roses in the dress that didn't strike 
              her as so very shabby now. </p>
            <p>She enjoyed herself very much that evening, for she danced to her 
              heart's content. Everyone was very kind, and she had three compliments. 
              Annie made her sing, and some one said she had a remarkably fine 
              voice. Major Lincoln asked who `the fresh little girl with the beautiful 
              eyes' was, and Mr. Moffat insisted on dancing with her because she 
              `didn't dawdle, but had some spring in her', as he gracefully expressed 
              it. So altogether she had a very nice time, till she overheard a 
              bit of conversation, which disturbed her extremely. She was sitting 
              just inside the conservatory, waiting for her partner to bring her 
              an ice, when she heard a voice ask on the other side of the flowery 
              wall... </p>
            <p>&quot;How old is he?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Sixteen or seventeen, I should say,&quot; replied another 
              voice. </p>
            <p>&quot;It would be a grand thing for one of those girls, wouldn't 
              it? Sallie says they are very intimate now, and the old man quite 
              dotes on them.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Mrs. M. has made her plans, I dare say, and will play her 
              cards well, early as it is. The girl evidently doesn't think of 
              it yet,&quot; said Mrs. Moffat. </p>
            <p>&quot;She told that fib about her momma, as if she did know, and 
              colored up when the flowers came quite prettily. Poor thing! She'd 
              be so nice if she was only got up in style. Do you think she'd be 
              offended if we offered to lend her a dress for Thursday?&quot; asked 
              another voice. </p>
            <p>&quot;She's proud, but I don't believe she'd mind, for that dowdy 
              tarlatan is all she has got. She may tear it tonight, and that will 
              be a good excuse for offering a decent one.&quot; </p>
            <p>Here Meg's partner appeared, to find her looking much flushed and 
              rather agitated. She was proud, and her pride was useful just then, 
              for it helped her hide her mortification, anger, and disgust at 
              what she had just heard. For, innocent and unsuspicious as she was, 
              she could not help understanding the gossip of her friends. She 
              tried to forget it, but could not, and kept repeating to herself, 
              &quot;Mrs. M. has made her plans,&quot; &quot;that fib about her 
              mamma,&quot; and 'dowdy tarlatan,&quot; till she was ready to cry 
              and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for advice. As that was 
              impossible, she did her best to seem gay, and being rather excited, 
              she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an effort she was 
              making. She was very glad when it was all over and she was quiet 
              in her bed, where she could think and wonder and fume till her head 
              ached and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears. Those 
              foolish, yet well meant words, had opened a new world to Meg, and 
              much disturbed the peace of the old one in which till now she had 
              lived as happily as a child. Her innocent friendship with Laurie 
              was spoiled by the silly speeches she had overheard. Her faith in 
              her mother was a little shaken by the worldly plans attributed to 
              her by Mrs. Moffat, who judged others by herself, and the sensible 
              resolution to be contented with the simple wardrobe which suited 
              a poor man's daughter was weakened by the unnecessary pity of girls 
              who thought a shabby dress one of the greatest calamities under 
              heaven. </p>
            <p>Poor Meg had a restless night, and got up heavy-eyed, unhappy, 
              half resentful toward her friends, and half ashamed of herself for 
              not speaking out frankly and setting everything right. Everybody 
              dawdled that morning, and it was noon before the girls found energy 
              enough even to take up their worsted work. Something in the manner 
              of her friends struck Meg at once. They treated her with more respect, 
              she thought, took quite a tender interest in what she said, and 
              looked at her with eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity. All this 
              surprised and flattered her, though she did not understand it till 
              Miss Belle looked up from her writing, and said, with a sentimental 
              air... </p>
            <p>&quot;Daisy, dear, I've sent an invitation to your friend, Mr. 
              Laurence, for Thursday. We should like to know him, and it's only 
              a proper compliment to you.&quot; </p>
            <p>Meg colored, but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her 
              reply demurely, &quot;You are very kind, but I'm afraid he won't 
              come.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Why not, Cherie?&quot; asked Miss Belle. </p>
            <p>&quot;He's too old.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;My child, what do you mean? What is his age, I beg to know!&quot; 
              cried Miss Clara. </p>
            <p>&quot;Nearly seventy, I believe,&quot; answered Meg, counting stitches 
              to hide the merriment in her eyes. </p>
            <p>&quot;You sly creature! Of course we meant the young man,&quot; 
              exclaimed Miss Belle, laughing. </p>
            <p>&quot;There isn't any, Laurie is only a little boy.&quot; And Meg 
              laughed also at the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she 
              thus described her supposed lover.&quot;About you age,&quot; Nan 
              said. </p>
            <p>&quot;Nearer my sister Jo's, I am seventeen in August,&quot; returned 
              Meg, tossing her head. </p>
            <p>&quot;It's very nice of him to send you flowers, isn't it?&quot; 
              said Annie, looking wise about nothing. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, he often does, to all of us, for their house is full, 
              and we are so fond of them. My mother and old Mr. Laurence are friends, 
              you know, so it is quite natural that we children should play together.&quot; 
              And Meg hoped they would say no more. </p>
            <p>&quot;It's evident Daisy isn't out yet,&quot; said Miss Clara to 
              Belle with a nod. </p>
            <p>&quot;Quite a pastoral state of innocence all round,&quot; returned 
              Miss Belle with a shrug. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm going out to get some little matters for my girls. Can 
              I do anything for you, young ladies?&quot; asked Mrs. Moffat, lumbering 
              in like an elephant in silk and lace. </p>
            <p>&quot;No, thank you, ma'am,&quot; replied Sallie. &quot;I've got 
              my new pink silk for Thursday and don't want a thing.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Nor I...&quot; began Meg, but stopped because it occurred 
              to her that she did want several things and could not have them. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;What shall you wear?&quot; asked Sallie. </p>
            <p>&quot;My old white one again, if I can mend it fit to be seen, 
              it got sadly torn last night,&quot; said Meg, trying to speak quite 
              easily, but feeling very uncomfortable. </p>
            <p>&quot;Why don't you send home for another?&quot; said Sallie, who 
              was not an observing young lady. </p>
            <p>&quot;I haven't got any other.&quot; It cost Meg an effort to say 
              that, but Sallie did not see it and exclaimed in amiable surprise, 
              &quot;Only that?&quot; How funny...&quot; She did not finish her 
              speech, for Belle shook her head at her and broke in, saying kindly... 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Not at all. Where is the use of having a lot of dresses when 
              she isn't out yet? There's no need of sending home, Daisy, even 
              if you had a dozen, for I've got a sweet blue silk laid away, which 
              I've outgrown, and you shall wear it to please me, won't you, dear?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You are very kind, but I don't mind my old dress if you don't, 
              it does well enough for a little girl like me,&quot; said Meg. </p>
            <p>&quot;Now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style. 
              I admire to do it, and you'd be a regular little beauty with a touch 
              here and there. I shan't let anyone see you till you are done, and 
              then we'll burst upon them like Cinderella and her godmother going 
              to the ball,&quot; said Belle in her persuasive tone. </p>
            <p>Meg couldn't refuse the offer so kindly made, for a desire to see 
              if she would be `a little beauty' after touching up caused her to 
              accept and forget all her former uncomfortable feelings toward the 
              Moffats. </p>
            <p>On the Thursday evening, Belle shut herself up with her maid, and 
              between them they turned Meg into a fine lady. They crimped and 
              curled her hair, they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant 
              powder, touched her lips with coralline salve to make them redder, 
              and Hortense would have added `a soupcon of rouge', if Meg had not 
              rebelled. They laced her into a sky-blue dress, which was so tight 
              she could hardly breathe and so low in the neck that modest Meg 
              blushed at herself in the mirror. A set of silver filagree was added, 
              bracelets, necklace, brooch, and even earrings, for Hortense tied 
              them on with a bit of pink silk which did not show. A cluster of 
              tea-rose buds at the bosom and a ruche, reconciled Meg to the display 
              of her pretty, white shoulders, and a pair of high-heeled silk boots 
              satisfied the last wish of her heart. A lace handkerchief, a plumy 
              fan, and a bouquet in a shoulder holder finished her off, and Miss 
              Belle surveyed her with the satisfaction of a little girl with a 
              newly dressed doll. </p>
            <p>&quot;Mademoiselle is chatmante, tres jolie, is she not?&quot; 
              cried Hortense, clasping her hands in an affected rapture. </p>
            <p>&quot;Come and show yourself,&quot; said Miss Belle, leading the 
              way to the room where the others were waiting. </p>
            <p>As Meg went rustling after, with her long skirts trailing, her 
              earrings tinkling, her curls waving, and her heart beating, she 
              felt as if her fun had really begun at last, for the mirror had 
              plainly told her that she was `a little beauty'. Her friends repeated 
              the pleasing phrase enthusiastically, and for several minutes she 
              stood, like a jackdaw in the fable, enjoying her borrowed plumes, 
              while the rest chattered like a party of magpies. </p>
            <p> &quot;While I dress, do you drill her, Nan, in the management 
              of her skirt and those French heels, or she will trip herself up. 
              Take your silver butterfly, and catch up that long curl on the left 
              side of her head, Clara, and don't any of you disturb the charming 
              work of my hands,&quot; said Belle, as she hurried away, looking 
              well pleased with her success. </p>
            <p>&quot;You don't look a bit like yourself, but you are very nice. 
              I'm nowhere beside you, for Belle has heaps of taste, and you're 
              quite French, I assure you. Let your flowers hang, don't be so careful 
              of them, and be sure you don't trip,&quot; returned Sallie, trying 
              not to care that Meg was prettier than herself. </p>
            <p>Keeping that warning carefully in mind, Margaret got safely downstairs 
              and sailed into the drawing rooms where the Moffats and a few early 
              guests were assembled. She very soon discovered that there is a 
              charm about fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people 
              and secures their respect. Several young ladies, who had taken no 
              notice of her before, were very affectionate all of a sudden. Several 
              young gentlemen, who had only stared at her at the other party, 
              now not only stared, but asked to be introduced, and said all manner 
              of foolish but agreeable things to her, and several old ladies, 
              who sat on the sofas, and criticized the rest of the party, inquired 
              who she was with an air of interest. She heard Mrs. Moffat reply 
              to one of them... </p>
            <p>&quot;Daisy March--father a colonel in the army--one of our first 
              families, but reverses of fortune, you know; intimate friends of 
              the Laurences; sweet creature, I assure you; my Ned is quite wild 
              about her.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Dear me!&quot; said the old lady, putting up her glass for 
              another observation of Meg, who tried to look as if she had not 
              heard and been rather shocked at Mrs. Moffat's fibs. The `queer 
              feeling' did not pass away, but she imagined herself acting the 
              new part of fine lady and so got on pretty well, though the tight 
              dress gave her a side-ache, the train kept getting under her feet, 
              and she was in constant fear lest her earrings should fly off and 
              get lost or broken. She was flirting her fan and laughing at the 
              feeble jokes of a young gentleman who tried to be witty, when she 
              suddenly stopped laughing and looked confused, for just opposite, 
              she saw Laurie. He was staring at her with undisguised surprise, 
              and disapproval also, she thought, for though he bowed and smiled, 
              yet something in his honest eyes made her blush and wish she had 
              her old dress on. To complete her confusion, she saw Belle nudge 
              Annie, and both glance from her to Laurie, who, she was happy to 
              see, looked unusually boyish and shy. </p>
            <p>&quot;Silly creatures, to put such thoughts into my head. I won't 
              care for it, or let it change me a bit,&quot; thought Meg, and rustled 
              across the room to shake hands with her friend. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm glad you came, I was afraid you wouldn't.&quot; she said, 
              with her most grown-up air. </p>
            <p>&quot;Jo wanted me to come, and tell her how you looked, so I did,&quot; 
              answered Laurie, without turning his eyes upon her, though he half 
              smiled at her maternal tone. </p>
            <p>&quot;What shall you tell her?&quot; asked Meg, full of curiosity 
              to know his opinion of her, yet feeling ill at ease with him for 
              the first time. </p>
            <p>&quot;I shall say I didn't know you, for you look so grown-up and 
              unlike yourself, I'm quite afraid of you,&quot; he said, fumbling 
              at his glove button. </p>
            <p>&quot;How absurd of you! The girls dressed me up for fun, and I 
              rather like it. Wouldn't Jo stare if she saw me?&quot; said Meg, 
              bent on making him say whether he thought her improved or not.</p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, I think she would,&quot; returned Laurie gravely. </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't you like me so?' asked Meg. </p>
            <p>&quot;No, I don't,&quot; was the blunt reply. </p>
            <p>&quot;Why not?&quot; in an anxious tone. </p>
            <p>He glanced at her frizzled head, bare shoulders, and fantastically 
              trimmed dress with an expression that abashed her more than his 
              answer, which had not particle of his usual politeness in it. </p>
            <p> &quot;I don't like fuss and feathers.&quot; </p>
            <p>That was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself, and 
              Meg walked away, saying petulantly, &quot;You are the rudest boy 
              I ever saw.&quot; </p>
            <p>Feeling very much ruffled, she went and stood at a quiet window 
              to cool her cheeks, for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably 
              brilliant color. As she stood there, Major Lincoln passed by, and 
              a minute after she heard him saying to his mother... </p>
            <p>&quot;They are making a fool of that little girl. I wanted you 
              to see her, but they have spoiled her entirely. She's nothing but 
              a doll tonight.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, dear!&quot; sighed Meg. &quot;I wish I'd been sensible 
              and worn my own things, then I should not have disgusted other people, 
              or felt so uncomfortable and ashamed of myself.&quot; </p>
            <p>She leaned her forehead on the cool pane, and stood half hidden 
              by the curtains, never minding that her favorite waltz had begun, 
              till some one touched her, and turning, she saw Laurie, looking 
              penitent, as he said, with his very best bow and his hand out... 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Please forgive my rudeness, and come and dance with me.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;I'm afraid it will be to disagreeable to you,&quot; said 
              Meg, trying to look offended and failing entirely. </p>
            <p>&quot;Not a bit of it, I'm dying to do it. Come, I'll be good. 
              I don't like your gown, but I do think you are just splendid.&quot; 
              And he waved his hands, as if words failed to express his admiration. 
              Meg smiled and relented, and whispered as they stood waiting to 
              catch the time, &quot;Take care my skirt doesn't trip you up. It's 
              the plague of my life and I was a goose to wear it.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Pin it round your neck, and then it will be useful,&quot; 
              said Laurie, looking down at the little blue boots, which he evidently 
              approved of. Away they went fleetly and gracefully, for having practiced 
              at home, they were well matched, and the blithe young couple were 
              a pleasant sight to see, as they twirled merrily round and round, 
              feeling more friendly than ever after their small tiff. </p>
            <p>&quot;Laurie, I want you to do me a favor, will you?' said Meg, 
              as he stood fanning her when her breath gave out, which it did very 
              soon though she would not own why. </p>
            <p>&quot;Won't I!&quot; said Laurie, with alacrity. </p>
            <p>&quot;Please don't tell them at home about my dress tonight. </p>
            <p>They won't understand the joke, and it will worry Mother.' </p>
            <p>&quot;Then why did you do it?&quot; said Laurie's eyes, so plainly 
              that Meg hastily added... </p>
            <p>&quot;I shall tell them myself all about it, and `fess' to Mother 
              how silly I've been. But I'd rather do it myself. So you'll not 
              tell, will you?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I give you my word I won't, only what shall I say when they 
              ask me?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Just say I looked pretty well and was having a good time.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;I'll say the first with all my heart, but how about the 
              other? You don't look as if you were having a good time. Are you?' 
              And Laurie looked at her with an expression which made her answer 
              in a whisper... </p>
            <p>&quot;No, not just now. Don't think I'm horrid. I only wanted a 
              little fun, but this sort doesn't pay, I find, and I'm getting tired 
              of it.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Here comes Ned Moffat. What does he want?&quot; said Laurie, 
              knitting his black brows as if he did not regard his young host 
              in the light of a pleasant addition to the party.</p>
            <p>&quot;He put his name down for three dances, and I suppose he's 
              coming for them. What a bore!&quot; said Meg, assuming a languid 
              air which amused Laurie immensely. </p>
            <p>He did not speak to her again till suppertime, when he saw her 
              drinking champagne with Ned and his friend Fisher, who were behaving 
              `like a pair of fools', as Laurie said to himself, for he felt a 
              brotherly sort of right to watch over the Marches and fight their 
              battles whenever a defender was needed. </p>
            <p>&quot;You'll have a splitting headache tomorrow, if you drink much 
              of that. I wouldn't, Meg, your mother doesn't like it, you know,&quot; 
              he whispered, leaning over her chair, as Ned turned to refill her 
              glass and Fisher stooped to pick up her fan. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm not Meg tonight, I'm `a doll' who does all sorts of crazy 
              things. Tomorrow I shall put away my `fuss and feathers' and be 
              desperately good again,&quot; se answered with an affected little 
              laugh. </p>
            <p>&quot;Wish tomorrow was here, then,&quot; muttered Laurie, walking 
              off, ill-pleased at the change he saw in her. </p>
            <p>Meg danced and flirted, chattered and giggled, as the other girls 
              did. After supper she undertook the German, and blundered through 
              it, nearly upsetting her partner with her long skirt, and romping 
              in a way that scandalized Laurie, who looked on and meditated a 
              lecture. But he got no chance to deliver it, for Meg kept away from 
              him till he came to say good night. </p>
            <p>&quot;Remember!&quot; she said, trying to smile, for the splitting 
              headache had already begun. </p>
            <p>&quot;Silence a` la mort,&quot; replied Laurie, with a melodramatic 
              flourish, as he went away. </p>
            <p>This little bit of byplay excited Annie's curiosity, but Meg was 
              too tired for gossip and went to bed, feeling as if she had been 
              to a masquerade and hadn't enjoyed herself as much as she expected. 
              She was sick all the next day, and on Saturday went home, quite 
              used up with her fortnight's fun and feeling that she had `sat in 
              the lap of luxury' long enough. </p>
            <p>&quot;It does seem pleasant to be quiet, and not have company manners 
              on all the time. Home is a nice place, though it isn't splendid,&quot; 
              said Meg, looking about her with a restful expression, as she sat 
              with her mother and Jo on the Sunday evening. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm glad to hear you say so, dear, for I was afraid home 
              would seem dull and poor to you after your fine quarters,&quot; 
              replied her mother, who had given her many anxious looks that day. 
              For motherly eyes are quick to see any change in children's faces. 
            </p>
            <p>Meg had told her adventures gayly and said over and over what a 
              charming time she had had, but something still seemed to weigh upon 
              her spirits, and when the younger girls were gone to bed, she sat 
              thoughtfully staring at the fire, saying little and looking worried. 
              As the clock struck nine and Jo proposed bed, Meg suddenly left 
              her chair and, taking Beth's stool, leaned her elbows on her mother's 
              knee, saying bravely... </p>
            <p>&quot;Marmee, I want to `fess'.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I thought so. What is it, dear?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Shall I go away?&quot; asked Jo discreetly. </p>
            <p>&quot;Of course not. Don't I always tell you everything? I was 
              ashamed to speak of it before the younger children, but I want you 
              to know all the dreadful things I did at the Moffats'.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;We are prepared,&quot; said Mrs. March, smiling but looking 
              a little anxious. </p>
            <p>&quot;I told you they dressed me up, but I didn't tell you that 
              they powdered and squeezed and frizzled, and made me look like a 
              fashion plate. Laurie thought I wasn't proper. I know he did, though 
              he didn't say so, and one man called me `a doll'. I knew it was 
              silly, but they flattered me and said I was a beauty, and quantities 
              of nonsense, so I let them make a fool of me.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;Is that all?&quot; asked Jo, as Mrs. March looked silently 
              at the downcast face of her pretty daughter, and could not find 
              it in her heart to blame her little follies. </p>
            <p>&quot;No, I drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt, and 
              was altogether abominable,&quot; said Meg self-reproachfully. </p>
            <p>&quot;There is something more, I think.&quot; And Mrs. March smoothed 
              the soft cheek, which suddenly grew rosy as Meg answered slowly... 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Yes. It's very silly, but I want to tell it, because I hate 
              to have people say and think such things about us and Laurie.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>Then she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the Moffats', 
              and as she spoke, Jo saw her mother fold her lips tightly, as if 
              ill pleased that such ideas should be put into Meg's innocent mind. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, if that isn't the greatest rubbish I ever heard,&quot; 
              cried Jo indignantly. &quot;Why didn't you pop out and tell them 
              so on the spot?' </p>
            <p>&quot;I couldn't, it was so embarrassing for me. I couldn't help 
              hearing at first, and then I was so angry and ashamed, I didn't 
              remember that I ought to go away.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Just wait till I see Annie Moffat, and I'll show you how 
              to settle such ridiculous stuff. The idea of having `plans' and 
              being kind to Laurie because he's rich and may marry us by-and-by! 
              Won't he shout when I tell him what those silly things say about 
              us poor children?&quot; And Jo laughed, as if on second thoughts 
              the thing struck her as a good joke. </p>
            <p>&quot;If you tell Laurie, I'll never forgive you! She mustn't, 
              must she, Mother?&quot; said Meg, looking distressed. </p>
            <p>&quot;No, never repeat that foolish gossip, and forget it as soon 
              as you can,&quot; said Mrs. March gravely. &quot;I was very unwise 
              to let you go among people of whom I know so little, kind, I dare 
              say, but worldly, ill-bred, and full of these vulgar ideas about 
              young people. I am more sorry than I can express for the mischief 
              this visit may have done you, Meg.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't be sorry, I won't let it hurt me. I'll forget all the 
              bad and remember only the good, for I did enjoy a great deal, and 
              thank you very much for letting me go. I'll not be sentimental or 
              dissatisfied, Mother. I know I'm a silly little girl, and I'll stay 
              with you till I'm fit to take care of myself. But it is nice to 
              be praised and admired, and I can't help saying I like it,&quot; 
              said Meg, looking half ashamed of the confession. </p>
            <p>&quot;That is perfectly natural, and quite harmless, if the liking 
              does not become a passion and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly 
              things. Learn to know and value the praise which is worth having, 
              and to excite the admiration of excellent people by being modest 
              as well as pretty, Meg.&quot; </p>
            <p>Margaret sat thinking a moment, while Jo stood with her hands behind 
              her, looking both interested and a little perplexed, for it was 
              a new thing to see Meg blushing and talking about admiration, lovers, 
              and things of that sort. And Jo felt as if during that fortnight 
              her sister had grown up amazingly, and was drifting away from her 
              into a world where she could not follow. </p>
            <p>&quot;Mother, do you have `plans', as Mrs. Moffat said?&quot; asked 
              Meg bashfully.</p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, my dear, I have a great many, all mothers do, but mine 
              differ somewhat from Mrs. Moffat's, I suspect. I will tell you some 
              of them, for the time has come when a word may set this romantic 
              little head and heart of yours right, on a very serious subject. 
              You are young, Meg, but not too young to understand me, and mothers' 
              lips are the fittest to speak of such things to girls like you. 
              Jo, your turn will come in time, perhaps, so listen to my `plans' 
              and help me carry them out, if they are good.&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo went and sat on one arm of the chair, looking as if she thought 
              they were about to join in some very solemn affair. Holding a hand 
              of each, and watching the two young faces wistfully, Mrs. March 
              said, in her serious yet cheery way... </p>
            <p>&quot;I want my daughters to be beautiful, accomplished, and good. 
              To be admired, loved, and respected. To have a happy youth, to be 
              well and wisely married, and to lead useful, pleasant lives, with 
              as little care and sorrow to try them as God sees fit to send. To 
              be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing 
              which can happen to a woman, and I sincerely hope my girls may know 
              this beautiful experience. It is natural to think of it, Meg, right 
              to hope and wait for it, and wise to prepare for it, so that when 
              the happy time comes, you may feel ready for the duties and worthy 
              of the joy. My dear girls, I am ambitious for you, but not to have 
              you make a dash in the world, marry rich men merely because they 
              are rich, or have splendid houses, which are not homes because love 
              is wanting. Money is a needful and precious thing, and when well 
              used, a noble thing, but I never want you to think it is the first 
              or only prize to strive for. I'd rather see you poor men's wives, 
              if you were happy, beloved, contented, than queens on thrones, without 
              self-respect and peace.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Poor girls don't stand any chance, Belle says, unless they 
              put themselves forward,&quot; sighed Meg. </p>
            <p>&quot;Then we'll be old maids,&quot; said Jo stoutly. &quot;right, 
              Jo. Better be happy old maids than unhappy wives, or unmaidenly 
              girls, running about to find husbands,&quot; said Mrs. March decidedly. 
              &quot;Don't be troubled, Meg, poverty seldom daunts a sincere lover. 
              Some of the best and most honored women I know were poor girls, 
              but so love-worthy that they were not allowed to be old maids. Leave 
              these things to time. Make this home happy, so that you may be fit 
              for homes of your own, if they are offered you, and contented here 
              if they are not. One thing remember, my girls. Mother is always 
              ready to be your confidante, Father to be your friend, and both 
              of hope and trust that our daughters, whether married or single, 
              will be the pride and comfort of out lives.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;We will, Marmee, we will!&quot; cried both, with all their 
              hearts, as she bade them good night. </p>

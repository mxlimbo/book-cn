            <p> <br>
              &quot;What in the world are you going to do now, Jo.&quot; asked 
            </p>
            <p>Meg one snowy afternoon, as her sister came tramping through the 
              hall, in rubber boots, old sack, and hood, with a broom in one hand 
              and a shovel in the other. </p>
            <p>&quot;Going out for exercise,&quot; answered Jo with a mischievous 
              twinkle in her eyes. </p>
            <p>&quot;I should think two long walks this morning would have been 
              enough! It's cold and dull out, and I advise you to stay warm and 
              dry by the fire, as I do,&quot; said Meg with a shiver. </p>
            <p>&quot;Never take advice! Can't keep still all day, and not being 
              a pussycat, I don't like to doze by the fire. I like adventures, 
              and I'm going to find some.&quot; </p>
            <p>Meg went back to toast her feet and read IVANHOE, and Jo began 
              to dig paths with great energy. The snow was light, and with her 
              broom she soon swept a path all round the garden, for Beth to walk 
              in when the sun came out and the invalid dolls needed air. Now, 
              the garden separated the Marches' house from that of Mr. Laurence. 
              Both stood in a suburb of the city, which was still countrylike, 
              with groves and lawns, large gardens, and quiet streets. A low hedge 
              parted the two estates. On one side was an old, brown house, looking 
              rather bare and shabby, robbed of the vines that in summer covered 
              its walls and the flowers, which then surrounded it. On the other 
              side was a stately stone mansion, plainly betokening every sort 
              of comfort and luxury, from the big coach house and well-kept grounds 
              to the conservatory and the glimpses of lovely things one caught 
              between the rich curtains. </p>
            <p>Yet it seemed a lonely, lifeless sort of house, for no children 
              frolicked on the lawn, no motherly face ever smiled at the windows, 
              and few people went in and out, except the old gentleman and his 
              grandson. </p>
            <p>To Jo's lively fancy, this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted 
              palace, full of splendors and delights which no one enjoyed. She 
              had long wanted to behold these hidden glories, and to know the 
              Laurence boy, who looked as if he would like to be known, if he 
              only knew how to begin. Since the party, she had been more eager 
              than ever, and had planned many ways of making friends with him, 
              but he had not been seen lately, and Jo began to think he had gone 
              away, when she one day spied a brown face at an upper window, looking 
              wistfully down into their garden, where Beth and Amy were snow-balling 
              one another. </p>
            <p> &quot;That boy is suffering for society and fun,&quot; she said 
              to herself. &quot;His grandpa does not know what's good for him, 
              and keeps him shut up all alone. He needs a party of jolly boys 
              to play with, or somebody young and lively. I've a great mind to 
              go over and tell the old gentleman so!&quot; </p>
            <p>The idea amused Jo. who liked to do daring things and was always 
              scandalizing Meg by her queer performances. The plan of `going over' 
              was not forgotten. And when the snowy afternoon came, Jo resolved 
              to try what could be done. She saw Mr. Lawrence drive off, and then 
              sallied out to dig her way down to the hedge, where she paused and 
              took a survey. All quiet, curtains down at the lower windows, servants 
              out of sight, and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning 
              on a thin hand at the upper window. </p>
            <p>&quot;There he is,&quot; thought Jo, &quot;Poor boy! All alone 
              and sick this dismal day. It's a shame! I'll toss up a snowball 
              and make him look out, and then say a kind word to him.&quot; </p>
            <p>Up went a handful of soft snow, and the head turned at once, showing 
              a face which lost its listless look in a minute, as the big eyes 
              brightened and the mouth began to smile. Jo nodded and laughed, 
              and flourished her broom as she called out... </p>
            <p>&quot;How do you do? Are you sick?&quot; </p>
            <p>Laurie opened the window, and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven... 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Better, thank you. I've had a bad cold, and been shut up 
              a week.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm sorry. What do you amuse yourself with?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Nothing. It's dull as tombs up here.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't you read?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Not much. They won't let me.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Can't somebody read to you?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Grandpa does sometimes, but my books don't interest him, 
              and I hate to ask Brooke all the time.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Have someone come and see you then.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;There isn't anyone I'd like to see. Boys make such a row, 
              and my head is weak.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Isn't there some nice girl who'd read and amuse you? Girls 
              are quiet and like to play nurse.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't know any.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You know us,&quot; began Jo, then laughed and stopped. </p>
            <p>&quot;So I do! Will you come, please?&quot; cried Laurie. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm not quiet and nice, but I'll come, if Mother will let 
              me. I'll go ask her. Shut the window, like a good boy, and wait 
              till I come.&quot; </p>
            <p>With that, Jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house, 
              wondering what they would all say to her. Laurie was in a flutter 
              of excitement at the idea of having company, and flew about to get 
              ready, for as Mrs. March said, he was `a little gentleman'. and 
              did honor to the coming guest by brushing his curly pate, putting 
              on a fresh color, and trying tidy up the room, which in spite of 
              half a dozen servants, was anything but neat. Presently there came 
              a loud ring, than a decided voice, asking for `Mr. laurie', and 
              a surprised- looking servant came running up to announce a young 
              lady. </p>
            <p>&quot;All right, show her up, it's Miss Jo, &quot;said Laurie, 
              going to the door of his little parlor to meet Jo, who appeared, 
              looking rosy and quite at her ease, with a covered dish in one hand 
              and Beth's three kittens in the other. </p>
            <p>&quot;Here I am, bag and baggage,&quot; she said briskly. &quot;Mother 
              sent her love, and was glad if I could do anything for you. Meg 
              wanted me to bring some of her blancmange, she makes it very nicely, 
              and Beth thought her cats would be comforting. I knew you'd laugh 
              at them, but I couldn't refuse, she was so anxious to do something.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>It so happened that Beth's funny loan was just the thing, for in 
              laughing over the kits, Laurie forgot his bashfulness, and grew 
              sociable at once. </p>
            <p>&quot;That looks too pretty to eat,&quot; he said, smiling with 
              pleasure, as Jo uncovered the dish, and showed the blancmange, surrounded 
              by a garland of green leaves, and the scarlet flowers of Amy's pet 
              geranium.</p>
            <p> &quot;It isn't anything, only they all felt kindly and wanted 
              to show it. Tell the girl to put it away for your tea. It's so simple 
              you can eat it, and being soft, it will slip down without hurting 
              your sore throat. What a cozy room this is!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;It might be it it was kept nice, but the maids are lazy, 
              and I don't know how to make them mind. It worries me though.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;I'll right it up in two minutes, for it only needs to have 
              the hearth brushed, so--and the things made straight on the mantelpiece, 
              so--and the books put here, and the bottles there, and your sofa 
              turned from the light, and the pillows plumped up a bit. Now then, 
              you're fixed.&quot;</p>
            <p>And so he was, for, as she laughed and talked, Jo had whisked things 
              into place and given quite a different air to the room. Laurie watched 
              her in respectful silence, and when she beckoned him to his sofa, 
              he sat down with a sigh of satisfaction, saying gratefully... </p>
            <p> &quot;How kind you are! Yes, that's what it wanted. Now please 
              take the big chair and let me do something to amuse my company.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;No, I came to amuse you. Shall I read aloud?&quot; and Jo 
              looked affectionately toward some inviting books near by. </p>
            <p>&quot;Thank you! I've read all those, and if you don't mind, I'd 
              rather talk,&quot; answered Laurie. </p>
            <p>&quot;Not a bit. I'll talk all day if you'll only set me going. 
              Beth says I never know when to stop.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Is Beth the rosy one, who stays at home good deal and sometimes 
              goes out with a little basket?&quot; asked Laurie with interest. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Yes, that's Beth. She's my girl, and a regular good one 
              she is, too.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;The pretty one is Meg, and the curly-haired one is Amy, I 
              believe?&quot; </p>
            <p>Laurie colored up, but answered frankly, &quot;Why, you see I often 
              hear you calling to one another, and when I'm alone up here, I can't 
              help looking over at your house, you always seem to be having such 
              good times. I beg your pardon for being so rude, but sometimes you 
              forget to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are. 
              And when the lamps are lighted, it's like looking at a picture to 
              see the fire, and you all around the table with your mother. Her 
              face is right opposite, and it looks so sweet behind the flowers, 
              I can't help watching it. I haven't got any mother, you know.&quot; 
              And Laurie poked the fire to hide a little twitching of the lips 
              that he could not control. </p>
            <p>The solitary, hungry look in his eyes went straight to Jo's warm 
              heart. she had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense 
              in her head, and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any 
              child. Laurie was sick and lonely, and feeling how rich she was 
              in home and happiness, she gladly tried to share it with him. Her 
              face was very friendly and her sharp voice unusually gentle as she 
              said... </p>
            <p>&quot;We'll never draw that curtain any more, and I give you leave 
              to look as much as you like. I just wish, though, instead of peeping, 
              you'd come over and see us. Mother is so splendid, she'd do you 
              heaps of good, and Beth would sing to you if I begged her to, and 
              Amy would dance. Meg and I would make you laugh over our funny stage 
              properties, and we'd have jolly times. Wouldn't your grandpa let 
              you?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I think he would, if your mother asked him. He's very kind, 
              though he does not look so, and he lets me do what I like, pretty 
              much, only he's afraid I might be a bother to strangers,&quot; began 
              Laurie, brightening more and more. </p>
            <p>&quot;We are not strangers, we are neighbors, and you needn't think 
              you'd be a bother. We want to know you, and I've been trying to 
              do it this ever so long. We haven't been here a great while, you 
              know, but we have got acquainted with all our neighbors but you.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;You see, Grandpa lives among his books, and doesn't mind 
              much what happens outside. Mr. Brooke, my tutor, doesn't stay here, 
              you know, and I have no one to go about with me, so I just stop 
              at home and get on as I can.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;That's bad. You ought to make an effort and go visiting everywhere 
              you are asked, then you'll have plenty of friends, andpleasant places 
              to go to. Never mind being bashful. It won't last long if you keep 
              going.&quot; </p>
            <p>Laurie turned red again, but wasn't offended at being accused of 
              bashfulness, for there was so much good will in Jo it was impossible 
              not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant. </p>
            <p>&quot;Do you like your school?&quot; asked the boy, changing the 
              subject, after a little pause, during which he stared at the fire 
              and Jo looked about her, well pleased. </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't go to school, I'm a businessman--girl, I mean. I go 
              to wait on my great-aunt, and a dear, cross old soul she is, too,&quot; 
              answered Jo. </p>
            <p>Laurie opened his mouth to ask another question, but remembering 
              just in time that it wasn't manners to make too many inquiries into 
              people's affairs, he shut it again, and looked uncomfortable. </p>
            <p>Jo liked his good breeding, and didn't mind having a laugh at Aunt 
              March, so she gave him a lively description of the fidgety old lady, 
              her fat poodle, the parrot that talked Spanish, and the library 
              where she reveled. </p>
            <p>Laurie enjoyed that immensely, and when she told about the prim 
              old gentleman who came once to woo Aunt March, and in the middle 
              of a fine speech, how Poll had tweaked his wig off to his great 
              dismay, the boy lay back and laughed till the tears ran down his 
              cheeks, and a maid popped her head in to see what was the matter. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! That does me no end of good. Tell on, please,&quot; he 
              said, taking his face out of the sofa cushion, red and shining with 
              merriment. </p>
            <p>Much elated with her success, Jo did `tell on', all about their 
              plays and plans, their hopes and fears for Father, and the most 
              interesting events of the little world in which the sisters lived. 
              Then they got to talking about books, and to Jo's delight, she found 
              that Laurie loved them as well as she did, and had read even more 
              than herself. </p>
            <p>&quot;If you like them so much, come down and see ours. Grandfather 
              is out, so you needn't be afraid,&quot; said Laurie, getting up. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;I'm not afraid of anything,&quot; returned Jo, with a toss 
              of the head. </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't believe you are!&quot; exclaimed the boy, looking 
              at her with much admiration, though he privately thought she would 
              have good reason to be a trifle afraid of the old gentleman, if 
              she met hem in some of his moods. </p>
            <p>The atmosphere of the whole house being summerlike, Laurie led 
              the way from room to room, letting Jo stop to examine whatever struck 
              her fancy. And so, at last they came to the library, where she clapped 
              her hands and pranced, as she always did when especially delighted. 
              It was lined with books, and there were pictures and statues, and 
              distracting little cabinets full of coins and curiosities, and Sleepy 
              Hollow chairs, and queer tables, and bronzes, and best of all, a 
              great open fireplace with quaint tiles all round it. </p>
            <p>&quot;What richness!&quot; sighed Jo, sinking into the depth of 
              a velour chair and gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction. 
              &quot;Theodore Laurence, you ought to be the happiest boy in the 
              world,&quot;she added impressively. </p>
            <p>&quot;A fellow can't live on books,&quot; said Laurie, shaking 
              his head as he perched on a table opposite. </p>
            <p>Before he could more, a bell rang, and Jo flew up, exclaiming with 
              alarm, &quot;Mercy me! It's your grandpa!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, what if it is? You are not afraid of anything, you 
              know,&quot; returned the boy, looking wicked. </p>
            <p>&quot;I think I am a little bit afraid of him, but I don't know 
              why I should be. Marmee said I might come, and I don't think you're 
              any the worse for it,&quot; said Jo, composing herself, though she 
              kept her eyes on the door. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm a great deal better for it, and ever so much obliged. 
              I'm only afraid you are very tired of talking to me. It was so pleasant, 
              I couldn't bear to stop,&quot; said Laurie gratefully.</p>
            <p>&quot;The doctor to see you, sir,&quot; and the maid beckoned as 
              she spoke. </p>
            <p>&quot;Would you mind if I left you for a minute? I suppose I must 
              see him,&quot; said Laurie. </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't mind me. I'm happy as a cricket here,&quot; answered 
              Jo. </p>
            <p>Laurie went away, and his guest amused herself in her own way. 
              She was standing before a fine portrait of the old gentleman when 
              the door opened again, and without turning, she said decidedly, 
              &quot;I'm sure now that I shouldn't be afraid of him, for he's got 
              kind eyes, though his mouth is grim, and he looks as if he had a 
              tremendous will of hisown. He isn't as handsome as my grandfather, 
              but I like him.</p>
            <p>&quot;Thank you, ma'am,&quot; said a gruff voice behind her, and 
              there, to her great dismay, stood old Mr. Laurence. </p>
            <p>Poor Jo blushed till she couldn't blush any redder, and her heart 
              began to beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had said. 
              For a minute a wild desire to run away possessed her, but that was 
              cowardly, and the girls would laugh at her, so she resolved to stay 
              and get out of the scrape as she could. A second look showed her 
              that the living eyes, under the bushy eyebrows, were kinder even 
              than the painted ones, and there was a sly twinkle in them, which 
              lessened her fear a good deal. The gruff voice was gruffer than 
              ever, as the old gentleman said abruptly, after the dreadful pause, 
              &quot;So you're not afraid of me, hey?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Not much, sir.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;And you don't think me as handsome as your grandfather?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Not quite, sir.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;And I've got a tremendous will, have I?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I only said I thought so.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;But you like me in spite of it?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, I do, sir.&quot; </p>
            <p>That answer pleased the old gentleman. He gave a short laugh, shook 
              hands with her, and, putting his finger under her chin, turned up 
              her face, examined it gravely, and let it go, saying with a nod, 
              &quot;You've got your grandfather's spirit, if you haven't his face. 
              He was a fine man, my dear, but what is better, he was a brave and 
              an honest one, and I was proud to be his friend.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; And Jo was quite comfortable after 
              that, for it suited her exactly. </p>
            <p>&quot;What have you been doing to this boy of mine, hey?&quot; 
              was the next question, sharply put. </p>
            <p>&quot;Only trying to be neighborly, sir.&quot; And Jo to how her 
              visit came about. </p>
            <p>&quot;You think he needs cheering up a bit, do you?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, sir, he seems a little lonely, and young folks would 
              do him good perhaps. We are only girls, but we should be glad to 
              help if we could, for we don't forget the splendid Christmas present 
              you sent us,&quot; said Jo eagerly. </p>
            <p>&quot;Tut, tut, tut! That was the boy's affair. How is the poor 
              woman?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Doing nicely, sir.&quot; And off went Jo, talking very fast, 
              as she told all about the Hummels, in whom her mother had interested 
              richer friends than they were. </p>
            <p>&quot;Just her father's way of doing good. I shall come and see 
              your mother some fine day. Tell her so. There's the tea bell, we 
              have it early on the boy's account. Come down and go on being neighborly.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;If you'd like to have me, sir.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Shouldn't ask you, if I didn't.&quot; And Mr. Laurence offered 
              her his arm with old-fashioned courtesy. </p>
            <p>&quot;What would Meg say to this?&quot; thought Jo, as she was 
              marched away, while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself 
              telling the story at home. </p>
            <p>&quot;Hey! Why, what the dickens has come to the fellow?&quot; 
              said the old gentleman, as Laurie came running downstairs and brought 
              up with a start of surprise at the astounding sight of Jo arm in 
              arm with his redoubtable grandfather. </p>
            <p>&quot;I didn't know you'd come, sir,&quot; he began, as Jo gave 
              him a triumphant little glance. </p>
            <p>&quot;That's evident, by the way you racket downstairs. Come to 
              your tea, sir, and behave like a gentleman.&quot; And having pulled 
              the boy's hair by way of a caress, Mr. Laurence walked on, while 
              Laurie went through a series of comic evolutions behind their backs, 
              which nearly produced an explosion of laughter from Jo. </p>
            <p>The old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of 
              tea, but he watched the young people, who soon chatted away like 
              old friends, and the change in his grandson did not escape him. 
              There was color, light, and life in the boy's face now, vivacity 
              in his manner, and genuine merriment in his laugh. </p>
            <p> &quot;She's right, the lad is lonely. I'll see what these little 
              girls can do for him,&quot; thought Mr. Laurence, as he looked and 
              listened. He liked Jo, for her odd, blunt ways suited him, and she 
              seemed to understand the boy almost as well as if she had been one 
              herself. </p>
            <p>If the Laurences had been what Jo called `prim and poky', she would 
              not have got on at all, for such people always made her shy and 
              awkward. But finding them free and easy, she was so herself, and 
              made a good impression. When they rose she proposed to go, but Laurie 
              said he had something more to show her, and took her away to the 
              conservatory, which had been lighted for her benefit. It seemed 
              quite fairylike to Jo, as she went up and down the walks, enjoying 
              the blooming walls on either side, the soft light, the damp sweet 
              air, and the wonderful vines and trees that hung about her, while 
              her new friend cut the finest flowers till his hands were full. 
              Then he tied them up, saying, with the happy look Jo liked to see, 
              &quot;Please give these to your mother, and tell her I like the 
              medicine she sent me very much.&quot; </p>
            <p>They found Mr. Laurence standing before the fire in the great drawing 
              room, by Jo's attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano, 
              which stood open. </p>
            <p>&quot;Do you play?&quot; she asked, turning to Laurie with a respectful 
              expression. </p>
            <p>&quot;Sometimes,&quot; he answered modestly. </p>
            <p>&quot;Please do now. I want to hear it, so I can tell Beth.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Won't you first?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't know how. Too stupid to learn, but I love music dearly.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>So Laurie played and Jo listened, with her nose luxuriously buried 
              in heliotrope and tea roses. Her respect and regard for the `Laurence' 
              boy increased very much, for he played remarkably well and didn't 
              put on any airs. She wished Beth could hear him, but she did not 
              say so, only praised him till he was quite abashed, and his grandfather 
              came to his rescue. </p>
            <p>&quot;That will do, that will do, young lady. too many sugarplums 
              are not good for him. His music isn't bad, but I hope he will do 
              as well in more important things. Going? well, I'm much obliged 
              to you, and I hope you'll come again. My respects to your mother. 
              Good night, Doctor Jo.&quot; </p>
            <p>He shook hands kindly, but looked as if something did not please 
              him. When they got into the hall, Jo asked Laurie if she had said 
              something amiss. He shook his head. </p>
            <p>&quot;No, it was me. He doesn't like to hear me play.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Why not?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'll tell you some day. John is going home with you, as I 
              can't.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;No need of that. I am not a young lady, and it's only a step. 
              Take care of yourself, won't you?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, but you will come again, I hope?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;If you promise to come and see us after you are well.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;I will.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Good night, Laurie!&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Good night, Jo, good night!&quot; </p>
            <p>When all the afternoon's adventures had been told, the family felt 
              inclined to go visiting in a body, for each found something very 
              attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge. Mrs. 
              March wanted to talk of her father with the old man who had not 
              forgotten him, Meg longed to walk in the conservatory, Beth sighed 
              for the grand piano. and Amy was eager to see the fine pictures 
              and statues. </p>
            <p>&quot;Mother, why didn't Mr. Laurence like to have Laurie play?&quot; 
              asked Jo, who was of an inquiring disposition. </p>
            <p>&quot;I am not sure, but I think it was because his son, Laurie's 
              father, married an Italian lady, a musician, which displeased the 
              old man, who is very proud. The lady was good and lovely and accomplished, 
              but he did not like her, and never saw his son after he married. 
              They both died when Laurie was a little child, and then his grandfather 
              took him home. I fancy the boy, who was born in Italy, is not very 
              strong, and the old man is afraid of losing him, which makes him 
              so careful. Laurie comes naturally by his love of music, for he 
              is like his mother, and I dare say his grandfather fears that he 
              may want to be a musician. At any rate, his skill reminds him of 
              the woman he did not like, and so he `glowered' as Jo said.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Dear me, how romantic!&quot; exclaimed Meg. </p>
            <p>&quot;How silly!&quot; said Jo. &quot;Let him be a musician if 
              he wants to, and not plague his life out sending him to college, 
              when he hates to go.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;That's why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners, 
              I suppose. Italians are always nice,&quot; said Meg, who was a little 
              sentimental. </p>
            <p>&quot;What do you know about his eyes and his manners? You never 
              spoke to him, hardly,&quot; cried Jo, who was not sentimental. </p>
            <p> &quot;I saw him at the party, and what you tell shows that he 
              knows how to behave. That was a nice little speech about the medicine 
              Mother sent him.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;He meant the blanc mange, I suppose.&quot; &quot;How stupid 
              you are, child! He meant you, of course.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;Did he?&quot; And Jo opened her eyes as if it had never 
              occurred to her before. </p>
            <p>&quot;I never saw such a girl! You don't know a compliment when 
              you get it,&quot; said Meg, with the air of a young lady who knew 
              all about the matter. </p>
            <p>&quot;I think they are great nonsense, and I'll thank you not to 
              be silly and spoil my fun. Laurie's a nice boy and I like him, and 
              I won't have any sentimental stuff about compliments and such rubbish. 
              We'll all be good to him because he hasn't got any mother, and he 
              may come over and see us, mayn't he, Marmee?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, Jo, your little friend is very welcome, and I hope Meg 
              will remember that children should be children as long as they can.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't call myself a child, and I'm not in my teens yet,&quot; 
              observed Amy. &quot;What do you say, Beth?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I was thinking about our `PILGRIM'S PROGRESS',&quot; answered 
              Beth, who had not heard a word. &quot;How we got out of the Slough 
              and through the Wicket Gate by resolving to be good, and up the 
              steep hill by trying, and that maybe the house over there, full 
              of splendid things, is going to be our Palace Beautiful.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;We have got to get by the lions first,&quot; said Jo, as 
              if she rather liked the prospect. </p>

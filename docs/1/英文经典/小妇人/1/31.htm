              <br>
              London </p>
            <p>Dearest People, </p>
            <p>Here I really sit at a front window of the Bath Hotel, Piccadilly. 
              It's not a fashionable place, but Uncle stopped here years ago, 
              and won't go anywhere else. However, we don't mean to stay long, 
              so it's no great matter. Oh, I can't begin to tell you how I enjoy 
              it all! I never can, so I'll only give you bits out of my notebook, 
              for I've done nothing but sketch and scribble since I started. </p>
            <p>I sent a line from Halifax, when I felt pretty miserable, but after 
              that I got on delightfully, seldom ill, on deck all day, with plenty 
              of pleasant people to amuse me. Everyone was very kind to me, especially 
              the officers. Don't laugh, Jo, gentlemen really are very necessary 
              aboard ship, to hold on to, or to wait upon one, and as they have 
              nothing to do, it's a mercy to make them useful, otherwise they 
              would smoke themselves to death, I'm afraid. </p>
            <p>Aunt and Flo were poorly all the way, and liked to be let alone, 
              so when I had done what I could for them, I went and enjoyed myself. 
              Such walks on deck, such sunsets, such splendid air and waves! It 
              was almost as exciting as riding a fast horse, when we went rushing 
              on so grandly. I wish Beth could have come, it would have done her 
              so much good. As for Jo, she would have gone up and sat on the maintop 
              jib, or whatever the high thing is called, made friends with the 
              engineers, and tooted on the captain's speaking trumpet, she'd have 
              been in such a state of rapture. </p>
            <p>It was all heavenly, but I was glad to see the Irish coast, and 
              found it very lovely, so green and sunny, with brown cabins here 
              and there, ruins on some of the hills, and gentlemen's countryseats 
              in the valleys, with deer feeding in the parks. It was early in 
              the morning, but I didn't regret getting up to see it, for the bay 
              was full of little boats, the shore so picturesque, and a rosy sky 
              overhead. I never shall forget it. </p>
            <p>At Queenstown on of my new acquaintances left us, Mr. Lennox, and 
              when I said something about the Lakes of Killarney, he sighed and 
              and, with a look at me... </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, have you e'er heard of Kate Kearney? <br>
              She lives on the banks of Killarney; <br>
              From the glance of her eye, <br>
              Shun danger and fly, <br>
              For fatal's the glance of Kate Kearney.&quot; </p>
            <p>Wasn't that nonsensical? </p>
            <p>We only stopped at Liverpool a few hours. It's a dirty, noisy place, 
              and I was glad to leave it. Uncle rushed out and bought a pair of 
              dogskin gloves, some ugly, thick shoes, and an umbrella, and got 
              shaved `a la mutton chop, the first thing. Then he flattered himself 
              that he looked like a true Briton, but the first time he had the 
              mud cleaned off his shoes, the little bootblack knew that an American 
              stood in them, and said, with a grin, &quot;There yer har, sir. 
              I've given `em the latest Yankee shine.&quot; It amused Uncle immensely. 
              Oh, I must tell you what that absurd Lennox did! He got his friend 
              Ward, who came on with us, to order a bouquet for me, and the first 
              thing I saw in my room was a lovely one, with &quot;Robert Lennox's 
              compliments,&quot; on the card. Wasn't that fun, girls? I like traveling. 
            </p>
            <p>I never shall get to London if I don't hurry. The trip was like 
              riding through a long picture gallery, full of lovely landscapes. 
              The farmhouses were my delight, with thatched roofs, ivy up to the 
              eaves, latticed windows, and stout women with rosy children at the 
              doors. The very cattle looked more tranquil than ours, as they stood 
              knee-deep in clover, and the hens had a contented cluck, as if they 
              never got nervous like Yankee biddies. Such perfect color I never 
              saw, the grass so green, sky so blue, grain so yellow, woods so 
              dark, I was in a rapture all the way. So was Flo, and we kept bouncing 
              from one side to the other, trying to see everything while we were 
              whisking along at the rate of sixty miles an hour. Aunt was tired 
              and went to sleep, but Uncle read his guidebook, and wouldn't be 
              astonished at anything. This is the way we went on. Amy, flying 
              up--&quot;Oh, that must be Kenilworth, that gray place among the 
              trees!&quot; Flo, darting to my window--&quot;How sweet! We must 
              go there sometime, won't we Papa?&quot; Uncle, calmly admiring his 
              boots--&quot;No, my dear, not unless you want beer, that's a brewery.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>A pause--then Flo cried out, &quot;Bless me, there's a gallows 
              and a man going up.&quot; &quot;Where, where?&quot; shrieks Amy, 
              staring out at two tall posts with a crossbeam and some dangling 
              chains. &quot;A colliery,&quot; remarks Uncle, with a twinkle of 
              the eye. &quot;Here's a lovely flock of lambs all lying down,&quot; 
              says Amy. &quot;See, Papa, aren't they pretty?&quot; added Flo sentimentally. 
              &quot;Geese, young ladies,&quot; returns Uncle, in a tone that keeps 
              us quiet till Flo settles down to enjoy the FLIRTATIONS OF CAPTAIN 
              CAVENDISH, and I have the scenery all to myself. </p>
            <p>Of course it rained when we got to London, and there was nothing 
              to be seen but fog and umbrellas. We rested, unpacked, and shopped 
              a little between the showers. Aunt Mary got me some new things, 
              for I came off in such a hurry I wasn't half ready. A white hat 
              and blue feather, a muslin dress to match, and the loveliest mantle 
              you ever saw. Shopping in Regent Street is perfectly splendid. Things 
              seem so cheap, nice ribbons only sixpence a yard. I laid in a stock, 
              but shall get my gloves in Paris. Doesn't that sound sort of elegant 
              and rich? </p>
            <p>Flo and I, for the fun of it, ordered a hansom cab, while Aunt 
              and Uncle were out, and went for a drive, though we learned afterward 
              that it wasn't the thing for young ladies to ride in them alone. 
              It was so droll! For when we were shut in by the wooden apron, the 
              man drove so fast that Flo was frightened, and told me to stop him. 
              but he was up outside behind somewhere, and I couldn't get at him. 
              He didn't hear me call, nor see me flap my parasol in front, and 
              there we were, quite helpless, rattling away, and whirling around 
              corners at a breakneck pace. At last, in my despair, I saw a little 
              door in the roof, and on poking it open, a red eye appeared, and 
              a beery voice said... </p>
            <p>&quot;Now, then, mum?&quot; </p>
            <p>I gave my order as soberly as I could, and slamming down the door, 
              with an &quot;Aye, aye, mum,&quot; the man made his horse walk, 
              as if going to a funeral. I poked again and said, &quot;A little 
              faster,&quot; then off he went, helter-skelter as before, and we 
              resigned ourselves to our fate. </p>
            <p>Today was fair, and we went to Hyde Park, close by, for we are 
              more aristocratic than we look. The Duke of Devonshire lives near. 
              I often see his footmen lounging at the back gate, and the Duke 
              of Wellington's house is not far off. Such sights as I saw, my dear! 
              It was as good as Punch, for there were fat dowagers rolling about 
              in their red and yellow coaches, with gorgeous Jeameses in silk 
              stockings and velvet coats, up behind, and powdered coachmen in 
              front. Smart maids, with the rosiest children I ever saw, handsome 
              girls, looking half asleep, dandies in queer English hats and lavender 
              kids lounging about, and tall soldiers, in short red jackets and 
              muffin caps stuck on one side, looking so funny I longed to sketch 
              them. </p>
            <p>Rotten Row means `Route de Roi', or the king's way, but now it's 
              more like a riding school than anything else. The horses are splendid, 
              and the men, especially the grooms, ride well, but the women are 
              stiff, and bounce, which isn't according to our rules. I longed 
              to show them a tearing American gallop, for they trotted solemnly 
              up and down, in their scant habits and high hats, looking like the 
              women in a toy Noah's Ark. Everyone rides--old men, stout ladies, 
              little children-- and the young folks do a deal of flirting here, 
              I say a pair exchange rose buds, for it's the thing to wear one 
              in the button-hole, and I thought it rather a nice little idea. 
            </p>
            <p>In the P.M. to Westminster Abbey, but don't expect me to describe 
              it, that's impossible, so I'll only say it was sublime! This evening 
              we are going to see Fechter, which will be an appropriate end to 
              the happiest day of my life. </p>
            <p>It's very late, but I can't let my letter go in the morning without 
              telling you what happened last evening. Who do you think came in, 
              as we were at tea? Laurie's English friends, Fred and Frank Vaughn! 
              I was so surprised, for I shouldn't have known them but for the 
              cards. both are tall fellows with whiskers, Fred handsome in the 
              English style, and Frank much better, for he only limps slightly, 
              and uses no crutches. They had heard from Laurie where we were to 
              be, and came to ask us to their house, but Uncle won't go, so we 
              shall return the call, and see them as we can. They went to the 
              theater with us, and we did have such a good time, for Frank devoted 
              himself to Flo, and Fred and I talked over past, present, and future 
              fun as if we had know each other all our days. Tell Beth Frank asked 
              for her, and was sorry to hear of her ill health. Fred laughed when 
              I spoke of Jo, and sent his `respectful compliments to the big hat'. 
              Neither of them had forgotten Camp Laurence, or the fun we had there. 
              What ages ago it seems, doesn't it? </p>
            <p>Aunt is tapping on the wall for the third time, so I must stop. 
              I really feel like a dissipated London fine lady, writing here so 
              late, with my room full of pretty things, and my head a jumble of 
              parks, theaters, new gowns, and gallant creatures who say &quot;Ah!&quot; 
              and twirl their blond mustaches with the true English lordliness. 
              I long to see you all, and in spite of my nonsense am, as ever, 
              your loving... </p>
            <p>AMY </p>
            <p><br>
            </p>
            <p>PARIS </p>
            <p>Dear girls, </p>
            <p>In my last I told you about our London visit, how kind the Vaughns 
              were, and what pleasant parties they made for us. I enjoyed the 
              trips to Hampton Court and the Kensington Museum more than anything 
              else, for at Hampton I saw Raphael's cartoons, and at the Museum, 
              rooms full of pictures by Turner, Lawrence, Reynolds, Hogarth, and 
              the other great creatures. The day in Richmond Park was charming, 
              for we had a regular English picnic, and I had more splendid oaks 
              and groups of deer than I could copy, also heard a nightingale, 
              and saw larks go up. We `did' London to our heart's content, thanks 
              to Fred and Frank, and were sorry to go away, for though English 
              people are slow to take you in, when they once make up their minds 
              to do it they cannot be outdone in hospitality, I think. The Vaughns 
              hope to meet us in Rome next winter, and I shall be dreadfully disappointed 
              if they don't, for Grace and I are great friends, and the boys very 
              nice fellows, especially Fred. </p>
            <p>Well, we were hardly settled here, when he turned up again, saying 
              he had come for a holiday, and was going to Switzerland. Aunt looked 
              sober at first, but he was so cool about it she couldn't say a word. 
              And now we get on nicely, and are very glad he came, for he speaks 
              French like a native, and I don't know what we should do without 
              him. Uncle doesn't know ten words, and insists on talking English 
              very loud, as if it would make people understand him. Aunt's pronunciation 
              is old-fashioned, and Flo and I, though we flattered ourselves that 
              we knew a good deal, find we don't, and are very grateful to have 
              Fred do the `parley vooing', as Uncle calls it. </p>
            <p>Such delightful times as we are having! Sight-seeing from morning 
              till night, stopping for nice lunches in the gay cafes, and meeting 
              with all sorts of droll adventures. Rainy days I spend in the Louvre, 
              revelling in pictures. Jo would turn up her naughty nose at some 
              of the finest, because she has no soul for art, but I have, and 
              I'm cultivation eye and taste as fast as I can. She would like the 
              relics of great people better, for I've seen her Napoleon's cocked 
              hat and gray coat, his baby's cradle and his old toothbrush, also 
              Marie Antoinette's little shoe, the ring of Saint Denis, Charlemagne's 
              sword, and many other interesting things. I'll talk for hours about 
              them when I come, but haven't time to write. </p>
            <p>The Palais Royale is a heavenly place, so full of bijouterie and 
              lovely things that I'm nearly distracted because I can't buy them. 
              Fred wanted to get me some, but of course I didn't allow it. Then 
              the Bois and Champs Elysees are tres magnifique. I've seen the imperial 
              family several times, the emperor an ugly, hard-looking man, the 
              empress pale and pretty, but dressed in bad taste, I thought--purple 
              dress, green hat, and yellow gloves. Little Nap is a handsome boy, 
              who sits chatting to his tutor, and kissed his hand to the people 
              as he passes in his four-horse barouche, with postilions in red 
              satin jackets and a mounted guard before and behind. </p>
            <p>We often walk in the Tuileries Gardens, for they are lovely, though 
              the antique Luxembourg Gardens suit me better. Pere la Chaise is 
              very curious, for many of the tombs are like small rooms, and looking 
              in, one sees a table, with images or pictures of the dead, and chairs 
              for the mourners to sit in when they come to lament. That is so 
              Frenchy. </p>
            <p>Our rooms are on the Rue de Rivoli, and sitting on the balcony, 
              we look up and down the long, brilliant street. It is so pleasant 
              that we spend our evenings talking there when too tired with our 
              day's work to go out. Fred is very entertaining, and is altogether 
              the most agreeable young man I ever knew-- except Laurie, whose 
              manners are more charming. I wish Fred was dark, for I don't fancy 
              light men, however, the Vaughns are very rich and come of an excellent 
              family, so I won't find fault with their yellow hair, as my own 
              is yellower. </p>
            <p>Next week we are off to Germany and Switzerland, and as we shall 
              travel fast, I shall only be able to give you hasty letters. I keep 
              my diary, and try to `remember correctly and describe clearly all 
              that I see and admire', as Father advised. It is good practice for 
              me, and with my sketchbook will give you a better idea of my tour 
              than these scribbles. </p>
            <p>Adieu, I embrace you tenderly. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>VOTRE AMIE </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>HEIDELBERG <br>
              <br>
              My dear Mamma, </p>
            <p>Having a quiet hour before we leave for Berne, I'll try to tell 
              you what has happened, for some of it is very important, as you 
              will see. </p>
            <p>The sail up the Rhine was perfect, and I just sat and enjoyed it 
              with all my might. Get Father's old guidebooks and read about it. 
              I haven't words beautiful enough to describe it. At Coblenz we had 
              a lovely time, for some students from Bonn, with whom Fred got acquainted 
              on the boat, gave us a serenade. It was a moonlight night, and about 
              one o'clock Flo and I were waked by the most delicious music under 
              our windows. We flew up, and hid behind the curtains, but sly peeps 
              showed us Fred and the students singing away down below. It was 
              the most romantic thing I ever saw--the river, the bridge of boats, 
              the great fortress opposite, moonlight everywhere, and music fit 
              to melt a heart of stone. </p>
            <p>When they were done we threw down some flowers, and saw them scramble 
              for them, kiss their hands to the invisible ladies, and go laughing 
              away, to smoke and drink beer, I suppose. Next morning Fred showed 
              me one of the crumpled flowers in his vest pocket, and looked very 
              sentimental. I laughed at him, and said I didn't throw it, but Flo, 
              which seemed to disgust him, for he tossed it out of the window, 
              and turned sensible again. I'm afraid I'm going to have trouble 
              with that boy, it begins to look like it. </p>
            <p>The baths at Nassau were very gay, so was Baden-Baden, where Fred 
              lost some money, and I scolded him. He needs someone to look after 
              him when Frank is not with him. Kate said once she hoped he'd marry 
              soon, and I quite agree with her that it would be well for him. 
              Frankfurt was delightful. I saw Goeth's house, Schiller's statue, 
              and Dannecker's famous Ariadne. It was very lovely, but I should 
              have enjoyed it more if I had known the story better. I didn't like 
              to ask, as everyone knew it or pretended they did. I wish Jo would 
              tell me all about it. I ought to have read more, for I find I don't 
              know anything, and it mortifies me. <br>
              <br>
              Now comes the serious part, for it happened here, and Fred has just 
              gone. He has been so kind and jolly that we all got quite fond of 
              him. I never thought of anything but a traveling friendship till 
              the serenade night. Since then I've begun to feel that the moonlight 
              walks, balcony talks, and daily adventures were something more to 
              him than fun. I haven't flirted, Mother, truly, but remembered what 
              you said to me, and have done my very best. I can't help it if people 
              like me. I don't try to make them, and it worries me if I don't 
              care for them, though Jo says I haven't got any heart. Now I know 
              Mother will shake her head, and the girls say, &quot;Oh, the mercenary 
              little wretch!&quot;, but I've made up my mind, and if Fred asks 
              me, I shall accept him, though I'm not madly in love. I like him, 
              and we get on comfortably together. He is handsome, young, clever 
              enough, and very rich--ever so much richer than the Laurences. I 
              don't think his family would object, and I should be very happy, 
              for they are all kind, well-bred, generous people, and they like 
              me. Fred, as the eldest twin, will have the estate, I suppose, and 
              such a splendid one it is! A city house in a fashionable street, 
              not so showy as our big houses, but twice as comfortable and full 
              of solid luxury, such as English people believe in. I like it, for 
              it's genuine. I've seen the plate, the family jewels, the old servants, 
              and pictures of the country place, with its park, great house, lovely 
              grounds, and fine horses. Oh, it would be all I should ask! And 
              I'd rather have it than any title such as girls snap up so readily, 
              and find nothing behind. I may be mercenary, but I hate poverty, 
              and don't mean to bear it a minute longer than I can help. One of 
              us must marry well. Meg didn't, Jo won't, Beth can't yet, so I shall, 
              and make everything okay all round. I wouldn't marry a man I hated 
              or despised. You may be sure of that, and though Fred is not my 
              model hero, he does very well, and in time I should get fond enough 
              of him if he was very fond of me, and let me do just as I liked. 
              So I've been turning the matter over in my mind the last week, for 
              it was impossible to help seeing that Fred liked me. He said nothing, 
              but little things showed it. He never goes with Flo, always gets 
              on my side of the carriage, table, or promenade, looks sentimental 
              when we are alone, and frowns at anyone else who ventures to speak 
              tome. Yesterday at dinner, when an Austrian officer stared at us 
              and then said something to his friend, a rakish-looking baron, about 
              `ein wonderschones Blondchen', Fred looked as fierce as a lion, 
              and cut his meat so savagely it nearly flew off his plate. He isn't 
              one of the cool, stiff Englishmen, but is rather peppery, for he 
              has Scotch blood in him, as one might guess from his bonnie blue 
              eyes. </p>
            <p>Well, last evening we went up to the castle about sunset, at least 
              all of us but Fred, who was to meet us there after going to the 
              Post Restante for letters. We had a charming time poking about the 
              ruins, the vaults where the monster tun is, and the beautiful gardens 
              made by the elector long ago for his English wife. I liked the great 
              terrace best, for the view was divine, so while the rest went to 
              see the rooms inside, I sat there trying to sketch the gray stone 
              lion's head on the wall, with scarlet woodbine sprays hanging round 
              it. I felt as if I'd got into a romance, sitting there, watching 
              the Meckar rolling through the valley, listening to the music of 
              the Austrian band below, and waiting for my lover, like a real storybook 
              girl. I had a feeling that something was going to happen and I was 
              ready for it. I didn't feel blushy or quakey, but quite cool and 
              only a little excited. </p>
            <p>By-and-by I heard Fred's voice, and then he came hurrying through 
              the great arch to find me. He looked so troubled that I forgot all 
              about myself, and asked what the matter was. He said he'd just got 
              a letter begging him to come home, for Frank was very ill. So he 
              was going at once on the night train and only had time to say good-by. 
              I was very sorry for him, and disappointed for myself, but only 
              for a minute because he said, as he shook hands, and said it in 
              a way that I could not mistake, &quot;I shall soon come back, you 
              won't forget me, Amy?&quot; </p>
            <p>I didn't promise, but I looked at him, and he seemed satisfied, 
              and there was no time for anything but messages and good-byes, for 
              he was off in an hour, and we all miss him very much. I know he 
              wanted to speak, but I think, from something he once hinted, that 
              he had promised his father not to do anything of the sort yet a 
              while, for is is a rash boy, and the old gentleman dreads a foreign 
              daughter-in-law. We shall soon meet in Rome, and then, if I don't 
              change my mind, I'll say &quot;Yes, thank you,&quot; when he says 
              &quot;Will you, please?&quot; </p>
            <p>Of course this is all very private, but I wished you to know what 
              was going on. Don't be anxious about me, remember I am your `prudent 
              Amy', and be sure I will do nothing rashly. Send me as much advice 
              as you like. I'll use it if I can. I wish I could see you for a 
              good talk, Marmee. Love and trust me. </p>
            <p>Ever your AMY </p>

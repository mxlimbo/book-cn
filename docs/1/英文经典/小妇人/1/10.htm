              As spring came on, a new set of amusements became the fashion, and 
              the lengthening days gave long afternoons for work and play of all 
              sorts. The garden had to be put in order, and each sister had a 
              quarter of the little plot to do what she liked with. Hannah used 
              to say, &quot;I'd know which each of them gardings belonged to, 
              ef I see 'em in Chiny,&quot; and so she might, for the girls' tastes 
              differed as much as their characters. Meg's had roses and heliotrope, 
              myrtle, and a little orange tree in it. Jo's bed was never alike 
              two seasons, for she was always trying experiments. This year it 
              was to be a plantation of sun flowers, the seeds of which cheerful 
              land aspiring plant were to feed Aunt Cockle-top and her family 
              of chicks. Beth had old-fashioned fragrant flowers in her garden, 
              sweet peas and mignonette, larkspur, pinks, pansies, and southernwood, 
              with chickweed for the birds and catnip for the pussies. Amy had 
              a bower in hers, rather small and earwiggy, but very pretty to look 
              at, with honeysuckle and morning-glories hanging their colored horns 
              and bells in graceful wreaths all over it, tall white lilies, delicate 
              ferns, and as many brilliant, picturesque plants as would consent 
              to blossom there. </p>
            <p>Gardening, walks, rows on the river, and flower hunts employed 
              the fine days, and for rainy ones, they had house diversions, some 
              old, some new, all more or less original. One of these was the `P.C', 
              for as secret societies were the fashion,it was thought proper to 
              have one, and as all of the girls admired Dickens, they called themselves 
              the Pickwick Club. With a few interruptions, they had kept this 
              up for a year, and met every Saturday evening in the big garret, 
              on which occasions the ceremonies were as follows: Three chairs 
              were arranged in a row before a table on which was a lamp, also 
              four white badges, with a big `P.C.' in different colors on each, 
              and the weekly newspaper called, The Pickwick Portfolio, to which 
              all contributed something, while Jo, who reveled in pens and ink, 
              was the editor. At seven o'clock, the four members ascended to the 
              clubroom, tied their badges round their heads, and took their seats 
              with great solemnity. Meg, as the eldest, was Samuel Pickwick, Jo, 
              being of a literary turn, Augustus Snodgrass, Beth, because she 
              was round and rosy, Tracy Tupman, and Amy, who was always trying 
              to do what she couldn't, was Nathaniel Winkle. Pickwick, the president, 
              read the paper, which was filled with original tales, poetry, local 
              news, funny advertisements, and hints, in which they good-naturedly 
              reminded each other of their faults and short comings. On one occasion, 
              Mr. Pickwick put on a pair of spectacles without any glass, rapped 
              upon the table, hemmed, and having stared hard at Mr. Snodgrass, 
              who was tilting back in his chair, till he arranged himself properly, 
              began to read: </p>

              With badge and solemn rite, <br>
              Our fifty-second anniversary, <br>
              In Pickwick Hall, tonight. </p>
            <p>We all are here in perfect health, <br>
              None gone from our small band: <br>
              Again we see each well-known face, <br>
              And press each friendly hand. </p>
            <p>Our Pickwick, always at his post, <br>
              With reverence we greet, <br>
              As, spectacles on nose, he reads <br>
              Our well-filled weekly sheet. </p>
            <p>Although he suffers from a cold, <br>
              We joy to hear him speak, <br>
              For words of wisdom from him fall, <br>
              In spite of croak or squeak. </p>
            <p>Old six-foot Snodgrass looms on high, <br>
              With elephantine grace, <br>
              And beams upon the company, <br>
              With brown and jovial face. </p>
            <p>Poetic fire lights up his eye, <br>
              He struggles 'gainst his lot. <br>
              Behold ambition on his brow, <br>
              And on his nose, a blot. </p>
            <p>Next our peaceful Tupman comes, <br>
              So rosy, plump, and sweet, <br>
              Who chokes with laughter at the puns, <br>
              And tumbles off his seat. </p>
            <p>Prim little Winkle too is here, <br>
              With every hair in place, <br>
              A model of propriety, <br>
              Though he hates to wash his face. </p>
            <p>The year is gone, we still unite <br>
              To joke and laugh and read, <br>
              And tread the path of literature <br>
              That doth to glory lead. </p>
            <p>Long may our paper prosper well, <br>
              Our club unbroken be, <br>

              THE MASKED MARRIAGE <br>
              (A Tale Of Venice) </p>
            <p>Gondola after gondola swept up to the marble steps, and left its 
              lovely load to swell the brilliant throng that filled the stately 
              halls of Count Adelon. Knights and ladies, elves and pages, monks 
              and flower girls, all mingled gaily in the dance. </p>
            <p>Sweet voices and rich melody filled the air, and so with mirth 
              and music the masquerade went on. &quot;Has your Highness seen the 
              Lady viola tonight?&quot; asked a gallant troubadour of the fairy 
              queen who floated down the hall upon his arm. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, is she not lovely, though so sad! Her dress is well 
              chosen, too, for in a week she weds Count Antonio, whom she passionately 
              hates.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;By my faith, I envy him. Yonder he comes, arrayed like a 
              bridegroom, except the black mask. When that is off we shall see 
              how he regards the fair maid whose heart he cannot win, though her 
              stern father bestows her hand,&quot; returned the troubadour. </p>
            <p>&quot;Tis whispered that she loves the young English artist who 
              haunts her steps, and is spurned by the old Count,&quot; said the 
              lady, as they joined the dance. The revel was at its height when 
              a priest appeared, and withdrawing the young pair to an alcove, 
              hung with purple velvet, he motioned them to kneel. Instant silence 
              fell on the gay throng, and not a sound, but he dash of fountains 
              or the rustle of orange groves sleeping in the moonlight, broke 
              the hush, as Count de Adelon spoke thus: </p>
            <p>&quot;My lords and ladies, pardon the ruse by which I have gathered 
              you here to witness the marriage of my daughter. Father, we wait 
              your services.&quot; All eyes turned toward the bridal party, and 
              a murmur of amazement went through the throng, for neither bride 
              nor groom removed their masks. Curiosity and wonder possessed all 
              hearts, but respect restrained all tongues till the holy rite was 
              over. Then the eager spectators gathered round the count, demanding 
              an explanation. <br>
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Gladly would I give it if I could, but I only know that 
              it was the whim of my timid Viola, and I yielded to it. Now, my 
              children, let the play end. Unmask and receive my blessing.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>But neither bent the knee, for the young bridegroom replied in 
              a tone that startled all listeners as the mask fell, disclosing 
              the noble face of Ferdinand Devereux, the artist lover, and leaning 
              on the breast where now flashed the star of an English earl was 
              the lovely Viola, radiant with joy and beauty. </p>
            <p>&quot;My lord, you scornfully bade me claim your daughter when 
              I could boast as high a name and vast a fortune as the Count antonio. 
              I can do more, for even your ambitious soul cannot refuse the Earl 
              of Devereux and De Vere, when he gives his ancient name and boundless 
              wealth in return for the beloved hand of this fair lady, now my 
              wife. </p>
            <p>The count stood like one changed to stone, and turning to the bewildered 
              crowd, Ferdinand added, with a gay smile of triumph, &quot;To you, 
              my gallant friends, I can only wish that your wooing may prosper 
              as mine has done, and that you may all win as fair a bride as I 
              have by this masked marriage.&quot; </p>

            <p>THE HISTORY OF A SQUASH </p>
            <p>_____ <br>
              <br>
              Once upon a time a farmer planted a little seed. in his garden, 
              and after a while it sprouted and became a vine and bore many squashes. 
              One day in October, when they were ripe, he picked one and took 
              it to market. A gorcerman bought and put it in his shop. That same 
              morning, a little girl in a brown hat and blue dress, with a round 
              face and snub nose, went and bought it for her mother. She lugged 
              it home, cut it up, and boiled it in the big pot, mashed some of 
              it salt and butter, for dinner. And to the rest she added a pint 
              of milk, two eggs, four spoons of sugar, nutmeg, and some crackers, 
              put it in a deep dish, and baked it till it was brown and nice, 
              and next day it was eaten by a family named March. </p>

              named Winkle who makes trouble in his club by laughing and sometimes 
              won't write his piece in this fine paper I hope you will pardon 
              his badness and let him send a French fable because he can't write 
              out of his head as he has so many lessons to do and no brains in 
              future I will try to take time by the fetlock and prepare some work 
              which will be all commy la fo that means all right I am in haste

            <p>A SAD ACCIDENT <br>
              <br>
              On Friday last, we were startled by a violent shock in our basement, 
              followed by cries of distress. On rushing in a body to the cellar, 
              we discovered our beloved President prostrate upon the floor, having 
              tripped and fallen while getting wood for domestic purposes. A perfect 
              scene of ruin met our eyes, for in his fall Mr. Pickwick had plunged 
              his head and shoulders into a tub of water, upset a keg of soft 
              soap upon his manly form, and torn his garments badly. On being 
              removed from this perilous situation, it was discovered that he 
              had suffered no injury but several bruises, and we are happy to 
              add, is now doing well. </p>
            <p>ED. </p>
            <p>THE PUBLIC BEREAVEMENT </p>
            <p>It is our painful duty to record the sudden and mysterious disappearance 
              of our cherished friend, Mrs. Snowball Pat Paw. This lovely and 
              beloved cat was the pet of a large circle of warm and admiring friends; 
              for her beauty attracted all eyes, her graces and virtues endeared 
              her to all hearts, and her loss is deeply felt by the whole community. 
            </p>
            <p>When last seen, she was sitting at the gate, watching the butcher's 
              cart, and it is feared that some villain, tempted by her charms, 
              basely stole her. Weeks have passed, but no trace of her has been 
              discovered, and we relinquish all hope, tie a black ribbon to her 
              basket, set aside her dish, and weep for her as one lost to us forever. 
              <br>
              <br>
              A sympathizing friend sends the following gem: <br>
              <br>
              A LAMENT <br>
              (FOR S. B. PAT PAW) </p>
            <p>We mourn the loss of our little pet, <br>
              And sigh o'er her hapless fate, <br>
              For never more by the fire she'll sit, <br>
              Nor play by the old green gate. </p>
            <p>The little grave where her infant sleeps <br>
              Is 'neath the chestnut tree. <br>
              But o'er her grave we may not weep, <br>
              We know not where it may be. </p>
            <p>Her empty bed, her idle ball, <br>
              Will never see her more; <br>
              No gentle tap, no loving purr <br>
              Is heard at the parlor door. </p>
            <p>Another cat comes after her mice, <br>
              A cat with a dirty face, <br>
              But she does not hunt as our darling did, <br>
              Nor play with her airy grace. </p>
            <p>Her stealthy paws tread the very hall <br>
              Where Snowball used to play, <br>
              But she only spits at the dogs our pet <br>
              So gallantly drove away. </p>
            <p>She is useful and mild, and does her best, <br>
              But she is not fair to see, <br>
              And we cannot give her your place dear, <br>
              Nor worship her as we worship thee. </p>

            <p>As the President finished reading the paper (which I beg leave 
              to assure my readers is a bona fide copy of one written by bona 
              fide girls once upon a time), a round of applause followed, and 
              then Mr. Snodgrass rose to make a proposition. </p>
            <p>&quot;Mr. President and gentlemen,&quot; he began, assuming a parliamentary 
              attitude and tone, &quot;I wish to propose the admission of a new 
              member--one who highly deserves the honor, would be deeply grateful 
              for it, and would add immensely to the spirit of the club, the literary 
              value of the paper, and be no end jolly and nice. I propose Mr. 
              Theodore Laurence as an honorary member of the P. C. Come now, do 
              have him.&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo's sudden change of tone made the girls laugh, but all looked 
              rather anxious, and no one said a word as Snodgrass took his seat. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;We'll put it to a vote,&quot; said the President. &quot;All 
              in favor of this motion please to manifest it by saying, `Aye'.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Contrary-minded say, `No'.&quot; </p>
            <p>Meg and Amy were contrary-minded, and Mr. Winkle rose to say with 
              great elegance, &quot;We don't wish any boys, they only joke and 
              bounce about. This is a ladies' club, and we wish to be private 
              and proper.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm afraid he'll laugh at our paper, and make fun of us afterward,&quot; 
              observed Pickwick, pulling the little curl on her forehead, as she 
              always did when doubtful. </p>
            <p>Up rose Snodgrass, very much in earnest. &quot;Sir, I give you 
              my word as a gentleman, Laurie won't do anything of the sort. He 
              likes to write, and he'll give a tone to our contributions and keep 
              us from being sentimental, don't you see? We can do so little for 
              him, and he does so much for us, I think the least we can do is 
              to offer him a place here, and make him welcome if he comes.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>This artful allusion to benefits conferred brought Tupman to his 
              feet, looking as if he had quite made up his mind. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, we ought to do it, even if we are afraid. I say he may 
              come, and his grandpa, too, if he likes.&quot; </p>
            <p>This spirited burst from Beth electrified the club, and Jo left 
              her seat to shake hands approvingly. &quot;Now then, vote again. 
              Everybody remember it's our Laurie, and say, `Aye!'&quot; cried 
              Snodgrass excitedly. </p>
            <p>&quot;Aye! Aye! Aye!&quot; replied three voices at once. </p>
            <p>&quot;Good! Bless you! Now, as there's nothing like `taking time 
              by the fetlock', as Winkle characteristically observes, allow me 
              to present the new member.&quot; And, to the dismay of the rest 
              of the club, Jo threw open the door of the closet, and displayed 
              Laurie sitting on a rag bag, flushed and twinkling with suppressed 
              laughter. </p>
            <p> &quot;You rogue! You traitor! Jo, how could you?&quot; cried the 
              three girls, as Snodgrass led her friend triumphantly forth, and 
              producing both a chair and a badge, installed him in a jiffy. </p>
            <p>&quot;The coolness of you two rascals is amazing,&quot; began Mr. 
              Pickwick, trying to get up an awful frown and only succeeding in 
              producing an amiable smile. But the new member was equal to the 
              occasion, and rising, with a grateful salutation to the Chair, said 
              in the most engaging manner, &quot;Mr. President and ladies--I beg 
              pardon, gentlemen--allow me to introduce myself as Sam Weller, the 
              very humble servant of the club.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Good! Good!&quot; cried Jo, pounding with the handle of the 
              old warming pan on which she leaned. </p>
            <p>&quot;My faithful friend and noble patron,&quot; continued Laurie 
              with a wave of the hand, &quot;who has so flatteringly presented 
              me, is not to be blamed for the base stratagem of tonight. I planned 
              it, and she only gave in after lots of teasing.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Come now, don't lay it all on yourself. You know I proposed 
              the cupboard,&quot; broke in Snodgrass, who was enjoying the joke 
              amazingly. </p>
            <p>&quot;Never mind what she says. I'm the wretch that did it, sir,&quot; 
              said the new member, with a Welleresque nod to Mr. Pickwick. &quot;But 
              on my honor, I never will do so again, and henceforth devote myself 
              to the interest of this immortal club.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Hear! Hear!&quot; cried Jo, clashing the lid of the warming 
              pan like a cymbal. </p>
            <p>&quot;Go on, go on!&quot; added Winkle and Tupman, while the President 
              bowed benignly. </p>
            <p>&quot;I merely wish to say, that as a slight token of my gratitude 
              for the honor done me, and as a means of promoting friendly relations 
              between adjoining nations, I have set up a post office in the hedge 
              in the lower corner of the garden, a fine, spacious building with 
              padlocks on the doors and every convenience for the mails, also 
              the females, if I may be allowed the expression. It's the old martin 
              house, but I've stopped up the door and made the roof open, so it 
              will hold all sorts of things, and save our valuable time. Letters, 
              manuscripts, books, and bundles can be passed in there, and as each 
              nation has a key, it will be uncommonly nice, I fancy. Allow me 
              to present the club key, and with many thanks for your favor, take 
              my seat.&quot; </p>
            <p>Great applause as Mr. Weller deposited a little key on the table 
              and subsided, the warming pan clashed and waved wildly, and it was 
              some time before order could be restored. A long discussion followed, 
              and everyone came out surprising, for everyone did her best. So 
              it was an unusually lively meeting, and did not adjourn till a late 
              hour, when it broke up with three shrill cheers for the new member. 
              No one ever regretted the admittance of Sam Weller, for a more devoted, 
              well-behaved, and jovial member no club could have. He certainly 
              did add `spirit' to the meetings, and `a tone' to the paper, for 
              his orations convulsed his hearers and his contributions were excellent, 
              being patriotic, classical, comical, or dramatic, but never sentimental. 
              Jo regarded them as worthy of Bacon, Milton, or Shakespeare, and 
              remodeled her own works with good effect, she thought. </p>
            <p>The P. O. was a capital little institution, and flourished wonderfully, 
              for nearly as many queer things passed through it as through the 
              real post office. Tragedies and cravats, poetry and pickles, garden 
              seeds and long letters, music and gingerbread, rubbers, invitations, 
              scoldings, and puppies. The old gentleman liked the fun, and amused 
              himself by sending odd bundles, mysterious messages, and funny telegrams, 
              and his gardener, who was smitten with Hannah's charms, actually 
              sent a love letter to Jo's care. How they laughed when the secret 
              came out, never dreaming how many love letters that little post 
              office would hold in the years to come. </p>

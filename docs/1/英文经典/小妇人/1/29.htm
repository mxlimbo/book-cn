              <br>
              &quot;Come, Jo, it's time.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;For what?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;You don't mean to say you have forgotten that you promised 
              to make half a dozen calls with me today?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I've done a good many rash and foolish things in my life, 
              but I don't think I ever was mad enough to say I'd make six calls 
              in one day, when a single one upsets me for a week.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, you did, it was a bargain between us. I was to finish 
              the crayon of Beth for you, and you were to go properly with me, 
              and return our neighbors' visits.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;If it was fair, that was in the bond, and I stand to the 
              letter of my bond, Shylock. There is a pile of clouds in the east, 
              it's not fair, and I don't go.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Now, that's shirking. It's a lovely day, no prospect of rain, 
              and you pride yourself on keeping; promises, so be honorable, come 
              and do your duty, and then be at peace for another six months.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>At that minute Jo was particularly absorbed in dressmaking, for 
              she was mantua-maker general to the family, and took especial credit 
              to herself because she could use a needle as well as a pen. It was 
              very provoking to be arrested in the act of a first tryingon, and 
              ordered out to make calls in her best array on a warm July day. 
              She hated calls of the formal sort, and never made any till Amy 
              compelled her with a bargain, bribe, or promise. In the present 
              instance there was no escape, and having clashed her scissors rebelliously, 
              while protesting that she smelled thunder, she gave in, put away 
              her work, and taking up her hat and gloves with an air of resignation, 
              told Amy the victim was ready. </p>
            <p>&quot;Jo March, you are perverse enough to provoke a saint! You 
              don't intend to make calls in that state, I hope,&quot; cried Amy, 
              surveying her with amazement. </p>
            <p>&quot;Why not? I'm neat and cool and comfortable, quite proper 
              for a dusty walk on a warm day. If people care more for my clothes 
              than they do for me, I don't wish to see them. You can dress for 
              both, and be as elegant as you please. It pays for you to be fine. 
              It doesn't for me, and furbelows only worry me.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;Oh, dear!&quot; sighed Amy, &quot;now she's in a contrary 
              fit, and will drive me distracted before I can get her properly 
              ready. I'm sure it's no pleasure to me to go today, but it's a debt 
              we owe society, and there's no one to pay it but you and me. I'll 
              do anything for you, Jo, if you'll only dress yourself nicely, and 
              come and help me do the civil. You can talk so well, look so aristocratic 
              in your best things, and behave so beautifully, if you try, that 
              I'm proud of you. I'm afraid to go alone, do come and take care 
              of me.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You're an artful little puss to flatter and wheedle your 
              cross old sister in that way. The idea of my being aristocratic 
              and well-bred, and your being afraid to go anywhere alone! I don't 
              know which is the most absurd. Well, I'll go if I must, and do my 
              best. You shall be commander of the expedition, and I'll obey blindly, 
              will that satisfy you?&quot; said Jo, with a sudden change from 
              perversity to lamblike submission. </p>
            <p>&quot;You're a perfect cherub! Now put on all your best things, 
              and I'll tell you how to behave at each place, so that you will 
              make a good impression. I want people to like you, and they would 
              if you'd only try to be a little more agreeable. Do your hair the 
              pretty way, and put the pink rose in your bonnet. It's becoming, 
              and you look too sober in your plain suit. Take your light gloves 
              and the embroidered handkerchief. We'll stop at Meg's, and borrow 
              her white sunshade, and then you can have my dove-colored one.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>While Amy dressed, she issued her orders, and Jo obeyed them, not 
              without entering her protest, however, for she sighed as she rustled 
              into her new organdie, frowned darkly at herself as she tied her 
              bonnet strings in an irreproachable bow, wrestled viciously with 
              pins as she put on her collar, wrinkled up her features generally 
              as she shook out the handkerchief, whose embroidery was as irritating 
              to her nose as the present mission was to her feelings, and when 
              she had squeezed her hands into tight gloves with three buttons 
              and a tassel, as the last touch of elegance, she turned to Amy with 
              an imbecile expression of countenance, saying meekly... </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm perfectly miserable, but if you consider me presentable, 
              I die happy.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You're highly satisfactory. turn slowly round, and let me 
              get a careful view.&quot; Jo revolved, and Amy gave a touch here 
              and there, then fell back, with her head on one side, observing 
              graciously, &quot;Yes, you'll do. Your head is all I could ask, 
              for that white bonnet with the rose is quite ravishing. Hold back 
              your shoulders, and carry your hands easily, no matter if your gloves 
              do pinch. There's one thing you can do well, Jo, that is, wear a 
              shawl. I can't, but it's very nice to see you, and I'm so glad Aunt 
              March gave you that lovely one. It's simple, but handsome, and those 
              folds over the arm are really artistic. Is the point of my mantle 
              in the middle, and have I looped my dress evenly? I like to show 
              my boots, for my feet are pretty, though my nose isn't.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;You are a thing of beauty and a joy forever,&quot; said 
              Jo, looking through her hand with the air of a connoisseur at the 
              blue feather against the golden hair. &quot;Am I to drag my best 
              dress through the dust, or loop it up, please, ma'am?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Hold it yup when you walk, but drop it in the house. The 
              sweeping style suits you best, and you must learn to trail your 
              skirts gracefully. You haven't half buttoned one cuff, do it at 
              once. You'll never look finished if you are not careful about the 
              little details, for they make yup the pleasing whole.&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo sighed, and proceeded to burst the buttons off her glove, in 
              doing up her cuff, but at last both were ready, and sailed away, 
              looking as `pretty as picters', Hannah said, as she hung out of 
              the upper window to watch them. </p>
            <p>&quot;Now, Jo dear, the Chesters consider themselves very elegant 
              people, so I want you to put on your best deportment. Don't make 
              any of your abrupt remarks, or do anything odd, will you? Just be 
              calm, cool, and quiet, that's safe and ladylike, and you can easily 
              do it for fifteen minutes,&quot; said Amy, as they approached the 
              first place, having borrowed the white parasol and been inspected 
              by Meg, with a baby on each arm.</p>
            <p>&quot;Let me see. `Calm, cool, and quiet', yes, I think I can promise 
              that. I've played the part of a prim young lady on the stage, and 
              I'll try it off. My powers are great, as you shall see, so be easy 
              in your mind, my child.&quot; </p>
            <p>Amy looked relieved, but naughty Jo took her at her word, for during 
              the first call she sat with every limb gracefully composed, every 
              fold correctly draped, calm as a summer sea, cool as a snowbank, 
              and as silent as the sphinx. In vain Mrs. Chester alluded to her 
              `charming novel', and the Misses Chester introduced parties, picnics, 
              the opera, and the fashions. Each and all were answered by a smile, 
              a bow, and a demure &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; with the chill 
              on. In vain Amy telegraphed the word `talk', tried to draw her out, 
              and administered covert pokes with her foot. Jo sat as if blandly 
              unconcious of it all, with deportment like Maud's face, `icily regular, 
              splendidly null'. </p>
            <p>&quot;What a haughty, uninteresting creature that oldest Miss March 
              is!&quot; was the unfortunately audible remark of one of the ladies, 
              as the door closed upon their guests. Jo laughed noiselessly all 
              through the hall, but Amy looked disgusted at the failure of her 
              instructions, and very naturally laid the blame upon Jo. </p>
            <p>&quot;How could you mistake me so? I merely meant you to be properly 
              dignified and composed, and you made yourself a perfect stock and 
              stone. Try to be sociable at the Lamb's'. Gossip as other girls 
              do, and be interested in dress and flirtations and whatever nonsense 
              comes up. They move in the best society, are valuable persons for 
              us to know, and I wouldn't fail to make a good impression there 
              for anything.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'll be agreeable. I'll gossip and giggle, and have horrors 
              and raptures over any trifle you like. I rather enjoy this, and 
              now I'll imitate what is called `a charming girl'. I can do it, 
              for I have May Chester as a model, and I'll improve upon her. See 
              if the Lambs don't say, `What a lively, nice creature that Jo March 
              is!&quot; </p>
            <p>Amy felt anxious, as well she might, for when Jo turned freakish 
              there was no knowing where she would stop. Amy's face was a study 
              when she saw her sister skim into the next drawing room, kiss all 
              the young ladies with effusion, beam graciously upon the young gentlemen, 
              and join in the chat with a spirit which amazed the beholder. Amy 
              was taken possession of by Mrs. Lamb, with whom she was a favorite, 
              and forced to hear a long account of Lucretia's last attack, while 
              three delightful young gentlemen hovered near, waiting for a pause 
              when they might rush in and rescue her. So situated, she was powerless 
              to check Jo, who seemed possessed by a spirit of mischief, and talked 
              away as volubly as the lady. A knot of heads gathered about her, 
              and Amy strained her ears to hear what was going on, for broken 
              sentences filled her with curiosity, and frequent peals of laughter 
              made her wild to share the fun. One may imagine her suffering on 
              overhearing fragments of this sort of conversation.</p>
            <p>&quot;She rides splendidly. who taught her?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;No one. She used to practice mounting, holding the reins, 
              and sitting straight on an old saddle in a tree. Now she rides anything, 
              for she doesn't know what fear is, and the stableman lets her have 
              horses cheap because she trains them to carry ladies so well. She 
              has such a passion for it, I often tell her if everything else fails, 
              she can be a horsebreaker, and get her living so.&quot; </p>
            <p>At this awful speech Amy contained herself with difficulty, for 
              the impression was being given that she was rather a fast young 
              lady, which was her especial aversion. But what could she do? For 
              the old lady was in the middle of her story, and long before it 
              was done, Jo was off again, make more droll revelations and committing 
              still more fearful blunders. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, Amy was in despair that day, for all the good beasts 
              were gone, and of three left, one was lame, one blind, and the other 
              so balky that you had to put dirt in his mouth before he would start. 
              Nice animal for a pleasure party, wasn't it?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Which did she choose?&quot; asked one of the laughing gentlemen, 
              who enjoyed the subject. </p>
            <p>&quot;None of them. She heard of a young horse at the farm house 
              over the river, and though a lady had never ridden him, she resolved 
              to try, because he was handsome and spirited. Her struggles were 
              really pathetic. There was no one to bring the horse to the saddle, 
              so she took the saddle to the horse. My dear creature, she actually 
              rowed it over the river, put it on her head, and marched up to the 
              barn to the utter amazement of the old man!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Did she ride the horse?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Of course she did, and had a capital time. I expected to 
              see her brought home in fragments, but she managed him perfectly, 
              and was the life of the party.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, I call that plucky!&quot; And young Mr. Lamb turned 
              an approving glance upon Amy, wondering what his mother could be 
              saying to make the girl look so red and uncomfortable. </p>
            <p>She was still redder and more uncomfortable a moment after, when 
              a sudden turn in the conversation introduced the subject of dress. 
              One of the young ladies asked Jo where she got the pretty drab hat 
              she wore to the picnic and stupid Jo, instead of mentioning the 
              place where it was bought two years ago, must needs answer with 
              unnecessary frankness, &quot;Oh, Amy painted it. You can't buy those 
              soft shades, so we paint ours any color we like. It's a great comfort 
              to have an artistic sister.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Isn't that an original idea?&quot; cried Miss Lamb, who found 
              Jo great fun. </p>
            <p>&quot;That's nothing compared to some of her brilliant performances. 
              There's nothing the child can't do. Why, she wanted a pair of blue 
              boots for Sallie's party, so she just painted her soiled white ones 
              the loveliest shade of sky blue you ever saw, and they looked exactly 
              like satin,&quot; added Jo, with an air of pride in her sister's 
              accomplishments that exasperated Amy till she felt that it would 
              be a relief to throw her cardcase at her. </p>
            <p>&quot;We read a story of yours the other day, and enjoyed it very 
              much,&quot; observed the elder Miss Lamb, wishing to compliment 
              the literary lady, who did not look the character just then, it 
              must be confessed. </p>
            <p>Any mention of her `works' always had a bad effect upon Jo, who 
              either grew rigid and looked offended, or changed the subject with 
              a brusque remark, as now. &quot;Sorry you could find nothing better 
              to read. I write that rubbish because it sells, and ordinary people 
              like it. Are you going to New York this winter?' </p>
            <p>As Miss Lamb had `enjoyed' the story, this speech was not exactly 
              grateful or complimentary. The minute it was made Jo saw her mistake, 
              but fearing to make the matter worse, suddenly remembered that it 
              was for her to make the first move toward departure, and did so 
              with an abruptness that left three people with half- finished sentences 
              in their mouths. </p>
            <p>&quot;Amy, we must go. Good-by, dear, do come and see us. We are 
              pining for a visit. I don't dare to ask you, Mr. Lamb, but if you 
              should come, I don't think I shall have the heart to send you away.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>Jo said this with such a droll imitation of May Chester's gushing 
              style that Amy got out of the room as rapidly as possible, feeling 
              a strong desire to laugh and cry at the same time.</p>
            <p>&quot;Didn't I do well?&quot; asked Jo, with a satisfied air as 
              they walked away. </p>
            <p>&quot;Nothing could have been worse,&quot; was Amy's crushing reply. 
              &quot;What possessed you to tell those stories about my saddle, 
              and the hats and boots, and all the rest of it?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Why, it's funny, and amuses people. They know we are poor, 
              so it's no use pretending that we have grooms, buy three or four 
              hats a season, and have things as easy and fine as they do.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;You needn't go and tell them all our little shifts, and 
              expose our; poverty in that perfectly unnecessary way. You haven't 
              a bit of proper pride, and never will learn when to hold your tongue 
              and when to speak,&quot; said Amy despairingly. </p>
            <p>Poor Jo looked abashed, and silently chafed the end of her nose 
              with the stiff handkerchief, as if performing a penance for her 
              misdemeanors. </p>
            <p>&quot;How shall I behave here?&quot; she asked, as they approached 
              the third mansion. </p>
            <p>&quot;Just as you please. I wash my hands of you,&quot; was Amy's 
              short answer. </p>
            <p>&quot;Then I'll enjoy myself. The boys are at home, and we'll have 
              a comfortable time. Goodness knows I need a little change, for elegance 
              has a bad effect upon my constitution,&quot; returned Jo gruffly, 
              being disturbed by her failure to suit. </p>
            <p>An enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty 
              children speedily soothed her ruffled feelings, and leaving Amy 
              to entertain the hostess and Mr. Tudor, who happened to be calling 
              likewise, Jo devoted herself to the young folks and found the change 
              refreshing. She listened to college stories with deep interest, 
              caressed pointers and poodles without a murmur, agreed heartily 
              that &quot;Tom Brown was a brick,&quot; regardless of the improper 
              form of praise, and when one lad proposed a visit to his turtle 
              tank, she went with an alacrity which caused Mamma to smile upon 
              her, as that motherly lady settled the cap which was left in a ruinous 
              condition by filial hugs, bearlike but affectionate, and dearer 
              to her than the most faultless coiffure from the hands of an inspired 
              Frenchwoman. </p>
            <p>Leaving her sister to her own devices, Amy proceeded to enjoy herself 
              to her heart's content. Mr. Tudor's uncle had married an English 
              lady who was third cousin to a living lord, and Amy regarded the 
              whole family with great respect, for in spite of her American birth 
              and breeding, she possessed that reverence for titles which haunts 
              the best of us--that unacknowledged loyalty to the early faith in 
              kings which set the most democratic nation under the sun in ferment 
              at the coming of a royal yellow-haired laddie, some years ago, and 
              which still has something to do with the love the young country 
              bears the old, like that of a big son for an imperious little mother, 
              who held him while she could, and let him go with a farewell scolding 
              when he rebelled. But even the satisfaction of talking with a distant 
              connection of the British nobility did not render Amy forgetful 
              of time, and when the proper number of minutes had passed, she reluctantly 
              tore herself from this aristocratic society, and looked about for 
              Jo, fervently hoping that her incorrigible sister would not be found 
              in any position which should bring disgrace upon the name of March. 
            </p>
            <p>It might have been worse, but Amy considered it bad. For Jo sat 
              on the grass, with an encampment of boys about her, and a dirty-footed 
              dog reposing on the skirt of her state and festival dress, as she 
              related one of Laurie's pranks to her admiring audience. One small 
              child was poking turtles with Amy's cherished parasol, a second 
              was eating gingerbread over Jo's best bonnet, and a third playing 
              ball with her gloves. but all were enjoying themselves, and when 
              Jo collected her damaged property to go, her escort accompanied 
              her, begging her to come again, &quot;It was such fun to hear about 
              Laurie's larks.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Capital boys, aren't they? I feel quite young and brisk again 
              after that.&quot; said Jo, strolling along with her hands behind 
              her, partly from habit, partly to conceal the bespattered parasol. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Why do you always avoid Mr. Tudor?&quot; asked Amy, wisely 
              refraining from any comment upon Jo's dilapidated appearance. </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't like him, he puts on airs, snubs his sisters, worries 
              his father, a nd doesn't speak respectfully of his mother. Laurie 
              says he is fast, and I don't consider him a desirable acquaintance, 
              so I let him alone.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You might treat him civilly, at least. You gave him a cool 
              nod, and just now you bowed and smiled in the politest way to Tommy 
              Chamberlain, whose father keeps a grocery store. If you had just 
              reversed the nod and the bow, it would have been right,&quot; said 
              Amy reprovingly. </p>
            <p>&quot;No, it wouldn't,&quot; returned Jo, &quot;I neither like, 
              respect, nor admire Tudor, though his grandfather's uncle's nephew's 
              niece was a third cousin to a lord. Tommy is poor and bashful and 
              good and very clever. I think well of him, and like to show that 
              I do, for he is a gentleman in spite of the brown paper parcels.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It's no use trying to argue with you,&quot; began Amy. </p>
            <p>&quot;Not the least, my dear,&quot; interrupted Jo, &quot;so let 
              us look amiable, and drop a card here, as the Kings are evidently 
              out, for which I'm deeply grateful.&quot; </p>
            <p>The family cardcase having done its duty the girls walked on, and 
              Jo uttered another thanksgiving on reaching the fifth house, and 
              being told that the young ladies were engaged. </p>
            <p>&quot;now let us go home, and never mind Aunt March today. We can 
              run down there any time, and it's really a pity to trail through 
              the dust in our best bibs and tuckers, when we are tired and cross.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Speak for yourself, if you please. Aunt March likes to have 
              us pay her the compliment of coming in style, and making a formal 
              call. It's a little thing to do, but it gives her pleasure, and 
              I don't believe it will hurt your things half so much as letting 
              dirty dogs and clumping boys spoil them. Stoop down, and let me 
              take the crumbs off of your bonnet.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;What a good girl you are, Amy!&quot; said Jo, with a repentant 
              glance from her own damaged costume to that of her sister, which 
              was fresh and spotless still. &quot;I wish it was as easy for me 
              to do little things to please people as it is for you. I think of 
              them, but it takes too much time to do them, so I wait for a chance 
              to confer a great favor, and let the small ones slip, but they tell 
              best in the end, I fancy.&quot; </p>
            <p>Amy smiled and was mollified at once, saying with a maternal air, 
              &quot;Women should learn to be agreeable, particularly poor ones, 
              for they have no other way of repaying the kindnesses they receive. 
              If you'd remember that, and practice it, you'd be better liked than 
              I am, because there is more of you.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm a crotchety old thing, and always shall be, but I'm willing 
              to own that you are right, only it's easier for me to risk my life 
              for a person than to be pleasant to him when I don't feel like it. 
              It's a great misfortune to have such strong likes and dislikes, 
              isn't it?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;It's a greater not to be able to hide them. I don't mind 
              saying that I don't approve of Tudor any more than you do, but I'm 
              not called upon to tell him so. Neither are you, and there is no 
              use in making yourself disagreeable because he is.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;But I think girls ought to show when they disapprove of young 
              men, and how can they do it except by their manners? Preaching does 
              not do any good, as I know to my sorrow, since I've had Teddie to 
              manage. But there are many little ways in which I can influence 
              him without a word, and I say we ought to do it to others if we 
              can.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Teddy is a remarkable boy, and can't be taken as a sample 
              of other boys,&quot; said Amy, in a tone of solemn conviction, which 
              would have convulsed the `remarkable boy' if he had heard it. &quot;If 
              we were belles, or women of wealth and position, we might do something, 
              perhaps, but for us to frown at one set of young gentlemen because 
              we don't approve of them, and smile upon another set because we 
              do, wouldn't have a particle of effect, and we should only be considered 
              odd and puritanical.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;So we are to countenance things and people which we detest, 
              merely because we are not belles and millionaires, are we? That's 
              a nice sort of morality.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I can't argue about it, I only know that it's the way of 
              the world, and people who set themselves against it only get laughed 
              at for their pains. I don't like reformers, and I hope you never 
              try to be one.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I do like them, and I shall be one if I can, for in spite 
              of the laughing the world would never get on without them. We can't 
              agree about that. for you belong to the old set, and I to the new. 
              You will get on the best, but I shall have the liveliest time of 
              it. I should rather enjoy the brickbats and hooting, I think.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Well, compose yourself now, and don't worry Aunt with your 
              new ideas.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'll try not to, but I'm always possessed to burst out with 
              some particularly blunt speech or revolutionary sentiment before 
              her. It's my doom, and I can't help it.&quot; </p>
            <p>They found Aunt Carrol with the old lady, both absorbed in some 
              very interesting subject, but they dropped it as the girls came 
              in, with a conscious look which betrayed that they had been talking 
              about their nieces. Jo was not in a good humor, and the perverse 
              fit returned, but Amy, who had virtuously done her duty, kept her 
              temper and pleased everybody, was in a most angelic frame of mind. 
              This amiable spirit was felt at once, and both aunts `my deared' 
              her affectionately, looking what they afterward said emphatically, 
              &quot;That child improves every day.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Are you going to help about the fair, dear?&quot; asked Mrs. 
              Carrol, as Amy sat down beside her with the confiding air elderly 
              people like so well in the young. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, Aunt. Mrs. Chester asked me if I would, and I offered 
              to tend a table, as I have nothing but my time to give.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm not,&quot; put in Jo decidedly. &quot;I hate to be patronized, 
              and the Chesters think it's a great favor to allow us to help with 
              their highly connected fair. I wonder you consented, Amy, they only 
              want you to work.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I am willing to work. It's for the freedmen as well as the 
              Chesters, and I think it very kind of them to let me share the labor 
              and the fun. Patronage does not trouble me when it is well meant.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Quite right and proper. I like your grateful spirit, my dear. 
              It's a pleasure to help people who appreciate our efforts. Some 
              do not, and that is trying,&quot; observed Aunt March, looking over 
              her spectacles at Jo, who sat apart, rocking herself, with a somewhat 
              morose expression. </p>
            <p>If Jo had only known what a great happiness was wavering in the 
              balance for one of them, she would have turned dove-like in a minute, 
              but unfortunately, we don't have windows in our breasts, and cannot 
              see what goes on in the minds of our friends. Better for us that 
              we cannot as a general thing, but now and then it would be such 
              a comfort, such a saving of time and temper. By her next speech, 
              Jo deprived herself of several years of pleasure, and received a 
              timely lesson in the art of holding her tongue. </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't like favors, they oppress and make me feel like a 
              slave. I'd rather do everything for myself, and be perfectly independent.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Ahem!&quot; coughed Aunt Carrol softly, with a look at Aunt 
              March. </p>
            <p>&quot;I told you so,&quot; said Aunt March, with a decided nod 
              to Aunt Carrol. </p>
            <p>Mercifully unconscious of what she had done, Jo sat with her nose 
              in the air, and a revolutionary aspect which was anything but inviting. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Do you speak French, dear?&quot; asked Mrs. Carrol, laying 
              a hand on Amy's. </p>
            <p>&quot;Pretty well, thanks to Aunt March, who lets Esther talk to 
              me as often as I like,&quot; replied amy, with a grateful look, 
              which caused the old lady to smile affably. </p>
            <p>&quot;How are you about languages?&quot; asked Mrs. Carrol of JO. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Don't know a word. I'm very stupid about studying anything, 
              can't bear French, it's such a slippery, silly sort of language,&quot; 
              was the brusque reply. </p>
            <p>Another look passed between the ladies, and Aunt March said to 
              Amy, 'You are quite strong and well no, dear, I believe? Eyes don't 
              trouble you any more, do they?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Not at all, thank you, ma'am. I'm very well, and mean to 
              do great things next winter, so that I may be ready for Rome, whenever 
              that joyful time arrives.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Good girl! You deserve to go, and I'm sure you will some 
              day,&quot; said Aunt March, with an approving; pat on the head, 
              as Amy picked up her ball for her. </p>
            <p>Crosspatch, draw the latch, Sit by the fire and spin, </p>
            <p>squalled Polly, bending down from his perch on the back of her 
              chair to peep into Jo's face, with such a comical air of impertinent 
              inquiry that it was impossible to help laughing. </p>
            <p>&quot;Most observing bird,&quot; said the old lady. </p>
            <p>&quot;Come and take a walk, my dear?&quot; cried Polly, hopping 
              toward the china closet, with a look suggestive of a lump of sugar. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Thank you, I will. Come Amy.&quot; And Jo brought the visit 
              to an end, feeling more strongly than ever that calls did have a 
              bad effect upon her constitution. She shook hands in a gentlemanly 
              manner, but Amy kissed both the aunts, and the girls departed, leaving 
              behind them the impression of shadow and sunshine, which impression 
              caused Aunt March to say, as they vanished... </p>
            <p>&quot;You'd better do it, Mary. I'll supply the money. And Aunt 
              Carrol to reply decidedly, &quot;I certainly will, if her father 
              and mother consent.&quot; </p>

              <br>
              Amy's lecture did Laurie good, though, of course, he did not own 
              it till long afterward. Men seldom do, for when women are the advisers, 
              the lords of creation don't take the advice till they have persuaded 
              themselves that it is just what they intended to do. Then they act 
              upon it, and, if it succeeds, they give the weaker vessel half the 
              credit of it. If it fails, they generously give her the whole. Laurie 
              went back to his grandfather, and was so dutifully devoted for several 
              weeks that the old gentleman declared the climate of Nice had improved 
              him wonderfully, and he had better try it again. There was nothing 
              the young gentleman would have liked better, but elephants could 
              not have dragged him back after the scolding he had received. Pride 
              forbid, and whenever the longing grew very strong, he fortified 
              his resolution by repeating the words that had made the deepest 
              impression, &quot;I despise you.&quot; &quot;Go and do something 
              splendid that will make her love you.&quot; </p>
            <p>Laurie turned the matter over in his mind so often that he soon 
              brought himself to confess that he had been selfish and lazy, but 
              then when a man has a great sorrow, he should be indulged in all 
              sorts of vagaries till he has lived it down. He felt that his blighted 
              affections were quite dead now, and though he should never cease 
              to be a faithful mourner, there was no occasion to wear his weeds 
              ostentatiously. Jo wouldn't love him, but he might make her respect 
              and admire him by doing something which should prove that a girl's 
              no had not spoiled his life. He had always meant to do something, 
              and Amy's advice was quite unnecessary. He had only been waiting 
              till the aforesaid blighted affections were decently interred. That 
              being done, he felt that he was ready to `hide his stricken heart, 
              and still toil on'. </p>
            <p>As Goethe, when he had a joy or a grief, put it into a song, so 
              Laurie resolved to embalm his love sorrow in music, and to compose 
              a Requiem which should harrow up Jo's soul and melt the heart of 
              every hearer. Therefore the next time the old gentleman found him 
              getting restless and moody and ordered him off, he went to Vienna, 
              where he had musical friends, and fell to work with the firm determination 
              to distinguish himself. But whether the sorrow was too vast to be 
              embodied in music, or music too ethereal to uplift a mortal woe, 
              he soon discovered that the Requiem was beyond him just at present. 
              It was evident that his mind was not in working order yet, and his 
              ideas needed clarifying, for often in the middle of a plaintive 
              strain, he would find himself humming a dancing tune that vividly 
              recalled the Christmas ball at Nice, especially the stout Frenchman, 
              and put an effectual stop to tragic composition for the time being. 
            </p>
            <p>Then he tried an opera, for nothing seemed impossible in the beginning, 
              but here again unforeseen difficulties beset him. He wanted Jo for 
              his heroine, and called upon his memory to supply him with tender 
              recollections and romantic visions of his love. But memory turned 
              traitor, and as if possessed by the perverse spirit of the girl, 
              would only recall Jo's oddities, faults, and freaks, would only 
              show her in the most unsentimental aspects--beating mats with her 
              head tied up in a bandana, barricading herself with the sofa pillow, 
              or throwing cold water over his passion a la Gummidge--and an irresistable 
              laugh spoiled the pensive picture he was endeavoring to paint. Jo 
              wouldn't be put into the opera at any price, and he had to give 
              her up with a &quot;Bless that girl, what a torment she is!&quot; 
              and a clutch at his hair, as became a distracted composer. </p>
            <p>When he looked about him for another and a less intractable damsel 
              to immortalize in melody, memory produced one with the most obliging 
              readiness. This phantom wore many faces, but it always had golden 
              hair, was enveloped in a diaphanous cloud, and floated airily before 
              his mind's eye in a pleasing chaos of roses, peacocks, white ponies, 
              and blue ribbons. He did not give the complacent wraith any name, 
              but he took her for his heroine and grew quite fond of her, as well 
              he might, for he gifted her with every gift and grace under the 
              sun, and escorted her, unscathed, through trials which would have 
              annihilated any mortal woman. </p>
            <p>Thanks to this inspiration, he got on swimmingly for a time, but 
              gradually the work lost its charm, and he forgot to compose, while 
              he sat musing, pen in hand, or roamed about the gay city to get 
              some new ideas and refresh his mind, which seemed to be in a somewhat 
              unsettled state that winter. He did not do much, but he thought 
              a great deal and was conscious of a change of some sort going on 
              in spite of himself. &quot;It's genius simmering, perhaps. I'll 
              let it simmer, and see what comes of it,&quot; he said, with a secret 
              suspicion all the while that it wasn't genius, but something far 
              more common. Whatever it was, it simmered to some purpose, for he 
              grew more and more discontented with his desultory life, began to 
              long for some real and earnest work to go at, soul and body, and 
              finally came to the wise conclusion that everyone who loved music 
              was not a composer. Returning from one of Mozart's grand operas, 
              splendidly performed at the Royal Theatre, he looked over his own, 
              played a few of the best parts, sat staring at the busts of Mendelssohn, 
              Beethoven, and bach, who stared benignly back again. Then suddenly 
              he tore up his music sheets, one by one, and as the last fluttered 
              out of his hand, he said soberly to himself... </p>
            <p>&quot;She is right! Talent isn't genius, and you can't make it 
              so. That music has taken the vanity out of my as Rome took it out 
              of her, and I won't be a humbug any longer. Now what shall I do?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>That seemed a hard question to answer, and Laurie began to wish 
              he had to work for his daily bread. Now if ever, occurred an eligible 
              opportunity for `going to the devil', as he once forcibly expressed 
              it, for he had plenty of money and nothing to do, and Satan is proverbially 
              fond of providing employment for full and idle hands. The poor fellow 
              had temptations enough from without and from within, but he withstood 
              them pretty well, for much as he valued liberty, he valued good 
              faith and confidence more, so his promise to his grandfather, and 
              his desire to be able to look honestly into the eyes of the women 
              who loved him, and say &quot;All's well,&quot; kept him safe and 
              steady.</p>
            <p>Very likely some Mrs. Grundy will observe, &quot;I don't believe 
              it, boys will be boys, young men must sow their wild oats, and women 
              must not expect miracles.&quot; I dare say you don't, Mrs. Grundy, 
              but it's true nevertheless. Women work a good many miracles, and 
              I have a persuasion that they may perform even that of raising the 
              standard of manhood by refusing to echo such sayings. Let the boys 
              be boys, the longer the better, and let the young men sow their 
              wild oats if they must. But mothers, sisters, and friends may help 
              to make the crop a small one, and keep many tares from spoiling 
              the harvest, by believing, and showing that they believe, in the 
              possibility of loyalty to the virtues which make men manliest in 
              good women's eyes. If it is a feminine delusion, leave us to enjoy 
              it while we may, for without it half the beauty and the romance 
              of life is lost, and sorrowful forebodings would embitter all our 
              hopes of the brave, tenderhearted little lads, who still love their 
              mothers better than themselves and are not ashamed to own it. </p>
            <p>Laurie thought that the task of forgetting his love for Jo would 
              absorb all his powers for years, but to his great surprise he discovered 
              it grew easier every day. He refused to believe it at first, got 
              angry with himself, and couldn't understand it, but these hearts 
              of ours are curious and contrary things, and time and nature work 
              their will in spite of us. Laurie's heart wouldn't ache. The wound 
              persisted in healing with a rapidity that astonished him, and instead 
              of trying to forget, he found himself trying to remember. He had 
              not foreseen this turn of affairs, and was not prepared for it. 
              He was disgusted with himself, surprised at his own fickleness, 
              and full of a queer mixture of disappointment and relief that he 
              could recover from such a tremendous blow so soon. He carefully 
              stirred up the embers of his lost love, but they refused to burst 
              into a blaze. There was only a comfortable glow that warmed and 
              did him good without putting him into a fever, and he was reluctantly 
              obliged to confess that the boyish passion was slowly subbsiding 
              into a more tranquil sentiment, very tender, a little sad and resentful 
              still, but that was sure to pass away in time, leaving a brotherly 
              affection which would last unbroken to the end. </p>
            <p>As the word `brotherly' passed through his mind in one of his reveries, 
              he smiled, and glanced up at the picture of Mozart that was before 
              him... </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, he was a great man, and when he couldn't have one sister 
              he took the other, and was happy.&quot; </p>
            <p>Laurie did not utter the words, but he thought them, and the next 
              instant kissed the little old ring, saying to himself, &quot;No, 
              I won't! I haven't forgotten, I never can. I'll try again, and if 
              that fails, why then... </p>
            <p>Leaving his sentence unfinished, he seized pen and paper and wrote 
              to Jo, telling her that he could not settle to anything while there 
              was the least hope of her changing her mind. Couldn't she, wouldn't 
              she, and let him come home and be happy? While waiting for an answer 
              he did nothing, but he did it energetically, for he was in a fever 
              of impatience. It came at last, and settled his mind effectually 
              on one point, for Jo decidedly couldn't and wouldn't. She was wrapped 
              up in Beth, and never wished to hear the word love again. Then she 
              begged him to be happy with somebody else, but always keep a little 
              corner of his ghart for his loving sister Jo. In a postscript she 
              desired him not to tell Amy that Beth was worse, she was coming 
              home in the spring and there was no need of saddening the remainder 
              of her stay. That would be time enough, please God, but Laurie must 
              write to her often, and not let her feel lonely, homesick or anxious. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;So I will, at once. Poor little girl, it will be a sad going 
              home for her, I'm afraid.&quot; And Laurie opened his desk, as if 
              writing to Amy had been the proper conclusion of the sentence left 
              unfinished some weeks before. </p>
            <p>But he did not write the letter that day, for as he rummaged out 
              his best paper, he came across something which changed his purpose. 
              Tumbling about in one part of the desk among bills, passports, and 
              business documents of various kinds were several of Jo's letters, 
              and in another compartment were three notes from Amy, carefully 
              tied up with one of her blue ribbons and sweetly suggestive of the 
              little dead roses put away inside. with a half-repentant, half-amused 
              expression, Laurie gathered up all Jo's letters, smoothed, folded, 
              and put them neatly into a small drawer of the desk, stood a minute 
              turning the ring thoughtfully on his finger, then slowly drew it 
              off, laid it with the letters, locked the drawer, and went out to 
              hear High Mass at Saint Stefan's, feeling as if there had been a 
              funeral, and though not overwhelmed with affliction, this seemed 
              a more proper way to spend the rest of the day than in writing letters 
              to charming young ladies. </p>
            <p>The letter went very soon, however, and was promptly answered, 
              for Amy was homesick, and confessed it in the most delightfully 
              confiding manner. The correspondence flourished famously, and letters 
              flew to and fro with unfailing regularity all through the early 
              spring. Laurie sold his busts, made allumettes of his opera, and 
              went back to Paris, hoping somebody would arrive before long. He 
              wanted desperately to go to Nice, but would not till he was asked, 
              and Amy would not ask him, for just then she was having little experiences 
              of her own, which made her rather wish to avoid the quizzical eyes 
              of `out boy'. </p>
            <p>Fred Vaughn had returned, and put the question to which she had 
              once decided to answer, &quot;Yes, thank you,&quot; but now she 
              said, &quot;No, thank you,&quot; kindly but steadily, for when the 
              time came, her courage failed her, and she found that something 
              more than money and position was needed to satisfy the new longing 
              that filled her heart so full of tender hopes and fears. The words, 
              &quot;Fred is a good fellow, but not at all the man I fancied you 
              would ever like,&quot; and Laurie's face when he uttered them, kept 
              returning to her as pertinaciously as her own did when she said 
              in look, if not in words, &quot;I shall marry for money.&quot; It 
              troubled her to remember that now, she wished she could take it 
              back, it sounded so unwomanly. She didn't want Laurie to think her 
              a heartless, worldly creature. She didn't care to be a queen of 
              society now half so much as she did to be a lovable woman. She was 
              so glad he didn't hate her for the dreadful things she said, but 
              took them so beautifully and was kinder than ever. His letters were 
              such a comfort, for the home letters were very irregular and not 
              half so satisfactory as his when they did come. It was not only 
              a pleasure, but a duty to answer them, for the poor fellow was forlorn, 
              and needed petting, since Jo persisted in being stonyhearted. She 
              ought to have made an effort and tried to love him. It couldn't 
              be very hard, many people would be proud and glad to have such a 
              dear boy care for them. But Jo never would act like other girls, 
              so there was nothing to do but be very kind and treat him like a 
              brother.</p>
            <p>If all brothers were treated as well as Laurie was at this period, 
              they would be a much happier race of beings than they are. Amy never 
              lectured now. She asked his opinion on all subjects, she was interested 
              in everything he did, made charming little presents for him, and 
              sent him two letters a week, full of lively gossip, sisterly confidences, 
              and captivating sketches of the lovely scenes about her. As few 
              brothers are complimented by having their letters carried about 
              in their sister's pockets, read and reread diligently, cried over 
              when short, kissed when long, and treasured carefully, we will not 
              hint that Amy did any of these fond and foolish things. But she 
              certainly did grow a little pale and pensive that spring, lost much 
              of her relish for society, and went out sketching alone a good deal. 
              She never had much to show when she came home, but was studying 
              nature, I dare say, while she sat for hours, with her hands folded, 
              on the terrace at Valrosa, or absently sketched any fancy that occurred 
              to her, a stalwart knight carved on a tomb, a young man asleep in 
              the grass, with his hat over his eyes, or a curly haired girl in 
              gorgeous array, promenading down a ballroom on the arm of a tall 
              gentleman, both faces being left a blur according to the last fashion 
              in art, which was safe but not altogether satisfactory. </p>
            <p>Her aunt thought that she regretted her answer to Fred, and finding 
              denials useless and explanations impossible, Amy left her to think 
              what she liked, taking care that Laurie should know that Fred had 
              gone to Egypt. That was all, but he understood it, and looked relieved, 
              as he said to himself, with a venerable air . ..</p>
            <p>&quot;I was sure she would think better of it. Poor old fellow! 
              I've been through it all, and I can sympathize.&quot; </p>
            <p>With that he heaved a great sigh, and then, as if he had discharged 
              his duty to the past, put his feet up on the sofa and enjoyed Amy's 
              letter luxuriously. </p>
            <p>While these changes were going on abroad, trouble had come at home. 
              But the letter telling that Beth was failing never reached Amy, 
              and when the next found her at Vevay, for the heat had driven them 
              from Nice in May, and they had travelled slowly to Switzerland, 
              by way of Genoa and the Italian lakes. She bore it very well, and 
              quietly submitted to the family decree that she should not shorten 
              her visit, for since it was too late to say goodbye to Beth, she 
              had better stay, and let absence soften her sorrow. But her heart 
              was very heavy, she longed to be at home, and every day looked wistfully 
              across the lake, waiting for Laurie to come and comfort her. </p>
            <p>He did come very soon, for the same mail brought letters to them 
              both, but he was in Germany, and it took some days to reach him. 
              The moment he read it, he packed his knapsack, bade adieu to his 
              fellow pedestrians, and was off to keep his promise, with a heart 
              full of joy and sorrow, hope and suspense. </p>
            <p>He knew Vevay well, and as soon as the boat touched the little 
              quay, he hurried along the shore to La Tour, where the Carrols were 
              living en pension. The garcon was in despair that the whole family 
              had gone to take a promenade on the lake, but no, the blonde mademoiselle 
              might be in the chateau garden. If monsier would give himself the 
              pain of sitting down, a flash of time should present her. But monsieur 
              could not wait even a `flash of time', and in the middle of the 
              speech departed to find mademoiselle himself. </p>
            <p>A pleasant old garden on the borders of the lovely lake, with chestnuts 
              rustling overhead, ivy climbing everywhere, and the black shadow 
              of the tower falling far across the sunny water. At one corner of 
              the wide, low wall was a seat, and here Amy often came to read or 
              work, or console herself with the beauty all about her. She was 
              sitting here that day, leaning her head on her hand, with a homesick 
              heart and heavy eyes, thinking of Beth and wondering why Laurie 
              did not come. She did not hear him cross the courtyard beyond, nor 
              see him pause in the archway that led from the subterranean path 
              into the garden. He stood a minute looking at her with new eyes, 
              seeing what no one had ever seen before, the tender side of Amy's 
              character. Everything about her mutely suggested love and sorrow, 
              the blotted letters in her lap, the black ribbon that tied up her 
              hair, the womanly pain and patience in her face, even the little 
              ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to Laurie, for he had 
              given it to her, and she wore it as her only ornament. If he had 
              any doubts about the reception she would give him, they were set 
              at rest the minute she looked up and saw him, for dropping everything, 
              she ran to him, exclaiming in a tone of unmistakable love and longing... 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, Laurie, Laurie, I knew you'd come to me!&quot; </p>
            <p>I think everything was said and settled then, for as they stood 
              together quite silent for a moment, with the dark head bent down 
              protectingly over the light one, Amy felt that no one could comfort 
              and sustain her so well as Laurie, and Laurie decided that Amy was 
              the only woman in the world who could fill Jo's place and make him 
              happy. He did not tell her so, but she was not disappointed, for 
              both felt the truth, were satisfied, and gladly left the rest to 
              silence. </p>
            <p>In a minute Amy went back to her place, and while she dried her 
              tears, Laurie gathered up the scattered papers, finding in the sight 
              of sundry well-worn letters and suggestive sketches good omens for 
              the future. As he sat down beside her, amy felt shy again, and turned 
              rosy red at the recollection of her impulsive greeting. </p>
            <p>&quot;I couldn't help it, I felt so lonely and sad, and was so 
              very glad to see you. It was such a surprise to look up and find 
              you, just as I was beginning to fear you wouldn't come,&quot; she 
              said, trying in vain to speak quite naturally. </p>
            <p>&quot;I came the minute I heard. I wish I could say something to 
              comfort you for the loss of dear little Beth, but I can only feel, 
              and...&quot; He could not get any further, for her too turned bashful 
              all of a sudden, and did not quite know what to say. He longed to 
              lay Amy's head down on his shoulder, and tell her to have a good 
              cry, but he did not dare, so took her hand instead, and gave it 
              a sympathetic squeeze that was better than words. </p>
            <p>&quot;You needn't say anything, this comforts me,&quot; she said 
              softly. &quot;Beth is well and happy, and I mustn't wish her back, 
              but I dread the going home, much as I long to see them all. We won't 
              talk about it now, for it makes me cry, and I want to enjoy you 
              while you stay. You needn't go right back, need you?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Not if you want me, dear.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;I do, so much. Aunt and Flo are very kind, but you seem like 
              one of the family, and it would be so comfortable to have you for 
              a little while.&quot; </p>
            <p>Amy spoke and looked so like a homesick child whose heart was full 
              that Laurie forgot his bashfulness all at once, and gave her just 
              what she wanted--the petting she was used to and the cheerful conversation 
              she needed. </p>
            <p>&quot;Poor little soul, you look as if you'd grieved yourself half 
              sick! I'm going to take care of you, so don't cry any more, but 
              come and walk about with me, the wind is too chilly for you to sit 
              still,&quot; he said, in the half-caressing, half-commanding way 
              that Amy liked, as he tied on her hat, drew her arm through his, 
              and began to pace up and down the sunny walk under the new-leaved 
              chestnuts. He felt more at ease upon his legs, and Amy found it 
              pleasant to have a strong arm to lean upon, a familiar face to smile 
              at her, and a kind voice to talk delightfully for her alone. </p>
            <p>The quaint old garden had sheltered many pairs of lovers, and seemed 
              expressly made for them, so sunny and secluded was it, with nothing 
              but the tower to overlook them, and the wide lake to carry away 
              the echo of their words, as it rippled by below. For an hour this 
              new pair walked and talked, or rested on the wall, enjoying the 
              sweet influences which gave such a charm to time and place, and 
              when an unromantic dinner bell warned them away, Amy felt as if 
              she left her burden of lonliness and sorrow behind her in the chateau 
              garden. </p>
            <p>The moment Mrs. Carrol saw the girl's altered face, she was illuminated 
              with a new idea, and exclaimed to herself, &quot;Now I understand 
              it all--the child has been pining for young Laurence. Bless my heart, 
              I never thought of such a thing!&quot; </p>
            <p>With praiseworthy discretion, the good lady said nothing, and betrayed 
              no sign of enlightenment, but cordially urged Laurie to stay and 
              begged Amy to enjoy his society, for it would do her more good than 
              so much solitude. Amy was a model of docility, and as her aunt was 
              a good deal occupied with Flo, she was left to entertain her friend, 
              and did it with more than her usual success. </p>
            <p>At Nice, Laurie had lounged and Amy had scolded. At Vevay, Laurie 
              was never idle, but always walking, riding, boating, or studying 
              in the most energetic manner, while Amy admired everything he did 
              and followed his example as far and as fast as she could. He said 
              the change was owing to the climate, and she did not contradict 
              him, being glad of a like excuse for her own recovered health and 
              spirits.</p>
            <p>The invigorating air did them both good, and much exercise worked 
              wholesome changes in minds as well as bodies. They seemed to get 
              clearer views of life and duty up there among the everlasting hills. 
              The fresh winds blew away desponding doubts, delusive fancies, and 
              moody mists. The warm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of aspiring 
              ideas, tender hopes, and happy thoughts. The lake seemed to wash 
              away the troubles of the past, and the grand old mountains to look 
              benignly down upon them saying, &quot;Little children, love one 
              another.&quot; </p>
            <p>In spite of the new sorrow, it was a very happy time, so happy 
              that Laurie could not bear to disturb it by a word. It took him 
              a little while to recover from his surprise at the cure of his first, 
              and as he had firmly believed, his last and only love. He consoled 
              himself for the seeming disloyalty by the thought that Jo's sister 
              was almost the same as Jo's self, and the conviction that it would 
              have been impossible to love any other woman but Amy so soon and 
              so well. His first wooing had been of the tempestuous order, and 
              he looked back upon ;it as if through a long vista of years with 
              a feeling of compassion blended with regret. He was not ashamed 
              of it, but put it away as one of the bitter-sweet experiences of 
              his life, for which he could be grateful when the pain was over. 
              His second wooing, he resolved, should be as calm and simple as 
              possible. There was no need of having a scene, hardly any need of 
              telling Amy that he loved her, she knew it without words and had 
              given him his answer long ago. It all came about so naturally that 
              no one could complain, and he knew that everybody would be pleased, 
              even Jo. But when our first little passion has been crushed, we 
              are apt to be wary and slow in making a second trial, so Laurie 
              let the days pass, enjoying every hour, and leaving to chance the 
              utterance of the word that would put an end to the first and sweetest 
              part of his new romance. </p>
            <p>He had rather imagined that the denoument would take place in the 
              chateau garden by moonlight, and in the most graceful and decorus 
              manner, but it turned out exactly the reverse, for the matter was 
              settled on the lake at noonday in a few blunt words. They had been 
              floating about all the morning, from gloomy St. Gingolf to sunny 
              Montreux, with the Alps of Savoy on one side, Mont St. Bernard and 
              the Dent du Midi on the other, pretty Vevay in the valley, and Lausanne 
              upon the hill beyond, a cloudless blue sky overhead, and the bluer 
              lake below, dotted with the picturesque boats that look like white-winged 
              gulls. </p>
            <p>They had been talking of Bonnivard, as they glided past Chillon, 
              and of Rousseau, as they looked up at Clarens, where he wrote his 
              Heloise. Neither had read it, but they knew it was a love story, 
              and each privately wondered if it was half as interesting as their 
              own. Amy had been dabbling her hand in the water during the little 
              pause that fell between them, and when she looked up, Laurie was 
              leaning on his oars with an expression in his eyes that made her 
              say hastily, merely for the sake of saying something . . </p>
            <p>&quot;You must be tired. Rest a little, and let me row. It will 
              do me good, for since you came I have been altogether lazy and luxurious.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;I'm not tired, but you may take an oar, if you like. There's 
              room enough, though I have to sit nearly in the middle, else the 
              boat won't trim,&quot; returned Laurie, as if he rather liked the 
              arrangment. </p>
            <p>Feeling that she had not mended matters much, Amy took the offered 
              third of a seat, shook her hair over her face, and accepted an oar. 
              She rowed as well as she did many other things, and though she used 
              both hands, and Laurie but one, the oars kept time, and the boat 
              went smoothly through the water. </p>
            <p>&quot;How well we pull together, don't we?&quot; said Amy, who 
              objected to silence just then. </p>
            <p>&quot;So well that I wish we might always pull in the same boat. 
              Will you, Amy?&quot; very tenderly. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, Laurie,&quot; very low. </p>
            <p>Then they both stopped rowing, and unconsciously added a pretty 
              little tableau of human love and happiness to the dissolving views 
              reflected in the lake. </p>

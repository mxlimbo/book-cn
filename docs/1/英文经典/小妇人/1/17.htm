              For a week the amount of virtue in the old house would have supplied 
              the neighborhood. It was really amazing, for everyone seemed in 
              a heavenly frame of mind, and self-denial was all the fashion. Relieved 
              of their first anxiety about their father, girls insensibly relaxed 
              their praiseworthy efforts a little, and began to fall back into 
              old ways. They did not forget their motto, but hoping and keeping 
              busy seemed to grow easier, and after such tremendous exertions, 
              they felt that Endeavor deserved a holiday, and gave it a good many. 
            </p>
            <p>Jo caught a bad cold through neglect to cover the shorn head enough, 
              and was ordered to stay at home till she was better, for Aunt March 
              didn't like to hear people read with colds in their heads. Jo liked 
              this, and after an energetic rummage from garret to cellar, subsided 
              on the sofa to nurse her cold with arsenicum and books. Amy found 
              that housework and art did not go well together, and returned to 
              her mud pies. Meg went daily to her pupils, and sewed, or thought 
              she did, at home, but much time was spent in writing long letters 
              to her mother, or reading the Washington dispatches over and over. 
              Beth kept on, with only slight relapses into idleness or grieving. 
            </p>
            <p>All the little duties were faithfully done each day, and many of 
              her sisters' also, for they were forgetful, and the house seemed 
              like a clock whose pendulum was gone a-visiting. When her heart 
              got heavy with longings for Mother or fears for Father, she went 
              away into a certain closet, hid her face in the folds of a dear 
              old gown, and made her little moan and prayed her little prayer 
              quietly by herself. Nobody knew what cheered her up after a sober 
              fit, but everyone felt how sweet and helpful Beth was, and fell 
              into a way of going to her for comfort or advice in their small 
              affairs. </p>
            <p>All were unconscious that this experience was a test of character, 
              and when the first excitement was over, felt that they had done 
              well and deserved praise. So they did, but their mistake was in 
              ceasing to do well, and they learned this lesson through much anxiety 
              and regret. </p>
            <p>&quot;Meg, I wish you'd go and see the Hummels. You know Mother 
              told us not to forget them.&quot; said Beth, ten days after Mrs. 
              March's departure. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm too tired to go this afternoon,&quot; re;lied Meg, rocking 
              comfortably as she sewed. </p>
            <p>&quot;Can't you, Jo?' asked Beth. </p>
            <p>&quot;Too stormy for me with my cold.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I thought it was almost well.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;It's well enough for me to go out with Laurie, but not well 
              enough to go to the Hummels',&quot; said Jo, laughing, but looking 
              a little ashamed of her inconsistency. </p>
            <p>&quot;Why don't you go yourself?&quot; asked Meg. </p>
            <p>&quot;I have been every day, but the baby is sick, and I don't 
              know what to do for it. Mrs. Hummel goes away to work, and Lottchen 
              takes care of it. But it gets sicker and sicker, and I think you 
              or Hannah ought to go.&quot; </p>
            <p>Beth spoke earnestly, and Meg promised she would go tomorrow. </p>
            <p>&quot;Ask Hannah for some nice little mess, and take it round, 
              Beth, the air will do you good,&quot; said Jo, adding apologetically, 
              &quot;I'd go but I want to finish my writing.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;My head aches and I'm tired, so I thought maybe some of you 
              would go,&quot; said Beth. </p>
            <p>&quot;Amy will be in presently, and she will run down for us, suggested 
              Meg. </p>
            <p>So Beth lay down on the sofa, the others returned to their work, 
              and the Hummels were forgotten. An hour passed. Amy did not come, 
              Meg went to her room to try on a new dress, Jo was absorbed in her 
              story, and Hannah was sound asleep before the kitchen fire, when 
              Beth quietly put on her hood, filled her basket with odds and ends 
              for the poor children, and went out into the chilly air with a heavy 
              head and a grieved look in her patient eyes. It was late when she 
              came back, and no one saw her creep upstairs and shut herself into 
              her mother's room. Half an hour after, Jo went to `Mother's closet' 
              for something, and there found little Beth sitting on the medicine 
              chest, looking very grave, with red eyes and a camphor bottle in 
              her hand. </p>
            <p>&quot;Christopher Columbus! What's the matter?&quot; cried Jo, 
              as Beth put out her hand as if to warn her off, and asked quickly, 
              &quot;You've had the scarlet fever, havent't you?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Years ago, when Meg did. Why?' </p>
            <p>&quot;Then I'll tell you. Oh, Jo, the baby's dead!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;What baby?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Mrs. Hummel's. It died in my lap before she got home,&quot; 
              cried Beth with a sob. </p>
            <p>&quot;My poor dear, how dreadful for you! I ought to have gone,&quot; 
              said Jo, taking her sister in her arms as she sat down in her mother's 
              bit chair, with a remorseful face. </p>
            <p>&quot;It wasn't dreadful, Jo, only so sad! I saw in a minute it 
              was sicker, but Lottchen said her mother had gone for a doctor, 
              so I took Baby and let Lotty rest. It seemed asleep, but all of 
              a sudden if gave a little cry and trembled, and then lay very still. 
              I tried to warm its feet, and Lotty gave it some milk, but it didn't 
              stir, and I knew it was dead.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't cry, dear! What did you do?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I just sat and held it softly till Mrs. Hummel came with 
              the doctor. He said it was dead, and looked at Heinrich and Minna, 
              who have sore throats. `Scarlet fever, ma'am. Ought to have called 
              me before, ' he said crossly. Mrs. Hummel told him she was poor, 
              and had tried to cure baby herself, but now it was too late, and 
              she could only ask him to help the others and trust to charity for 
              his pay. He smiled then, and was kinder, but it was very sad, and 
              I cried with them till he turned round all of a sudden, and told 
              me to go home and take belladonna right away, or I'd have the fever.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;No, you won't!&quot; cried Jo, hugging her close, with a 
              frightened look. &quot;Oh, Beth, if you should be sick I never could 
              forgive myself! What shall we do?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't be frightened, I guess I shan't have it badly. I looked 
              in Mother's book, and saw that it begins with headache, sore throat, 
              and queer feelings like mine, so I did take some belladonna, and 
              I feel better,&quot; said Beth, laying her cold hands on her hot 
              forehead and trying to look well. </p>
            <p>&quot;If Mother was only at home!&quot; exclaimed Jo, seizing the 
              book, and feeling that Washington was an immense way off. She read 
              a page, looked at Beth, felt her head, peeped into her throat, and 
              then said gravely, &quot;You've been over the baby every day for 
              more than a week, and among the others who are going to have it, 
              so I'm afraid you are going to have it, Beth. I'll call Hannah, 
              she knows all about sickness.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't let Amy come. She never had it, and I should hate to 
              give it to her. Can't you and Meg have it over again?&quot; asked 
              Beth, anxiously. </p>
            <p>&quot;I guess not. Don't care if I do. Serve me right, selfish 
              pig, to let you go, and stay writing rubbish myself!&quot; muttered 
              Jo, as she went to consult Hannah. </p>
            <p>The good soul was wide awake in a minute, and took the lead at 
              once, assuring that there was no need to worry; every one had scarlet 
              fever, and if rightly treated, nobody died, all of which Jo believed, 
              and felt much relieved as they went up to call Meg. </p>
            <p>&quot;Now I'll tell you what we'll do,&quot; said Hannah, when 
              she had examined and questioned Beth, &quot;we will have Dr. Bangs, 
              just to take a look at you, dear, and see that we start right. Then 
              we'll send Amy off to Aunt March's for a spell, to keep her out 
              of harm's way, and one of you girls can stay at home and amuse Beth 
              for a day or two.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I shall stay, of course, I'm oldest,&quot; began Meg, looking 
              anxious and self-reproachful. </p>
            <p>&quot;I shall, because it's my fault she is sick. I told Mother 
              I'd do the errands, and I haven't,&quot; said Jo decidedly. </p>
            <p>&quot;Which will you have, Beth? There ain't no need of but one,&quot; 
              aid Hannah. </p>
            <p>&quot;Jo, please.&quot; And Beth leaned her head against her sister 
              with a contented look, which effectually settled that point. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'll go and tell Amy,&quot; said Meg, feeling a little hurt, 
              yet rather relieved on the whole, for she did not like nursing, 
              and Jo did. </p>
            <p>Amy rebelled outright, and passionately declared that she had rather 
              have the fever than go to Aunt March. Meg reasoned, pleaded, and 
              commanded, all in vain. Amy protested that she would not go, and 
              Meg left her in despair to ask Hannah what should be done. Before 
              she came back, Laurie walked into the parlor to find Amy sobbing, 
              with her head in the sofa cushions. She told her story, expecting 
              to be consoled, but Laurie only put his hands in his pockets and 
              walked about the room, whistling softly, as he knit his brows in 
              deep thought. Presently he sat down beside her, and said, in his 
              most wheedlesome tone, &quot;Now be a sensible little woman, and 
              do as they say. No, don't cry, but hear what a jolly plan I've got. 
              You go to Aunt March's, and I'll come and take you out every day, 
              driving or walking, and we'll have capital times. Won't that be 
              better than moping here?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't wish to be sent off as if I was in the way,&quot; 
              began Amy, in an injured voice. </p>
            <p>&quot;Bless your heart, child, it's to keep you well. You don't 
              want to be sick, do you?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;No, I'm sure I don't, but I dare say I shall be, for I've 
              been with Beth all the time.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;That's the very reason you ought to go away at once, so that 
              you may escape it. Change of air and care will keep you well, I 
              dare say, or if it does not entirely, you will have the fever more 
              lightly. I advise you to be off as soon as you can, for scarlet 
              fever is no joke, miss.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;But it's dull at Aunt March's, and she is so cross,&quot; 
              said Amy, looking rather frightened. </p>
            <p>&quot;It won't be dull with me popping; in every day to tell you 
              how Beth is, and take you out gallivanting. The old lady likes me, 
              and I'll be as sweet as possible to her, so she won't peck at us, 
              whatever we do.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Will you take me out in the trotting wagon with Puck?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;On my honor as a gentleman.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;And come every single day?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;See if I don't/&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;And bring me back the minute Beth is well?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;The identical minute.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;And go to the theater, truly?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;A dozen theaters, if we may.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Well--I guess I will,&quot; said Amy slowly. </p>
            <p>&quot;Good girl! Call Meg, and tell her you'll give in,&quot; said 
              Laurie, with an approving pat, which annoyed Amy more than the`giving 
              in'. </p>
            <p>Meg and Jo came running down to behold the miracle which had been 
              wrought, and Amy, feeling very precious and self-sacrificing, promised 
              to go, if the doctor said Beth was going to be ill. </p>
            <p>&quot;How is the little dear?&quot; asked Laurie, for Beth was 
              his especial pet, and he felt more anxious about her than he liked 
              to show. </p>
            <p>&quot;She is lying down on Mother's bed, and feels better. The 
              baby's death troubled her, but I dare say she has only got cold. 
              Hannah says she thinks so, but she looks worried, and that makes 
              me fidgety,&quot; answered Meg. </p>
            <p>&quot;What a trying world it is!&quot; said Jo, rumpling up her 
              hair in a fretful way. &quot;No sooner do we get out of one trouble 
              than down comes another. There doesn't seem to be anything to hold 
              on to when Mother's gone, so I'm all at sea.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, don't make a porcupine of yourself, it isn't becoming. 
              Settle your wig, Jo, and tell me if I shall telegraph to your mother, 
              or do anything?&quot; asked Laurie, who never had been reconciled 
              to the loss of his friend's one beauty. </p>
            <p>&quot;That is what troubles me,&quot; said Meg. &quot;I think we 
              ought to tell her if Beth is really ill, but Hannah says we mustn't, 
              for Mother can't leave Father, and it will only make them anxious. 
              Beth won't be sick long, and Hannah knows just what to do, and Mother 
              said we were to mind her, so I suppose we must, but it doesn't seem 
              quite right to me.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Hum, well, I can't say. Suppose you ask Grandfather after 
              the doctor has been.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;We will. Jo, go and get Dr. Bangs at once,&quot; commanded 
              Meg. </p>
            <p>&quot;We can't decide anything till he has been.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Stay where you are, Jo. I'm errand boy to this establishment,&quot; 
              said Laurie, taking up his cap. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm afraid you are busy,&quot; began Meg. </p>
            <p>&quot;No, I've done my lessons for the day.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Do you study in vacation time?&quot; asked Jo. </p>
            <p>&quot;I follow the good example my neighbors set me,&quot; was 
              Laurie's answer, as he swung himself out of the room. </p>
            <p>&quot;I have great hopes for my boy,&quot; observed Jo, watching 
              him fly over the fence with an approving smile. </p>
            <p>&quot;He does very well, for a boy,&quot; was Meg's somewhat ungracious 
              answer, for the subject did not interest her. </p>
            <p>Dr. Bangs came, said Beth had symptoms of the fever, but he thought 
              she would have it lightly, though he looked sober over the Hummel 
              story. Amy was ordered off at once, and provided with something 
              to ward off danger, she departed in great state, with Jo and Laurie 
              as escort. </p>
            <p>Aunt March received them with her usual hospitality.</p>
            <p>&quot;What do you want now?&quot; she asked, looking sharply over 
              her spectacles, while the parrot, sitting on the back of her chair, 
              called out... </p>
            <p>&quot;Go away. No boys allowed here.&quot; </p>
            <p>Laurie retired to the window, and Jo told her story. </p>
            <p>&quot;No more than I expected, if you are allowed to go poking 
              about among poor folks. Amy can stay and make herself useful if 
              she isn't sick, which I've no doubt she will be, looks like it now. 
              Don't cry, child, it worries me to hear people sniff.&quot; Amy 
              was on the point of crying, but Laurie slyly pulled the parrot's 
              tail, which caused Polly to utter an astonished croak and call out, 
              &quot;Bless my boots!&quot; in such a funny way, that she laughed 
              instead. </p>
            <p>&quot;What do you hear from your mother?&quot; asked the old lady 
              gruffly. </p>
            <p>&quot;Father is much better,&quot; replied Jo, trying to keep sober. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Oh, is her? Well, that won't last long, I fancy. March never 
              had any stamina,&quot; was the cheerful reply. </p>
            <p>&quot;Ha, ha! Never say die, take a pinch of snuff, goodbye, goodbye!&quot; 
              squalled Polly, dancing on her perch, and clawing at the old lady's 
              cap as Laurie tweaked him in the rear. </p>
            <p>&quot;Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird! And, Jo, you'd 
              better go at once. It isn't proper to be gadding about so late with 
              a rattlepated boy like...&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird!&quot; cried 
              Polly, tumbling off the chair with a bounce, and running to peck 
              the `rattlepated' boy, who was shaking with laughter at the last 
              speech. </p>
            <p> &quot;I don't think I can bear it, but I'll try,&quot; thought 
              Amy, as she was left alone with Aunt March. </p>
            <p>&quot;Get along, you fright!&quot; screamed Polly, and at that 
              rude speech Amy could not restrain a sniff. </p>

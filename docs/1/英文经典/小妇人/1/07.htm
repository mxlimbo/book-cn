              &quot;That boy is a perfect cyclops, isn't he?&quot; said Amy one 
              day, as Laurie clattered by on horseback, with a flourish of his 
              whip as he passed. </p>
            <p>&quot;How dare you say so, when he's got both his eyes? And very 
              handsome ones they are, too,&quot; cried Jo, who resented any slighting 
              remarks about her friend. </p>
            <p>&quot;I didn't day anything about his eyes, and I don't see why 
              you need fire up when I admire his riding.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, my goodness! That little goose means a centaur, and she 
              called him a Cyclops,&quot; exclaimed Jo, with a burst of laughter. 
              &quot;You needn't be so rude, it's only a `lapse of lingy', as Mr. 
              Davis says,&quot; retorted Amy, finishing Jo with her Latin. &quot;I 
              just wish I had a little of the money Laurie spends on that horse,&quot; 
              she added, as if to herself, yet hoping her sisters would hear. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Why?&quot; asked Meg kindly, for Jo had gone off in another 
              laugh at Amy's second blunder. </p>
            <p>&quot;I need it so much. I'm dreadfully in debt, and it won't be 
              my turn to have the rag money for a month.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;In debt, Amy? What do you mean?&quot; And Meg looked sober. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Why, I owe at least a dozen pickled limes, and I can't pay 
              them, you know, till I have money, for Marmee forbade my having 
              anything charged at the shop.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Tell me all about it. Are limes the fashion now? It used 
              to be pricking bits of rubber to make balls.&quot; And Meg tried 
              to keep her countenance, Amy looked so grave and important. </p>
            <p>&quot;Why, you see, the girls are always buying them, and unless 
              you want to be thought mean, you must do it too. It's nothing but 
              limes now, for everyone is sucking them in their desks in schooltime, 
              and trading them off for pencils, bead rings, paper dolls, or something 
              else, at recess. If one girl likes another, she gives her a lime. 
              If she's mad with her, she eats one before her face, and doesn't 
              offer even a suck. They treat by turns, and I've had ever so many 
              but haven't returned them, and I ought for they are debts of honor, 
              you know.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;How much will pay them off and restore your credit?&quot; 
              asked Meg, taking out her purse.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;A quarter would more than do it, and leave a few cents over 
              for a treat for you. Don't you like limes?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Not much. You may have my share. Here's the money. Make it 
              last as long as you can, for it isn't very plenty, you know.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Oh, thank you! It must be so nice to have pocket money! 
              I'll have a grand feast, for I haven't tasted a lime this week. 
              I felt delicate about taking any, as I couldn't return them, and 
              I'm actually suffering for one.&quot; </p>
            <p>Next day Amy was rather late at school, but could not resist the 
              temptation of displaying, with pardonable pride, a moist brown-paper 
              parcel, before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of her desk. 
              During the next few minutes the rumor that Amy March had got twenty- 
              four delicious limes (she ate one on the way) and was going to treat 
              circulated through her `set', and the attentions of her friends 
              became quite overwhelming. Katy Brown invited her to her next party 
              on the spot. Mary Kinglsey insisted on lending her her watch till 
              recess, and Jenny Snow, a satirical young lady, who had basely twitted 
              Amy upon her limeless state, promptly buried the hatchet and offered 
              to furnish answers to certain appalling sums. But Amy had not forgotten 
              Miss Snow's cutting remarks about `some persons whose noses were 
              not too flat to smell other people's limes, and stuck-up people 
              who were not too proud to ask for them', and she instantly crushed 
              `that Snow girl's' hopes by the withering telegram, &quot;You needn't 
              be so polite all of a sudden, for you won't get any.&quot; </p>
            <p>A distinguished personage happened to visit the school that morning, 
              and Amy's beautifully drawn maps received praise, which honor to 
              her foe rankled in the soul of Miss Snow, and caused Miss March 
              to assume the airs of a studious young peacock. But, alas, alas! 
              Pride goes before a fall, and the revengeful Snow turned the tables 
              with disastrous success. No sooner had the guest paid the usual 
              stale compliments and bowed himself out, than Jenny, under pretense 
              of asking an important question, informed Mr. Davis, the teacher, 
              that Amy March had pickled limes in her desk. </p>
            <p>Now Mr. Davis had declared limes a contraband article, and solemnly 
              vowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found breaking 
              the law. This much-enduring man had succeeded in banishing chewing 
              gum after a long and stormy war, had made a bonfire of the confiscated 
              novels and newspapers, had suppressed a private post office, had 
              forbidden distortions of the face, nicknames, and caricatures, and 
              done all that one man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious 
              girls in order. Boys are trying enough to human patience, goodness 
              knows, but girls are infinitely more so, especially to nervous gentlemen 
              with tyrannical tempers and no more talent for teaching than Dr. 
              Blimber. Mr. Davis knew any quantity of Greek, Latin, algebra, and 
              ologies of all sorts so he was called a fine teacher, and manners, 
              morals, feelings, and examples were not considered of any particular 
              importance. It was a most unfortunate moment for denouncing Amy, 
              and Jenny knew it. Mr. Davis had evidently taken his coffee too 
              strong that morning, there was an east wind, which always affected 
              his neuralgia, and his pupils had not done him the credit which 
              he felt he deserved. Therefore, to use the expressive, if not elegant, 
              language of a schoolgirl, &quot;He was as nervous as a witch and 
              as cross as a bear&quot;. The word `limes' was like fire to powder, 
              his yellow face flushed, and he rapped on his desk with an energy 
              which made Jenny skip to her seat with unusual rapidity. </p>
            <p>&quot;Young ladies, attention, if you please!&quot; </p>
            <p>At the stern order the buzz ceased, and fifty pairs of blue, black, 
              gray, and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Miss March, come to the desk.&quot; </p>
            <p>Amy rose to comply with outward composure, but a secret fear oppressed 
              her, for the limes weighed upon her conscience. </p>
            <p>&quot;Bring with you the limes you have in your desk,&quot; was 
              the unexpected command which arrested her before she got out of 
              her seat. </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't take all.&quot; whispered her neighbor, a young lady 
              of great presence of mind. </p>
            <p>Amy hastily shook out half a dozen and laid the rest down before 
              Mr. Davis, feeling that any man possessing a human heart would relent 
              when that delicious perfume met his nose. Unfortunately, Mr. Davis 
              particularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle, and disgust 
              added to his wrath. </p>
            <p>&quot;Is that all?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Not quite,&quot; stammered Amy. </p>
            <p>&quot;Bring the rest immediately.&quot; </p>
            <p>With a despairing glance at her set, she obeyed. </p>
            <p>&quot;You are sure there are no more?' </p>
            <p>&quot;I never lie, sir.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;So I see. Now take these disgusting things two by two, and 
              throw them out of the window.&quot; </p>
            <p>There was a simultaneous sigh, which created quite a little gust, 
              as the last hope fled, and the treat was ravished from their longing 
              lips. Scarlet with shame and anger, Amy went to and fro six dreadful 
              times, and as each doomed couple, looking oh, so plump and juicy, 
              fell from her reluctant hands, a shout from the street completed 
              the anguish of the girls, for it told them that their feast was 
              being exulted over by the little Irish children, who were their 
              sworn foes. This--this was too much. All flashed indignant or appealing 
              glances at the inexorable Davis, and one passionate lime lover burst 
              into tears. </p>
            <p>As Amy returned from her last trip, Mr. Davis gave a portentous 
              &quot;Hem!&quot; and said, in his most impressive manner... </p>
            <p>&quot;Young ladies, you remember what I said to you a week ago. 
              I am sorry this has happened, but I never allow my rules to be infringed, 
              and I never break my word. Miss March, hold out your hand.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>Amy started, and put both hands behind her, turning on him an imploring 
              look which pleaded for her better than the words she could not utter. 
              She was rather a favorite with `old Davis', as, of course, he was 
              called, and it's my private belief that he would have broken his 
              word if the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not 
              found vent in a hiss. That hiss, faint as it was, irritated the 
              irascible gentleman, and sealed the culprit's fate. </p>
            <p>&quot;Your hand, Miss March!&quot; was the only answer her mute 
              appeal received, and too proud to cry or beseech, Amy set her teeth, 
              threw bach her head defiantly, and bore without flinching several 
              tingling blows on her little palm. They were neither many nor heavy, 
              but that made no difference to her. For the first time in her life 
              she had been struck, and the disgrace, in her eyes, was as deep 
              as if he had knocked her down. </p>
            <p>&quot;You will now stand on the platform till recess,&quot; said 
              Mr. Davis, resolved to do the thing thoroughly, since he had begun. 
            </p>
            <p>That was dreadful. It would have been bad enough to go to her seat, 
              and see the pitying faces of her friends, or the satisfied ones 
              of her few enemies, but to face the whole school, with that shame 
              fresh upon her, seemed impossible, and for a second she felt as 
              if she could only drop down where she stood, and break her heart 
              with crying. A bitter sense of wrong and the thought of Jenny Snow 
              helped her to bear it, and, taking the ignominious place, she fixed 
              her eyes on the stove funnel above what now seemed a sea of faces, 
              and stood there, so motionless and white that the girls found it 
              hard to study with that pathetic figure before them. </p>
            <p>During the fifteen minutes that followed, the proud and sensitive 
              little girl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot. To 
              others it might seem a ludicrous or trivial affair, but to her it 
              was a hard experience, for during the twelve years of her life she 
              had been governed by love alone, and a blow of that sort had never 
              touched her before. The smart of her hand and the ache of her heart 
              were forgotten in the sting of the thought, &quot;I shall have to 
              tell at home, and they will be so disappointed in me!&quot; </p>
            <p>The fifteen minutes seemed an hour, but they came to an end at 
              last, and the word `Recess!' had never seemed so welcome to her 
              before.</p>
            <p>&quot;You can go, Miss March,&quot; said Mr. Davis, looking, as 
              he felt, uncomfortable. </p>
            <p>He did not soon forget the reproachful glance Amy gave him, as 
              she went, without a word to anyone, straight into the anteroom, 
              snatched her things, and left the place &quot;forever,&quot; as 
              she passionately declared to herself. She was in a sad state when 
              she got home, and when the older girls arrived, some time later, 
              an indignation meeting was held at once. Mrs. March did not say 
              much but looked disturbed, and comforted her afflicted little daughter 
              in her tenderest manner. Meg bathed the insulted hand with glycerine 
              and tears, Beth felt that even her beloved kittens would fail as 
              a balm for griefs like this, Jo wrathfully proposed that Mr. Davis 
              be arrested without delay, and Hannah shook her fist at the `villain' 
              and pounded potatoes for dinner as if she had him under her pestle. 
            </p>
            <p>No notice was taken of Amy's flight, except by her mates, but the 
              sharp-eyed demoiselles discovered that Mr. Davis was quite benignant 
              in the afternoon, also unusually nervous. Just before school closed, 
              Jo appeared, wearing a grim expression as she stalked up to the 
              desk, and delivered a letter from her mother, then collected Amy's 
              property, and departed, carefully scraping the mud from her boots 
              on the door mat, as if she shook that dust of the place off her 
              feet. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, you can have a vacation from school, but I want you 
              to study a little every day with Beth,&quot; said Mrs. March that 
              evening. &quot;I don't approve of corporal punishment, especially 
              for girls. I dislike Mr. Davis's manner of teaching and don't think 
              the girls you associate with are doing you any good, so I shall 
              ask your father's advice before I send you anywhere else.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;That's good! I wish all the girls would leave, and spoil 
              his old school. It's perfectly maddening to think of those lovely 
              limes,&quot; sighed Amy, with the air of a martyr. </p>
            <p>&quot;I am not sorry you lost them, for you broke the rules, and 
              deserved some punishment for disobedience,&quot; was the severe 
              reply, which rather disappointed the young lady, who expected nothing 
              but sympathy. </p>
            <p>&quot;Do you mean you are glad I was disgraced before the whole 
              school?&quot; cried Amy. </p>
            <p>&quot;I should not have chosen that way of mending a fault,&quot; 
              replied her mother, &quot;but I'm not sure that it won't do you 
              more good than a molder method. You are getting to be rather conceited, 
              my dear, and it is quite time you set about correcting it. You have 
              a good many little gifts and virtues, but there is no need of parading 
              them, for conceit spoils the finest genius. There is not much danger 
              that real talent or goodness will be overlooked long, even if it 
              is, the consciousness of possessing and using it well should satisfy 
              one, and the great charm of all power is modesty.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;So it is!&quot; cried Laurie, who was playing chess in a 
              corner with Jo. &quot;I knew a girl once, who had a really remarkable 
              talent for music, and she didn't know it, never guessed what sweet 
              little things she composed when she was alone, and wouldn't have 
              believed it if anyone had told her.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I wish I'd known that nice girl. Maybe she would have helped 
              me, I'm so stupid,&quot; said Beth, who stood beside him, listening 
              eagerly. </p>
            <p>&quot;You do know her, and she helps you better than anyone else 
              could,&quot; answered Laurie, looking at her with such mischievous 
              meaning in his merry black eyes that Beth suddenly turned very red, 
              and hid her face in the sofa cushion, quite overcome by such an 
              unexpected discovery. </p>
            <p>Jo let Laurie win the game to pay for that praise of her Beth, 
              who could not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment. 
              So Laurie did his best, and sang delightfully, being in a particularly 
              lively humor, for to the Marches he seldom showed the moody side 
              of his character. When he was gone, amy, who had been pensive all 
              evening, said suddenly, as if busy over some new idea, &quot;Is 
              Laurie an accomplished boy?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, he has had an excellent education, and has much talent. 
              He will make a fine man, if not spoiled by petting,&quot; replied 
              her mother. </p>
            <p>&quot;And he isn't conceited, is he?&quot; asked Amy. </p>
            <p>&quot;Not in the least. That is why he is so charming and we all 
              like him so much.&quot; &quot;I see. It's nice to have accomplishments 
              and be elegant, but not to show off or get perked up,&quot; said 
              Amy thoughtfully. </p>
            <p> &quot;These things are always seen and felt in a person's manner 
              and conversations, if modestly used, but it is not necessary to 
              display them,&quot; said Mrs. March. </p>
            <p>Any more than it's proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and 
              ribbons at once, that folks may know you've got them,&quot; added 
              Jo, and the lecture ended in a laugh. </p>

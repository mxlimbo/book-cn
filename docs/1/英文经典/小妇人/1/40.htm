              <br>
              When the first bitterness was over, the family accepted the inevitable, 
              and tried to bear it cheerfully, helping one another by the increased 
              affection which comes to bind households tenderly together in times 
              of trouble. They put away their grief, and each did his or her part 
              toward making that last year a happy one. </p>
            <p>The pleasantest room in the house was set apart for Beth, and in 
              it was gathered everything that she most loved, flowers, pictures, 
              her piano, the little worktable, and the beloved pussies. Father's 
              best books found their way there, Mother's easy chair, Jo's desk, 
              Amy's finest sketches, and every day Meg brought her babies on a 
              loving pilgrimage, to make sunshine for Aunty Beth. John quietly 
              set apart a little sum, that he might enjoy the pleasure of keeping 
              the invalid supplied with the fruit she loved and longed for. Old 
              Hannah never wearied of concocting dainty dishes to tempt a capricious 
              appetite, dropping tears as she worked, and from across the sea 
              came little gifts and cheerful letters, seeming to bring breaths 
              of warmth and fragrance from lands that know no winter. </p>
            <p>Here, cherished like a household saint in its shrine, sat Beth, 
              tranquil and busy as ever, for nothing could change the sweet, unselfish 
              nature, and even while preparing to leave life, she tried to make 
              it happier for those who should remain behind. The feeble fingers 
              were never idle, and one of her pleasures was to make little things 
              for the school children daily passing to and fro, to drop a pair 
              of mittens from her window for a pair of purple hands, a needlebook 
              for some small mother of many dolls, penwipers for young penmen 
              toiling through forests of pothooks, scrapbooks for picture-loving 
              eyes, and all manner of pleasant devices, till the reluctant climbers 
              of the ladder of learning found their way strewn with flowers, as 
              it were, and came to regard the gentle giver as a sort of fairy 
              godmother, who sat above there, and showered down gifts miraculously 
              suited to their tastes and needs. If Beth had wanted any reward, 
              she found it in the bright little faces always turned up to her 
              window, with nods and smiles, and the droll little letters which 
              came to her, full of blots and gratitude. </p>
            <p>The first few months were very happy ones, and Beth often used 
              to look round, and say &quot;How beautiful this is!&quot; as they 
              all sat together in her sunny room, the babies kicking and crowing 
              on the floor, mother and sisters working near, and father reading, 
              in his pleasant voice, from the wise old books which seemed rich 
              in good and comfortable words, as applicable now as when written 
              centuries ago, a little chapel, where a paternal priest taught his 
              flock the hard lessons all must learn, trying to show them that 
              hope can comfort love, and faith make resignation possible. Simple 
              sermons, that went straight to the souls of those who listened, 
              for the father's heart was in the minister's religion, and the frequent 
              falter in the voice gave a double eloquence to the words he spoke 
              or read. </p>
            <p>It was well for all that this peaceful time was given them as preparation 
              for the sad hours to come, for by-and-by, Beth said the needle was 
              `so heavy', and put it down forever. Talking wearied her, faces 
              troubled her, pain claimed her for its own, and her tranquil spirit 
              was sorrowfully perturbed by the ills that vexed her feeble flesh. 
              Ah me! Such heavy days, such long, long nights, such aching hearts 
              and imploring prayers, when those who loved her best were forced 
              to see the thin hands stretched out to them beseechingly, to hear 
              the bitter cry, &quot;Help me, help me!&quot; and to feel that there 
              was no help. A sad eclipse of the serene soul, a sharp struggle 
              of the young life with death, but both were mercifully brief, and 
              then the natural rebellion over, the old peace returned more beautiful 
              than ever. With the wreck of her frail body, Beth's soul grew strong, 
              and though she said little, those about her felt that she was ready, 
              saw that the first pilgrim called was likewise the fittest, and 
              waited with her on the shore, trying to see the Shining Ones coming 
              to receive her when she crossed the river. </p>
            <p>Jo never left her for an hour since Beth had said &quot;I feel 
              stronger when you are here.&quot; She slept on a couch in the room, 
              waking often to renew the fire, to feed, lift, or wait upon the 
              patient creature who seldom asked for anything, and `tried not to 
              be a trouble'. All day she haunted the room, jealous of any other 
              nurse, and prouder of being chosen then than of any honor her life 
              ever brought her. Precious and helpful hours to Jo, for now her 
              heart received the teaching that it needed. Lessons in patience 
              were so sweetly taught her that she could not fail to learn them, 
              charity for all, the lovely spirit that can forgive and truly forget 
              unkindness, the loyalty to duty that makes the hardest easy, and 
              the sincere faith that fears nothing, but trusts undoubtingly. </p>
            <p>Often when she woke Jo found Beth reading in her well-worn little 
              book, heard her singing softly, to beguile the sleepless night, 
              or saw her lean her face upon her hands, while slow tears dropped 
              through the transparent fingers, and Jo would lie watching her with 
              thoughts too deep for tears, feeling that Beth, in her simple, unselfish 
              way, was trying to wean herself from the dear old life, and fit 
              herself for the life to come, by sacred words of comfort, quiet 
              prayers, and the music she loved so well. </p>
            <p>Seeing this did more for Jo than the wisest sermons, the saintliest 
              hymns, the most fervent prayers that any voice could utter. For 
              with eyes made clear by many tears, and a heart softened by the 
              tenderest sorrow, she recognized the beauty of her sister's life--uneventful, 
              unambitious, yet full of the genuine virtues which `smell sweet, 
              and blossom in the dust', the self-forgetfulness that makes the 
              humblest on earth remembered soonest in heaven, the true success 
              which is possible to all. </p>
            <p>One night when Beth looked among the books upon her table, to find 
              something to make her forget the mortal weariness that was almost 
              as hard to bear as pain, as she turned the leaves of her old favorite, 
              Pilgrims's Progress, she found a little paper, scribbled over in 
              Jo's hand. The name caught her eye and the blurred look of the lines 
              made her sure that tears had fallen on it. </p>
            <p>&quot;Poor Jo! She's fast asleep, so I won't wake her to ask leave. 
              She shows me all her things, and I don't think she'll mind if I 
              look at this&quot;, thought Beth, with a glance at her sister, who 
              lay on the rug, with the tongs beside her, ready to wake up the 
              minute the log fell apart. <br>
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>MY BETH </p>
            <p>Sitting patient in the shadow <br>
              Till the blessed light shall come, <br>
              A serene and saintly presence <br>
              Sanctifies our troubled home. <br>
              Earthly joys and hopes and sorrows <br>
              Break like ripples on the strand <br>
              Of the deep and solemn river <br>
              Where her willing feet now stand. </p>
            <p>O my sister, passing from me, <br>
              Out of human care and strife, <br>
              Leave me, as a gift, those virtues <br>
              Which have beautified your life. <br>
              Dear, bequeath me that great patience <br>
              Which has power to sustain <br>
              A cheerful, uncomplaining spirit <br>
              In its prison-house of pain. </p>
            <p>Give me, for I need it sorely, <br>
              Of that courage, wise and sweet, <br>
              Which has made the path of duty<br>
              Green beneath your willing feet. <br>
              Give me that unselfish nature, <br>
              That with charity devine <br>
              Can pardon wrong for love's dear sake-- <br>
              Meek heart, forgive me mine! </p>
            <p>Thus our parting daily loseth <br>
              Something of its bitter pain, <br>
              And while learning this hard lesson, <br>
              My great loss becomes my gain. <br>
              For the touch of grief will render <br>
              My wild nature more serene, <br>
              Give to life new aspirations, <br>
              A new trust in the unseen. </p>
            <p>Henceforth, safe across the river, <br>
              I shall see forever more <br>
              A beloved, household spirit <br>
              Waiting for me on the shore. <br>
              Hope and faith, born of my sorrow, <br>
              Guardian angels shall become, <br>
              And the sister gone before me <br>
              By their hands shall lead me home. </p>
            <p><br>
              Blurred and blotted, faulty and feeble as the lines were, they brought 
              a look of inexpressible comfort to Beth's face, for her one regret 
              had been that she had done so little, and this seemed to assure 
              her that her life had not been useless, that her death would not 
              bring the despair she feared. As she sat with the paper folded between 
              her hands, the charred log fell asunder. Jo started up, revived 
              the blaze, and crept to the bedside, hoping Beth slept. </p>
            <p>&quot;Not asleep, but so happy, dear. See, I found this and read 
              it. I knew you wouldn't care. Have I been all that to you, Jo?&quot; 
              she asked, with wistful, humble earnestness. </p>
            <p>&quot;OH, Beth, so much, so much!&quot; And Jo's head went down 
              upon the pillow beside her sister's. </p>
            <p>&quot;Then I don't feel as if I'd wasted my life. I'm not so good 
              as you make me, but I have tried to do right. And now, when it's 
              too late to begin even to do better, it's such a comfort to know 
              that someone loves me so much, and feels as if I'd helped them.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;More than any one in the world, Beth. I used to think I 
              couldn't let you go, but I'm learning to feel that I don't lose 
              you, that you'll be more to me than ever, and death can't part us, 
              though it seems to.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I know it cannot, and I don't fear it any longer, for I'm 
              sure I shall be your Beth still, to love and help you more than 
              ever. You must take my place, Jo, and be everything to Father and 
              Mother when I'm gone. They will turn to you, don't fail them, and 
              if it's hard to work alone, remember that I don't forget you, and 
              that you'll be happier in doing that than writing splendid books 
              or seeing all the world, for love is the only thing that we can 
              carry with us when we go, and it makes the go easy.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;I'll try, Beth.&quot; And then and there Jo renounced her 
              old ambition, pledged herself to a new and better one, acknowledging 
              the poverty of other desires, and feeling the blessed solace of 
              a belief in the immortality of love. </p>
            <p>So the spring days came and went , the sky grew clearer, the earth 
              greener, the flowers were up fairly early, and the birds came back 
              in time to say goodbye to Beth, who, like a tired but trustful child, 
              clung to the hands that had led her all her life, as Father and 
              Mother guided her tenderly through the Valley of the Shadow, and 
              gave her up to God. </p>
            <p>Seldom except in books do the dying utter memorable words, see 
              visions, or depart with beatified countenances, and those who have 
              sped many parting souls know that to most the end comes as naturally 
              and simply as sleep. As Beth had hoped, the `tide went out easily', 
              and in the dark hour before dawn, on the bosom where she had drawn 
              her first breath, she quietly drew her last, with no farewell but 
              one loving look, one little sigh. </p>
            <p>With tears and prayers and tender hands, Mother and sisters made 
              her ready for the long sleep that pain would never mar again, seeing 
              with grateful eyes the beautiful serenity that soon replaced the 
              pathetic patience that had wrung their hearts so long, and feeling 
              with reverent joy that to their darling death was a benignant angel, 
              not a phantom full of dread. </p>
            <p>When morning came, for the first time in many months the fire was 
              out, Jo's place was empty, and the room was very still. But a bird 
              sang blithely on a budding bough, close by, the snowdrops blossomed 
              freshly at the window, and the spring sunshine streamed in like 
              a benediction over the placid face upon the pillow, a face so full 
              of painless peace that those who loved it best smiled through their 
              tears, and thanked God that Beth was well at last. </p>

            <p> <br>
              In the cold gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp and read their 
              chapter with an earnestness never felt before. For now the shadow 
              of a real trouble had come, the little books were full of help and 
              comfort, and as they dressed, they agreed to say goodbye cheerfully 
              and hopefully, and send their mother on her anxious journey unsaddened 
              by tears or complaints from them. Everything seemed very strange 
              when they went down, so dim and still outside, so full of light 
              and bustle within. Breakfast at that early hour seemed odd, and 
              even Hannah's familiar face looked unnatural as she flew about her 
              kitchen with her nightcap on. The big trunk stood ready in the hall, 
              Mother's cloak and bonnet lay on the sofa, and Mother herself sat 
              trying to eat, but looking so pale and worn with sleeplessness and 
              anxiety that the girls found it very hard to keep their resolution. 
              Meg's eyes kept filling in spite of herself, Jo was obliged to hide 
              her face in the kitchen rollermore than once, ant the little girls 
              wore a grave, troubled expression, as if sorrow was a new experience 
              to them. </p>
            <p>Nobody talked much, but as the time drew very near and they sat 
              waiting for the carriage, Mrs. March said to the girls, who were 
              all busied about her, one folding her shawl, another smoothing out 
              the strings of her bonnet, a third putting on her overshoes, and 
              a forth fastening up her travelling bag... </p>
            <p>&quot;Children, I leave you to Hannah's care and Mr. Laurence's 
              protection. Hannah is faithfulness itself, and our good neighbor 
              will guard you as if you were his own. I have no fears for you, 
              yet I am anxious that you should take this trouble rightly. Don't 
              grieve and fret when I am gone, or think that you can be idle and 
              comfort yourselves by being idle and trying to forget. Go on with 
              your work as usual, for work is a blessed solace. Hope and keep 
              busy, and whatever happens, remember that you never can be fatherless.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Yes, Mother.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Meg, dear, be prudent, watch over your sisters, consult Hannah, 
              and in any perplexity, go to Mr. Laurence. Be patient, Jo, don't 
              get despondent or do rash things, write to me often, and be my brave 
              girl, ready to help and cheer all. Beth, comfort yourself with your 
              music, and be faithful to the little home duties, and You Amy, help 
              all you can, be obedient, and keep happy safe at home.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;We will, Mother! We will!&quot; </p>
            <p>The rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and listen. 
              That was the hard minute, but the girls stood it well. No one cried, 
              no one ran away or uttered a lamentation, though their hearts were 
              very heavy as they sent loving messages to Father, remembering, 
              as they spoke that it might be too late to deliver them. They kissed 
              their mother quietly, clung about her tenderly, and tried to wave 
              their hands cheerfully when she drove away. </p>
            <p>Laurie and his grandfather came over to see her off, and Mr. Brooke 
              looked so strong and sensible and kind that the girls christened 
              him `Mr. Greatheart' on the spot. </p>
            <p>&quot;Goodby, my darlings! God bless and keep us all!&quot; whispered 
              Mrs. March, as she kissed one dear little face after the other, 
              and hurried into the carriage. </p>
            <p>As she rolled away, the sun came out, and looking back, she saw 
              it shining on the group at the gate like a good omen. They saw it 
              also, and smiled and waved their hands, and the last thing she beheld 
              as she turned the corner was the four bright faces, and behind them 
              like a bodyguard, old Mr. Laurence, faithful Hannah, and devoted 
              Laurie. </p>
            <p>&quot;How kind everyone is to us!&quot; she said, turning to find 
              fresh proof of it in the respectful sympathy of the young man's 
              face. </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't see how they can help it,&quot; returned Mr. Brooke, 
              laughing so infectiously that Mrs. March could not help smiling. 
              And so the journey began with the good omens of sunshine, smiles, 
              and cheerful words. </p>
            <p>&quot;I feel as if there had been an earthquake,&quot; said Jo, 
              as their neighbors went home to breakfast, leaving them to rest 
              and refresh themselves. </p>
            <p>&quot;It seems as if half the house was gone,&quot; added Meg forlornly. 
            </p>
            <p>Beth opened her lips to say something, but could only point to 
              the pile of nicely mended hose which lay on Mother's table, showing 
              that even in her last hurried moments she had thought and worked 
              for them. It was a little thing, but it went straight to their hearts, 
              and in spite of their brave resolutions, they all broke down and 
              cried bitterly. </p>
            <p>Hannah wisely allowed them to relieve their feelings, and when 
              the shower showed signs of clearing up, she came to the rescue, 
              armed with a coffeepot. </p>
            <p>&quot;Now, ny dear young ladies, remember what your ma said, and 
              don't fret. Come and have a cup of coffee all round, and then let's 
              fall to work and be a credit to the family.&quot; </p>
            <p>Coffee was a treat, and Hannah showed great tact in making it that 
              morning. No one could resist her persuasive nods, or the fragrant 
              invitation issuing from the nose of the coffee pot. They drew up 
              to the table, exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins, and in 
              ten minutes were all right again. </p>
            <p>&quot;`Hope and keep busy', that's the motto for us, so let's see 
              who will remember it best. I shall go to Aunt March, as usual. Oh, 
              won't she lecture though!&quot; said Jo, as she sipped with returning 
              spirit. </p>
            <p>&quot;I shall go to my Kings, though I'd much rather stay at home 
              and attend to things here,&quot; said Meg, wishing she hadn't made 
              her eyes so red. </p>
            <p>&quot;No need of that. Beth and I can keep house perfectly well,&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>put in Amy, with an important air. </p>
            <p>&quot;Hannah will tell us what to do, and we'll have everything 
              nice when you come home,&quot; added Beth, getting out her mop and 
              dish tub without delay. </p>
            <p>&quot;I think anxiety is very interesting,&quot; observed Amy, 
              eating sugar pensively. </p>
            <p>The girls couldn't help laughing, and felt better for it, though 
              Meg shook her head at the young lady who could find consolation 
              in a sugar bowl. </p>
            <p>The sight of the turnovers made Jo sober again, and when the two 
              went out to their daily tasks, they looked sorrowfully back at the 
              window where they were accustomed to see their mother's face. It 
              was gone, but Beth had remembered the little household ceremony, 
              and there she was, nodding away at them like a rosyfaced mandarin. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;That's so like my Beth!&quot; said Jo, waving her hat, with 
              a grateful face. &quot;Goodbye, Meggy, I hope the Kings won't strain 
              today. Don't fret about Father, dear,&quot; she added, as they parted. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;And I hope Aunt March won't croak. Your hair is becoming, 
              and it looks very boyish and nice,&quot; returned Meg, trying not 
              to smile at the curly head, which looked comically small on her 
              tall sister's shoulders. </p>
            <p>&quot;That's my only comfort.&quot; And, touching her hat a` la 
              Laurie, away went Jo, feeling like a shorn sheep on a wintry day. 
            </p>
            <p>News from their father comforted the girls very much, for though 
              dangerously ill, the presence of the best and tenderest of nurses 
              had already done him good. Mr. Brooke sent a bulletin every day, 
              and as the head of the family, Meg insisted on reading the dispatches, 
              which grew more cheerful as the week passed. At first, everyone 
              was eager to write, and plump envelopes were carefully </p>
            <p>poked into the letter box by one or other of the sisters, who felt 
              rather important with their Washington correspondence. As one of 
              these packets contained characteristic notes from the party, we 
              will rob an imaginary mail, and read them. </p>
            <p><br>
              My dearest Mother: </p>
            <p>It is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made us, 
              for the news was so good we couldn't help laughing and crying over 
              it. How very kind Mr. Brooke is, and how fortunate that Mr. Laurence's 
              business detains him near you so long, since he is so useful to 
              you and Father. The girls are all as good as gold. Jo helps me with 
              the sewing, and insists on doing all sorts of hard jobs. I should 
              be afraid she might overdo, if I didn't know her `moral fit' wouldn't 
              last long. Beth is as regular about her tasks as a clock, and never 
              forgets what you told her. She grieves about Father, and looks sober 
              except when she is at her little piano. Amy minds me nicely, and 
              I take great care of her. She does her ownhair, and I am teaching 
              her to make buttonholes and mend her stockings. </p>
            <p>She tries very hard, and I know you will be pleased with her improvement 
              when you come. Mr. Laurence watches over us like a motherly old 
              hen, as Jo says, and Laurie is very kind and neighborly. He and 
              Jo keep us merry, for we get pretty blue sometimes, and feel like 
              orphans, with you so far away. Hannah is a perfect saint. She does 
              not scold at all, and always calls me Miss Margaret, which is quite 
              proper, you know, and treats me with respect. We are all well and 
              busy, but we long, day and night, to have you back. Give my dearest 
              love to Father, and believe me, ever your own... </p>
            <p><br>
              MEG </p>
            <p><br>
              This note, prettily written on scented paper, was a great contrast 
              to the next, which was scribbled on a big sheet of thin foreign 
              paper, ornamented with blots and all manner of flourishes and curly-tailed 
              letters. </p>
            <p><br>
              My precious Marmee: </p>
            <p>Three cheers for dear Father! Brooke was a trump to telegraph right 
              off, and let us know the minute he was better. I rushed up garret 
              when the letter came, and tried to thank god for being so good to 
              us, but I could only cry, and say, &quot;I'm glad! I'm glad!&quot; 
              Didn't that do as well as a regular prayer? For I felt a great many 
              in my heart. We have such funny times, and now I can enjoy them, 
              for everyone is so desperately good, it's like living in a nest 
              of turtledoves. You'd laugh to see Meg head the table and try to 
              be motherish. She gets prettier every day, and I'm in love with 
              her sometimes. The children are regular archangels, and I-- well, 
              I'm Jo, and never shall be anything else. Oh, I must tell you that 
              I came near having a quarrel with Laurie. I freed my mind about 
              a silly little thing, and he was offended. I was right, but didn't 
              speak as I ought, and he marched home, saying he wouldn't come again 
              till I begged pardon. I declared I wouldn't and got mad.</p>
            <p>It lasted all day. I felt bad and wanted you very much. Laurie 
              and I are both so proud, it's hard to beg pardon. But I thought 
              he'd come to it, for I was in the right. He didn't come, and just 
              at night I remembered what you said when Amy fell into the river. 
              I read my little book, felt better, resolved not to let the sun 
              set on my anger, and ran over to tell Laurie I was sorry. I met 
              him at the gate, coming for the same thing. We both laughed, begged 
              each other's pardon, and felt all good and comfortable again. </p>
            <p>I made a `pome' yesterday, when I was helping Hannah wash, and 
              as Father likes my silly little things, I put it in to amuse him. 
              Give him my lovingest hug that ever was, and kiss yourself a dozen 
              times for your... <br>
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>TOPSY-TURVY JO </p>
            <p>A SONG FROM THE SUDS </p>
            <p>Queen of my tub, I merrily sing, <br>
              While the white foam rises high, <br>
              And sturdily wash and rinse and wring, <br>
              And fasten the clothes to dry. <br>
              Then out in the free fresh air they swing, <br>
              Under the sunny sky. </p>
            <p>I wish we could wash from out hearts and souls <br>
              The stains of the week away, <br>
              And let water and air by their magic make <br>
              Ourselves as pure as they. <br>
              Then on the earth there would be indeed, <br>
              A glorious washing day! </p>
            <p>Along the path of a useful life, <br>
              Will heartsease ever bloom. <br>
              The busy mind has no time to think <br>
              Of sorrow or care or gloom. <br>
              And anxious thoughts may be swept away, <br>
              As we bravely wield a broom. </p>
            <p>I am glad a task to me is given, <br>
              To labor at day by day, <br>
              For it brings me health and strength and hope, <br>
              And I cheerfully learn to say,<br>
              &quot;Head, you may think, Heart, you may feel, <br>
              But, Hand, you shall work alway!&quot; </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Dear Mother, </p>
            <p>There is only room for me to send my love, and some pressed pansies 
              from the root I have been keeping safe in the house for Father to 
              see. I read every morning, try to be good all day, and sing myself 
              to sleep with Father's tune. I can't sing `LAND OF THE LEAL' now, 
              it makes me cry. Everyone is very kind, and we are as happy as we 
              can be without you. Amy wants the rest of the page, so I must stop. 
              I didn't forget to cover the holders, and I wind the clock and air 
              the rooms every day. </p>
            <p>Kiss dear Father on the cheek he calls mine. Oh, do come soon to 
              your loving . .. <br>
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>LITTLE BETH <br>
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Ma Chere Mamma, </p>
            <p>We are all well I do my lessons always and never corroberate the 
              girls--Meg says I mean contradick so I put in both words and you 
              can take the properest. Meg is a great comfort to me and lets me 
              have jelly every night at tea its so good for me Jo says because 
              it keeps me sweet tempered. Laurie is not as respeckful as he ought 
              to be now I am almost in my teens, he calls me Chick and hurts my 
              feelings by talking French to me very fast when I say Merci or Bon 
              jour as Hattie King does. The sleeves of my blue dress were all 
              worn out, and Meg put in new ones, but the full front came wrong 
              and they are more blue than the dress. I felt bad but did not fret 
              I bear my troubles well but I do wish Hannah would put more starch 
              in my aprons and have buckwheats every day. Can't she? Didn't I 
              make that interrigation point nice? Meg says my punchtuation and 
              spelling are disgraceful and I am mortyfied but dear me I have so 
              many things to do, I can't stop. Adieu, I send heaps of love to 
              Papa. Your affectionate daughter . .. <br>

            <p>Dear Mis March, </p>
            <p>I jes drop a line to say we git on fust rate. The girls is clever 
              and fly round right smart. Miss Meg is going to make a proper good 
              housekeeper. She hes the liking for it, and gits the hang of things 
              surprisin quick. Jo doos beat all for goin ahead, but she don't 
              stop to cal'k'late fust, and you never know where she's like to 
              bring up. She done out a tub of clothes on Monday, but she starched 
              'em afore they was wrenched, and blued a pink calico dress till 
              I thought I should a died a laughin. Beth is the best of little 
              creeters, and a sight of help to me, bein so forehanded and dependable. 
              She tries to learn everything, and really goes to market beyond 
              her years, likewise keeps accounts, with my help, quite wonderful. 
              We have got on very economical so fur. I don't let the girls hev 
              coffee only once a week, accordin to your wish, and keep em on plain 
              wholesome vittles. Amy does well without frettin, wearin her best 
              clothes and eatin sweet stuff. Mr. Laurie is as full of didoes as 
              usual, and turns the house upside down frequent, but he heartens 
              the girls, so I let em hev full swing. The old gentleman send heaps 
              of things, and is rather wearin, but means wal, and it aint my place 
              to say nothin. My bread is riz, so no more at this time. I send 
              my duty to Mr. March, and hope he's seen the last of his Pewmonia. 
            </p>
            <p>Yours respectful, </p>

            <p>All serene on the Rappahannock, troops in fine condition, commisary 
              department well conducted, the Home Guard under Colonel Teddy always 
              on duty, Commander in Chief General Laurence reviews the army daily, 
              Quartermaster Mullet keeps order in camp, and Major Lion does picket 
              duty at night. A salute of twenty-four guns was fired on reciept 
              of good news from Washington, and a dress parade took place at headquarters. 
              Commander in chief sends best wishes, in which he is heartily joined 
              by... </p>

              Dear Madam: </p>

              fine weather holds. Pray make Brooke useful, and draw on me for 
              funds if expenses exceed your estimate. Don't let your husband want

              <br>
              It was easy to promise self-abnegation when self was wrapped up 
              in another, and heart and soul were purified by a sweet example. 
              But when the helpful voice was silent, the daily lesson over, the 
              beloved presence gone, and nothing remained but lonliness and grief, 
              then Jo found her promise very hard to keep. How could she `comfort 
              Father and Mother' when her own heart ached with a ceaseless longing 
              for her sister, how could she `make the house cheerful' when all 
              its light and warmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when 
              Beth left the old home for the new, and where in all the world could 
              she `find some useful, happy work to do', that would take the place 
              of the loving service which had been its own reward? She tried in 
              a blind, hopeless way to do her duty, secretly rebelling against 
              it all the while, for it seemed unjust that her few joys should 
              be lessened, her burdens made heavier, and life get harder and harder 
              as she toiled along. Some people seemed to get all sunshine, and 
              some all shadow. It was not fair, for she tried more than Amy to 
              be good, but never got any reward, only disappointment, trouble 
              and hard work. </p>
            <p>Poor Jo, these were dark days to her, for something like despair 
              came over her when she thought of spending all her life in that 
              quiet house, devoted to humdrum cares, a few small pleasures, and 
              the duty that never seemed to grow any easier. &quot;I can't do 
              it. I wasn't meant for a life like this, and I know I shall break 
              away and do something desperate if somebody doesn't come and help 
              me,&quot; she said to herself, when her first efforts failed and 
              she fell into the moody, miserable state of mind which often comes 
              when strong wills have to yield to the inevitable. </p>
            <p>But someone did come and help her, though Jo did not recognize 
              her good angels at once because they wore familiar shapes and used 
              the simple spells best fitted to poor humanity. Often she started 
              up at night, thinking Beth called her, and when the sight of the 
              little empty bed made her cry with the bitter cry of unsubmissive 
              sorrow, &quot;Oh, Beth, come back! Come back!&quot; she did not 
              stretch out her yearning arms in vain. For, as quick to hear her 
              sobbing as she had been to hear her sister's faintest whisper, her 
              mother came to comfort her, not with words only, but the patient 
              tenderness that soothes by a touch, tears that were mute reminders 
              of a greater grief than Jo's, and broken whispers, more eloquent 
              than prayers, because hopeful resignation went hand-in-hand with 
              natural sorrow. Sacred moments, when heart talked to heart in the 
              silence of the night, turning affliction to a blessing, which chastened 
              grief and strengthned love. Feeling this, Jo's burden seemed easier 
              to bear, duty grew sweeter, and life looked more endurable, seen 
              from the safe shelter of her mother's arms. </p>
            <p>When aching heart was a little comforted, troubled mind likewise 
              found help, for one day she went to the study, and leaning over 
              the good gray head lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile, 
              she said very humbly, &quot;Father, talk to me as you did to Beth. 
              I need it more than she did, for I'm all wrong.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;My dear, nothing can comfort me like this,&quot; he answered, 
              with a falter in his voice, and both arms round her, as if he too, 
              needed help, and did not fear to ask for it. </p>
            <p>Then, sitting in Beth's little chair close beside him, Jo told 
              her troubles, the resentful sorrow for her loss, the fruitless efforts 
              that discouraged her, the want of faith that made life look so dark, 
              and all the sad bewilderment which we call despair. She gave him 
              entire confidence, he gave her the help she needed, and both found 
              consolation in the act. For the time had come when they could talk 
              together not only as father and daughter, but as man and woman, 
              able and glad to serve each other with mutual sympathy as well as 
              mutual love. Happy, thoughtful times there in the old study which 
              Jo called `the church of one member', and from which she came with 
              fresh courage, recovered cheerfulness, and a more submissive spirit. 
              For the parents who had taught one child to meet death without fear, 
              were trying now to teach another to accept life without despondency 
              or distrust, and to use its beautiful opportunities with gratitude 
              and power. </p>
            <p>Other helps had Jo--humble, wholesome duties and delights that 
              would not be denied their part in serving her, and which she slowly 
              learned to see and value. Brooms and dishcloths never could be as 
              distasteful as they once had been, for Beth had presided over both, 
              and something of her housewifely spirit seemed to linger around 
              the little mop and the old brush, never thrown away. As she used 
              them, Jo found herself humming the songs Beth used to hum, imitating 
              Beth's orderly ways, and giving the little touches here and there 
              that kept everything fresh and cozy, which was the first step toward 
              making home happy, though she didn't know it till Hannah said with 
              an approving squeeze of the hand... </p>
            <p>&quot;You thoughtful creeter, you're determined we shan't miss 
              that dear lamb ef you can help it. We don't say much, but we see 
              it, and the Lord will bless you for't, see ef He don't.&quot; </p>
            <p>As they sat sewing together, Jo discovered how much improved her 
              sister Meg was, how well she could talk, how much she knew about 
              good, womanly impulses, thoughts, and feelings, how happy she was 
              in husband and children, and how much they were all doing for each 
              other. </p>
            <p>&quot;Marriage is an excellent thing, after all. I wonder if I 
              should blossom out half as well as you have, if I tried it?&quot; 
              said Jo, as she constructed a kite for Demi in the topsy-turvy nursery. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;It's just what you need to bring out the tender womanly 
              half of your nature, Jo. You are like a chestnut burr, prickly outside, 
              but silky-soft within, and a sweet kernal, if one can only get at 
              it. Love will make you show your heart one day, and then the rough 
              burr will fall off.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Frost opens chestnut burrs, ma`am, and it takes a good shake 
              to bring them down. Boys go nutting, and I don't care to be bagged 
              by them,&quot; returned Jo, pasting away at the kite which no wind 
              that blows would ever carry up, for Daisy had tied herself on as 
              a bob. </p>
            <p>Meg laughed, for she was glad to see a glimmer of Jo's old spirit, 
              but she felt it her duty to enforce her opinion by every argument 
              in her power, and the sisterly chats were not wasted, especially 
              as two of Meg's most effective arguments were the babies, whom Jo 
              loved tenderly. Grief is the best opener of some hearts, and Jo's 
              was nearly ready for the bag. A little more sunshine to ripen the 
              nut, then, not a boy's impatient shake, but a man's hand reached 
              up to pick it gently from the burr, and find the kernal sound and 
              sweet. If she suspected this, she would have shut up tight, and 
              been more prickly than ever, fortunately she wasn't thinking about 
              herself, so when the time came, down she dropped. </p>
            <p>Now, if she had been the heroine of a moral storybook, she ought 
              at this period of her life to have become quite saintly, renounced 
              the world, and gone about doing good in a mortified bonnet, with 
              tracts in her pocket. But, you see, Jo wasn't a heroine, she was 
              only a struggling human girl like hundreds of others, and she just 
              acted out her nature, being sad, cross, listless, or energetic, 
              as the mood suggested. It's highly virtuous to say we'll be good, 
              but we can't do it all at once, and it takes a long pull, a strong 
              pull, and a pull all together before some of us even get our feet 
              set in the right way. Jo had got so far, she was learning to do 
              her duty, and to feel unhappy if she did not, but to do it cheerfully, 
              ah, that was another thing! She had often said she wanted to do 
              something splendid, no matter how hard, and now she had her wish, 
              for what could be more beautiful than to devote her life to Father 
              and Mother, trying to make home as happy to them as they had to 
              her? And if difficulties were necessary to increase the splendor 
              of the effort, what could be harder for a restless, ambitious girl 
              than to give up her own hopes, plans, and desires, and cheerfully 
              live for others? </p>
            <p>Providence had taken her at her word. Here was the task, not what 
              she had expected, but better because self had no part in it. Now, 
              could she do it? She decided that she would try, and in her first 
              attempt she found the helps I have suggested. Still another was 
              given her, and she took it, not as a reward, but as a comfort, as 
              Christian took the refreshment afforded by the little arbor where 
              he rested, as he climbed the hill called Difficulty. </p>
            <p>&quot;Why don't you write? That always used to make you happy,&quot; 
              said her mother once, when the desponding fit over-shadowed Jo. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;I've no heart to write, and if I had, nobody cares for my 
              things.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;We do. Write something for us, and never mind the rest of 
              the world. Try it, dear. I'm sure it would do you good, and please 
              us very much.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't believe I can.&quot; But Jo got out her desk and began 
              to overhaul her half-finished manuscripts. </p>
            <p>An hour afterward her mother peeped in and there she was, scratching 
              away, with her black pinafore on, and an absorbed expression, which 
              caused Mrs. March to smile and slip away, well pleased with the 
              success of her suggestion. Jo never knew how it happened, but something 
              got into that story that went straight to the hearts of those who 
              read it, for when her family had laughed and cried over it, her 
              father sent it, much against her will, to one of the popular magazines, 
              and to her utter surprise, it was not only paid for, but others 
              requested. Letters from several persons, whose praise was honor, 
              followed the appearance of the little story, newspapers copied it, 
              and strangers as well as friends, admired it. For a small thing 
              it was a great success, and Jo was more astonished than when her 
              novel was commended and condemned all at once. </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't understand it. What can there be in a simple little 
              story like that to make people praise it so?&quot; she said, quite 
              bewildered. </p>
            <p>&quot;There is truth in it, Jo, that's the secret. Humor and pathos 
              make it alive, and you have found your style at last. You wrote 
              with not thoughts of fame and money, and put your heart into it, 
              my daughter. You have had the bitter, now comes the sweet. Do your 
              best, and grow as happy as we are in your success.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;If there is anything good or true in what I write, it isn't 
              mine. I owe it all to you and Mother and Beth,&quot; said Jo, more 
              touched by her father's words than by any amount of praise from 
              the world. </p>
            <p>So taught by love and sorrow, Jo wrote her little stories, and 
              sent them away to make friends for themselves and her, finding it 
              a very charitable world to such humble wanderers, for they were 
              kindly welcomed, and sent home comfortable tokens to their mother, 
              like dutiful children whom good fortune overtakes. </p>
            <p>When Amy and Laurie wrote of their engagement, Mrs. March feared 
              that Jo would find it difficult to rejoice over it, but her fears 
              were soon set at rest, for thought Jo looked grave at first, she 
              took it very quietly, and was full of hopes and plans for `the children' 
              before she read the letter twice. It was a sort of written duet, 
              wherein each glorified the other in loverlike fashion, very pleasant 
              to read and satisfactory to think of, for no one had any objection 
              to make. </p>
            <p>&quot;You like it, Mother?&quot; said Jo, as they laid down the 
              closely written sheets and looked at one another. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, I hoped it would be so, ever since Amy wrote that she 
              had refused Fred. I felt sure then that something better than what 
              you call the `mercenary spirit' had come over her, and a hint here 
              and there in her letters made me suspect that love and Laurie would 
              win the day.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;How sharp you are, Marmee, and how silent! You never said 
              a worked to me.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Mothers have need of sharp eyes and discreet tongues when 
              they have girls to manage. I was half afraid to put the idea into 
              your head, lest you should write and congratulate them before the 
              thing was settled.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm not the scatterbrain I was. You may trust me. I'm sober 
              and sensible enough for anyone's confidante now.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;So you are, my dear, and I should have made you mine, only 
              I fancied it might pain you to learn that your Teddy loved someone 
              else.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Now, Mother, did you really think I could be so silly and 
              selfish, after I'd refused his love, when it was freshest, if not 
              best?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I knew you were sincere then, Jo, but lately I have thought 
              that if he came back, and asked again, you might perhaps, feel like 
              giving another answer. Forgive me, dear, I can't help seeing that 
              you are very lonely, and sometimes there is a hungry look in your 
              eyes that goes to my heart. So I fancied that your boy might fill 
              the empty place if he tried now.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;No, Mother, it is better as it ia, and I'm glad Amy has learned 
              to love him. But you are right in one thing. I am lonely, and perhaps 
              if Teddy had tried again, I might have said `Yes', not because I 
              love him any more, but because I care more to be loved than when 
              he went away.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm glad of that, Jo, for it shows that you are getting on. 
              There are plenty to love you, so try to be satisfied with Father 
              and Mother, sisters and brothers, friends and babies, till the best 
              lover of all comes to give you your reward.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Mothers are the best lovers in the world, but I don't mind 
              whispering to Marmee that I'd like to try all kinds. It's very curious, 
              but the more I try to satisfy myself with all sorts of natural affections, 
              the more I seem to want. I'd no idea hearts could take in so many. 
              Mine is so elastic, it never seems full now, and I used to be quite 
              contented with my family. I don't understand it.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I do.&quot; And Mrs. March smiled her wise smile, as Jo turned 
              back the leaves to read what Amy said of Laurie. </p>
            <p>&quot;It is so beautiful to be loved as Laurie loves me. He isn't 
              sentimental, doesn't say much about it, but I see and feel it in 
              all he says and does, and it makes me so happy and so humble that 
              I don't seem to be the same girl I was. I never knew how good and 
              generous and tender he was till now, for he lets me read his heart, 
              and I find it full of noble impulses and hopes and purposes, and 
              am so proud to know it's mine. He says he feels as if he `could 
              make a prosperous voyage now with me aboard as mate, and lots of 
              love for ballast'. I pray he may, and try to be all he believes 
              me, for I love my gallant captain with all my heart and soul and 
              might, and never will desert him, while God lets us be together. 
              Oh, Mother, I never knew how much like heaven this world could be, 
              when two people love and live for one another!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;And that's our cool, reserved, and worldly Amy! Truly, love 
              does work miracles. How very, very happy they must be!&quot; And 
              Jo laid the rustling sheets together with a careful hand, as one 
              might shut the covers of a lovely romance, which holds the reader 
              fast till the end comes, and he finds himself alone in the workaday 
              world again. </p>
            <p>By-and-by Jo roamed away upstairs, for it was rainy, and she could 
              not walk. A restless spirit possessed her, and the old feeling came 
              again, not bitter as it once was, but a sorrowfully patient wonder 
              why one sister should have all she asked, the other nothing. It 
              was not true, she knew that and tried to put it away, but the natural 
              craving for affection was strong, and Amy's happiness woke the hungry 
              longing for someone to `love with heart and soul, and cling to while 
              God let them be together'. Up in the garret, where Jo's unquiet 
              wanderings ended stood four little wooden chests in a row, each 
              marked with its owners name, and each filled with relics of the 
              childhood and girlhood ended now for all. Jo glanced into them, 
              and when she came to her own, leaned her chin on the edge, and stared 
              absently at the chaotic collection, till a bundle of old exercise 
              books caught her eye. She drew them out, turned them over, and relived 
              that pleasant winter at kind Mrs. Kirke's. She had smiled at first, 
              then she looked thoughtful, next sad, and when she came to a little 
              message written in the Professor's hand, her lips began to tremble, 
              the books slid out of her lap, and she sat looking at the friendly 
              words, as they took a new meaning, and touched a tender spot in 
              her heart. </p>
            <p>&quot;Wait for me, my friend. I may be a little late, but I shall 
              surely come.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, if he only would! So kine, so good, so patient with me 
              always, my dear old Fritz. I didn't value him half enough when I 
              had him, but now how I should love to see him, for everyone seems 
              going away from me, and I'm all alone.&quot; </p>
            <p>And holding the little paper fast, as if it were a promise yet 
              to be fulfilled, Jo laid her head down on a comfortable rag bag, 
              and cried, as if in opposition to the rain pattering on the roof. 
            </p>
            <p>Was it all self-pity, loneliness, or low spirits? Or was it the 
              waking up of a sentiment which had bided its time as patiently as 
              its inspirer? Who shall say? </p>

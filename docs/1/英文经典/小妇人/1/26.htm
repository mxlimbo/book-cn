            <p> <br>
              It takes people a long time to learn the difference between talent 
              and genius, especially ambitious young men and women. Amy was learning 
              this distinction through much tribulation, for mistaking enthusiasm 
              for inspiration, she attempted every branch of art with youthful 
              audacity. For a long time there was a lull in the `mud-pie' business, 
              and she devoted herself to the finest pen-and-ink drawing, in which 
              she showed such taste and skill that her graceful handiwork proved 
              both pleasant and profitable. But over-strained eyes caused pen 
              and ink to be laid aside for a bold attempt at poker sketching. 
            </p>
            <p>While this attack lasted, the family lived in constant fear of 
              a conflagration, for the odor of burning wood pervaded the house 
              at all hours, smoke issued from attic and shed with alarming frequency, 
              red-hot pokers lay about promiscuously, and Hannah never went to 
              bed without a pail of water and the dinner bell at her door in case 
              of fire. Raphael's face was found boldly executed on the underside 
              of the moulding board, and Bacchus on the head of a beer barrel. 
              A chanting cherub adorned the cover of the sugar bucket, and attempts 
              to portray Romeo and Juliet supplied kindling for some time. </p>
            <p>From fire to oil was a natural transition for burned fingers, and 
              Amy fell to painting with undiminished ardor. An artist friend fitted 
              her out with his castoff palettes, brushes, and colors, and she 
              daubed away, producing pastoral and marine views such as were never 
              seen on land or sea. Her monstrosities in the way of cattle would 
              have taken prizes at an agricultural fair, and the perilous pitching 
              of her vessels would have produced seasickness in the most nautical 
              observer, if the utter disregard to all known rules of shipbuilding 
              and rigging had not convulsed him with laughter at the first glance. 
              Swarthy boys and dark-eyed Madonnas, staring at you from one corner 
              of the studio, suggested Murillo. Oily brown shadows of faces with 
              a lurid streak in the wrong place, meant Rembrandt. Buxom ladies 
              and dropiscal infants, Rubens, and Turner appeared in tempests of 
              blue thunder, orange lightning, brown rain, and purple clouds, with 
              a tomato-colored splash in the middle, which might be the sun or 
              a bouy, a sailor's shirt or a king's robe, as the spectator pleased. 
            </p>
            <p>Charcoal portraits came next, and the entire family hung in a row, 
              looking as wild and crocky as if just evoked from a coalbin. Softened 
              into crayon sketches, they did better, for the likenesses were good, 
              and Amy's hair, Jo's nose, Meg's mouth, and Laurie's eyes were pronounced 
              `wonderfully fine'. A return to clay and plaster followed, and ghostly 
              casts of her acquaintances haunted corners of the house, or tumbled 
              off closet shelves onto people's heads. Children were enticed in 
              as models, till their incoherent accounts of her mysterious doings 
              caused Miss Amy to be regarded in the light of a young ogress. Her 
              efforts in this line, however, were brought to an abrupt close by 
              an untoward accident, which quenched her ardor. Other models failing 
              her for a time, she undertook to cast her own pretty foot, and the 
              family were one day alarmed by an unearthly bumping and screaming 
              and running to the rescue, found the young enthusiast hopping wildly 
              about the shed with her foot held fast in a pan full of plaster, 
              which had hardened with unexpected rapidity. With much difficulty 
              and some danger she was dug out, for Jo was so overcome with laughter 
              while she excavated that her knife went too far, cut the poor foot, 
              and left a lasting memorial of one artistic attempt, at least. </p>
            <p>After this Amy subsided, till a mania for sketching from nature 
              set her to haunting river, field, and wood, for picturesque studies, 
              and sighing for ruins to copy. She caught endless colds sitting 
              on damp grass to book `delicious bit', composed of a stone, a stump, 
              one mushroom, and a broken mullein stalk, or `a heavenly mass of 
              clouds', that looked like a choice display of featherbeds when done. 
              She sacrificed her complexion floating on the river in the midsummer 
              sun to study light and shade, and got a wrinkle over her nose trying 
              after `points of sight', or whatever the squint-and-string performance 
              is called. </p>
            <p>If `genius is eternal patience', as Michelangelo affirms, Amy had 
              some claim to the divine attribute, for she persevered in spite 
              of all obstacles, failures, and discouragements, firmly believing 
              that in time she should do something worthy to be called `high art'. 
            </p>
            <p>She was learning, doing, and enjoying other things, meanwhile, 
              for she had resolved to be an attractive and accomplished woman, 
              even if she never became a great artist. Here she succeeded better, 
              for she was one of those happily created beings who please without 
              effort, make friends everywhere, and take life so gracefully and 
              easily that less fortunate souls are tempted to believe that such 
              are born under a lucky star. Everybody liked her, for among her 
              good gifts was tact. She had an instinctive sense of what was pleasing 
              and proper, always said the right thing to the right person, did 
              just what suited the time and place, and was so self-possessed that 
              her sisters used to say, &quot;If Amy went to court without any 
              rehearsal beforehand, she'd know exactly what to do.&quot; </p>
            <p>One of her weaknesses was a desire to move in `our best society', 
              without being quite sure what the best really was. Money, position, 
              fashionable accomplishments, and elegant manners were most desirable 
              things in her eyes, and she liked to associate with those who possessed 
              them, often mistaking the false for the true, and admiring what 
              was not admirable. Never forgetting that by birth she was a gentlewoman, 
              she cultivated her aristocratic tastes and feelings, so that when 
              the opportunity came she might be ready to take the place from which 
              poverty now excluded her. </p>
            <p>&quot;My lady,&quot; as her friends called her, sincerely desired 
              to be a genuine lady, and was so at heart, but had yet to learn 
              that money cannot buy refinement of nature, that rank does not always 
              confer nobility, and that true breeding makes itself felt in spite 
              of external drawbacks. </p>
            <p>&quot;I want to ask a favor of you, Mamma,&quot; Amy said, coming 
              in with an important air one day. </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, little girl, what is it?&quot; replied her mother, 
              in whose eyes the stately young lady still remained `the baby'. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Our drawing class breaks up next week, and before the girls 
              separate for the summer, I want to ask them out here for a day. 
              They are wild to see the river, sketch the broken bridge, and copy 
              some of the things they admire in my book. They have been very kind 
              to me in many ways, and I am grateful, for they are all rich and 
              I know I am poor, yet they never made any difference.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Why should they?&quot; And Mrs. March put the question with 
              what the girls called her `Maria Theresa air'. </p>
            <p>&quot;You know as well as I that it does make a difference with 
              nearly everyone, so don't ruffle up like a dear, motherly hen, when 
              your chickens get pecked by smarter birds. The ugly duckling turned 
              out a swan, you know.&quot; And Amy smiled without bitterness, for 
              she possessed a happy temper and hopeful spirit. </p>
            <p>Mrs. March laughed, and smoothed down her maternal pride as she 
              asked, &quot;Well, my swan, what is your plan?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I should like to ask the girls out to lunch next week, to 
              take them for a drive to the places they want to see, a row on the 
              river, perhaps, and make a little artistic fete for them.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;That looks feasible. What do you want for lunch? Cake, sandwiches, 
              fruit, and coffee will be all that is necessary, I suppose?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, dear, no! We must have cold tongue and chicken, French 
              chocolate and ice cream, besides. The girls are used to such things, 
              and I want my lunch to be proper and elegant, though I do work for 
              my living.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;How many young ladies are there?&quot; asked her mother, 
              beginning to look sober. </p>
            <p>&quot;Twelve or fourteen in the class, but I dare say they won't 
              all come.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Bless me, child, you will have to charter an omnibus to carry 
              them about.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Why, Mother, how can you think of such a thing? Not more 
              than six or eight will probably come, so I shall hire a beach wagon 
              and borrow Mr. Laurence's cherry-bounce.&quot; (Hannah's pronunciation 
              of charabanc.) </p>
            <p>&quot;All of this will be expensive, Amy.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Not very. I've calculated the cost, and I'll pay for it myself.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Don't you think, dear, that as these girls are used to such 
              things, and the best we can do will be nothing new, that some simpler 
              plan would be pleasanter to them, as a change if nothing more, and 
              much better for us than buying or borrowing what we don't need, 
              and attempting a style not in keeping with our circumstances?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;If I can't have it as I like, I don't care to have it at 
              all. I know that I can carry it out perfectly well, if you and the 
              girls will help a little, and I don't see why I can't if I'm willing 
              to pay for it,&quot; said Amy, with the decision which opposition 
              was apt to change into obstinacy. </p>
            <p>Mrs. March knew that experience was an excellent teacher, and when 
              it was possible she left her children to learn alone the lessons 
              which she would gladly have made easier, if they had not objected 
              to taking advice as much as they did salts and senna. </p>
            <p>&quot;Very well, Amy, if your heart is set upon it, and you see 
              your way through without too great an outlay of money, time, and 
              temper, I'll say no more. Talk it over with the girls, and whichever 
              way you decide, I'll do my best to help you.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Thanks, Mother, you are always so kind.&quot; And away went 
              Amy to lay her plan before her sisters. Meg agreed at once, and 
              promised to her aid, gladly offering anything she possessed, from 
              her little house itself to her very best saltspoons. But Jo frowned 
              upon the whole project and would have nothing to do with it at first. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Why in the world should you spend your money, worry your 
              family, and turn the house upside down for a parcel of girls who 
              don't care a sixpence for you? I thought you had too much pride 
              and sense to truckle to any mortal woman just because she wears 
              French boots and rides in a coupe,&quot; said Jo, who, being called 
              from the tragic climax of her novel, was not in the best mood for 
              social enterprises. </p>
            <p> &quot;I don't truckle, and I hate being patronized as much as 
              you do!&quot; returned Amy indignantly, for the two still jangled 
              when such questions arose. &quot;The girls do care for me, and I 
              for them, and there's a great deal of kindness and sense and talent 
              among them, in spite of what you call fashionable nonsense. You 
              don't care to make people like you, to go into good society, and 
              cultivate your manners and tastes. I do, and I mean to make the 
              most of every chance that comes. You can go through the world with 
              your elbows out and your nose in the air, and call it independence, 
              if you like. That's not my way.&quot; </p>
            <p>When Amy had whetted her tongue and freed her mind she usually 
              got the best of it, for she seldom failed to have common sense on 
              her side, while Jo carried her love of liberty and hate of conventionalities 
              to such an unlimited extent that she naturally found herself worsted 
              in an argument. Amy's definition of Jo's idea of independence was 
              such a good hit that both burst out laughing, and the discussion 
              took a more amiable turn. Much against her will, Jo at length consented 
              to sacrifice a day to Mrs. Grundy, and help her sister through what 
              she regarded as `a nonsensical business'. </p>
            <p>The invitations were sent, nearly all accepted, and the following 
              Monday was set apart for the grand event. Hannah was out of humor 
              because her week's work was deranged, and prophesied that &quot;ef 
              the washin' and ironin' warn't done reg'lar, nothin' would go well 
              anywheres&quot;. This hitch in the mainspring of the domestic machinery 
              had a bad effect upon the whole concern, but Amy's motto was `Nil 
              desperandum', and having made up her mind what to do, she proceeded 
              to do it in spite of all obstacles. To begin with, Hannah's cooking 
              didn't turn out well. The chicken was tough, the tongue too salt, 
              and the chocolate wouldn't froth properly. Then the cake and ice 
              cost more than Amy expected, so did the wagon, and various other 
              expenses, which seemed trifling at the outset, counted up rather 
              alarmingly afterward. Beth got a cold and took to her bed. Meg had 
              an unusual number of callers to keep her at home, and Jo was in 
              such a divided state of mind that her breakages, accidents, and 
              mistakes were uncommonly numerous, serious, and trying. </p>
            <p>It it was not fair on Monday, the young ladies were to come on 
              Tuesday, and arrangement which aggravated Jo and Hannah to the last 
              degree. On Monday morning the weather was in that undecided state 
              which is more exasperating than a steady pour. It drizzled a little, 
              shone a little, blew a little, and didn't make up its mind till 
              it was too late for anyone else to make up theirs. Amy was up at 
              dawn, hustling people out of their beds and through their breakfasts, 
              that the house might be got in order. The parlor struck her as looking 
              uncommonly shabby, but without stopping to sigh for what she had 
              not, she skillfully made the best of what she had, arranging chairs 
              over the worn places in the carpet, covering stains on the walls 
              with homemade statuary, which gave an artistic air to the room, 
              as did the lovely vases of flowers Jo scattered about. </p>
            <p>The lunch looked charming, and as she surveyed it, she sincerely 
              hoped it would taste well, and that the borrowed glass, china, and 
              silver would get safely home again. The carriages were promised, 
              Meg and Mother were all ready to do the honors, Beth was able to 
              help Hannah behind the scenes, Jo had engaged to be as lively and 
              amiable as an absent mind, and aching head, and a very decided disapproval 
              of everybody and everything would allow, and as she wearily dressed, 
              Amy cheered herself with anticipations of the happy moment when, 
              lunch safely over, she should drive away with her friends for an 
              afternoon of artistic delights, for the `cherry bounce' and the 
              broken bridge were her strong points. </p>
            <p>Then came the hours of suspense, during which she vibrated from 
              parlor to porch, while public opinion varied like the weathercock. 
              A smart shower at eleven had evidently quenched the enthusiasm of 
              the young ladies who were to arrive at twelve, for nobody came, 
              and at two the exhausted family sat down in a blaze of sunshine 
              to consume the perishable portions of the feast, that nothing might 
              be lost. </p>
            <p>&quot;No doubt about the weather today, they will certainly come, 
              so we must fly round and be ready for them,&quot; said Amy, as the 
              sun woke her next morning. She spoke briskly, but in her secret 
              soul she wished she had said nothing about Tuesday, for her interest 
              like her cake was getting a little stale. </p>
            <p>&quot;I can't get any lobsters, so you will have to do without 
              salad today,&quot; said Mr. March, coming in half an hour later, 
              with an expression of placid despair. </p>
            <p>&quot;Use the chicken then, the toughness won't matter in a salad,&quot; 
              advised his wife. </p>
            <p>&quot;Hannah left it on the kitchen table a minute, and the kittens 
              got at it. I'm very sorry, amy,&quot; added Beth, who was still 
              a patroness of cats. </p>
            <p>&quot;Then I must have a lobster, for tongue alone won't do,&quot; 
              said Amy decidedly. </p>
            <p>&quot;Shall I rush into town and demand one?&quot; asked Jo, with 
              the magnanimity of a martyr. </p>
            <p>&quot;You'd come bringing it home under your arm without any paper, 
              just to try me. I'll go myself,&quot; answered Amy, whose temper 
              was beginning to fail. </p>
            <p>Shrouded in a thick veil and armed with a genteel traveling basket, 
              she departed, feeling that a cool drive would soothe her ruffled 
              spirit and fit her for the labors of the day. After some delay, 
              the object of her desire was procured, likewise a bottle of dressing 
              to prevent further loss of time at home, and off she drove again, 
              well pleased with her own forethought. </p>
            <p>As the omnibus contained only one other passenger, a sleepy old 
              lady, Amy pocketed her veil and beguiled the tedium of the way by 
              trying to find out where all her money had gone to. So busy was 
              she with her card full of refractory figures that she did not observe 
              a newcomer, who entered without stopping the vehicle, till a masculine 
              voice said, &quot;Good morning, Miss March,&quot; and, looking up, 
              she beheld one of Laurie's most elegant college friends. Fervently 
              hoping that he would get out before she did, Amy utterly ignored 
              the basket at her feet, and congratulating herself that she had 
              on her new traveling dress, returned the young man's greeting with 
              her usual suavity and spirit.</p>
            <p>They got on excellently, for Amy's chief care was soon set at rest 
              by learning that the gentleman would leave first, and she was chatting 
              away in a peculiarly lofty strain, when the old lady got out. In 
              stumbling to the door, she upset the basket, and--oh horror!--the 
              lobster, in all its vulgar size and brilliancy, was revealed to 
              the highborn eyes of a Tudor. </p>
            <p>&quot;By Jove, she's forgotten her dinner!&quot; cried the unconscious 
              youth, poking the scarlet monster into its place with his cane, 
              and preparing to hand out the basket after the old lady. </p>
            <p>&quot;Please don't--it's--it's mine,&quot; murmured Amy, with a 
              face nearly as red as her fish. </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, really, I beg pardon. It's an uncommonly fine one, isn't 
              it?&quot; said Tudor, with great presence of mind, and an air of 
              sober interest that did credit to his breeding. </p>
            <p>Amy recovered herself in a breath, set her basket boldly on the 
              seat, and said, laughing, &quot;Don't you wish you were to have 
              some of the salad he's going to make, and to see the charming young 
              ladies who are to eat it?&quot; </p>
            <p>Now that was tact, for two of the ruling foibles of the masculine 
              mind were touched. The lobster was instantly surrounded by a halo 
              of pleasing reminiscences, and curiosity about `the charming young 
              ladies' diverted his mind from the comical mishap. </p>
            <p>&quot;I suppose he'll laugh and joke over it with Laurie, but I 
              shan't see them, that's a comfort,&quot; thought Amy, as Tudor bowed 
              and departed. </p>
            <p>She did not mention this meeting at home (though she discovered 
              that, thanks to the upset, her new dress was much damaged by the 
              rivulets of dressing that meandered down the skirt), but went through 
              with the preparations which now seemed more irksome than before, 
              and at twelve o'clock all was ready again. feeling that the neighbors 
              were interested in her movements, she wished to efface the memory 
              of yesterday's failure by a grand success today, so she ordered 
              the `cherry bounce', and drove away in state to meet and escort 
              her guests to the banquet. </p>
            <p>&quot;There's the rumble, they're coming! I'll go onto the porch 
              and meet them. It looks hospitable, and I want the poor child to 
              have a good time after all her trouble,&quot; said Mrs. March, suiting 
              the action to the word. But after one glance, she retired, with 
              an indescribable expression, for looking quite lost in the big carriage, 
              sat Amy and one young lady. </p>
            <p>&quot;Run, Beth, and help Hannah clear half the things off the 
              table. It will be too absurd to put a luncheon for twelve before 
              a single girl,&quot; cried Jo, hurrying away to the lower regions, 
              too excited to stop even for a laugh.</p>
            <p>In came Amy, quite calm and delightfully cordial to the one guest 
              who had kept her promise. The rest of the family, being of a dramatic 
              turn, played their parts equally well, and Miss Eliott found them 
              a most hilarious set, for it was impossible to control entirely 
              the merriment which possessed them. The remodeled lunch being gaily 
              partaken of, the studio and garden visited, and art discussed with 
              enthusiasm, Amy ordered a buggy (alas for the elegant cherry-bounce), 
              and drove her friend quietly about the neighborhood till sunset, 
              when `the party went out'. </p>
            <p>As she came walking in, looking very tired but as composed as ever, 
              she observed that every vestige of the unfortunate fete had disappeared, 
              except a suspicious pucker about the corners of Jo's mouth. </p>
            <p>&quot;You've had a loverly afternoon for your drive, dear,&quot; 
              said her mother, as respectfully as if the whole twelve had come. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Miss Eliott is a very sweet girl, and seemed to enjoy herself, 
              I thought,&quot; observed Beth, with unusual warmth. </p>
            <p>&quot;Could you spare me some of your cake? I really need some, 
              I have so much company, and I can't make such delicious stuff as 
              yours,&quot; asked Meg soberly. </p>
            <p>&quot;Take it all. I'm the only one here who likes sweet things, 
              and it will mold before I can dispose of it,&quot; answered Amy, 
              thinking with a sigh of the generous store she had laid in for such 
              an end as this. </p>
            <p>&quot;It's a pity Laurie isn't here to help us,&quot; began Jo, 
              as they sat down to ice cream and salad for the second time in two 
              days. </p>
            <p>A warning look from her mother checked any further remarks, and 
              the whole family ate in heroic silence, till Mr. March mildly observed, 
              &quot;salad was one of the favorite dishes of the ancients, and 
              Evelyn...&quot; Here a general explosion of laughter cut short the 
              `history of salads', to the great surprise of the learned gentleman. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Bundle everything into a basket and send it to the Hummels. 
              Germans like messes. I'm sick of the sight of this, and there's 
              no reason you should all die of a surfeit because I've been a fool,&quot; 
              cried Amy, wiping her eyes. &quot;I thought I should have died when 
              I saw you two girls rattling about in the what-you-call-it, like 
              two little kernels in a very big nutshell, and Mother waiting in 
              state to receive the throng,&quot; sighed Jo, quite spent with laughter. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm very sorry you were disappointed, dear, but we all did 
              our best to satisfy you,&quot; said Mrs. March, in a tone full of 
              motherly regret. </p>
            <p>&quot;I am satisfied. I've done what I undertook, and it's not 
              my fault that it failed. I comfort myself with that,&quot; said 
              Amy with a little quiver in her voice. &quot;I thank you all very 
              much for helping me, and I'll thank you still more if you won't 
              allude to it for a month, at least.&quot; </p>
            <p>No one did for several months, but the word `fete' always produced 
              a general smile, and Laurie's birthday gift to Amy was a tiny coral 
              lobster in the shape of a charm for her watch guard. </p>

              <br>
              Though very happy in the social atmosphere about her, and very busy 
              with the daily work that earned her bread and made it sweeter for 
              the effort, Jo still found time for literary labors. The purpose 
              which now took possession of her was a natural one to a poor and 
              ambitious girl, but the means she took to gain her end were not 
              the best. She saw that money conferred power, therefore, she resolved 
              to have, not to be used for herself alone, but for those whom she 
              loved more than life. </p>
            <p>The dream of filling home with comforts, giving Beth everything 
              she wanted, from strawberries in winter to an organ in her bedroom, 
              going abroad herself, and always having more than enough, so that 
              she might indulge in the luxury of charity, had been for years Jo's 
              most cherished castle in the air. </p>
            <p>The prize-story experience had seemed to open a way which might, 
              after long traveling and much uphill work, lead to this delightful 
              chateau en Espagne. But the novel disaster quenched her courage 
              for a time, for public opinion is a giant which has frightened stouter-hearted 
              Jacks on bigger beanstalks than hers. Like that immortal hero, she 
              reposed awhile after the first attempt, which resulted in a tumble 
              and the least lovely of the giant's treasures, if I remember rightly. 
              But the `up again and take another' spirit was as strong in Jo as 
              in Jack, so she scrambled up on the shady side this time and got 
              more booty, but nearly left behind her what was far more precious 
              than the moneybags. </p>
            <p>She took to writing sensation stories, for in those dark ages, 
              even all-perfect America read rubbish. She told no one, but concocted 
              a `thrilling tale', and boldly carried it herself to Mr. Dashwood, 
              editor of the Weekly Volcano. She had never read Sartor Resartus, 
              but she had a womanly instinct that clothes possess an influence 
              more powerful over many than the worth of character or the magic 
              of manners. So she dressed herself in her best, and trying to persuade 
              herself that she was neither excited nor nervous, bravely climbed 
              two pairs of dark and dirty stairs to find herself in a disorderly 
              room, a cloud of cigar smoke, and the presence of three gentlemen, 
              sitting with their heels rather higher than their hats, which articles 
              of dress none of them took the trouble to remove on her appearance. 
              somewhat daunted by this reception, Jo hesitated on the threshold, 
              murmuring in much embarrassment... </p>
            <p>&quot;Excuse me, I was looking for the Weekly Volcano office. I 
              wished to see Mr. Dashwood.&quot; </p>
            <p>Down went the highest pair of heels, up rose the smokiest gentleman, 
              and carefully cherishing his cigar between his fingers, he advanced 
              with a nod and a countenance expressive of nothing but sleep. Feeling 
              that she must get through the matter somehow, Jo produced her manuscript 
              and, blushing redder and redder with each sentence, blundered out 
              fragments of the little speech carefully prepared for the occasion. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;A friend of mine desired me to offer--a story--just as an 
              experiment--would like your opinion--be glad to write more if this 
              suits.&quot; </p>
            <p>While she blushed and blundered, Mr. Dashwood had taken the manuscript, 
              and was turning over the leaves with a pair of rather dirty fingers, 
              and casting critical glances up and down the neat pages. </p>
            <p>&quot;Not a first attempt, I take it?&quot; observing that the 
              pages were numbered, covered only on one side, and not tied up with 
              a ribbon--sure sign of a novice. </p>
            <p>&quot;No, sir. She has had some experience, and got a prize for 
              a tale in the BLARNEYSTONE BANNER.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, did she?&quot; And Mr. Dashwood gave JO a quick look, 
              which seemed to take note of everything she had on, from the bow 
              in her bonnet to the buttons on her boots. &quot;Well, you can leave 
              it, if you like. We've more of this sort of thing on hand than we 
              know what to do with at present, but I'll run my eye over it, and 
              give you an answer next week.&quot; </p>
            <p>Now, Jo did not like to leave it, for Mr. Dashwood didn't suit 
              her at all, but, under the circumstances, there was nothing for 
              her to do but bow and walk away, looking particularly tall and dignified, 
              as she was apt to do when nettled or abashed. Just then she was 
              both, for it was perfectly evident from the knowing glances exchanged 
              among the gentlemen that her little fiction of `my friend' was considered 
              a good joke, and a laugh, produced by some inaudible remark of the 
              editor, as he closed the door, completed her discomfiture. Half 
              resolving never to return, she went home, and worked off her irritation 
              by stitching pinafores vigorously, and in an hour or two was cool 
              enough to laugh over the scene and long for next week. </p>
            <p>When she went again, Mr. Dashwood was alone, whereat she rejoiced. 
              Mr. Dashwood was much wider awake than before, which was agreeable 
              and Mr. Dashwood was not too deeply absorbed in a cigar to remember 
              his manners, so the second interview was much more comfortable than 
              the first. </p>
            <p>&quot;We'll take this (editors never say I), if you don't object 
              to a few alterations. It's too long, but omitting the passages I've 
              marked will make it just the right length,&quot;he said, in a businesslike 
              tone. </p>
            <p>Jo hardly knew her own MS again, so crumpled and underscored were 
              its pages and paragraphs, but feeling as a tender patent might on 
              being asked to cut off her baby's legs in order that it might fit 
              into a new cradle, she looked at the marked passages and was surprised 
              to find that all the moral reflections--which she had carefully 
              put in as ballast for much romance--had been stricken out. </p>
            <p>But, Sir, I thought every story should have some sort of a moral, 
              so I took care to have a few of my sinners repent.&quot; </p>
            <p>Mr. Dashwoods's editorial gravity relaxed into a smile, for Jo 
              had forgotten her `friend', and spoken as only an author could. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;People want to be amused, not preached at, you know. Morals 
              don't sell nowadays.&quot; Which was not quite a correct statement, 
              by the way. </p>
            <p>&quot;You think it would do with these alterations, then?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Yes, it's a new plot, and pretty well worked up--language 
              good, and so on,&quot; was Mr. Dashwood's affable reply. </p>
            <p>&quot;What do you--that is, what compensation--&quot; began Jo, 
              not exactly knowing how to express herself. </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, yes, well, we give from twenty-five to thirty for things 
              of this sort. Pay when it comes out,&quot; returned Mr. Dashwood, 
              as if that point had escaped him. Such trifles do escape the editorial 
              mind, it is said. </p>
            <p>&quot;Very well, you can have it,&quot; said Jo, handing back the 
              story with a satisfied air, for after the dollar-a-column work, 
              even twenty-five seemed good pay. </p>
            <p>&quot;Shall I tell my friend you will take another if she has one 
              better than this?&quot; asked Jo, unconscious of her little slip 
              of the tongue, and emboldened by her success. </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, we'll look at it. Can't promise to take it. Tell her 
              to make it short and spicy, and never mind the moral. What name 
              would your friend like to put on it?&quot; in a careless tone.</p>
            <p> &quot;None at all, if you please, she doesn't wish her name to 
              appear and has no nom de plume,&quot; said Jo, blushing in spite 
              of herself. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Just as she likes, of course. The tale will be out next week. 
              Will you call for the money, or shall I send it?&quot; asked Mr. 
              Dashwood, who felt a natural desire to know who his new contributor 
              might be. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'll call. Good morning, Sir.&quot;</p>
            <p>As she departed, Mr. Dashwood put up his feet, with the graceful 
              remark, &quot;Poor and proud, as usual, but she'll do.&quot; </p>
            <p>Following Mr. Dashwood's directions, and making Mrs. Northbury 
              her model, Jo rashly took a plunge into the frothy sea of sensational 
              literature, but thanks to the life preserver thrown her by a friend, 
              she came up again not much the worse for her ducking. </p>
            <p>Like most young scribblers, she went abroad for her characters 
              and scenery, and banditti, counts, gypsies, nuns, and duchesses 
              appeared upon her stage, and played their parts with as much accuracy 
              and spirit as could be expected. Her readers were not particular 
              about such trifles as grammar, punctuation, and probability, and 
              Mr. Dashwood graciously permitted her to fill his columns at the 
              lowest prices, not thinking it necessary to tell her that the real 
              cause of his hospitality was the fact that one of his hacks, on 
              being offered higher wages, had basely left him in the lurch. </p>
            <p>She soon became interested in her work, for her emaciated purse 
              grew stout, and the little hoard she was making to take Beth to 
              the mountains next summer grew slowly but surely as the weeks passed. 
              One thing disturbed her satisfaction, and that was that she did 
              not tell them at home. She had a feeling that Father and Mother 
              would not approve, and preferred to have her own way first, and 
              beg pardon afterward. It was easy to keep her secret, for no name 
              appeared with her stories. Mr. Dashwood had of course found it out 
              very soon, but promised to be dumb, and for a wonder kept his word. 
            </p>
            <p>She thought it would do her no harm, for she sincerely meant to 
              write nothing of which she would be ashamed, and quieted all pricks 
              of conscience by anticipations of the happy minute when she should 
              show her earnings and laugh over her well-kept secret. </p>
            <p>But Mr. Dashwood rejected any but thrilling tales, and as thrills 
              could not be produced except by harrowing up the souls of the readers, 
              history and romance, land and sea, science and art, police records 
              and lunatic asylums, had to be ransacked for the purpose. Jo soon 
              found that her innocent experience had given her but few glimpses 
              of the tragic world which underlies society, so regarding it in 
              a business light, she set about supplying her deficiencies with 
              characteristic energy. Eager to find material for stories, and bent 
              on making them original in plot, if not masterly in execution, she 
              searched newspapers for accidents, incidents, and crimes. She excited 
              the suspicions of public librarians by asking for works on poisons. 
              She studied faces in the street, and characters, good, bad, and 
              indifferent, all about her. She delved in the dust of ancient times 
              for facts or fictions so old that they were as good as new, and 
              introduced herself to folly, sin, and misery, as well as her limited 
              opportunities allowed. She thought she was prospering finely, but 
              unconsciously she was beginning to desecrate some of the womanliest 
              attributes of a woman's character. She was living in bad society, 
              and imaginary though it was, its influence affected her, for she 
              was feeding heart and fancy on dangerous and unsubstantial food, 
              and was fast brushing the innocent bloom from her nature by a premature 
              acquaintance with the darker side of life, which comes soon enough 
              to all of us. </p>
            <p>She was beginning to feel rather than see this, for much describing 
              of other people's passions and feelings set her to studying and 
              speculating about her own. a morbid amusement in which healthy young 
              minds do not voluntarily indulge. Wrongdoing always brings its own 
              punishment, and when Jo most needed hers, she got it. </p>
            <p>I don't know whether the study of Shakespeare helped her to read 
              character, or the natural instinct of a woman for what was honest, 
              brave, and strong, but while endowing her imaginary heroes with 
              every perfection under the sun, Jo was discovering a live hero, 
              who interested her in spite of many human imperfections.</p>
            <p>Mr. Bhaer, in one of their conversations, had advised her to study 
              simple, true, and lovely characters, wherever she found them, as 
              good training for a writer. Jo took him at his word, for she coolly 
              turned round and studied him--a proceeding which would have much 
              surprised him, had he know it, for the worthy Professor was very 
              humble in his own conceit.</p>
            <p>Why everybody liked him was what puzzled Jo, at first. He was neither 
              rich nor great, young nor handsome, in no respect what is called 
              fascinating, imposing, or brilliant, and yet he was as attractive 
              as a genial fire, and people seemed to gather about him as naturally 
              as about a warm hearth. He was poor, yet always appeared to be giving 
              something away; a stranger, yet everyone was his friend; no longer 
              young, but as happy-hearted as a boy; plain and peculiar, yet his 
              face looked beautiful to many, and his oddities were freely forgiven 
              for his sake. Jo often watched him, trying to discover the charm, 
              and at last decided that it was benevolence which worked the miracle. 
              If he had any sorrow, `it sat with its head under its wing', and 
              he turned only his sunny side to the world. There were lines upon 
              his forehead, but Time seemed to have touched him gently, remembering 
              how kind he was to others. The pleasant curves about his mouth were 
              the memorials of many friendly words and cheery laughs, his eyes 
              were never cold or hard, and his big hand had a warm, strong grasp 
              that was more expressive than words. </p>
            <p>His very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature of 
              the wearer. They looked as if they were at ease, and liked to make 
              him comfortable. His apacious waistcoat was suggestive of a large 
              heart underneath. His rusty coat had a social air, and the baggy 
              pockets plainly proved that little hands often went in empty and 
              came out full. His very boots were benevolent, and his collars never 
              stiff and raspy like other people's. </p>
            <p> &quot;That's it!&quot; said Jo to herself, when she at length 
              discovered that genuine good will toward one's fellow men could 
              beautify and dignify even a stout German teacher, who shoveled in 
              his dinner, darned his own socks, and was burdened with the name 
              of Bhaer. </p>
            <p>Jo valued goodness highly, but she also possessed a most feminine 
              respect for intellect, and a little discovery which she made about 
              the Professor added much to her regard for him. He never spoke of 
              himself, and no one ever knew that in his native city he had been 
              a man much honored and esteemed for learning and integrity, till 
              a countryman came to see him. He never spoke of himself, and in 
              a conversation with Miss Norton divulged the pleasing fact. From 
              her Jo learned it, and liked it all the better because Mr. Bhaer 
              had never told it. She felt proud to know that he was an honored 
              Professor in Berlin, though only a poor language-master in America, 
              and his homely, hard-working life was much beautified by the spice 
              of romance which this discovery gave it. Another and a better gift 
              than intellect was shown her in a most unexpected manner. Miss Norton 
              had the entree into most society, which Jo would have had no chance 
              of seeing but for her. The solitary woman felt an interest in the 
              ambitious girl, and kindly conferred many favors of this sort both 
              on Jo and the Professor. She took them with her one night to a select 
              symposium, held in honor of several celebrities. </p>
            <p>Jo went prepared to bow down and adore the mighty ones whom she 
              had worshiped with youthful enthusiasm afar off. But her reverence 
              for genius received a severe shock that night, and it took her some 
              time to recover from the discovery that the great creatures were 
              only men and women after all. Imagine her dismay, on stealing a 
              glance of timid admiration at the poet whose lines suggested an 
              ethereal being fed on `spirit, fire, and dew', to behold him devouring 
              his supper with an ardor which flushed his intellectual countenance. 
              Turning as from a fallen idol, she made other discoveries which 
              rapidly dispelled her romantic illusions. The great novelist vibrated 
              between two decanters with the regularity of a pendulum; the famous 
              divine flirted openly with one of the Madame de Staels of the age, 
              who looked daggers at another Corinne, who was amiably satirizing 
              her, after outmaneuvering her in efforts to absorb the profound 
              philosopher, who imbibed tea Johnsonianly and appeared to slumber, 
              the loquacity of the lady rendering speech impossible. The scientific 
              celebrities, forgetting their mollusks and glacial periods, gossiped 
              about art, while devoting themselves to oysters and ices with characteristic 
              energy; the young musician, who was charming the city like a second 
              Orpheus, talked horses; and the specimen of the British nobility 
              present happened to be the most ordinary man of the party. </p>
            <p>Before the evening was half over, Jo felt so completely disillusioned, 
              that she sat down in a corner to recover herself. Mr. Bhaer soon 
              joined her, looking rather out of his element, and presently several 
              of the philosophers, each mounted on his hobby, came ambling up 
              to hold an intellectual tournament in the recess. The conversations 
              were miles beyond Jo's comprehension, but she enjoyed it, though 
              Kant and Hegel were unknown gods, the Subjective and Objective unintelligible 
              terms, and the only thing `evolved from her inner consciousness' 
              was a bad headache after it was all over. It dawned upon her gradually 
              that the world was being picked to pieces, and put together on new 
              and, according to the talkers, on infinitely better principles than 
              before, that religion was in a fair way to be reasoned into nothingness, 
              and intellect was to be the only God. Jo knew nothing about philosophy 
              or metaphysics of any sort, but a curious excitement, half pleasurable, 
              half painful, came over her as she listened with a sense of being 
              turned adrift into time and space, like a young balloon out on a 
              holiday. </p>
            <p>She looked round to see how the Professor liked it, and found him 
              looking at her with the grimest expression she had ever seen him 
              wear. He shook his head and beckoned her to come away, but she was 
              fascinated just then by the freedom of Speculative Philosophy, and 
              kept her seat, trying to find out what the wise gentlemen intended 
              to rely upon after they had annihilated all the old beliefs. </p>
            <p>Now, Mr. Bhaer was a diffident man and slow to offer his own opinions, 
              not because they were unsettled, but too sincere and earnest to 
              be lightly spoken. As he glanced from Jo to several other young 
              people, attracted by the brilliancy of the philosophic pyrotechnics, 
              he knit his brows and longed to speak, fearing that some inflammable 
              young soul would be led astray by the rockets, to find when the 
              display was over that they had only an empty stick or a scorched 
              hand. </p>
            <p>He bore it as long as he could, but when he was appealed to for 
              an opinion, he blazed up with honest indignation and defended religion 
              with all the eloquence of truth--an eloquence which made his broken 
              English musical and his plain face beautiful. He had a hard fight, 
              for the wise men argued well, but he didn't know when he was beaten 
              and stood to his colors like a man. Somehow, as he talked, the world 
              got right again to Jo. The old beliefs, that had lasted so long, 
              seemed better than the new. God was not a blind force, and immortality 
              was not a pretty fable, but a blessed fact. She felt as if she had 
              solid ground under her feet again, and when Mr. Bhaer paused, outtalked 
              but not one whit convinced, Jo wanted to clap her hands and thank 
              him. </p>
            <p>She did neither, but she remembered the scene, and gave the Professor 
              her heartiest respect, for she knew it cost him an effort to speak 
              out then and there, because his conscience would not let him be 
              silent. She began to see that character is a better possession than 
              money, rank, intellect, or beauty, and to feel that if greatness 
              is what a wise man has defined it to be, `truth, reverence, and 
              good will', then her friend friedrich Bhaer was not only good, but 
              great. </p>
            <p>This belief strengthened daily. She valued his esteem, she coveted 
              his respect, she wanted to be worthy of his friendship, and just 
              when the wish was sincerest, she came near to losing everything. 
              It all grew out of a cocked hat, for one evening the Professor came 
              in to give Jo her lesson with a paper soldier cap on his head, which 
              Tina had put there and he had forgotten to take off. </p>
            <p>&quot;It's evident he doesn't look in his glass before coming down,&quot; 
              thought Jo, with a smile, as he said &quot;Goot efening,&quot; and 
              sat soberly down, quite unconscious of the ludicrous contrast between 
              his subject and his headgear, for he was going to read her the Death 
              of Wallenstein. </p>
            <p>She said nothing at first, for she liked to hear him laugh out 
              his big, hearty laugh when anything funny happened, so she left 
              him to discover it for himself, and presently forgot all about it, 
              for to hear a German read Schiller is rather an absorbing occupation. 
              After the reading came the lesson, which was a lively one, for Jo 
              was in a gay mood that night, and the cocked hat kept her eyes dancing 
              with merriment. The Professor didn't know what to make of her, and 
              stopped at last to ask with an air of mild surprise that was irresistible 
              ...</p>
            <p>&quot;Mees Marsch, for what do you laugh in your master's face? 
              Haf you no respect for me, that you go on so bad?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;How can I be respectful, Sir, when you forget to take your 
              hat off?&quot; said Jo. </p>
            <p>Lifting his hand to his head, the absent-minded Professor gravely 
              felt and removed the little cocked hat, looked at it a minute, and 
              then threw back his head and laughed like a merry bass viol. </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah! I see him now, it is that imp Tina who makes me a fool 
              with my cap. Well, it is nothing, but see you, if this lesson goes 
              not well, you too shall wear him.&quot; </p>
            <p>But the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes because Mr. 
              Bhaer caught sight of a picture on the hat, and unfolding it, said 
              with great disgust, &quot;I wish these papers did not come in the 
              house. They are not for children to see, nor young people to read. 
              It is not well, and I haf no patience with those who make this harm.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>Jo glanced at the sheet and saw a pleasing illustration composed 
              of a lunatic, a corpse, a villian, and a viper. She did not like 
              it, but the impulse that made her turn it over was not one of displeasure 
              but fear, because for a minute she fancied the paper was the Volcano. 
              It was not, however, and her panic subsided as she remembered that 
              even if it had been and one of her own tales in it, there would 
              have been no name to betray her. She had betrayed herself, however, 
              by a look and a blush, for though an absent man, the Professor saw 
              a good deal more than people fancied. He knew that Jo wrote, and 
              had met her down among the newspaper offices more than once, but 
              as she never spoke of it, he asked no questions in spite of a strong 
              desire to see her work. Now it occurred to him that she was doing 
              what she was ashamed to own, and it troubled him. He did not say 
              to himself, &quot;It is none of my business. I've no right to say 
              anything,&quot; as many people would have done. He only remembered 
              that she was young and poor, a girl far away from mother's love 
              and father's care, and he was moved to help her with an impulse 
              as quick and natural as that which would prompt him to put out his 
              hand to save a baby from a puddle. All this flashed through his 
              mind in a minute, but not a trace of it appeared in his face, and 
              by the time the paper was turned, and Jo's needle threaded, he was 
              ready to say quite naturally, but very gravely... </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, you are right to put it from you. I do not think that 
              good young girls should see such things. They are made pleasant 
              to some, but I would more rather give my boys gunpowder to play 
              with than this bad trash.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;All may not be bad, only silly, you know, and if there is 
              a demand for it, I don't see any harm in supplying it. Many very 
              respectable people make an honest living out of what are called 
              sensation stories,&quot; said Jo, scratching gathers so energetically 
              that a row of little slits followed her pin. </p>
            <p>&quot;There is a demand for whisky, but I think you and I do not 
              care to sell it. If the respectable people knew what harm they did, 
              they would not feel that the living was honest. They haf no right 
              to put poison in the sugarplum, and let the small ones eat it. No, 
              they should think a little, and sweep mud in the street before they 
              do this thing.&quot; </p>
            <p>Mr. Bhaer spoke warmly, and walked to the fire, crumpling the paper 
              in his hands. Jo sat still, looking as if the fire had come to her, 
              for her cheeks burned long after the cocked hat had turned to smoke 
              and gone harmlessly up the chimney. </p>
            <p>&quot;I should like much to send all the rest after him,&quot; 
              muttered the Professor, coming back with a relieved air.</p>
            <p> Jo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would make, 
              and her hard-earned money lay rather heavily on her conscience at 
              that minute. Then she thought consolingly to herself, &quot;Mine 
              are not like that, they are only silly, never bad, so I won't be 
              worried,&quot; and taking up her book, she said, with a studious 
              face, &quot;Shall we go on, Sir? I'll be very good and proper now.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I shall hope so,&quot; was all he said, but he meant more 
              than she imagined, and the grave, kind look he gave her made her 
              feel as if the words Weekly Volcano were printed in large type on 
              her forehead. </p>
            <p>As soon as she went to her room, she got out her papers, and carefully 
              reread every one of her stories. Being a little shortsighted, Mr. 
              Bhaer sometimes used eye glasses, and Jo had tried them once, smiling 
              to see how they magnified the fine print of her book. Now she seemed 
              to have on the Professor's mental or moral spectacles also, for 
              the faults of these poor stories glared at her dreadfully and filled 
              her with dismay. </p>
            <p> &quot;They are trash, and will soon be worse trash if I go on, 
              for each is more sensational than the last. I've gone blindly on, 
              hurting myself and other people, for the sake of money. I know it's 
              so, for I can't read this stuff in sober earnest without being horribly 
              ashamed of it, and what should I do if they were seen at home or 
              Mr. Bhaer got hold of them?&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo turned hot at the bare idea, and stuffed the whole bundle into 
              her stove, nearly setting the chimney afire with the blaze. </p>
            <p> &quot;Yes, that's the best place for such inflammable nonsense. 
              I'd better burn the house down, I suppose, than let other people 
              blow themselves up with my gunpowder,&quot; she thought as she watched 
              the Demon of the Jura whisk away, a little black cinder with fiery 
              eyes. </p>
            <p>But when nothing remained of all her three month's work except 
              a heap of ashes and the money in her lap, Jo looked sober, as she 
              sat on the floor, wondering what she ought to do about her wages. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I think I haven't done much harm yet, and may keep this to 
              pay for my time,&quot; she said, after a long meditation, adding 
              impatiently, &quot;I almost wish I hadn't any conscience, it's so 
              inconvenient. If I didn't care about doing right, and didn't feel 
              uncomfortable when doing wrong, I should get on capitally. I can't 
              help wishing sometimes, that Mother and Father hadn't been so particular 
              about such things.&quot; </p>
            <p>Ah, Jo, instead of wishing that, thank God that `Father and Mother 
              were particular'. and pity from your heart those who have no such 
              guardians to hedge them round with principles which may seem like 
              prison walls to impatient youth, but which will prove sure foundations 
              to build character upon in womanhood. </p>
            <p>Jo wrote no more sensational stories, deciding that the money did 
              not pay for her share of the sensation, but going to the other extreme, 
              as is the way with people of her stamp, she took a course of Mrs. 
              Sherwood, Miss Edgeworth, and Hannah More, and then produced a tale 
              which might have been more properly called an essay or a sermon, 
              so intensely moral was it. She had her doubts about it from the 
              beginning, for her lively fancy and girlish romance felt as ill 
              at ease in the new style as she would have done masquerading in 
              the stiff and cumbrous costume of the last century. She sent this 
              didactic gem to several markets, but it found no purchaser, and 
              she was inclined to agree with Mr. Dashwood that morals didn't sell. 
            </p>
            <p>Then she tried a child's story, which she could easily have disposed 
              of if she had not been mercenary enough to demand filthy lucre for 
              it. The only person who offered enough to make it worth her while 
              to try juvenile literature was a worthy gentleman who felt it his 
              mission to convert all the world to his particular belief. But much 
              as she liked to write for children, Jo could not consent to depict 
              all her naughty boys as being eaten by bears or tossed by mad bulls 
              because they did not go to a particular Sabbath school, nor all 
              the good infants who did go as rewarded by every kind of bliss, 
              from gilded gingerbread to escorts of angels when they departed 
              this life with psalms or sermons on their lisping tongues. So nothing 
              came of these trials, land Jo corked up her inkstand, and said in 
              a fit of very wholesome humility...</p>
            <p>&quot;I don't know anything. I'll wait until I do before I try 
              again, and meantime, `sweep mud in the street' if I can't do better, 
              that's honest, at least.&quot; Which decision proved that her second 
              tumble down the beanstalk had done her some good. </p>
            <p>While these internal revolutions were going on, her external life 
              had been as busy and uneventful as usual, and if she sometimes looked 
              serious or a little sad no one observed it but Professor Bhaer. 
              He did it so quietly that Jo never knew he was watching to see if 
              she would accept and profit by his reproof, but she stood the test, 
              and he was satisfied, for though no words passed between them, he 
              knew that she had given up writing. Not only did he guess it by 
              the fact that the second finger of her right hand was no longer 
              inky, but she spent her evenings downstairs now, was met no more 
              among newspaper offices, and studied with a dogged patience, which 
              assured him that she was bent on occupying her mind with something 
              useful, if not pleasant. </p>
            <p>He helped her in many ways, proving himself a true friend, and 
              Jo was happy, for while her pen lay idle, she was learning other 
              lessons besides German, and laying a foundation for the sensation 
              story of her own life. </p>
            <p>It was a pleasant winter and a long one, for she did not leave 
              Mrs. Kirke till June. Everyone seemed sorry when the time came. 
              The children were inconsolable, and Mr. Bhaer's hair stuck straight 
              up all over his head, for he always rumpled it wildly when disturbed 
              in mind. </p>
            <p>&quot;Going home? Ah, you are happy that you haf a home to go in,&quot; 
              he said, when she told him, and sat silently pulling his beard in 
              the corner, while she held a little levee on that last evening. 
            </p>
            <p>She was going early, so she bade them all goodbye overnight, and 
              when his turn came, she said warmly, &quot;Now, Sir, you won't forget 
              to come and see us, if you ever travel our way, will you? I'll never 
              forgive you if you do, for I want them all to know my friend.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Do you? Shall I come?&quot; he asked, looking down at her 
              with an eager expression which she did not see. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, come next month. Laurie graduates then, and you'd enjoy 
              commencement as something new.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;That is your best friend, of whom you speak?&quot; he said 
              in an altered tone. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, my boy Teddy. I'm very proud of him and should like 
              you to see him.&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo looked up then, quite unconscious of anything but her own pleasure 
              in the prospect of showing them to one another. Something in Mr. 
              Bhaer's face suddenly recalled the fact that she might find Laurie 
              more than a `best friend', and simply because she particularly wished 
              not to look as if anything was the matter, she involuntarily began 
              to blush, and the more she tried not to, the redder she grew. If 
              it had not been for Tina on her knee. She didn't know what would 
              have become of her. Fortunately the child was moved to hug her, 
              so she managed to hide her face an instant, hoping the Professor 
              did not see it. But he did, and his own changed again from that 
              momentary anxiety to its usual expression, as he said cordially... 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I fear I shall not make the time for that, but I wish the 
              friend much success, and you all happiness. Gott bless you!&quot; 
              And with that, he shook hands warmly, shouldered Tina, and went 
              away. </p>
            <p>But after the boys were abed, he sat long before his fire with 
              the tired look on his face and the `heimweh', or homesickness, lying 
              heavy at his heart. Once, when he remembered Jo as she sat with 
              the little child in her lap and that new softness in her face, he 
              leaned his head on his hands a minute, and then roamed about the 
              room, as if in search of something that he could not find. </p>
            <p>&quot;It is not for me, I must not hope it now,&quot; he said to 
              himself, with a sigh that was almost a groan. Then, as if reproach- 
              ing himself for the longing that he could not repress, he went and 
              kissed the two tousled heads upon the pillow, took down his seldom-used 
              meerschaum, and opened his Plato. </p>
            <p>He did his best and did it manfully, but I don't think he found 
              that a pair of rampant boys, a pipe, or even the divine Plato, were 
              very satisfactory substitutes for wife and child at home. </p>
            <p>Early as it was, he was at the station next morning to see Jo off, 
              and thanks to him, she began her solitary journey with the pleasant 
              memory of a familiar face smiling its farewell, a bunch of violets 
              to keep her company, and best of all, the happy thought, &quot;Well, 
              the winter's gone, and I've written no books, earned no fortune, 
              but I've made a friend worth having and I'll try to keep him all 
              my life.&quot; </p>

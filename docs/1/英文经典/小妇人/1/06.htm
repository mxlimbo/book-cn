            <p> <br>
              The big house did prove a Palace Beautiful, though it took some 
              time for all to get in, and Beth found it very hard to pass the 
              lions. Old Mr. Laurence was the biggest one, but after he had called, 
              said something funny or kind to each one of the girls, and talked 
              over old times with their mother, nobody felt much afraid of him, 
              except timid Beth. The other lion was the fact that they were poor 
              and Laurie rich, for this made them shy of accepting favors which 
              they could not return. But, after a while, they found that he considered 
              them the benefactors, and could not do enough to show how grateful 
              he was for Mrs. March's motherly welcome, their cheerful society, 
              and the comfort he took in that humble home of theirs. So they soon 
              forgot their pride and interchanged kindnesses without stopping 
              to think which was the greater. </p>
            <p>All sorts of pleasant things happened about that time, for the 
              new friendship flourished like grass in spring. Every one liked 
              Laurie, and he privately informed his tutor that &quot;the Marches 
              were regularly splendid girls.&quot; With the delightful enthusiasm 
              of youth, they took the solitary boy into their midst and made much 
              of him, and he found something very charming in the innocent companionshipof 
              these simple-hearted girls. Never having known mother or sisters, 
              he was quick to feel the influences they brought about him, and 
              their busy, lively ways made him ashamed of the indolent life he 
              led. He was tired of books, and found people so interesting now 
              that Mr. Brooke was obliged to make very unsatisfactory reports, 
              for Laurie was always playing truant and running over to the Marches'. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Never mind, let him take a holiday, and make it up afterward,&quot; 
              said the old gentleman. &quot;The good lady next door says he is 
              studying too hard and needs young society, amusement, and exercise. 
              I suspect she is right, and that I've been coddling the fellow as 
              if I'd been his grandmother. Let him do what he likes, as long as 
              he is happy. He can't get into mischief in that little nunnery over 
              there, and Mrs. March is doing more for him than we can.&quot; </p>
            <p>What good times they had, to be sure. Such plays and tableaux, 
              such sleigh rides and skating frolics, such pleasant evenings in 
              the old parlor, and now and then such gay little parties at the 
              great house. Meg could walk in the conservatory whenever she liked 
              and revel in bouquets, Jo browsed over the new library voraciously, 
              and convulsed the old gentleman with her criticisms, Amy copied 
              pictures and enjoyed beauty to her heart's content, and Laurie played 
              `lord of the manor' in the most delightful style. </p>
            <p>But Beth, though yearning for the grand piano, could not pluck 
              up courage to go to the `Mansion of Bliss', as Meg called it. She 
              went once with Jo, but the old gentleman, not being aware of her 
              infirmity, stared at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows, 
              and said &quot;Hey!&quot; so loud, that he frightened her so much 
              her `feet chattered on the floor', she never told her mother, and 
              she ran away, declaring she would never go there any more, not even 
              for the dear piano. No persuasions orenticements could overcome 
              her fear, till, the fact coming to Mr. Laurence's ear in some mysterious 
              way, he set about mending matters. During one of the brief calls 
              he made, he artfully led the conversation to music, and talked away 
              about great singers whom he had seen, fine organs he had heard, 
              and toldsuch charming anecdotes that Beth found it impossible to 
              stay in her distant corner, but crept nearer and nearer, as if fascinated. 
              At the back of his chair she stopped and stood listening, with her 
              great eyes wide open and her cheeks red with excitement of this 
              unusual performance. Taking no more notice of her than if she had 
              been a fly, Mr. Laurence talked on about Laurie's lessons and teachers. 
              And presently, as if the idea had just occurred to him, he said 
              to Mrs. March... </p>
            <p>&quot;The boy neglects his music now, and I'm glad of it, for he 
              was getting too fond of it. But the piano suffers for want of use. 
              Wouldn't some of your girls like to run over, and practice on it 
              now and then, just to keep it in tune, you know, ma`am?&quot; </p>
            <p>Beth took a step forward, and pressed her hands tightly together 
              to keep from clapping them, for this was an irresistible temptation, 
              and the thought of practicing on that splendid instrument quite 
              took her breath away. Before Mrs. March could reply, Mr. Laurence 
              went on with an odd little nod and smile... </p>
            <p> &quot;They needn't see or speak to anyone, but run in at any time. 
              For I'm shut up in my study at the other end of the house, Laurie 
              is out a great deal, and the servants are never near the drawing 
              room after nine o'clock.&quot; </p>
            <p>Here he rose, as if going, and Beth made up her mind to speak, 
              for that last arrangement left nothing to be desired. &quot;Please, 
              tell the young ladies what I say, and if they don't care to come, 
              why, never mind.&quot; Here a little hand slipped into his, and 
              Beth looked up at him with a face full of gratitude, as she said, 
              in her earnest yet timid way... </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh sir, they do care, very very much!&quot; &quot;Are you 
              the musical girl?&quot; he asked, without any startling &quot;Hey!&quot; 
              as he looked down at her very kindly. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm Beth. I love it dearly, and I'll come, if you are quite 
              sure nobody will hear me, and be disturbed,&quot; she added, fearing 
              to be rude, and trembling at her own boldness as she spoke. </p>
            <p>&quot;Not a soul, my dear. The house is empty half the day, so 
              come and drum away as much as you like, and I shall be obliged toyou.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;How kind you are, sir!&quot;</p>
            <p>Beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore, but she 
              was not frightened now, and gave the hand a grateful squeeze because 
              she had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given 
              her. The old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead, 
              and, stooping down, he kissed herr, saying, in a tone few people 
              ever heard... </p>
            <p>&quot;I had a little girl once, with eyes like these. God bless 
              you, my dear! Good day. madam.&quot; And away he went, in a great 
              hurry. </p>
            <p>Beth had a rapture with her mother, and then rushed up to impart 
              the glorious news to her family of invalids, as the girls were not 
              home. How blithely she sang that evening, and how they all laughed 
              at her because she woke Amy in the night by playing the piano on 
              her face in her sleep. Next day, having seen both the old and young 
              gentleman out of the house, Beth, after two or three retreats, fairly 
              got in at the side door, and made her way as noiselessly as any 
              mouse to the drawing room where her idol stood. Quite by accident, 
              of course, some pretty, easy music lay on the piano, and with trembling 
              fingers and frequent stops to listen and look about, Beth at last 
              touched the great instrument, and straightway forgot her fear, herself, 
              and everything else but the unspeakable delight which the music 
              gave her, for it was like the voice of a beloved friend. </p>
            <p>She stayed till Hannah came to take her home to dinner, but she 
              had no appetite, and could only sit and smile upon everyone in a 
              general state of beatitude. </p>
            <p>After that, the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly 
              every day, and the great drawing room was haunted by a tuneful spirit 
              that came and went unseen. She never knew that Mr. Laurence opened 
              his study door to hear the old-fashioned airs he liked. She never 
              saw Laurie mount guard in the hall to warn the servants away. She 
              never suspected that the exercise books and new songs which she 
              found in the rack were put there for her especial benefit, and when 
              he talked to her about music at home, she only thought how kind 
              he was to tell things that helped her so much. So she enjoyed herself 
              heartily, and found, what isn't always the case, that her granted 
              wish was all she had hoped. Perhaps it was because she was so grateful 
              for this blessing that a greater was given her. At any rate she 
              deserved both. &quot;Mother, I'm going to work Mr. Laurence a pair 
              of slippers. He is so kind to me, I must thank him, and I don't 
              know any other way. Can I do it?&quot; asked Beth, a few weeks after 
              that eventful call of his. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, dear. It will please him very much, and be a nice way 
              of thanking him. The girls will help you about them, and I will 
              pay for the making up,&quot; replied Mrs. March, who took peculiar 
              pleasure in granting Beth's requests because she so seldom asked 
              anything for herself. </p>
            <p>After many serious discussions with Meg and Jo, the pattern was 
              chosen, the materials bought, and the slippers begun. A cluster 
              ofgrave yet cheerful pansies on a deeper purple ground was pronounced 
              very appropriate and pretty, and beth worked away early and late, 
              with occasional lifts over hard parts. She was a nimble little needlewoman, 
              and they were finished before anyone got tired of them. Then she 
              wrote a short, simple note, and with Laurie's help, got them smuggled 
              onto the study table one morning before the old gentleman was up. 
            </p>
            <p>When this excitement was over, Beth waited to see what would happen. 
              All day passed a a part of the next before any acknowledgement arrived, 
              and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crochety friend. 
              On the afternoon of the second day, she went out to do an errand, 
              and give poor Joanna, the invalid doll, her daily exercise. As she 
              came up the street, on her return, she saw three, yes, four heads 
              popping in and out of the parlor windows, and the moment they saw 
              her, several hands were waved, and several joyful voices screamed... 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Here's a letter from the old gentleman! Come quick, and read 
              it!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, Beth, he's sent you...&quot; began Amy, gesticulating 
              with unseemly energy, but she got no further, for Jo quenched her 
              by slamming down the window. </p>
            <p>Beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense. At the door her sisters 
              seized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession, all 
              pointing and all saying at once, &quot;Look there! Look there!&quot; 
              Beth did look, and turned pale with delight and surprise, for there 
              stood a little cabinet piano, with a letter lying on the glossy 
              lid, directed like a sign board to &quot;Miss Elizabeth March.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;For me?&quot; gasped Beth, holding onto Jo and feeling as 
              if she should tumble down, it was such an overwhelming thing altogether. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Yes, all for you, my precious! Isn't it splendid of him? 
              Don't you think he's the dearest old man in the world? Here's the 
              key in the letter. We didn't open it, but we are dying to know what 
              he says,&quot; cried Jo, hugging her sister and offering the note. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You read it! I can't, I feel so queer! Oh, it is too lovely!&quot; 
              and Beth hid her face in Jo's apron, quite upset by her present. 
            </p>
            <p>Jo opened the paper and began to laugh, for the first worked she 
              saw were... </p>
            <p>&quot;Miss March: </p>
            <p>&quot;Dear Madam--&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;How nice it sounds! I wish someone would write to me so!&quot; 
              said Amy, who thought the old-fashioned address very elegant. </p>
            <p>&quot;`I have had many pairs of slippers in my life, but I never 
              had any that suited me so well as yours, '&quot; continues Jo. &quot;`Heartsease 
              is my favorite flower, and these will always remind me of the gentle 
              giver. I like to pay my debts, so I know you will allow `the old 
              gentleman' to send you something which once belonged to the little 
              grand daughter he lost. With hearty thanks and best wishes, I remain 
              &quot;`Your grateful friend and humble servant,&quot;</p>
            <p>`JAMES LAURENCE' </p>
            <p>&quot;There, Beth, that's an honor to be proud of, I'm sure! Laurie 
              told me how fond Mr.Laurence used to be of the child who died, and 
              how he kept all her little things carefully. Just think, he's given 
              you her piano. That comes of having big blue eyes and loving music,&quot; 
              said Jo, trying to soothe Beth, who trembled and looked more excited 
              than she had ever been before. </p>
            <p>&quot;See the cunning brackets to hold candles, and the nice green 
              sild, puckered up, with a gold rose in the middle, and the pretty 
              rack and stool, all complete,&quot; added Meg, opening the instrument 
              and displaying its beauties. </p>
            <p>&quot;`Your humble servant, James Laurence'. Only think of his 
              writing that to you. I'll tell the girls. They'll think it's splendid,&quot; 
              said Amy, much impressed by the note. </p>
            <p>&quot;Try it, honey. Let's hear the sound of the baby pianny,&quot; 
              said Hannah, who always took a share in the family joys and sorrows. 
            </p>
            <p>So Beth tried it, and everyone pronounced it the most remarkable 
              piano ever heard. It had evidently been newly tuned and put in apple- 
              pie order, but, perfect as it was, I think the real charm lay in 
              the happiest of all happy faces which leaned over it, as Beth lovingly 
              touched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright 
              pedals. </p>
            <p>&quot;You'll have to go and thank him,&quot; said Jo, by way of 
              a joke, for the idea of the child's really going never entered her 
              head. </p>
            <p> &quot;Yes, I mean to. I guess I'll go no, before I get frightened 
              thinking about it.&quot; And, to the utter amazement of the assembled 
              family, Beth walked deliberately down the garden, through the hedge, 
              and in at the Laurences' door. </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, I wish I may die if it ain't the queerest thing I ever 
              see! The pianny has turned her head! She'd never have gone in her 
              right mind,&quot; cried Hannah, staring after her, while the girls 
              were rendered quite speechless by the miracle. </p>
            <p>They would have been still more amazed if they had seen what Beth 
              did afterward. If you will believe me, she went and knocked at the 
              study door before she gave herself time to think, and when a gruff 
              voice called out, &quot;come in!&quot; she did go in, right up to 
              Mr. Laurence, who looked quite taken aback, and held out her hand, 
              saying, with only a small quaver in her voice, &quot;I came to thank 
              you, sir, for...&quot; But she didn't finish, for he looked so friendly 
              that she forgot her speech and, only remembering that he had lost 
              the little girl he loved, she put both arms round his neck and kissed 
              him. </p>
            <p>If the roof of the house had suddenly flown off, the old gentleman 
              wouldn't have been more astonished. But he liked it. Oh, dear, yes, 
              he liked it amazingly! And was so touched and pleased by that confiding 
              little kiss that all his crustiness vanished, and he just set her 
              on his knee, and laid his wrinkled cheek against her rosy one, feeling 
              as if he had got his own little grand daughter back again. Beth 
              ceased to fear him from that moment, and sat there talking to him 
              as cozily as if she had known him all her life, for love casts out 
              fear, and gratitude can conquer pride. When she went home, he walked 
              with her to her own gate, shook hands cordially, and touched his 
              hat as he marched back again, looking very stately and erect, like

            <p><br>
              Fortune suddenly smiled upon Jo, and dropped a good luck penny in 
              her path. Not a golden penny, exactly, but I doubt if half a million 
              would have given more real happiness then did the little sum that 
              came to her in this wise. </p>
            <p>Every few weeks she would shut herself up in her room, put on her 
              scribbling suit, and `fall into a vortex', as she expressed it, 
              writing away at her novel with all her heart and soul, for till 
              that was finished she could find no peace. Her `scribbling suit' 
              consisted of a black woolen pinafore on which she could wipe her 
              pen at will, and a cap of the same material, adorned with a cheerful 
              red bow, into which she bundled her hair when the decks were cleared 
              for action. This cap was a beacon to the inquiring eyes of her family, 
              who during these periods kept their distance, merely popping in 
              their heads semi-occasionally to ask, with interest, &quot;Does 
              genius burn, Jo?&quot; They did not always venture even to ask this 
              question, but took an observation of the cap, and judged accordingly. 
              If this expressive article of dress was drawn low upon the forehead, 
              it was a sign that hard work was going on, in exciting moments it 
              was pushed rakishly askew, and when despair seized the author it 
              was plucked wholly off, and cast upon the floor, and cast upon the 
              floor. At such times the intruder silently withdrew, and not until 
              the red bow was seen gaily erect upon the gifted brow, did anyone 
              dare address Jo. </p>
            <p>She did not think herself a genius by any means, but when the writing 
              fit came on, she gave herself up to it with entire abandon, and 
              led a blissful life, unconscious of want, care, or bad weather, 
              while she sat safe and happy in an imaginary world, full of friends 
              almost as real and dear to her as any in the flesh. Sleep forsook 
              her eyes, meals stood untasted, day and night were all too short 
              to enjoy the happiness which blessed her only at such times, and 
              made these hours worth living, even if they bore no other fruit. 
              The devine afflatus usually lasted a week or two, and then she emerged 
              from her `vortex', hungry, sleepy, cross, or despondent. </p>
            <p>She was just recovering from one of these attacks when she was 
              prevailed upon to escort Miss Crocker to a lecture, and in return 
              for her virtue was rewarded with a new idea. It was a People's Course, 
              the lecture on the Pyramids, and Jo rather wondered at the choice 
              of such a subject for such an audience, but took it for granted 
              that some great social evil would be remedied or some great want 
              supplied by unfolding the glories of the Pharaohs to an audience 
              whose thoughts were busy with the price of coal and flour, and whose 
              lives were spent in trying to solve harder riddles than that of 
              the Sphinx. </p>
            <p>They were early, and while Miss Crocker set the heel of her stocking, 
              Jo amused herself by examining the faces of the people who occupied 
              the seat with them. On her left were two matrons, with massive foreheads 
              and bonnets to match, discussing Women's Rights and making tatting. 
              Beyond sat a pair of humble lovers, artlessly holding each other 
              by the hand, a somber spinster eating peppermints out of a paper 
              bag, and an old gentleman taking his preparatory nap behind a yellow 
              bandanna. On her right, her only neighbor was a studious looking 
              lad absorbed in a newspaper. </p>
            <p>It was a pictorial sheet, and Jo examined the work of art nearest 
              her, idly wondering what fortuitous concatenation of circumstances 
              needed the melodramatic illustration of an Indian in full war costume, 
              tumbling over a precipice with a wolf at his throat, while two infuriated 
              young gentlemen, with unnaturally small feet and big eyes,were stabbing 
              each other close by, and a disheveled female was flying away in 
              the background with her mouth wide open. Pausing to turn a page, 
              the lad saw her looking and, with boyish good nature offered half 
              his paper, saying bluntly, &quot;want to read it? That's a first-rate 
              story.&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo accepted it with a smile, for she had never outgrown her liking 
              for lads, and soon found herself involved in the usual labyrinth 
              of love, mystery, and murder, for the story belonged to that class 
              of light literature in which the passions have a holiday, and when 
              the author's invention fails, a grand catastrophe clears the stage 
              of one half the dramatis personae, leaving the other half to exult 
              over their downfall. </p>
            <p>&quot;Prime, isn't it?&quot; asked the boy, as her eye went down 
              the last paragraph of her portion. </p>
            <p>&quot;I think you and I could do as well as that if we tried,&quot; 
              returned Jo, amused at his admiration of the trash. </p>
            <p>&quot;I should think I was a pretty lucky chap if I could. She 
              makes a good living out of such stories, they say.&quot; And he 
              pointed to the name of Mrs. S.L.A.N.G. Northbury, under the title 
              of the tale. </p>
            <p> &quot;Do you know her?&quot; asked Jo, with sudden interest. </p>
            <p>&quot;No, but I read all her pieces, and I know a fellow who works 
              in the office where this paper is printed.&quot; &quot;Do you say 
              she makes a good living out of stories like this?&quot; And Jo looked 
              more respectfully at the agitated group and thickly sprinkled exclamation 
              points that adorned the page. </p>
            <p>&quot;Guess she does! She knows just what folks like, and gets 
              paid well for writing it.&quot; </p>
            <p>Here the lecture began, but Jo heard very little of it, for while 
              Professor Sands was prosing away about Belzoni, Cheops, scarabei, 
              and hieroglyphics, she was covertly taking down the address of the 
              paper, and boldly resolving to try for the hundred-dollar prize 
              offered in its columns for a sensational story. By the time the 
              lecture ended and the audience awoke, she had built up a splendid 
              fortune for herself (not the first founded on paper), and was already 
              deep in the concoction of her story, being unable to decide whether 
              the duel should come before the elopement or after the murder. </p>
            <p>She said nothing of her plan at home, but fell to work next day, 
              much to the disquiet of her mother, who always looked a little anxious 
              when `genius took to burning'. Jo had never tried this style before, 
              contenting herself with very mild romances for THE SPREAD EAGLE. 
              Her experience and miscellaneous reading were of service now, for 
              they gave her some idea of dramatic effect, and supplied plot, language, 
              and costumes. Her story was as full of desperation and despair as 
              her limited acquaintance with those uncomfortable emotions enabled 
              her to make it, and having located it in Lisbon, she wound up with 
              an earthquake, as a striking and appropriate denouement. The manuscript 
              was privately dispatched, accompanied by a note, modestly saying 
              that if the tale didn't get the prize, which the writer hardly dared 
              expect, she would be very glad to receive any sum it might be considered 
              worth. </p>
            <p>Six weeks is a long time to wait, and a still longer time for a 
              girl to keep a secret, but Jo did both, and was just beginning to 
              give up all hope of ever seeing her manuscript again, when a letter 
              arrived which almost took her breath away, for on opening it, a 
              check for a hundred dollars fell into her lap. For a minute she 
              stared at it as if it had been a snake, then she read her letter 
              and began to cry. If the amiable gentleman who wrote that kindly 
              note could have known what intense happiness he was giving a fellow 
              creature, I think he would devote his leisure hours, if he has any, 
              to that amusement, for Jo valued the letter more than the money, 
              because it was encouraging, and after years of effort it was so 
              pleasant to find that she had learned to do something, though it 
              was only to write a sensation story. </p>
            <p>A prouder young woman was seldom seen than she, when, havingcomposed 
              herself, she electrified the family by appearing before them with 
              the letter in one hand, the check in the other, announcing that 
              she had won the prize. Of course there was a great jubilee, and 
              when the story came everyone read and praised it, though after her 
              father had told her that the language was good, the romance fresh 
              and hearty, and the tragedy quite thrilling, he shook his head, 
              and said in his unworldly way... </p>
            <p>&quot;You can do better than this, Jo. Aim at the highest, and 
              never mind the money.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I think the money is the best part of it. What will you do 
              with such a fortune?&quot; asked Amy, regarding the magic slip of 
              paper with a reverential eye. </p>
            <p>&quot;Send Beth and Mother to the seaside for a month or two,&quot; 
              answered Jo promptly. </p>
            <p>To the seaside they went, after much discussion, and though Beth 
              didn't come home as plump and rosy as could be desired, she was 
              much better, while Mrs. March declared she felt ten years younger. 
              So Jo was satisfied with the investment of her prize money, and 
              fell to work with a cheery spirit, bent on earning more of those 
              delightful checks. She did earn several that year, and began to 
              feel herself a power in the house, for by the magic of a pen, her 
              `rubbish' turned into comforts for them all. The Duke's Daughter 
              paid the butcher's bill, A Phantom Hand put down a new carpet, and 
              the Curse of the Coventrys proved the blessing of the Marches in 
              the way of groceries and gowns. </p>
            <p>Wealth is certainly a most desirable thing, but poverty has its 
              sunny side, and one of the sweet uses of adversity is the genuine 
              satisfaction which comes from hearty work of head or hand, and to 
              the inspiration of necessity, we owe half the wise, beautiful, and 
              useful blessings of the world. Jo enjoyed a taste of this satisfaction, 
              and ceased to envy richer girls, taking great comfort in the knowledge 
              that she could supply her own wants, and need ask no one for a penny. 
            </p>
            <p>Little notice was taken of her stories, but they found a market, 
              and encouraged by this fact, she resolved to make a bold stroke 
              for fame and fortune. Having copied her novel for the fourth time, 
              read it to all her confidential friends, and submitted it with fear 
              and trembling to three publishers, she at last disposed of it, on 
              condition that she would cut it down one third, and omit all the 
              parts which she particularly admired. </p>
            <p>&quot;Now I must either bundle it back in to my tin kitchen to 
              mold, pay for printing it myself, or chop it up to suit purchasers 
              and get what I can for it. Fame is a very good thing to have in 
              the house, but cash is more convenient, so I wish to take the sense 
              of the meeting on this important subject,&quot; said Jo, calling 
              a family council. </p>
            <p> &quot;Don't spoil your book, my girl, for there is more in it 
              than you know, and the idea is well worked out. Let it wait and 
              ripen,&quot; was her father's advice, and he practiced what he preached, 
              having waited patiently thirty years for fruit of his own to ripen, 
              and being in no haste to gather it even now when it was sweet and 
              mellow. </p>
            <p> &quot;It seems to me that Jo will profit more by taking the trial 
              than by waiting,&quot; said Mrs. March. &quot;Criticism is the best 
              test of such work, for it will show her both unsuspected merits 
              and faults, and help her to do better next time. We are too partial, 
              but the praise and blame of outsiders will prove useful, even if 
              she gets but little money.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Jo, knitting her brows, &quot;that's just 
              it. I've been fussing over the thing so long, I really don't know 
              whether it's good, bad, or indifferent. It will be a great help 
              to have cool, impartial persons take a look at it, and tell me what 
              they think of it.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;I wouldn't leave a word out of it. You'll spoil it if you 
              do, for the interest of the story is more in the minds than in the 
              actions of the people, and it will be all a muddle if you don't 
              explain as you go on,&quot; said Meg, who firmly believed that this 
              book was the most remarkable novel ever written. </p>
            <p>&quot;But Mr. Allen says, `Leave out the explanations, make it 
              brief and dramatic, and let the characters tell the story',&quot; 
              interrupted Jo, turning to the publisher's note. </p>
            <p>&quot;Do as he tells you. He knows what will sale, and we don't. 
              Make a good, popular book, and get as much money as you can. By-and-by, 
              when you've got a name, you can afford to digress, and have philosophical 
              and metaphysical people in your novels,&quot; said Amy, who took 
              a strictly practical view of the subject. </p>
            <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Jo, laughing, &quot;if my people are `philosophical 
              and metaphysical', it isn't my fault, for I know nothing about such 
              things, except what I hear father say;, sometimes. If I've got some 
              of his wise ideas jumbled up with my romance, so much the better 
              for me. Now, Beth, what do you say?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I should so like to see it printed soon,&quot; was all Beth 
              said, and smiled in saying it. But there was an unconscious emphasis 
              on the last word, and a wistful look in the eyes that never lost 
              their childlike candor, which chilled Jo's heart for a minute with 
              a forboding fear, and decided her to make her little venture `soon'. 
            </p>
            <p>So, with Spartan firmness, the young authoress laid her first-born 
              on her table, and chopped it up as ruthlessly as any ogre. In the 
              hope of pleasing everyone, she took everyone's advice, and like 
              the old man and his donkey in the fable suited nobody. </p>
            <p>Her father liked the metaphysical streak which had unconsciously 
              got into it, so that was allowed to remain though she had her doubts 
              about it. Her mother thought that there was a trifle too much description. 
              Out, therefore it came, and with it many necessary links in the 
              story. Meg admired the tragedy, so Jo piled up the agony to suit 
              her, while Amy objected to the fun, and, with the best intentions 
              in life, Jo quenched the spritly scenes which relieved the somber 
              character of the story. Then, to complicate the ruin, she cut it 
              down one third, and confidingly sent the poor little romance, like 
              a picked robin, out into the big, busy world to try its fate. </p>
            <p>Well, it was printed, and she got three hundred dollars for it, 
              likewise plenty of praise and blame, both so much greater than she 
              expected that she was thrown into a state of bewilderment from which 
              it took her some time to recover. </p>
            <p>&quot;You said, Mother, that criticism would help me. But how can 
              it, when it's so contradictory that I don't know whether I've written 
              a promising book or broken all the ten commandments?&quot; cried 
              poor Jo, turning over a heap of notices, the perusal of which filled 
              her with pride and joy one minute, wrath and dismay the next. &quot;This 
              man says, `An exquisite book, full of truth, beauty, and earnestness. 
            </p>
            <p>All is sweet, pure, and healthy.'&quot; continued the perplexed 
              authoress. &quot;The next, `The theory of the book is bad, full 
              of morbid fancies, spiritualistic ideas, and unnatural characters.' 
              Now, as I had no theory of any kind, don't believe in Spiritualism, 
              and copied my characters from life, I don't see how this critic 
              can be right. Another says, `It's one of the best American novels 
              which has appeared for years.' (I know better than that), and the 
              next asserts that `Though it is original, and written with great 
              force and feeling, it is a dangerous book.' 'Tisn't! Some make fun 
              of it, some overpraise, and nearly all insist that I had a deep 
              theory to expound, when I only wrote it for the pleasure and the 
              money. I wish I'd printed the whole or not at all, for I do hate 
              to be so misjudged.&quot; </p>
            <p>Her family and friends administered comfort and commendation liberally. 
              Yet it was a hard time for sensitive, high-spirited Jo, who meant 
              so well and had apparently done so ill. But it did her good, for 
              those whose opinion had real value gave her the critism which is 
              an author's best education, and when the first soreness was over, 
              she could laugh at her poor little book, yet believe in it still, 
              and feel herself the wiser and stronger for the buffeting she had 
              received. </p>
            <p>&quot;Not being a genius, like Keats, it won't kill me,&quot; she 
              said stoutly, &quot;and I've got the joke on my side, after all, 
              for the parts that were taken straight out of real life are denounced 
              as impossible and absurd, and the scenes that I made up out of my 
              own silly head are pronounced `charmingly natural, tender, and true'. 
              So I'll comfort myself with that, and when I'm ready, I'll up again 
              and take another.&quot; </p>

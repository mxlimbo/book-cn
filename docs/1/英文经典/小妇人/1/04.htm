            <p><br>
              &quot;Oh, dear, how hard it does seem to take up our packs and go 
              on,&quot; sighed Meg the morning after the party, for now the holidays 
              were over, the week of merrymaking did not fit her for going on 
              easily with the task she never liked. </p>
            <p>&quot;I wish it was Christmas or New Year's all the time. Wouldn't 
              it be fun?&quot; answered Jo, yawning dismally. </p>
            <p>&quot;We shouldn't enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now. But 
              it does seem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets, and go 
              to parties, and drive home, and read and rest, and not work. It's 
              like other people, you know, and I always envy girls who do such 
              things, I'm so fond of luxury,&quot; said Meg, trying to decide 
              which of two shabby gowns was the least shabby. </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, we can't have it, so don't let us grumble but shoulder 
              our bundles and trudge along as cheerfully as Marmee does. I'm sure 
              Aunt March is a regular Old Man of the Sea to me, but I suppose 
              when I've learned to carry her without complaining, she will tumble 
              off, or get so light that I shan't mind her.&quot; </p>
            <p>This idea tickled Jo's fancy and put her in good spirits, but Meg 
              didn't brighten, for her burden, consisting of four spoiled children, 
              seemed heavier than ever. She had not heart enough even to make 
              herself pretty as usual by putting on a blue neck ribbon and dressing 
              her hair in the most becoming way. </p>
            <p>&quot;Where's the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but 
              those cross midgets, and no one cares whether I'm pretty or not?&quot; 
              she muttered, shutting her drawer with a jerk. &quot;I shall have 
              to toil and moil all my days, with only little bits of fun now and 
              then, and get old and ugly and sour, because I'm poor and can't 
              enjoy my life as other girls do. It's a shame!&quot; </p>
            <p>So Meg went down, wearing an injured look, and wasn't at all agreeable 
              at breakfast time. Everyone seemed rather out of sorts and inclined 
              to croak. </p>
            <p>Beth had a headache and lay on the sofa, trying to comfort herself 
              with the cat and three kittens. Amy was fretting because her lessons 
              were not learned, and she couldn't find her rubbers. Jo would whistle 
              and make a great racket getting ready. </p>
            <p>Mrs. March was very busy trying to finish a letter, which must 
              go at once, and Hannah had the grumps, for being up late didn't 
              suit her. </p>
            <p>&quot;There never was such a cross family!&quot; cried Jo, losing 
              her temper when she had upset an inkstand, broken both boot lacings, 
              and sat down upon her hat. </p>
            <p>&quot;You're the crossest person in it!&quot; returned Amy, washing 
              out the sum that was all wrong with the tears that had fallen on 
              her slate. </p>
            <p>&quot;Beth, if you don't keep these horrid cats down cellar I'll 
              have them drowned,&quot; exclaimed Meg angrily as she tried to get 
              rid of the kitten which had scrambled up her back and stuck like 
              a burr just out of reach.</p>
            <p>Jo laughed, Meg scolded, Beth implored, and Amy wailed because 
              she couldn't remember how much nine times twelve was. </p>
            <p>&quot;Girls, girls, do be quiet one minute! I must get this off 
              by the early mail, and you drive me distracted with your worry,&quot; 
              cried Mrs. March, crossing out the third spoiled sentence in her 
              letter. </p>
            <p>There was a momentary lull, broken by Hannah, who stalked in, laid 
              two hot turnovers on the table, and stalked out again. These turnovers 
              were an institution, and the girls called them `muffs', for they 
              had no others and found the hot pies very comforting to their hands 
              on cold mornings. </p>
            <p>Hannah never forgot to make them, no matter how busy or grumpy 
              she might be, for the walk was long and bleak. The poor things got 
              no other lunch and were seldom home before two. </p>
            <p>&quot;Cuddle your cats and get over your headache, Bethy. Goodbye, 
              Marmee. We are a set of rascals this morning, but we'll come home 
              regular angels. Now then, Meg!&quot; And Jo tramped away, feeling 
              that the pilgrims were not setting out as they ought to do. </p>
            <p>They always looked back before turning the corner, for their mother 
              was always at the window to nod and smile, and wave her hand to 
              them. Somehow it seemed as if they couldn't have got through the 
              day without that, for whatever their mood might be, the last glimpse 
              of that motherly face was sure to affect them like sunshine. </p>
            <p>&quot;If Marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us, 
              it would serve us right, for more ungrateful wretches than we are 
              were never seen,&quot; cried Jo, taking a remorseful satisfaction 
              in the snowy walk and bitter wind. &quot;Don't use such dreadful 
              expressions,&quot; replied Meg from the depths of the veil in which 
              she had shrouded herself like a nun sick of the world. </p>
            <p>&quot;I like good strong words that mean something,&quot; replied 
              Jo, catching her hat as it took a leap off her head preparatory 
              to flying away altogether. </p>
            <p>&quot;Call yourself any names you like, but I am neither a rascal 
              nor a wretch and I don't choose to be called so.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You're a blighted being, and decidedly cross today because 
              you can't sit in the lap of luxury all the time. Poor dear, just 
              wait till I make my fortune, and you shall revel in carriages and 
              ice cream and high-heeled slippers, and posies, and red-headed boys 
              to dance with.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;How ridiculous you are, Jo!&quot; But Meg laughed at the 
              nonsense and felt better in spite of herself. </p>
            <p>&quot;Lucky for you I am, for if I put on crushed airs and tried 
              to be dismal, as you do, we should be in a nice state. Thank goodness, 
              I can always find something funny to keep me up. Don't croak any 
              more, but come home jolly, there's a dear.&quot; </p>
            <p>Jo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they parted 
              for the day, each going a different way, each hugging her little 
              warm turnover, and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry 
              weather, hard work, and the unsatisfied desires of pleasure-loving 
              youth. </p>
            <p>When Mr. March lost his property in trying to help an unfortunate 
              friend, the two oldest girls begged to be allowed to do something 
              toward their own support, at least. Believing that they could not 
              begin too early to cultivate energy, industry, and independence, 
              their parents consented, and both fell to work with the hearty good 
              will which in spite of all obstacles is sure to succeed at last. 
            </p>
            <p>Margaret found a place as nursery governess and felt rich with 
              her small salary. As she said, she was `fond of luxury', and her 
              chief trouble was poverty. She found it harder to bear than the 
              others because she could remember a time when home was beautiful, 
              life full of ease and pleasure, and want of any kind unknown. She 
              tried not to be envious or discontented, but it was very natural 
              that the young girl should long for pretty things, gay friends, 
              accomplishments, and a happy life. At the Kings' she daily saw all 
              she wanted, for the children's older sisters were just out, and 
              Meg caught frequent glimpses of dainty ball dresses and bouquets, 
              heard lively gossip about theaters, concerts, sleighing parties, 
              and merrymakings of all kinds, and saw money lavished on trifles 
              which would have been so precious to her. Poor Meg seldom complained, 
              but a sense of injustice made her feel bitter toward everyone sometimes, 
              for she had not yet learned to know how rich she was in the blessings 
              which alone can make life happy. </p>
            <p>Jo happened to suit Aunt March, who was lame and needed an active 
              person to wait upon her. The childless old lady had offered to adopt 
              one of the girls when the troubles came, and was much offended because 
              her offer was declined. Other friends told the Marches that they 
              had lost all chance of being remembered in the rich old lady's will, 
              but the unworldly Marches only said... </p>
            <p>&quot;We can't give up our girls for a dozen fortunes. Rich or 
              poor, we will keep together and be happy in one another.&quot; </p>
            <p>The old lady wouldn't speak to them for a time, but happening to 
              meet Jo at at a friend's, something in her comical face and blunt 
              manners struck the old lady's fancy, and she proposed to take her 
              for a companion. This did not suit Jo at all, but she accepted the 
              place since nothing better appeared and, to every one's surprise, 
              got on remarkably well with her irascible relative. There was an 
              occasional tempest, and once Jo marched home, declaring she couldn't 
              bear it longer, but Aunt March always cleared up quickly, and sent 
              for her to come back again with such urgency that she could not 
              refuse, for in her heart she rather liked the peppery old lady. 
            </p>
            <p>I suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine 
              books, which was left to dust and spiders since Uncle March died. 
              Jo remembered the kind old gentleman, who used to let her build 
              railroads and bridges with his big dictionaries, tell her stories 
              about queer pictures in his Latin books, and buy her cards of gingerbread 
              whenever he met her in the street. The dim, dusty room, with the 
              busts staring down from the tall bookcases, the cozy chairs, the 
              globes, and best of all, the wilderness of books in which she could 
              wander where she liked, made the library a region of bliss to her. 
            </p>
            <p>The moment Aunt March took her nap, or was busy with company, Jo 
              hurried to this quiet place, and curling herself up in the easy 
              chair, devoured poetry, romance, history, travels, and pictures 
              like a regular bookworm. But, like all happiness, it did not last 
              long, for as sure as she had just reached the heart of the story, 
              the sweetest verse of a song, or the most perilous adventure of 
              her traveler, a shrill voice called, &quot;Josy-phine! Josy-phine! 
              and she had to leave her paradise to wind yarn, wash the poodle, 
              or read Belsham's Essays by the hour together. </p>
            <p>Jo's ambition was to do something very splendid. What it was, she 
              had no idea as yet, but left it for time to tell her, and meanwhile, 
              found her greatest affliction in the fact that she couldn't read, 
              run, and ride as much as she liked. A quick temper, sharp tongue, 
              and restless spirit were always getting her into scrapes, and her 
              life was a series of ups and downs, which were both comic and pathetic. 
              But the training she received at Aunt March's was just what she 
              needed, and the thought that she was doing something to support 
              herself made her happy in spite of the perpetual &quot;Josy-phine!&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>Beth was too bashful to go to school.It had been tried, but she 
              suffered so much that it was given up, and she did her lessons at 
              home with her father. Even when he went away, and her mother was 
              called to devote her skill and energy to Soldiers' Aid Societies, 
              Beth went faithfully on by herself and did the best she could. She 
              was a housewifely little creature, and helped Hannah keep home neat 
              and comfortable for the workers, never thinking of any reward but 
              to be loved. Long, quiet days she spent, not lonely nor idle, for 
              her little world was peopled with imaginary friends, and she was 
              by nature a busy bee. There were six dolls to be taken up and dressed 
              every morning, for Beth was a child still and and loved her pets 
              as well as ever. Not one whole or handsome one among them, all were 
              outcasts till Beth took them in, for when her sisters outgrew these 
              idols, they passed to her because Amy would have nothing old or 
              ugly. Beth cherished them all the more tenderly for that very reason, 
              and set up a hospital for infirm dolls. No pins were ever stuck 
              into their cotton vitals, no harsh words or blows were ever given 
              them, no neglect ever saddened the heart or the most repulsive, 
              but all were fed and clothed, nursed and caressed with an affection 
              which never failed. One forlorn fragment of dollanity had belonged 
              to Jo and, having led a tempestuous life, was left a wreck in the 
              rag bag, from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued by Beth and 
              taken to her refuge. Having no top to its head, she tied on a neat 
              little cap, and as both arms and legs were gone, she hid these deficiencies 
              by folding it in a blanket and devoting her best bed to this chronic 
              invalid. If anyone had known the care lavished on that dolly, I 
              think it would have touched their hearts, even while they laughed. 
              She brought it bits of bouquets, she read to it, took it out to 
              breathe fresh air, hidden under her coat, she sang it lullabies 
              and never went to be without kissing its dirty face and whispering 
              tenderly, &quot;I hope you'll have a good night, my poor dear.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>Beth had her troubles as well as the others, and not being an angel 
              but a very human little girl, she often `wept a little weep' as 
              Jo said, because she couldn't take music lessons and have a fine 
              piano. She loved music so dearly, tried so hard to learn, and practiced 
              away so patiently at the jingling old instrument, that it did seem 
              as if someone (not to hint Aunt March) ought to help her. Nobody 
              did, however, and nobody saw Beth wipe the tears off the yellow 
              keys, that wouldn't keep in tune, when she was all alone. She sang 
              like a little lark about her work, never was too tired for Marmee 
              and the girls, and day after day said hopefully to herself,&quot; 
              I know I'll get my music some time, if I'm good.&quot; <br>
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>There are many Beths in the world, shy and quiet, sitting in corners 
              till needed, and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees 
              the sacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping, 
              and the sweet, sunshiny presence vanishes, leaving silence and shadow 
              behind. </p>
            <p>If anybody had asked Amy what the greatest trial of her life was, 
              she would have answered at once, &quot;My nose.&quot; When she was 
              a baby, Jo had accidently dropped her into the coal hod, and Amy 
              insisted that the fall had ruined her nose forever. It was not big 
              nor red, like poor `Petrea's', it was only rather flat, and all 
              the pinching in the world could not give it an aristocratic point. 
              No one minded it but herself, and it was doing its best to grow, 
              but Amy felt deeply the want of a Grecian nose, and drew whole sheets 
              of handsome ones to console herself. </p>
            <p>&quot;Little Raphael,&quot; as her sisters called her, had a decided 
              talent for drawing, and was never so happy as when copying flowers, 
              designing fairies, or illustrating stories with queer specimens 
              of art. Her teachers complained that instead of doing her sums she 
              covered her slate with animals, the blankpages of her atlas were 
              used to copy maps on, and caricatures of the most ludicrous description 
              came fluttering out of all her books at unlucky moments. She got 
              through her lessons as well as she could, and managed to escape 
              reprimands by being a model of deportment. She was a great favorite 
              with her mates, being good-tempered and possessing the happy art 
              of pleasing without effort. Her little airs and graces were much 
              admired, so were her accomplishments, for besides her drawing, she 
              could play twelve tunes, crochet, and read French without mispronouncing 
              more than two-thirds of the words. She had a plaintive way of saying, 
              &quot;When Papa was rich we did so-and-so,&quot; which was very 
              touching, and her long words were considered `perfectly elegant' 
              by the girls. </p>
            <p>Amy was in a fair way to be spoiled, for everyone petted her, and 
              her small vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely. One thing, 
              however, rather quenched the vanities. She had to wear her cousin's 
              clothes. Now Florence's mama hadn't a particle of taste, and Amy 
              suffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet, 
              unbecoming gowns, and fussy aprons that did not fit. Everything 
              was good, well made, and little worn, but Amy's artistic eyes were 
              much afflicted, especially this winter, when her school dress was 
              a dull purple with yellow dots and no trimming. </p>
            <p>&quot;My only comfort,&quot; she said to Meg, with tears in her 
              eyes, &quot;is that Mother doesn't take tucks in my dresses whenever 
              I'm naughty, as Maria Parks's mother does. My dear, it's really 
              dreadful, for sometimes she is so bad her frock is up to her knees, 
              and she can't come to school. When I think of this deggerredation, 
              I fell that I can bear even my flat nose and purple gown with yellow 
              skyrockets on it.&quot; </p>
            <p>Meg was Amy's confidante and monitor, and by some strange attraction 
              of opposites Jo was gentle Beth's. To Jo alone did the shy child 
              tell her thoughts, and over her big harum-scarum sister Beth unconsciously 
              exercised more influence than anyone in the family. The two older 
              girls were a great deal to one another, but each took one of the 
              younger sisters into her keeping and watched over her in her own 
              way, `playing mother' they called it, and put their sisters in the 
              places of discarded dolls with the maternal instinct of litte women. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Has anybody got anything to tell? It's been such a dismal 
              day I'm really dying for some amusement,&quot; said Meg, as they 
              sat sewing together that evening. </p>
            <p>&quot;I had a queer time with Aunt today, and, as I got the best 
              of it, I'll tell you about it,&quot; began Jo, who dearly loved 
              to tell stories. &quot;I was reading that everlasting Belsham, and 
              droning away as I always do, for Aunt soon drops off, and then I 
              take out some nice book, and read like fury till she wakes up. I 
              actually made myself sleepy, and before she began to nod, I gave 
              such a gape that she asked me what I meant by opening my mouth wide 
              enough to take the whole book in at once. </p>
            <p>&quot;I wish I could, and be done with it,&quot; said I, trying 
              not to be saucy.</p>
            <p>&quot;Then she gave me a long lecture on my sins, and told me to 
              sit and think them over while she just `lost' herself for a moment. 
              She never finds herself very soon, so the minute her cap began to 
              bob like a top-heavy dahlia, I whipped the VICAR OF WAKEFIELD out 
              of my pocket, and read away, with one eye on him and one on Aunt. 
              I'd just got to where they all tumbled into the water when I forgot 
              and laughed out loud. Aunt woke up and, being more good-natured 
              after her nap, told me to read a bit and show what frivolous work 
              I preferred to the worthy and instructive Belsham. I did my very 
              best, and she liked it, though she only said... </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't understand what it's all about. Go back and begin 
              it, child.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Back I went, and made the Primroses as interesting as ever 
              I could. Once I was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place, 
              and say meekly, &quot;I'm afraid it tires you, ma'am. Shan't I stop 
              now?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;She caught up her knitting, which had dropped out of her 
              hands, gave me a sharp look through her specs, and said, in her 
              short way, `Finish the chapter, and don't be impertinent, miss'.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Did she own she liked it?&quot; asked Meg. </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, bless you, no! But she let old Belsham rest, and when 
              I ran back after my gloves this afternoon, there she was, so hard 
              at the Vicar that she didn't hear me laugh as I danced a jig in 
              the hall because of the good time coming. What a pleasant life she 
              might have if only she chose! I don't envy her much, in spite of 
              her money, for after all rich people have about as many worries 
              as poor ones, I think,&quot; added Jo. </p>
            <p>&quot;That reminds me,&quot; said Meg, &quot;that I've got something 
              to tell. It isn't funny, like Jo's story, but I thought about it 
              a good deal as I came home. At the Kings' today I found everybody 
              in a flurry, and one of the children said that her oldest brother 
              had done something dreadful, and Papa had sent him away. I heard 
              Mrs. King crying and Mr. King talking very loud, and Grace and Ellen 
              turned away their faces when they passed me, so I shouldn't see 
              how red and swollen their eyes were. I didn't ask any questions, 
              of course, but I felt so sorry for them and was rather glad I hadn't 
              any wild brothers to do wicked things and disgrace the family.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I think being disgraced in school is a great deal tryinger 
              than anything bad boys can do,&quot; said Amy, shaking her head, 
              as if her experience of life had been a deep one. &quot;Susie Perkins 
              came to school today with a lovely red carnelian ring. I wanted 
              it dreadfully, and wished I was her with all my might. Well, she 
              drew a picture of Mr. Davis, with a monstrous nose and a hump, and 
              the words, `Young ladies, my eye is upon you!' coming out of his 
              mouth in a balloon thing. We were laughing over it when all of a 
              sudden his eye was on us, and he ordered Susie to bring up her slate. 
              She was parrylized with fright, but she went, and oh, what do you 
              think he did? He took her by the ear--the ear! Just fancy how horrid!--and 
              led her to the recitation platform, and made her stand there half 
              and hour, holding the slate so everyone could see.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Didn't the girls laugh at the picture?&quot; asked Jo, who 
              relished the scrape. </p>
            <p>&quot;Laugh? Not one! They sat still as mice, and Susie cried quarts, 
              I know she did. I didn't envy her then, for I felt that millions 
              of carnelian rings wouldn't have made me happy after that. I never, 
              never should have got over such a agonizing mortification.&quot; 
              And Amy went on with her work, in the proud consciousness of virtue 
              and the successful utterance of two long words in a breath. </p>
            <p>&quot;I saw something I liked this morning, and I meant to tell 
              it at dinner, but I forgot,&quot; said Beth, putting Jo's topsy-turvy 
              basket in order as she talked. &quot;When I went to get some oysters 
              for Hannah, Mr. Laurence was in the fish shop, but he didn't see 
              me, for I kept behind the fish barrel, and he was busy with Mr. 
              Cutter the fishman. A poor woman came in with a pail a mop, and 
              asked Mr. Cutter if he would let her do some scrubbing for a bit 
              of fish, because she hadn't any dinner for her children, and had 
              been disappointed of a day's work. Mr. Cutter was in a hurry and 
              said `No', rather crossly, so she was going away, looking hungry 
              and sorry, when Mr. Laurence hooked up a big fish with the crooked 
              end of his cane and held it out to her. She was so glad and surprised 
              she took it right into her arms, and thanked him over and over. 
              He told her to `go along and cook it', and she hurried off, so happy! 
              Wasn't it good of him? Oh, she did look so funny, hugging the big, 
              slippery fish, and hoping Mr. Laurence's bed in heaven would be 
              `aisy'.&quot; </p>
            <p>When they had laughed at Beth's story, they asked their mother 
              for one, and after a moments thought, she said soberly, &quot;As 
              I sat cutting out blue flannel jackets today at the rooms, I felt 
              very anxious about Father, and thought how lonely and helpless we 
              should be , if anything happened to him. It was not a wise thing 
              to do, but I kept on worrying till an old man came in with an order 
              for some clothes. He sat down near me, and I began to talk to him, 
              for he looked poor and tired and anxious. </p>
            <p>&quot;`Have you sons in the army?' I asked, for the note he brought 
              was not to me.</p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, ma'am. I had four, but two were killed, one is a prisoner, 
              and I'm going to the other, who is very sick in a Washington hospital.' 
              he answered quietly. </p>
            <p>&quot;`You have done a great deal for your country, sir, ' I said, 
              feeling respect now, instead of pity. </p>
            <p>&quot;`Not a mite more than I ought, ma'am. I'd go myself, if I 
              was any use. As I ain't, I give my boys, and give 'em free.' </p>
            <p>&quot;He spoke so cheerfully, looked so sincere, and seemed so 
              glad to give his all, that I was ashamed of myself. I'd given one 
              man and thought it too much, while he gave four without grudging 
              them. I had all my girls to comfort me at home, and his last son 
              was waiting, miles away, to say good-by to him, perhaps! I felt 
              so rich, so happy thinking of my blessings, that I made him a nice 
              bundle, gave him some money, and thanked him heartily for the lesson 
              he had taught me.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Tell another story, Mother, one with a moral to it, like 
              this. I like to think about them afterward, if they are real and 
              not too preachy,&quot; said Jo, after a minute's silence. </p>
            <p>Mrs. March smiled and began at once, for she had told stories to 
              this little audience for many years, and knew how to please them. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Once upon a time, there were four girls, who had enough 
              to eat and drink and wear, a good many comforts and pleasures, kind 
              friends and parents who loved them dearly, and yet they were not 
              contented.&quot; </p>
            <p>(Here the listeners stole sly looks at one another, and began to 
              sew diligently.)</p>
            <p>&quot;These girls were anxious to be good and made many excellent 
              resolutions, but they did not keep them very well, and were constantly 
              saying, `If only we had this, ' or `If we could only do that, ' 
              quite forgetting how much they already had, and how many things 
              they actually could do. So they asked an old woman what spell they 
              could use to make them happy, and she said, `When you feel discontented, 
              think over your blessings, and be grateful.'&quot; (Here Jo looked 
              up quickly, as if about to speak, but changed her mind, seeing that 
              the story was not done yet.) </p>
            <p>&quot;Being sensible girls, they decided to try her advice, and 
              soon were surprised to see how well off they were. One discovered 
              that money couldn't keep shame and sorrow out of rich people's houses, 
              another that, though she was poor, she was a great deal happier, 
              with her youth, health, and good spirits, than a certain fretful, 
              feeble old lady who couldn't enjoy her comforts, a third that, disagreeable 
              as it was to help get dinner, it was harder still to go begging 
              for it and the fourth, that even carnelian rings were not so valuable 
              as good behavior. So they agreed to stop complaining, to enjoy the 
              blessings already possessed, and try to deserve them, lest they 
              should be taken away entirely, instead of increased, and I believe 
              they were never disappointed or sorry that they took the old woman's 
              advice.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Now, Marmee, that is very cunning of you to turn our own 
              stories against us, and give us a sermon instead of a romance!&quot; 
              cried Meg. </p>
            <p>&quot;I like that kind of sermon. It's the sort Father used to 
              tell us,&quot; said Beth thoughtfully, putting the needles straight 
              on Jo's cushion. </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't complain near as much as the others do, and I shall 
              be more careful than ever now, for I've had warning from Susies's 
              downfall,&quot; said Amy morally. </p>
            <p>&quot;We needed that lesson, and we won't forget it. If we do so, 
              you just say to us, as old Chloe did in UNCLE TOM, `Tink ob yer 
              marcies, chillen! `Tink ob yer marcies!'&quot; added Jo, who could 
              not, for the life of her, help getting a morsel of fun out of the 
              little sermon, though she took it to heart as much as any of them.

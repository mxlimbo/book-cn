            <p>&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Like bees swarming after their queen, mother and daughters hovered 
              about Mr. March the next day, neglecting everything to look at, 
              wait upon, and listen to the new invalid, who was in a fair way 
              to be killed by kindness. As he sat propped up in a big chair by 
              Beth's sofa, with the other three close by, and Hannah popping in 
              her head now and then `to peek at the dear man', nothing seemed 
              needed to complete their happiness. But something was needed, and 
              the elder ones felt it, though none confessed the fact. Mr. and 
              Mrs. March looked at one another with an anxious expression, as 
              their eyes followed Meg. Jo had sudden fits of sobriety, and was 
              seen to shake her fist at Mr. Brooke's umbrella, which had been 
              left in the hall. Meg was absent-minded, shy, and silent, started 
              when the bell rang, and colored when John's name was mentioned. 
              Amy said, &quot;Everyone seemed waiting for something, and couldn't 
              settle down, which was queer, since Father was safe at home,&quot; 
              and Beth innocently wondered why their neighbors didn't run over 
              as usual. </p>
            <p>Laurie went by in the afternoon, and seeing Meg at the window, 
              seemed suddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit, for he fell down 
              on one knee in the snow, beat his breast, tore his hair, and clasped 
              his hands imploringly, as if begging some boon. And when Meg told 
              him to behave himself and go away, he wrung imaginary tears out 
              of his handkerchief, and staggered round the corner as if in utter 
              despair. </p>
            <p>&quot;What does the goose mean?&quot; said Meg, laughing and trying 
              to look unconscious. </p>
            <p>&quot;He's showing you how your John will go on by-and-by. Touchin, 
              isn't it?&quot; answered Jo scornfully. </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't say my John, it isn't proper or true,&quot; but Meg's 
              voice lingered over the words as if they sounded pleasant to her. 
              &quot;Please don't plague me, Jo, I've told you I don't care much 
              about him, and there isn't to be anything said, but we are all to 
              be friendly, and go on as before.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;We can't, for something has been said, and Laurie's mischief 
              has spoiled you for me. I see it, and so does Mother. You are not 
              like your old self a bit, and seem ever so far away from me. I don't 
              mean to plague you and will bear it like a man, but I do wish it 
              was all settled. I hate to wait, so if you mean ever to do it, make 
              haste and have it over quickly,&quot; said Jo pettishly. </p>
            <p>&quot;I can't say anything till he speaks, and he won't, because 
              Father said I was too young,&quot; began Meg, bending over her work 
              with a queer little smile, which suggested that she did not quite 
              agree with her father on that point. </p>
            <p>&quot;If he did speak, you wouldn't know what to say, but would 
              cry or blush, or let him have his own way, instead of giving a good, 
              decided no.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm not so silly and weak as you think. I know just what 
              I should say, for I've planned it all, so I needn't be taken unawares. 
              There's no knowing what may happen, and I wished to be prepared.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>Jo couldn't help smiling at the important air which Meg had unconsciously 
              assumed and which was as becoming as the pretty color varying in 
              her cheeks. </p>
            <p>&quot;Would you mind telling me what you'd say?&quot; asked Jo 
              more respectfully. </p>
            <p>&quot;Not at all. You are sixteen now, quite old enough to be my 
              confidente, and my experience will be useful to you by-and-by, perhaps, 
              in your own affairs of this sort.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't mean to have any. It's fun to watch other people philander, 
              but I should feel like a fool doing it myself,&quot; said Jo, looking 
              alarmed at the thought. </p>
            <p>&quot;I think not, if you liked anyone very much, and he liked 
              you.&quot; Meg spoke as if to herself, and glanced out at the lane 
              where she had often seen lovers walking together in the summer twilight. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I thought you were going to tell your speech to that man,&quot; 
              said Jo, rudely shortening her sister's little reverie. </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, I should merely say, quite calmly and decidedly, `Thank 
              you, Mr. Brooke, you are very kind, but I agree with Father that 
              I am too young to enter into any engagement at present, so please 
              say no more, but let us be friends as we were.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Hum, that's stiff and cool enough! I don't believe you'll 
              ever say it, and I know he won't be satisfied if you do. If he goes 
              on like the rejected lovers in books, you'll give in, rather than 
              hurt his feelings.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;No, I won't. I shall tell him I've made up my mind, and shall 
              walk out of the room with dignity.&quot; </p>
            <p>Meg rose as she spoke, and was just going to rehearse the dignified 
              exit, when a step in the hall made her fly into her seat and begin 
              to sew as fast as if her life depended on finishing that particular 
              seam in a given time. Jo smothered a laugh at the sudden change, 
              and when someone gave a modest tap, opened the door with a grim 
              aspect which was anything but hospitable. </p>
            <p> &quot;Good afternoon. I came to get my umbrella, that is, to see 
              how your father finds himself today,&quot; said Mr. Brooke, getting 
              a trifle confused as his eyes went from one telltale face to the 
              other. </p>
            <p>&quot;It's very well, he's in the rack. I'll get him, and tell 
              it you are here.&quot; And having jumbled her father and the umbrella 
              well together in her reply, Jo slipped out of the room to give Meg 
              a chance to make her speech and air her dignity. But the instant 
              she vanished, Meg began to sidle toward the door, murmuring... </p>
            <p>&quot;Mother will like to see you. Pray sit down, I'll call her.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Don't go. Are you afraid of me, Margaret?&quot; And Mr. 
              Brooke looked so hurt that Meg thought she must have done something 
              very rude. She blushed up to the little curls on her forehead, for 
              he had never called her Margaret before, and she was surprised to 
              find how natural and sweet it seemed to hear him say it. Anxious 
              to appear friendly and at her ease, she put out her hand with a 
              confiding gesture, and said gratefully... </p>
            <p>&quot;How can I be afraid when you have been so kind to Father? 
              I only wish I could thank you for it.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Shall I tell you how?&quot; asked Mr. Brooke, holding the 
              small hand fast in both his own, and looking down at Meg with so 
              much love in the brown eyes that her heart began to flutter, and 
              she both longed to run away and to stop and listen. </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh no, please don't, I'd rather not,&quot; she said, trying 
              to withdraw her hand, and looking frightened in spite of her denial. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;I won't trouble you. I only want to know if you care for 
              me a little, Meg. I love you so much, dear,&quot; added Mr. Brooke 
              tenderly. </p>
            <p>This was the moment for the calm, proper speech, but Meg didn't 
              make it. She forgot every word of it, hung her head, and answered, 
              &quot;I don't know,&quot; so softly that John had to stoop down 
              to catch the foolish little reply. </p>
            <p>He seemed to think it was worth the trouble, for he smiled to himself 
              as if quite satisfied, pressed the plump hand gratefully, and said 
              in his most persuasive tone, &quot;Will you try and find out? I 
              want to know so much, for I can't go to work with any heart until 
              I learn whether I am to have my reward in the end or not.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm too young,&quot; faltered Meg, wondering was she was 
              so fluttered, yet rather enjoying it. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'll wait, and in the meantime, you could be learning to 
              like me. Would it be a very hard lesson, dear?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Not if I chose to learn it, but. . .&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Please choose to learn, Meg. I love you to teach, and this 
              is easier than German,&quot; broke in John, getting possession of 
              the other hand, so that she had no way of hiding her face as he 
              bent to look into it.</p>
            <p>His tone was properly beseeching, but stealing a shy look at him, 
              Meg saw that his eyes were merry as well as tender, and that he 
              wore the satisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his success. 
              This nettled her. Annie Moffat's foolish lessons in coquetry came 
              into her mind, and the love of power, which sleeps in the bosoms 
              of the best of little women, woke up all of a sudden and took possession 
              of her. She felt excited and strange, and not knowing what else 
              to do, followed a capricious impulse, and, withdrawing her hands, 
              said petulantly, &quot;I don't choose. Please go away and let me 
              be!&quot; </p>
            <p>Poor Mr. Brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was tumbling 
              about his ears, for he had never seen Meg in such a mood before, 
              and it rather bewildered him. </p>
            <p>&quot;Do you really mean that?&quot; he asked anxiously, following 
              her as she walked away. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, I do. I don't want to be worried about such things. 
              Father says I needn't, it's too soon and I'd rather not.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;Mayn't I hope you'll change your mind by-and-by? I'll wait 
              and say nothing till you have had more time. Don't play with me, 
              Meg. I didn't think that of you.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't think of me at all. I'd rather you wouldn't,&quot; 
              said Meg, taking a naughty satisfaction in trying her lover's patience 
              and her own power. He was grave and pale now, and looked decidedly 
              more like the novel heroes whom she admired, but he neither slapped 
              his forehead nor tramped about the room as they did. He just stood 
              looking at her so wistfully, so tenderly, that she found her heart 
              relenting in spite of herself. What would have happened next I cannot 
              say, if Aunt March had not come hobbling in at this interesting 
              minute. </p>
            <p>The old lady couldn't resist her longing to see her nephew, for 
              she had met Laurie as she took her airing, and hearing of Mr. March's 
              arrival, drove straight out to see him. The family were all busy 
              in the back part of the house, and she had made her way quietly 
              in, hoping to surprise them. She did surprise two of them so much 
              that Meg started as if she had seen a ghost, and Mr. Brooke vanished 
              into the study. </p>
            <p>&quot;Bless me, what's all this?&quot; cried the old lady with 
              a rap of her cane as she glanced from the pale young gentleman to 
              the scarlet young lady. </p>
            <p>&quot;It's Father's friend. I'm so surprised to see you!&quot; 
              stammered Meg, feeling that she was in for a lecture now. </p>
            <p>&quot;That's evident,&quot; returned Aunt March, sitting down. 
              &quot;But what is Father's friend saying to make you look like a 
              peony? There's mischief going on, and I insist upon knowing what 
              it is,&quot; with another rap. </p>
            <p>&quot;We were only talking. Mr. Brooke came for his umbrella,&quot; 
              began Meg, wishing that Mr. Brooke and the umbrella were safely 
              out of the house.</p>
            <p>&quot;Brooke? That boy's tutor? Ah! I understand now. I know all 
              about it. Jo blundered into a wrong message in one of your Father's 
              letters, and I made her tell me. You haven't gone and accepted him, 
              child?&quot; cried Aunt March, looking scandalized. </p>
            <p> &quot;Hush! He'll hear. Shan't I call Mother?&quot; said Meg, 
              much troubled. </p>
            <p>&quot;Not yet. I've something to say to you, and I must free my 
              mind at once. Tell me, do you mean to marry this Cook? If you do, 
              not one penny of my money ever goes to you. Remember that, and be 
              a sensible girl,&quot; said the old lady impressively. </p>
            <p>Now Aunt March possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit 
              of opposition in the gentlest people, and enjoyed doing it. The 
              best of us have a spice of perversity in us, especially when we 
              are young and in love. If Aunt March had begged Meg to accept John 
              Brooke, she would probably have declared she couldn't think of it, 
              but as she was preemptorily ordered not to like him, she immediately 
              made up her mind that she would. Inclination as well as perversity 
              made the decision easy, and being already much excited, Meg opposed 
              the old lady with unusual spirit. &quot;I shall marry whom I please, 
              Aunt March, and you can leave your money to anyone you like,&quot; 
              she said, nodding her head with a resolute air. </p>
            <p>&quot;Highty-tighty! Is that the way you take my advice, Miss? 
              You'll be sorry for it by-and-by, when you've tried love in a cottage 
              and found it a failure.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;It can't be a worse one than some people find in big houses,&quot; 
              retorted Meg. </p>
            <p>Aunt March put on her glasses and took a look at the girl, for 
              she did not know her in this new mood. Meg hardly knew herself, 
              she felt so brave and independent, so glad to defend John and assert 
              her right to love him, if she liked. Aunt March saw that she had 
              begun wrong, and after a little pause, made a fresh start, saying 
              as mildly as she could, &quot;Now, Meg, my dear, be reasonable and 
              take my advice. I mean it kindly, and don't want you to spoil your 
              whole life by making a mistake at the beginning. You ought to marry 
              well and help your family. It's your duty to make a rich match and 
              it ought to be impressed upon you.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Father and Mother don't think so. They like John though he 
              is poor.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Your parents, my dear, have no more worldly wisdom than a 
              pair of babies.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm glad of it,&quot; cried Meg stoutly. </p>
            <p>Aunt March took no notice, but went on with her lecture. &quot;This 
              Rook is poor and hasn't got any rich relations, has he?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;No, but he has many warm friends.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You can't live on friends, try it and see how cool they'll 
              grow. He hasn't any business, has he?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Not yet. Mr. Laurence is going to help him.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;That won't last long. James Laurence is a crotchety old fellow 
              and not to be depended on. So you intend to marry a man without 
              money, position, or business, and go on working harder than you 
              do now, when you might be comfortable all your days by minding me 
              and doing better? I thought you had more sense, Meg.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I couldn't do better if I waited half my life! John is good 
              and wise, he's got heaps of talent, he's willing to work and sure 
              to get on, he's so energetic and brave. Everyone likes and respects 
              him, and I'm proud to think he cares for me, though I'm so poor 
              and young and silly,&quot; said Meg, looking prettier than ever 
              in her earnestness. </p>
            <p>&quot;He knows you have got rich relations, child. That's the secret 
              of his liking, I suspect.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Aunt March, how dare you say such a thing? John is above 
              such meanness, and I won't listen to you a minute if you talk so,&quot; 
              cried Meg indignantly, forgetting everything but the injustice of 
              the old lady's suspicions. &quot;My John wouldn't marry for money, 
              any more than I would. We are willing to work and we mean to wait. 
              I'm not afraid of being poor, for I've been happy so far, and I 
              know I shall be with him because he loves me, and I...&quot; </p>
            <p>Meg stopped there, remembering all of a sudden that she hadn't 
              made up her mind, that she had told `her John' to go away, and that 
              he might be overhearing her inconsistent remarks. </p>
            <p>Aunt March was very angry, for she had set her heart on having 
              her pretty niece make a fine match, and something in the girl's 
              happy young face made the lonely old woman feel both sad and sour. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Well, I wash my hands of the whole affair! You are a willful 
              child, and you've lost more than you know by this piece of folly. 
              No, I won't stop. I'm disappointed in you, and haven't spirits to 
              see your father now. Don't expect anything from me when you are 
              married. Your Mr. Book's friends must take care of you. I'm done 
              with you forever.&quot; </p>
            <p>And slamming the door in Meg's face, Aunt March drove off in high 
              dudgeon. She seemed to take all the girl's courage with her, for 
              when left alone, Meg stood for a moment, undecided whether to laugh 
              or cry. Before she could make up her mind, she was taken possession 
              of by Mr. Brooke, who said all in one breath, &quot;I couldn't help 
              hearing, Meg. Thank you for defending me, and Aunt March for proving 
              that you do care for me a little bit.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I didn't know how much till she abused you,&quot; began Meg. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;And I needn't go away, but my stay and be happy, may I, 
              dear?&quot; </p>
            <p>Here was another fine chance to make the crushing speech and the 
              stately exit, but Meg never thought of doing either, and disgraced 
              herself forever in Jo's eyes by meekly whispering, &quot;Yes, John,&quot; 
              and hiding her face on Mr. Brooke's waistcoat. </p>
            <p>Fifteen minutes after Aunt March's departure, Jo came softly downstairs, 
              paused an instant at the parlor door, and hearing no sound within, 
              nodded and smiled with a satisfied expression, saying to herself, 
              &quot;She has seen him away as we planned, and that affair is settled. 
              I'll go and hear the fun, and have a good laugh over it.&quot; </p>
            <p>But poor Jo never got her laugh, for she was transfixed upon the 
              threshold by a spectacle which held her there, staring with her 
              mouth nearly as wide open as her eyes. Going in to exult over a 
              fallen enemy and to praise a strong-minded sister for the banishment 
              of an objectionable lover, it certainly was a shock to behold the 
              aforesaid enemy serenely sitting on the sofa, with thestrongminded 
              sister enthroned upon his knee and wearing an expression of the 
              most abject submission. Jo gave a sort of gasp, as if a cold shower 
              bath had suddenly fallen upon her, for such an unexpected turning 
              of the tables actually took her breath away. At the odd sound the 
              lovers turned and saw her. Meg jumped up, looking both proud and 
              shy, but `that man', as Jo called him, actually laughed and said 
              coolly, as he kissed the astonished newcomer, &quot;Sister Jo, congratulate 
              us!&quot; </p>
            <p>That was adding insult to injury, it was altogether too much, and 
              making some wild demonstration with her hands, Jo vanished without 
              a word. Rushing upstairs, she startled the invalids by exclaiming 
              tragically as she burst into the room, &quot;Oh, do somebody go 
              down quick! John Brooke is acting dreadfully, and Meg likes it!&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>Mr. and Mrs. March left the room with speed, and casting herself 
              upon the be, Jo cried and scolded tempestuously as she told the 
              awful news to Beth and Amy. The little girls, however, considered 
              it a most agreeable and interesting event, and Jo got little comfort 
              from them, so she went up to her refuge in the garret, and confided 
              her troubles to the rats. </p>
            <p>Nobody ever knew what went on in the parlor that afternoon, but 
              a great deal of talking was done, and quiet Mr. Brooke astonished 
              his friends by the eloquence and spirit with which he pleaded his 
              suit, told his plans, and persuaded them to arrange everything just 
              as he wanted it. </p>
            <p>The tea bell rang before he had finished describing the paradise 
              which he meant to earn for Meg, and he proudly took her in to supper, 
              both looking so happy that Jo hadn't the heart to be jealous or 
              dismal. Amy was very much impressed by John's devotion and Meg's 
              dignity, Beth beamed at them from a distance, while Mr. and Mrs. 
              March surveyed the young couple with such tender satisfaction that 
              it was perfectly evident Aunt March was right in calling them as 
              `unworldly as a pair of babies'. No one ate much, but everyone looked 
              very happy, and the old room seemed to brighten up amazingly when 
              the first romance of the family began there. </p>
            <p>&quot;You can't say nothing pleasant ever happens now, can you, 
              Meg?&quot; said Amy, trying to decide how she would group the lovers 
              in a sketch she was planning to make. &quot;No, I'm sure I can't. 
              How much has happened since I said that! It seems a year ago,&quot; 
              answered Meg, who was in a blissful dream lifted far above such 
              common things as bread and butter. </p>
            <p>&quot;The joys come close upon the sorrows this time, and I rather 
              think the changes have begun,&quot; said Mrs. March. &quot;In most 
              families there comes, now and then, a year full of events. This 
              has been such a one, but it ends well, after all.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Hope the next will end better,&quot; muttered Jo, who found 
              it very hard to see Meg absorbed in a stranger before her face, 
              for Jo loved a few persons very dearly and dreaded to have their 
              affection lost or lessened in any way. &quot;I hope the third year 
              from this will end better. I mean it shall, if I live to work out 
              my plans,&quot; said Mr. Brooke, smiling at Meg, as if everything 
              had become possible to him now. </p>
            <p>&quot;Doesn't it seem very long to wait?&quot; asked Amy, who was 
              in a hurry for the wedding. </p>
            <p>&quot;I've got so much to learn before I shall be ready, it seems 
              a short time to me,&quot; answered Meg, with a sweet gravity in 
              her face never seen there before. </p>
            <p>&quot;You have only to wait, I am to do the work,&quot; said John 
              beginning his labors by picking up Meg's napkin, with an expression 
              which caused Jo to shake her head, and then say to herself with 
              an air of relief as the front door banged, &quot;Here comes Laurie. 
              Now we shall have some sensible conversation.&quot; </p>
            <p>But Jo was mistaken, for Laurie came prancing in, overflowing with 
              good spirits, bearing a great bridal-looking bouquet for `Mrs. John 
              Brooke', and evidently laboring under the delusion that the whole 
              affair had been brought about by his excellent management. </p>
            <p> &quot;I knew Brooke would have it all his own way, he always does, 
              for when he makes up his mind to accomplish anything, it's done 
              though the sky falls,&quot; said Laurie, when he had presented his 
              offering and his congratulations. </p>
            <p>&quot;Much obliged for that recommendation. I take it as a good 
              omen for the future and invite you to my wedding on the spot,&quot; 
              answered Mr. Brooke, who felt at peace with all mankind, even his 
              mischievous pupil. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'll come if I'm at the ens of the earth, for the sight of 
              Jo's face alone on that occasion would be worth a long journey. 
              You don't look festive, ma'am, what's the matter?&quot; asked Laurie, 
              following her into a corner of the parlor, whither all had adjourned 
              to greet Mr. Laurence. </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't approve of the match, but I've made up my mind to 
              bear it, and shall not say a word against it,&quot; said Jo solemnly. 
              &quot;You can't know how hard it is for me to give up Meg,&quot; 
              she continued with a little quiver in her voice. &quot;You don't 
              give her up. You only go halves,&quot; said Laurie consolingly. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It can never be the same again. I've lost my dearest friend,&quot; 
              sighed Jo. </p>
            <p>&quot;You've got me, anyhow. I'm not good for much, I know, but 
              I'll stand by you, Jo, all the days of my life. Upon my word I will!&quot; 
              And Laurie meant what he said. </p>
            <p>&quot;I know you will, and I'm ever so much obliged. You are always 
              a great comfort to me, Teddy,&quot; returned Jo, gratefully shaking 
              hands. &quot;Well, now, don't be dismal, there's a good fellow. 
              It's all right you see. Meg is happy, Brooke will fly round and 
              get settled immediately, Grandpa will attend to him, and it will 
              be very jolly to see Meg in her own little house. We'll have capital 
              times after she is gone, for I shall be through college before long, 
              and then we'll go abroad on some nice trip or other. Wouldn't that 
              console you?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I rather think it would, but there's no knowing what may 
              happen in three years,&quot; said Jo thoughtfully. </p>
            <p>&quot;That's true. Don't you wish you could take a look forward 
              and wee where we shall all be then? I do,&quot; returned Laurie. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I think not, for I might see something sad, and everyone 
              looks so happy now, I don't believe they could be much improved.&quot; 
              And Jo's eyes went slowly round the room, brightening as they looked, 
              for the prospect was a pleasant one. </p>
            <p>Father and Mother sat together, quietly reliving the first chapter 
              of the romance which for them began some twenty years ago. Amy was 
              drawing the lovers, who sat apart in a beautiful world of their 
              own, the light of which touched their faces with a grace the little 
              artist could not copy. Beth lay on her sofa, talking cheerily with 
              her old friend, who held her little hand as if he felt that it possessed 
              the power to lead him along the peaceful way she walked. Jo lounged 
              in her favorite low seat, with the grave quiet look which best became 
              her, and Laurie, leaning on the back of her chair, his chin on a 
              level with her curly head, smiled with his friendliest aspect, and 
              nodded at her in the long glass which reflected them both. </p>
            <p>So the curtain falls upon Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. Whether it ever 
              rises again, depends upon the reception giveN the first act of the 
              domestic drama called LITTLE WOMEN. </p>

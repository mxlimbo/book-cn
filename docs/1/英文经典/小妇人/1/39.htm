              <br>
              Laurie went to Nice intending to stay a week, and remained a month. 
              He was tired of wandering about alone, and Amy's familiar presence 
              seemed to give a homelike charm to the foreign scenes in which she 
              bore a part. He rather missed the `petting' he used to receive, 
              and enjoyed a taste of it again, for no attentions, however flattering, 
              from strangers, were half so pleasant as the sisterly adoration 
              of the girls at home. Amy never would pet him like the others, but 
              she was very glad to see him now, and quite clung to him, feeling 
              that he was the representative of the dear family for whom she longed 
              more than she would confess. They naturally took comfort in each 
              other's society and were much together, riding, walking, dancing, 
              or dawdling, for at Nice no one can be very industrious during the 
              gay season. But, while apparently amusing themselves in the most 
              careless fashion, they were half-consciously making discoveries 
              and forming opinions about each other. Amy rose daily in the estimation 
              of her friend, but he sank in hers, and each felt the truth before 
              a word was spoken. Amy tried to please, and succeeded, for she was 
              grateful for the many pleasures he gave her, and repaid him with 
              the little services to which womanly women know how to lend an indescribable 
              charm. Laurie made no effort of any kind, but just let himself drift 
              along as comfortably as possible, trying to forget, and feeling 
              that all women owed him a kind word because one had been cold to 
              him. It cost him no effort to be generous, and he would have given 
              Amy all the trinkets in Nice if she would have taken them, but at 
              the same time he felt that he could not change the opinion she was 
              forming of him, and he rather dreaded the keen blue eyes that seemed 
              to watch him with such half-sorrowful, half-scornful surprise. </p>
            <p>&quot;All the rest have gone to Monaco for the day. I preferred 
              to stay at home and write letters. They are done now, and I am going 
              to Valrosa to sketch, will you come?' said Amy, as she joined Laurie 
              one lovely day when he lounged in as usual about noon. </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, yes, but isn't it rather warm for such a long walk?&quot; 
              he answered slowly, for the shaded salon looked inviting after the 
              glare without. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm going to have the little carriage, and Baptiste can drive, 
              so you'll have nothing to do but hold your umbrella, and keep your 
              gloves nice,&quot; returned Amy, with a sarcastic glance at the 
              immaculate kids, which were a weak point with Laurie. </p>
            <p>&quot;Then I'll go with pleasure.&quot; And he put out his hand 
              for her sketchbook. But she tucked it under her arm with a sharp... 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Don't trouble yourself. It's no exertion to me, but you 
              don't look equal to it.&quot; </p>
            <p>Laurie lifted his eyebrows and followed at a leisurely pace as 
              she ran downstairs, but when they got into the carriage he took 
              the reins himself, and left little Baptiste nothing to do but fold 
              his arms and fall asleep on his perch. </p>
            <p>The two never quarreled. Amy was too well-bred, and just now Laurie 
              was too lazy, so in a minute he peeped under her hatbrim with an 
              inquiring air. She answered him with a smile, and they went on together 
              in the most amicable manner. </p>
            <p>It was a lovely drive, along winding roads rich in the picturesque 
              scenes that delight beauty-loving eyes. Here an ancient monastery, 
              whence the solemn chanting of the monks came down to them. There 
              a bare-legged shepherd, in wooden shoes, pointed hat, and rough 
              jacket over one shoulder, sat piping on a stone while his goats 
              skipped among the rocks or lay at his feet. Meek, mouse-colored 
              donkeys, laden with panniers of freshly cut grass passed by, with 
              a pretty girl in a capaline sitting between the green piles, or 
              an old woman spinning with a distaff as she went. Brown, soft-eyed 
              children ran out from the quaint stone hovels to offer nosegays, 
              or bunches of oranges still on the bough. Gnarled olive trees covered 
              the hills with their dusky foliage, fruit hung golden in the orchard, 
              and great scarlet anemones fringed the roadside, while beyond green 
              slopes and craggy heights, the Maritime Alps rose sharp and white 
              against the blue Italian sky. </p>
            <p>Valrosa well deserved its name, for in that climate of perpetual 
              summer roses blossomed everywhere. They overhung the archway, thrust 
              themselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet welcome 
              to passers-by, and lined the avenue, winding through lemon trees 
              and feathery palms up to the villa on the hill. Every shadowy nook, 
              where seats invited one to stop and rest, was a mass of bloom, every 
              cool grotto had its marble nymph smiling from a veil of flowers 
              and every fountain reflected crimson, white, or pale pink roses, 
              leaning down to smile at their own beauty. Roses covered the walls 
              of the house, draped the cornices, climbed the pillars, and ran 
              riot over the balustrade of the wide terrace,whence one looked down 
              on the sunny Mediterranean, and the white-walled city on its shore. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;This is a regular honeymoon paradise, isn't it? Did you 
              ever see such roses?&quot; asked Amy, pausing on the terrace to 
              enjoy the view, and a luxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering 
              by. </p>
            <p>&quot;No, nor felt such thorns,&quot; returned Laurie, with his 
              thumb in his mouth, after a vain attempt to capture a solitary scarlet 
              flower that grew just beyond his reach. </p>
            <p>&quot;Try lower down, and pick those that have no thorns,&quot; 
              said Amy, gathering three of the tiny cream-colored ones that starred 
              the wall behind her. She put them in his buttonhole as a peace offering, 
              and he stood a minute looking down at them with a curious expression, 
              for in the Italian part of his nature there was a touch of superstition, 
              and he was just then in that state of half-sweet, half-bitter melancholy, 
              when imaginative young men find significance in trifles and food 
              for romance everywhere. He had thought of Jo in reaching after the 
              thorny red rose, for vivid flowers became her, and she had often 
              worn ones like that from the greenhouse at home. The pale roses 
              Amy gave him were the sort that the Italians lay in dead hands, 
              never in bridal wreaths, and for a moment he wondered if the omen 
              was for Jo or for himself, but the next instant his American common 
              sense got the better of sentimentality, and he laughed a heartier 
              laugh than Amy had heard since he came. </p>
            <p>&quot;It's good advice, you'd better take it and save your fingers,&quot; 
              she said, thinking her speech amused him. </p>
            <p>&quot;Thank you, I will,&quot; he answered in jest, and a few months 
              later he did it in earnest. </p>
            <p>&quot;Laurie, when are you going to your grandfather?&quot; she 
              asked presently, as she settled herself on a rustic seat. </p>
            <p>&quot;Very soon.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You have said that a dozen times within the last three weeks.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;I dare say, short answers save trouble.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;He expects you, and you really ought to go.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Hospitable creature! I know it.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Then why don't you do it?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Natural depravity, I suppose.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Natural indolence, you mean. It's really dreadful!&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>And Amy looked severe. </p>
            <p>&quot;Not so bad as it seems, for I should only plague him if I 
              went, so I might as well stay and plague you a little longer, you 
              can bear it better, in fact I think it agrees with you excellently.&quot; 
              And Laurie composed himself for a lounge on the broad ledge of the 
              balustrade. </p>
            <p>Amy shook her head and opened her sketchbook with an air of resignation, 
              but she had made up her mind to lecture `that boy' and in a minute 
              she began again. </p>
            <p>&quot;What are you doing just now?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Watching lizards.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;No, no. I mean what do you intend and wish to do?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Smoke a cigarette, if you'll allow me.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;How provoking you are! I don't approve of cigars and I will 
              only allow it on condition that you let me put you into my sketch. 
              I need a figure.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;With all the pleasure in life. How will you have me, full 
              length or three-quarters, on my head or my heels? I should respectfully 
              suggest a recumbent posture, then put yourself in also and call 
              it `Dolce far niente'.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Stay as you are, and go to sleep if you like. I intend to 
              work hard,&quot; said Amy in her most energetic tone. </p>
            <p>&quot;What delightful enthusiasm!&quot; And he leaned against a 
              tall urn with an ir of entire satisfaction. </p>
            <p>&quot;What would Jo say if she saw you now?&quot; asked Amy impatiently, 
              hoping to stir him up by the mention of her still more energetic 
              sister's name. </p>
            <p>&quot;As usual, `Go away, Teddy. I'm busy!'&quot; He laughed as 
              he spoke, but the laugh was not natural, and a shade passed over 
              his face, for the utterance of the familiar name touched the wound 
              that was not healed yet. Both tone and shadow struck Amy, for she 
              had seen and heard them before, and now she looked up in time to 
              catch a new expression on Laurie's face--a hard bitter look, full 
              of pain, dissatisfaction, and regret. It was gone before she could 
              study it and the listless expression back again. She watched him 
              for a moment with artistic pleasure, thinking how like an Italian 
              he looked, as he lay basking in the sun with uncovered head and 
              eyes full of southern dreaminess, for he seemed to have forgotten 
              her and fallen into a reverie. </p>
            <p>&quot;You look like the effigy of a young knight asleep on his 
              tomb,&quot; she said, carefully tracing the well-cut profile defined 
              against the dark stone. </p>
            <p>&quot;Wish I was!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;That's a foolish wish, unless you have spoiled your life. 
              You are so changed, I sometimes think--&quot; There Amy stopped, 
              with a half-timid, half-wistful look, more significant than her 
              unfinished speech. </p>
            <p>Laurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she hesitated 
              to express, and looking straight into her eyes, said, just as he 
              used to say it to her mother, &quot;It's all right, ma'am.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>That satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to 
              worry her lately. It also touched her, and she showed that it did, 
              by the cordial tone in which she said... </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm glad of that! I didn't think you'd been a very bad boy, 
              but I fancied you might have wasted money at that wicked Baden-Baden, 
              lost your heart to some charming Frenchwoman with a husband, or 
              got into some of the scrapes that young men seem to consider a necessary 
              part of a foreign tour. Don't stay out there in the sun, come and 
              lie on the grass here and `let us be friendly', as Jo used to say 
              when we got in the sofa corner and told secrets.&quot; </p>
            <p>Laurie obediently threw himself down on the turf, and began to 
              amuse himself by sticking daisies into the ribbons of Amy's hat, 
              that lay there. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm all ready for the secrets.&quot; And he glanced up with 
              a decided expression of interest in his eyes. </p>
            <p>&quot;I've none to tell. You may begin.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Haven't one to bless myself with. I thought perhaps you'd 
              had some news from home..&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You have heard all that has come lately. Don't you hear often? 
              I fancied Jo would send you volumes.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;She's very busy. I'm roving about so, it's impossible to 
              be regular, you know. When do you begin your great work of art, 
              Raphaella?' he asked. changing the subject abruptly after another 
              pause, in which he had been wondering if Amy knew his secret and 
              wanted to talk about it. </p>
            <p>&quot;Never,&quot; she answered, with a despondent but decided 
              air. &quot;Rome took all the vanity out of me, for after seeing 
              the wonders there, I felt too insignificant to live and gave up 
              all my foolish hopes in despair.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Why should you, with so much energy and talent?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;That's just why, because talent isn't genius, and no amount 
              of energy can make it so. I want to be great, or nothing. I won't 
              be a common-place dauber, so I don't intend to try any more.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may 
              ask?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Polish up my other talents, and be an ornament to society, 
              if I get the chance.&quot; </p>
            <p>It was a characteristic speech, and sounded daring, but audacity 
              becomes young people, and Amy's ambition had a good foundation. 
              Laurie smiled, but he liked the spirit with which she took up a 
              new purpose when a long-cherished one died, and spent no time lamenting. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Good! And here is where Fred Vaughn comes in, I fancy.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>Amy preserved a discreet silence, but there was a conscious look 
              in her downcast face that made Laurie sit up and say gravely, &quot;Now 
              I'm going to play brother, and ask questions. May I?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't promise to answer.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Your face will, if your tongue won't. You aren't woman of 
              the world enough yet to hide your feelings, my dear. I heard rumors 
              about Fred and you last year, and it's my private opinion that if 
              he had not been called home so suddenly and detained so long, something 
              would have come of it, hey?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;That's not for me to say,&quot; was Amy's grim reply, but 
              her lips would smile, and there was a traitorous sparkle of the 
              eye which betrayed that she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;You are not engaged, I hope?&quot; And Laurie looked very 
              elder-brotherly and grave all of a sudden. </p>
            <p>&quot;No.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;But you will be, if he comes back and goes properly down 
              on his knees, won't you?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Very likely.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Then you are fond of old Fred?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I could be, if I tried.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;But you don't intend to try till the proper moment? Bless 
              my soul, what unearthly prudence! He's a good fellow, Amy, but not 
              the man I fancied you'd like.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;He is rich, a gentleman, and has delightful manners,&quot; 
              began Amy, trying to be quite cool and dignified, but feeling a 
              little ashamed of herself, in spite of the sincerity of her intentions. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;I understand. Queens of society can't get on without money, 
              so you mean to make a good match, and start in that way? Quite right 
              and proper, as the world goes, but it sounds odd from the lips of 
              one of your mother's girls.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;True, nevertheless.&quot; </p>
            <p>A short speech, but the quiet decision with which it was uttered 
              contrasted curiously with the young speaker. Laurie felt this instinctively 
              and laid himself down again, with a sense of disappointment which 
              he could not explain. His look and silence, as well as a certain 
              inward self-disapproval, ruffled Amy, and made her resolve to deliver 
              her lecture without delay. </p>
            <p>&quot;I wish you'd do me the favor to rouse yourself a little,&quot; 
              she said sharply. </p>
            <p>&quot;Do it for me, there's a dear girl.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I could, if I tried.&quot; And she looked as if she would 
              like doing it in the most summary style. </p>
            <p>&quot;Try, then. I give you leave,&quot; returned Laurie, who enjoyed 
              having someone to tease, after his long abstinence from his favorite 
              pastime. </p>
            <p>&quot;You'd be angry in five minutes.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm never angry with you. It takes two flints to make a fire. 
              You are as cool and soft as snow.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;You don't know what I can do. Snow produces a glow and a 
              tingle, if applied rightly. Your indifference is half affectation, 
              and a good stirring up would prove it.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Stir away, it won't hurt me and it may amuse you, as the 
              big man said when his little wife beat him. Regard me in the light 
              of a husband or a carpet, and beat till you are tired, if that sort 
              of exercise agrees with you.&quot; </p>
            <p>Being decidedly nettled herself, and longing to see him shake off 
              the apathy that so altered him, Amy sharpened both tongue and pencil, 
              and began. </p>
            <p>&quot;Flo and I have got a new name for you. It's Lazy Laurence. 
              How do you like it?&quot; </p>
            <p>She thought it would annoy him, but he only folded his arms under 
              his head, with an imperturbable, &quot;That's not bad. Thank you, 
              ladies.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Do you want to know what I honestly think of you?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Pining to be told.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, I despise you.&quot; If she had even said `I hate you' 
              in a petulant or coquettish tone, he would have laughed and rather 
              liked it, but the grave, almost sad, accent in her voice made him 
              open his eyes, and ask quickly... </p>
            <p>&quot;Why, if you please?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Because, with every chance for being good, useful, and happy, 
              you are faulty, lazy, and miserable.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Strong language, mademoiselle.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;If you like it, I'll go on.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Pray do, it's quite interesting.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I thought you'd find it so. Selfish people always like to 
              talk about themselves.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Am I selfish?&quot; The question slipped out involuntarily 
              and in a tone of surprise, for the one virtue on which he prided 
              himself was generosity. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, very selfish,&quot; continued Amy, in a calm, cool voice, 
              twice as effective just then as an angry one. &quot;I'll show you 
              how, for I've studied you while we were frolicking, and I'm not 
              at all satisfied with you. Here you have been abroad nearly six 
              months, and done nothing but waste time and money and disappoint 
              your friends.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Isn't a fellow to have any pleasure after a four-year grind?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;You don't look as if you'd had much. At any rate, you are 
              none the better for it, as far as I can see. I said when we first 
              met that you had improved. Now I take it all back, for I don't think 
              you half so nice as when I left you at home. You have grown abominably 
              lazy, you like gossip, and waste time on frivolous things, you are 
              contented to be petted and admired by silly people, instead of being 
              loved and respected by wise ones. With money, talent, position, 
              health, and beauty, ah you like that old Vanity! But it's the truth, 
              so I can't help saying it, with all these splendid things to use 
              and enjoy, you can find nothing to do but dawdle, and instead of 
              being the man you ought to be, you are only...&quot; There she stopped, 
              with a look that had both pain and pity in it. </p>
            <p>&quot;Saint Laurence on a gridiron,&quot; added Laurie, blandly 
              finishing the sentence. But the lecture began to take effect, for 
              there was a wide-awake sparkle in his eyes now and a half-angry, 
              half-injured expression replaced the former indifference. </p>
            <p> &quot;I supposed you'd take it so. You men tell us we are angels, 
              and say we can make you what we will, but the instant we honestly 
              try to do you good, you laugh at us and won't listen, which proves 
              how much your flattery is worth.&quot; Amy spoke bitterly, and turned 
              her back on the exasperating martyr at her feet. <br>
              <br>
              In a minute a hand came down over the page, so that she could not 
              draw, and Laurie's voice said, with a droll imitation of a penitent 
              child, &quot;I will be good, oh, I will be good!&quot; </p>
            <p>But Amy did not laugh, for she was in earnest, and tapping on the 
              outspread hand with her pencil, said soberly, &quot;Aren't you ashamed 
              of a hand like that? It's as soft and white as a woman's, and looks 
              as if it never did anything but wear Jouvin's best gloves and pick 
              flowers for ladies. You are not a dandy, thank Heaven, so I'm glad 
              to see there are no diamonds or big seal rings on it, only the little 
              old one Jo gave you so long ago. Dear soul, I wish she was here 
              to help me!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;So do I!&quot; </p>
            <p>The hand vanished as suddenly as it came, and there was energy 
              enough in the echo of her wish to suit even Amy. She glanced down 
              at him with a new thought in her mind, but he was lying with his 
              hat half over his face, as if for shade, and his mustache hid his 
              mouth. She only saw his chest rise and fall, with a long breath 
              that might have been a sigh, and the hand that wore the ring nestled 
              down into the grass, as if to hide something too precious or too 
              tender to be spoken of. All in a minute various hints and trifles 
              assumed shape and significance in Amy's mind, and told her what 
              her sister never had confided to her. She remembered that Laurie 
              never spoke voluntarily of Jo, she recalled the shadow on his face 
              just now, the change in his character, and the wearing of the little 
              old ring which was no ornament to a handsome hand. Girls are quick 
              to read such signs and feel their eloquence. Amy had fancied that 
              perhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the alteration, and 
              now she was sure of it. Her keen eyes filled, and when she spoke 
              again, it was in a voice that could be beautifully soft and kind 
              when she chose to make it so. </p>
            <p>&quot;I know I have no right to talk so to you, Laurie, and if 
              you weren't the sweetest-tempered fellow in the world, you'd be 
              very angry with me. But we are all so fond and proud of you, I couldn't 
              bear to think they should be disappointed in you at home as I have 
              been, though, perhaps they would understand the change better than 
              I do.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I think they would,&quot; came from under the hat, in a grim 
              tone, quite as touching as a broken one. </p>
            <p>&quot;They ought to have told me, and not let me go blundering 
              and scolding, when I should have been more kind and patient than 
              ever. I never did like that Miss Randal and now I hate her!&quot; 
              said artful Amy, wishing to be sure of her facts this time. </p>
            <p>&quot;Hang Miss Randal!&quot; And Laurie knocked the hat off his 
              face with a look that left no doubt of his sentiments toward that 
              young lady. </p>
            <p>&quot;I beg pardon, I thought...&quot; And there she paused diplomatically. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No, you didn't, you knew perfectly well I never cared for 
              anyone but Jo,&quot; Laurie said that in his old, impetuous tone, 
              and turned his face away as he spoke. </p>
            <p>&quot;I did think so, but as they never said anything about it, 
              and you came away, I supposed I was mistaken. And Jo wouldn't be 
              kind to you? Why, I was sure she loved you dearly.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;She was kind, but not in the right way, and it's lucky for 
              her she didn't love me, if I'm the good-for-nothing fellow you think 
              me. It's her fault though, and you may tell her so.&quot; </p>
            <p>The hard, bitter look came back again as he said that, and it troubled 
              Amy, for she did not know what balm to apply. </p>
            <p>&quot;I was wrong, I didn't know. I'm very sorry I was so cross, 
              but I can't help wishing you'd bear it better, Teddy, dear.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Don't, that's her name for me!&quot; And Laurie put up his 
              hand with a quick gesture to stop the words spoken in Jo's half-kind, 
              half-reproachful tone. &quot;Wait till you've tried it yourself,&quot; 
              he added in a low voice, as he pulled up the grass by the handful. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I'd take it manfully, and be respected if i couldn't be loved,&quot; 
              said Amy, with the decision of one who knew nothing about it. </p>
            <p>Now, Laurie flattered himself that he had borne it remarkably well, 
              making no moan, asking no sympathy, and taking his trouble away 
              to live it down alone. Amy's lecture put the Matter in a new light, 
              and for the first time it did look weak and selfish to lose heart 
              at the first failure, and shut himself up in moody indifference. 
              He felt as if suddenly shaken out of a pensive dream and found it 
              impossible to go to sleep again. Presently he sat up and asked slowly, 
              &quot;Do you think Jo would despise me as you do?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, if she saw you now. She hates lazy people. Why don't 
              you do something splendid, and make her love you?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I did my best, but it was no use.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Graduating well, you mean? That was no more than you ought 
              to have done, for your grandfather's sake. It would have been shameful 
              to fail after spending so much time and money, when everyone knew 
              that you could do well.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I did fail, say what you will, for Jo wouldn't love me,&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>began Laurie, leaning his head on his hand in a despondent attitude. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No, you didn't, and you'll say so in the end, for it did 
              you good, and proved that you could do something if you tried. If 
              you'd only set about another task of some sort, you'd soon be your 
              hearty, happy self again, and forget your trouble.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;That's impossible.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Try it and see. You needn't shrug your shoulders, and think, 
              `Much she knows about such things'. I don't pretend to be wise, 
              but I am observing, and I see a great deal more than you'd imagine. 
              I'm interested in other people's experiences and inconsistencies, 
              and though I can't explain, I remember and use them for my own benefit. 
              Love Jo all your days, if you choose, but don't let it spoil you, 
              for it's wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you can't 
              have the one you want. There, I won't lecture any more, for I know 
              you'll wake up and be a man in spite of that hardhearted girl.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>Neither spoke for several minutes. Laurie sat turning the little 
              ring on his finger, and Amy put the last touches to the hasty sketch 
              she had been working at while she talked. Presently she put it on 
              his knee, merely saying, &quot;How do you like that?&quot; </p>
            <p>He looked and then he smiled, as he could not well help doing, 
              for it was capitally done, the long, lazy figure on the grass, with 
              listless face, half-shut eyes, and one hand holding a cigar, from 
              which came the little wreath of smoke that encircled the dreamer's 
              head. </p>
            <p>&quot;How well you draw!&quot; he said, with a genuine surprise 
              and pleasure at her skill, adding, with a half-laugh, &quot;Yes, 
              that's me.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;As you are. This is as you were.&quot; And Amy laid another 
              sketch beside the one he held. </p>
            <p>It was not nearly so well done, but there was a life and spirit 
              in it which atoned for many faults, and it recalled the past so 
              vividly that a sudden change swept over the young man's face as 
              he looked. Only a rough sketch of Laurie taming a horse. Hat and 
              coat were off, and every line of the active figure, resolute face, 
              and commanding attitude was full of energy and meaning. The handsome 
              brute, just subdued, stood arching his neck under the tightly drawn 
              rein, with one foot impatiently pawing the ground, and ears pricked 
              up as if listening for the voice that had mastered him. In the ruffled 
              mane. The rider's breezy hair and erect attitude, there was a suggestion 
              of suddenly arrested motion, of strength, courage, and youthful 
              buoyancy that contrasted sharply with the supine grace of the `DOLCE 
              FAR NIENTE' sketch. Laurie said nothing but as his eye went from 
              one to the other, Amy say him flush up and fold his lips together 
              as if he read and accepted the little lesson she had given him. 
              That satisfied her, and without waiting for him to speak, she said, 
              in her sprightly way... </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't you remember the day you played Rarey with Puck, and 
              we all looked on? Meg and Beth were frightened, but Jo clapped and 
              pranced, and I sat on the fence and drew you. I found that sketch 
              in my portfolio the other day, touched it up, and kept it to show 
              you.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Much obliged. You've improved immensely since then, and I 
              congratulate you. May I venture to suggest in ` a honeymoon paradise' 
              that five o'clock is the dinner hour at your hotel?&quot; </p>
            <p>Laurie rose as he spoke, returned the pictures with a smile and 
              a bow and looked at his watch, as if to remind her that even moral 
              lectures should have an end. He tried to resume his former easy, 
              indifferent air, but it was an affectation now, for the rousing 
              had been more effacious than he would confess. Amy felt the shade 
              of coldness in his manner, and said to herself . .. </p>
            <p>&quot;Now, I've offended him. Well, if it does him good, I'm glad, 
              if it makes him hate me, I'm sorry, but it's true, and I can't take 
              back a word of it.&quot; </p>
            <p>They laughed and chatted all the way home, and little Baptist, 
              up behind, thought that monsieur and madamoiselle were in charming 
              spirits. But both felt ill at ease. The friendly frankness was disturbed, 
              the sunshine had a shadow over it, and despite their apparent gaiety, 
              there was a secret discontent in the heart of each. </p>
            <p>&quot;Shall we see you this evening, mon frere?&quot; asked Amy, 
              as they parted at her aunt's door. </p>
            <p>&quot;Unfortunately I have an engagement. Au revoir, madamoiselle.&quot; 
              And Laurie bent as if to kiss her hand, in the foreign fashion, 
              which became him better than many men. Something in his face made 
              Amy say quickly and warmly... </p>
            <p>&quot;No, be yourself with me, Laurie, and part in the good old 
              way. I'd rather have a hearty English handshake than all the sentimental 
              salutations in France.&quot;</p>
            <p> &quot;Goodbye, dear.&quot; And with these words, uttered in the 
              tone she liked, Laurie left her, after a handshake almost painful 
              in its heartiness. </p>
            <p>Next morning, instead of the usual call, Amy received a note which 
              made her smile at the beginning and sigh at the end. <br>
              <br>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>My Dear Mentor, </p>
              <p>Please make my adieux to your aunt, and exult within yourself, 
                for `Lazy Laurence' has gone to his grandpa, like the best of 
                boys. A pleasant winter to you, and may the gods grant you a blissful 
                honeymoon at Valrosa! I think Fred would be benefited by a rouser. 
                Tell him so, with my congratulations. </p>
              <p><br>
                Yours gratefully,</p>
              <p> Telemachus </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><br>
              &quot;Good boy! I'm glad he's gone,&quot; said Amy, with an approving 
              smile. The next minute her face fell as she glanced about the empty 
              room, adding, with an involuntary sigh, &quot;Yes, I am glad, but 
              how I shall miss him.&quot; </p>

              &quot;The first of June! The Kings are off to the seashore tomorrow, 
              and I'm free. Three months' vacation--how I shall enjoy it!&quot; 
              exclaimed Meg, coming home one warm day to find Jo laid upon the 
              sofa in an unusual state of exhaustion, while Beth took off her 
              dusty boots, and Amy made lemonade for the refreshment of the whole 
              party. </p>
            <p>&quot;Aunt March went today, for which, oh, be joyful!&quot; said 
              Jo. &quot;I was mortally afraid she'd ask me to go with her. If 
              she had, I should have felt as if I ought to do it, but Plumfield 
              is about as gay as a churchyard, you know, and I'd rather be excused. 
              We had a flurry getting the old lady off, and I had a fright every 
              time she spoke to me, for I was in such a hurry to be through that 
              I was uncommonly helpful and sweet, and feared she'd find it impossible 
              to part from me. I quaked till she was fairly in the carriage, and 
              had a final fright, for as it drove of, she popped out her head, 
              saying, `Josyphine, won't you--?' I didn't hear any more, for I 
              basely turned and fled. I did actually run, and whisked round the 
              corner whee I felt safe.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Poor old Jo! She came in looking as if bears were after her,&quot; 
              said Beth, as she cuddled her sister's feet with a motherly air. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Aunt March is a regular samphire, is she not?&quot; observed 
              Amy, tasting her mixture critically. </p>
            <p>&quot;She means vampire, not seaweed, but it doesn't matter. It's 
              too warm to be particular about one's parts of speech,&quot; murmured 
              Jo. </p>
            <p>&quot;What shall you do all your vacation?&quot; asked Amy, changing 
              the subject with tact. </p>
            <p>&quot;I shall lie abed late, and do nothing,&quot; replied Meg, 
              from the depths of the rocking chair. &quot;I've been routed up 
              early all winter and had to spend my days working for other people, 
              so now I'm going to rest and revel to my heart's content.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Jo, &quot;that dozy way wouldn't suit me. 
              I've laid in a heap of books, and I'm going to improve my shining 
              hours reading on my perch in the old apple tree, when I'm not having 
              l...&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't say `larks!'&quot; implored Amy, as a return snub for 
              the samphire' correction.</p>
            <p>&quot;I'll say `nightingales' then, with Laurie. That's proper 
              and appropriate, since he's a warbler.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't let us do any lessons, Beth, for a while, but play 
              all the time and rest, as the girls mean to,&quot; proposed Amy. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Well, I will, if Mother doesn't mind. I want to learn some 
              new songs, and my children need fitting up for the summer. They 
              are dreadfully out of order and really suffering for clothes.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;May we, Mother?&quot; asked Meg, turning to Mrs. March, 
              who sat sewing in what they called `Marmee's corner'. &quot;You 
              may try your experiment for a week and see how you like it. I think 
              by Saturday night you will find that all play and no work is as 
              bad as all work and no play.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, dear, no! It will be delicious, I'm sure,&quot; said 
              Meg complacently. </p>
            <p>&quot;I now propose a toast, as my `friend and pardner, Sairy Gamp', 
              says. Fun forever, and no grubbing!&quot; cried Jo, rising, glass 
              in hand, as the lemonade went round. </p>
            <p>They all drank it merrily, and began the experiment by lounging 
              for the rest of the day. Next morning, Meg did not appear till ten 
              o'clock. Her solitary breakfast did not taste nice, and the room 
              seemed lonely and untidy, for Jo had not filled the vases, Beth 
              had not dusted, and Amy's books lay scattered about. Nothing was 
              neat and pleasant but `Marmee's corner', which looked as usual. 
              And there Meg sat, to `rest and read', which meant to yawn and imagine 
              what pretty summer dresses she would get with her salary. Jo spent 
              the morning on the river with Laurie and the afternoon reading and 
              crying over The Wide, Wide World, up in the apple tree. Beth began 
              by rummaging everything out of the big closet where her family resided, 
              but getting tired before half done, she left her establishment topsy-turvy 
              and went to her music, rejoicing that she had no dishes to wash. 
              Amy arranged her bower, put on her best white frock, smoothed her 
              curls, and sat down to draw under the honeysuckle, hoping someone 
              would see and inquire who the young artist was. As no one appeared 
              but an inquisitive daddy-longlegs, who examined her work with interest, 
              she went to walk, got caught in a shower, and came home dripping. 
            </p>
            <p>At teatime they compared notes, and all agreed that it had been 
              a delightful, though unusually long day. Meg, who went shopping 
              in the afternoon and got a `sweet blue muslin, had discovered, after 
              she had cut the breadths off, that it wouldn't wash, which mishap 
              made her slightly cross. Jo had burned the skin off her nose boating, 
              and got a raging headache by reading too long. Beth was worried 
              by the confusion of her closet and the difficulty of learning three 
              or four songs at once, and Amy deeply regretted the damage done 
              her frock, for Katy Brown's party was to be the next day and now 
              like Flora McFlimsey, she had `nothing to wear'. But these were 
              mere trifles, and they assured their mother that the experiment 
              was working finely. She smiled, said nothing, and with Hannah's 
              help did their neglected work, keeping home pleasant and the domestic 
              machinery running smoothly. It was astonishing what a peculiar and 
              uncomfortable state of things was produced by the `resting and reveling' 
              process. The days kept getting longer and longer, the weather was 
              unusually variable and so were tempers, and unsettled feeling possessed 
              everyone, and Satan found plenty of mischief for the idle hands 
              to do. As the height of luxury, Meg put out some of her sewing, 
              and then found time hang so heavily that she fell to snipping and 
              spoiling her clothes in her attempts to furbish them up a`la Moffat. 
              Jo read till her eyes gave out and she was sick of books, got so 
              fidgety that even good-natured Laurie had a quarrel with her, and 
              so reduced in spirits that she desperately wished she had gone with 
              Aunt March. Beth got on pretty well, for she was constantly forgetting 
              that it was to be all play and no work, and fell back into her old 
              ways now and then. But something in the air affected her, and more 
              than once her tranquility was much disturbed, so much so that on 
              one occasion she actually shook poor dear Joanna and told her she 
              was a fright'. Amy fared worst of all, for her resources were small, 
              and when her sisters left her to amuse herself, she soon found that 
              accomplished and important little self a great burden. She didn't 
              like dolls, fairy tales were childish, and one couldn't draw all 
              the time. Tea parties didn't amount to much neither did picnics 
              unless very well conducted. &quot;If one could have a fine house, 
              full of nice girls, or go traveling, the summer would be delightful, 
              but to stay at home with three selfish sisters and a grown-up boy 
              was enough to try the patience of a Boaz,&quot; complained Miss 
              Malaprop, after several days devoted to pleasure, fretting, and 
              ennui. </p>
            <p>No one would own that they were tired of the experiment, but by 
              Friday night each acknowledged to herself that she was glad the 
              week was nearly done. Hoping to impress the lesson more deeply, 
              Mrs. March, who had a good deal of humor, resolved to finish off 
              the trial in an appropriate manner, so she gave Hannah a holiday 
              and let the girls enjoy the full effect of the play system. </p>
            <p>When they got up on Saturday morning, there was no fire in the 
              kitchen, no breakfast in the dining room, and no mother anywhere 
              to be seen.</p>
            <p>&quot;Mercy on us! What has happened?&quot; cried Jo, staring about 
              her in dismay. </p>
            <p>Meg ran upstairs and soon came back again, looking relieved but 
              rather bewildered, and a little ashamed. </p>
            <p>&quot;Mother isn't sick, only very tired, and she says she is going 
              to stay quietly in her room all day and let us do the best we can. 
              It's a very queer thing for her to do, she doesn't act a bit like 
              herself. But she says it has been a hard week for her, so we mustn't 
              grumble but take care of ourselves.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;That's easy enough, and I like the idea, I'm aching for something 
              to do, that is, some new amusement, you know,&quot; added Jo quickly. 
            </p>
            <p>In fact it was an immense relief to them all to have a little work, 
              and they took hold with a will, but soon realized the truth of Hannah's 
              saying, &quot;Housekeeping ain't no joke.&quot; There was plenty 
              of food in the larder, and while Beth and Amy set the table, Meg 
              and Jo got breakfast, wondering as they did why servants ever talked 
              about hard work. </p>
            <p>&quot;I shall take some up to Mother, though she said we were not 
              to think of her, for she'd take care of herself,&quot; said Meg, 
              who presided and felt quite matronly behind the teapot. </p>
            <p>So a tray was fitted out before anyone began, and taken up with 
              the cook's compliments. The boiled tea was very bitter, the omelet 
              scorched, and the biscuits speckled with saleratus, but Mrs. March 
              received her repast with thanks and laughed heartily over it after 
              Jo was gone. </p>
            <p>&quot;Poor little souls, they will have a hard time, I'm afraid, 
              but they won't suffer, and it will do them good,&quot; she said, 
              producing the more palatable viands with which she had provided 
              herself, and disposing of the bad breakfast, so that their feelings 
              might not be hurt, a motherly little deception for which they were 
              grateful. </p>
            <p>Many were the complaints below, and great the chagrin of the head 
              cook at her failures. &quot;Never mind, I'll get the dinner and 
              be servant, you be mistress, keep your hands nice, see company, 
              and give orders,&quot; said Jo, who knew still less than Meg, about 
              culinary affairs. </p>
            <p>This obliging offer was gladly accepted, and Margaret retired to 
              the parlor, which she hastily put in order by whisking the litter 
              under the sofa and shutting the blinds to save the trouble of dusting. 
              Jo, with perfect faith in her own powers and a friendly desire to 
              make up the quarrel, immediately put a note in the office, inviting 
              Laurie to dinner. </p>
            <p>&quot;You'd better see what you have got before you think of having 
              company,&quot; said Meg, when informed of the hospitable but rash 
              act. </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, there's corned beef and plenty of poatoes, and I shall 
              get some asparagus and a lobster, `for a relish', as Hannah says. 
              We'll have lettuce and make a salad. I don't know how, but the book 
              tells. I'll have blancmange and strawberries for dessert, and coffee 
              too, if you want to be elegant.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't try too many messes, Jo, for you can't make anything 
              but gingerbread and molasses candy fit to eat. I wash my hands of 
              the dinner party, and since you have asked Laurie on your own responsibility, 
              you may just take care of him.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't want you to do anything but be civil to him and help 
              to the pudding. You'll give me your advice if I get in a muddle, 
              won't you?&quot; asked Jo, rather hurt. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, but I don't know much, except about bread and a few 
              trifles. You had better ask Mother's leave before you order anything,&quot; 
              returned Meg prudently. </p>
            <p>&quot;Of course I shall. I'm not a fool.&quot; And Jo went off 
              in a huff at the doubts expressed of her powers. </p>
            <p>&quot;Get what you like, and don't disturb me. I'm going out to 
              dinner and can't worry about things at home,&quot; said Mrs. March, 
              when Jo spoke to her. &quot;I never enjoyed housekeeping, and I'm 
              going to take a vacation today, and read, write, go visiting, and 
              amuse myself.&quot; </p>
            <p>The unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably and 
              reading early in the morning made Jo feel as if some unnatural phenomenon 
              had occurred, for an eclipse, an earthquake, or a volcanic eruption 
              would hardly have seemed stranger. </p>
            <p>&quot;Everything is out of sorts, somehow,&quot; she said to herself, 
              going downstairs. &quot;There's Beth crying, that's a sure sign 
              that something is wrong in this family. If Amy is bothering, I'll 
              shake her.&quot; </p>
            <p>Feeling very much out of sorts herself, Jo hurried into the parlor 
              to find Beth sobbing over Pip, the canary, who lay dead in the cage 
              with his little claws pathetically extended, as if imploring the 
              food for want of which he had died. </p>
            <p>&quot;It's all my fault, I forgot him, there isn't a seed or a 
              drop left. Oh, Pip! Oh, Pip! How could I be so cruel to you?&quot; 
              cried Beth, taking the poor thing in her hands and trying to restore 
              him. </p>
            <p>Jo peeped into his half-open eye, felt his little heart, and finding 
              him stiff and cold, shook her head, and offered her domino box for 
              a coffin. </p>
            <p>&quot;Put him in the oven, and maybe his will get warm and revive,&quot; 
              said Amy hopefully. </p>
            <p>&quot;He's been starved, and he shan't be baked now he's dead. 
              I'll make him a shroud, and he shall be buried in the garden, and 
              I'll never have another bird, never, my Pip! For I am too bad to 
              own one,&quot; murmured Beth, sitting on the floor with her pet 
              folded in her hands. &quot;The funeral shall be this afternoon, 
              and we will all go. Now, don't cry, Bethy. It's a pity, but nothing 
              goes right this week, and Pip has had the worst of the experiment. 
              Make the shroud, and lay him in my box, and after the dinner party, 
              we'll have a nice little funeral,&quot; said Jo, beginning to feel 
              as if she had undertaken a good deal. </p>
            <p>Leaving the others to console Beth, she departed to the kitchen, 
              which was in a most discouraging state of confusion. Putting on 
              a big apron, she fell to work and got the dishes piled up ready 
              for washing, when she discovered that the fire was out. </p>
            <p>&quot;Here's a sweet prospect!&quot; muttered Jo, slamming the 
              stove door open, and poking vigorously among the cinders. </p>
            <p>Having rekindled the fire, she thought she would go to market while 
              the water heated. The walk revived her spirits, and flattering herself 
              that she had made good bargins, she trudged home again, after buying 
              a very young lobster, some very old asparagus, and two boxes of 
              acid strawberries. By the time she got cleared up, the dinner arrived 
              and the stove was red-hot. Hannah had left a pan of bread to rise, 
              Meg had worked it up early, set it on the hearth for a second rising, 
              and forgotten it. Meg was entertaining Sallie Gardiner in the parlor, 
              when the door flew open and a floury, crocky, flushed, and disheveled 
              figure appeared, demanding tartly... </p>
            <p>&quot;I say, isn't bread `riz' enough when it runs over the pans?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>Sallie began to laugh, but Meg nodded and lifted her eyebrows as 
              high as they would go, which caused the apparition to vanish and 
              put the sour bread into the oven without further delay. Mrs. March 
              went out, after peeping here and there to see how matters went, 
              also saying a word of comfort to Beth, who sat making a winding 
              sheet, while the dear departed lay in state in the domino box. A 
              strange sense of helplessness fell upon the girls as the gray bonnet 
              vanished round the corner, and despair seized them when a few minutes 
              later Miss Crocker appeared, and said she'd come to dinner. Now 
              this lady was a thin, yellow spinster, with a sharp nose and inquisitive 
              eyes, who saw everything and gossiped about all she saw. They disliked 
              her, but had been taught to be kind to her, simply because she was 
              old and poor and had few friends. So Meg gave her the easy chair 
              and tried to entertain her, while she asked questions, critsized 
              everything, and told stories of the people whom she knew. </p>
            <p>Language cannot describe the anxieties, experiences, and exertions 
              which Jo underwent that morning, and the dinner she served up became 
              a standing joke. Fearing to ask any more advice, she did her best 
              alone, and discovered that something more than energy and good will 
              is necessary to make a cook. She boiled the asparagus for an hour 
              and wasgrieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder 
              than ever. The bread burned black, for the salad dressing so aggravated 
              her that she could not make it fit to ear. The lobster was a scarlet 
              mystery to her, but she hammered and poked till it was unshelled 
              and its meagerproportions concealed in a grove of lettuce leaves. 
              The potatoes had to be hurried, not to keep the asparagus waiting, 
              and were not done at the last. The blancmange was lumpy, and the 
              strawberries not as ripe as they looked, having been skilfully `deaconed'. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, they can eat beef and bread and butter, if they are 
              hungry, only it's mortifying to have to spend your whole morning 
              for nothing,&quot; thought Jo, as she rang the bell half an hour 
              later than usual, and stood, hot, tired, and dispirited, surveying 
              the feast spread before Laurie, accustomed to all sorts of elegance, 
              and Miss Crocker, whose tattling tongue would report them far and 
              wide. </p>
            <p>Poor Jo would gladly have gone under the table, as one thing after 
              another was tasted and left, while Amy giggled, Meg looked distressed, 
              Miss Crocker pursed her lips, and Laurie talked and laughed with 
              all his might to give a cheerful tone to the festive scene. Jo's 
              one strong point was the fruit, for she had sugared it well, and 
              had a pitcher of rich cream to eat with it. Her hot cheeks cooled 
              a trifle, and she drew a long breath as the pretty glass plates 
              went round, and everyone looked graciously at the little rosy islands 
              floating in a sea of cream. Miss Crocker tasted first, made a wry 
              face, and drank some water hastily. Jo, who refused, thinking there 
              might not be enough, for they dwindled sadly after the picking over, 
              glanced at Laurie, but he was eating away manfully, though there 
              was a slight pucker about his mouth and he kept his eye fixed on 
              his plate. Amy, who was fond of delicate fare, took a heaping spoonful, 
              choked, hid her face in her napkin, and left the table precipitately. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;Oh, what is it?&quot; exclaimed Jo, trembling. </p>
            <p>&quot;Salt instead of sugar, and the cream is sour,&quot; replied 
              Meg with a tragic gesture. </p>
            <p>Jo uttered a groan and fell back in her chair, remembering that 
              she had given a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of 
              the two boxes on the kitchen table, and had neglected to put the 
              milk in the refrigerator. She turned scarlet and was on the verge 
              of crying, when she met Laurie's eyes, which would look merry in 
              spite of his heroic efforts. The comical side of the affair suddenly 
              struck her, and she laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks. 
              So did everyone else, even `Croaker' as the girls called the old 
              lady, and the unfortunate dinner ended gaily, with bread and butter, 
              olives and fun. </p>
            <p>&quot;I haven't strength of mind enough to clear up now, so we 
              will sober ourselves with a funeral,&quot; said Jo, as they rose, 
              and Miss Crocker made ready to go, being eager to tell the new story 
              at another friend's dinner table. </p>
            <p>They did sober themselves for Beth's sake. Laurie dug a grave under 
              the ferns in the grove, little Pip was laid in, with many tears 
              by his tender-hearted mistress, and covered with moss, while a wreath 
              of violets and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore his epitaph, 
              composed by Jo while she struggled with the dinner. </p>
            <p>Here lies Pip March, <br>
              Who died the 7th of June;<br>
              Loved and lamented sore, <br>
              And not forgotten soon. </p>
            <p>At the conclusion of the ceremonies, Beth retired to her room, 
              overcome with emotion and lobster, but there was no place of repose, 
              for the beds were not made, and she found her grief much assuaged 
              by beating up the pillows and putting things in order. Meg helped 
              Jo clear away the remains of the feast, which took half the afternoon 
              and left them so tired that they agreed to be contented with tea 
              and toast for supper. </p>
            <p>Laurie took Amy to drive, which was a deed of charity, for the 
              sour cream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper. Mrs. 
              March came home to find the three older girls hard at work in the 
              middle of the afternoon, and a glance at the closet gave her an 
              idea of the success of one part of the experiment. </p>
            <p>Before the housewives could rest, several people called, and there 
              was a scramble to get ready to see them. Then tea must be got, errands 
              done, and one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected until the 
              last minute. As twilight fell, dewy and still, one by one they gathered 
              on the porch where the June roses were budding beautifully, and 
              each groaned or sighed as she sat down, as if tired or troubled. 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;What a dreadful day this has been!&quot; began Jo, usually 
              the first to speak. </p>
            <p>&quot;It has seemed shorter than usual, but so uncomfortable,&quot; 
              said Meg. </p>
            <p>&quot;Not a bit like home,&quot; added Amy. </p>
            <p>&quot;It can't seem so without Marmee and little Pip,&quot; sighed 
              Beth, glancing with full eyes at the empty cage above her head. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Here's Mother, dear, and you shall have another bird tomorrow, 
              if you want it.&quot; </p>
            <p>As she spoke, Mrs. March came and took her place among them, looking 
              as if her holiday had not been much pleasanter than theirs. </p>
            <p> &quot;Are you satisfied with your experiment, girls, or do you 
              want another week of it?&quot; she asked, as Beth nestled up to 
              her and the rest turned toward her with brightening faces, as flowers 
              turn toward the sun. </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't!&quot; cried Jo decidedly. </p>
            <p>&quot;Nor I,&quot; echoed the others. </p>
            <p>&quot;You think then, that it is better to have a few duties and 
              live a little for others, do you?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Lounging and larking doesn't pay,&quot; observed Jo, shaking 
              her head. &quot;I'm tired of it and mean to go to work at something 
              right off.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Suppose you learn plain cooking. That's a useful accomplishment, 
              which no woman should be without,&quot; said Mrs. March, laughing 
              inaudibly at the recollection of Jo's dinner party, for she had 
              met Miss Crocker and heard her account of it. </p>
            <p>&quot;Mother, did you go away and let everything be, just to see 
              how we'd get on?&quot; cried Meg, who had had suspicions all day. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, I wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on 
              each doing her share faithfully. While Hannah and I did your work, 
              you got on pretty well, though I don't think you were very happy 
              or amiable. So I thought, as a little lesson, I would show you what 
              happens when everyone thinks only of herself. Don't you feel that 
              it is pleasanter to help one another, to have daily duties which 
              make leisure sweet when it comes, and to bear and forbear, that 
              home may be comfortable and lovely to us all?&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;We do, Mother we do!&quot; cried the girls. </p>
            <p>&quot;Then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again, 
              for though they seem heavy sometimes, they are good for us, and 
              lighten as we learn to carry them. Work is wholesome, and there 
              is plenty for everyone. It keeps us from ennui and mischief, is 
              good for health and spirits, and gives us a sense of power and independence 
              better than money or fashion.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;We'll work like bees, and love it too, see if we don't,&quot; 
              said Jo. &quot;I'll learn plain cooking for my holiday task, and 
              the dinner party I have shall be a success.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'll make the set of shirts for father, instead of letting 
              you do it, Marmee. I can and I will, though I'm not fond of sewing. 
              That will be better than fussing over my own things, which are plenty 
              nice enough as they are.&quot; said Meg. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'll do my lessons every day, and not spend so much time 
              with my music and dolls. I am a stupid thing, and ought to be studying, 
              not playing,&quot; was Beth's resolution, while Amy followed their 
              example by heroically declaring, &quot;I shall learn to make buttonholes, 
              and attend to my parts of speech.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Very good! Then I am quite satisfied with the experiment, 
              and fancy that we shall not have to repeat it, only don't go to 
              the other extreme and delve like slaves. Have regular hours for 
              work and play, make each day both useful and pleasant, and prove 
              that you understand the worth of time by employing it well. Then 
              youth will be delightful, old age will bring few regrets, and life 
              become a beautiful success, in spite of poverty.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;We'll remember, Mother!&quot; And they did. </p>

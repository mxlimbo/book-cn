            <p><br>
              &quot;Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,&quot; grumbled 
              Jo, lying on the rug. </p>
            <p>&quot;It's so dreadful to be poor!&quot; sighed Meg, looking down 
              at her old dress. </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't think it's fair for some girls to have plenty of 
              pretty things, and other girls nothing at all,&quot; added little 
              Amy, with an injured sniff.&quot;We've got Father and Mother, and 
              each other,&quot; said Beth contentedly from her corner. </p>
            <p>The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at 
              the cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly, &quot;We 
              haven't got Father, and shall not have him for a long time.&quot; 
              She didn't say &quot;perhaps never,&quot; but each silently added 
              it, thinking of Father far away, where the fighting was. </p>
            <p>Nobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone, &quot;You 
              know the reason Mother proposed not having any presents this Christmas 
              was because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone; and she 
              thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are 
              suffering so in the army. We can't do much, but we can make our 
              little sacrifices, and ought to do it gladly. But I am afraid I 
              don't.&quot; And Meg shook her head, as she thought regretfully 
              of all the pretty things she wanted. </p>
            <p>&quot;But I don't think the little we should spend would do any 
              good. We've each got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped 
              by our giving that. I agree not to expect anything from Mother or 
              you, but I do want to buy UNDINE AND SINTRAM for myself. I've wanted 
              it so long,&quot; said Jo, who was a bookworm. </p>
            <p>&quot;I planned to spend mine in new music,&quot; said Beth, with 
              a little sigh, which no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle 
              holder. </p>
            <p>&quot;I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing pencils. I really 
              need them,&quot; said Amy decidedly. </p>
            <p>&quot;Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she won't 
              wish us to give up everything. Let's each buy what we want, and 
              have a little fun. I'm sure we work hard enough to earn it,&quot; 
              cried Jo, examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I know I do--teaching those tiresome children nearly all 
              day, when I'm longing to enjoy myself at home,&quot; began Meg, 
              in the complaining tone again. </p>
            <p>&quot;You don't have half such a hard time as I do,&quot; said 
              Jo. &quot;How would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, 
              fussy old lady, who keeps you trotting, is never satisfied, and 
              worries you till you you're ready to fly out the window or cry?&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It's naughty to fret, but I do think washing dishes and keeping 
              things tidy is the worst work in the world. It makes me cross, and 
              my hands get so stiff, I can't practice well at all.&quot; And Beth 
              looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that 
              time. </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't believe any of you suffer as I do,&quot; cried Amy, 
              &quot;for you don't have to go to school with impertinent girls, 
              who plague you if you don't know your lessons, and laugh at your 
              dresses, and label your father if he isn't rich, and insult you 
              when your nose isn't nice.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;If you mean libel, I'd say so, and not talk about labels, 
              as if Papa was a pickle bottle,&quot; advised Jo, laughing. </p>
            <p>&quot;I know what I mean, and you needn't be statirical about it. 
              It's proper to use good words, and improve your vocabilary,&quot; 
              returned Amy, with dignity. </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't peck at one another, children. Don't you wish we had 
              the money Papa lost when we were little, Jo? Dear me! How happy 
              and good we'd be, if we had no worries!&quot; said Meg, who could 
              remember better times. </p>
            <p>&quot;You said the other day you thought we were a deal happier 
              than the King children, for they were fighting and fretting all 
              the time, in spite of their money.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;So I did, Beth. Well, I think we are. For though we do have 
              to work, we make fun of ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as 
              Jo would say.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Jo does use such slang words!&quot; observed Amy, with a 
              reproving look at the long figure stretched on the rug. </p>
            <p>o immediately sat up, put her hands in her pockets, and began to 
              whistle. </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't, Jo. It's so boyish!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;That's why I do it.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I detest rude, unladylike girls!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Birds in their little nests agree,&quot; sang Beth, the peacemaker, 
              with such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, 
              and the &quot;pecking&quot; ended for that time. </p>
            <p>&quot;Really, girls, you are both to be blamed,&quot; said Meg, 
              beginning to lecture in her elder-sisterly fashion.&quot;You are 
              old enough to leave off boyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine. 
              It didn't matter so much when you were a little girl, but now you 
              are so tall, and turn up your hair, you should remember that you 
              are a young lady.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm not! And if turning up my hair makes me one, I'll wear 
              it in two tails till I'm twenty,&quot; cried Jo, pulling off her 
              net, and shaking down a chestnut mane. &quot;I hate to think I've 
              got to grow up, and be Miss March, and wear long gowns, and look 
              as prim as a China Aster! It's bad enough to be a girl, anyway, 
              when I like boy's games and work and manners! I can't get over my 
              disappointment in not being a boy. And it's worse than ever now, 
              for I'm dying to go and fight with Papa. And I can only stay home 
              and knit, like a poky old woman!&quot; </p>
            <p>And Jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled like castanets, 
              and her ball bounded across the room. </p>
            <p>&quot;Poor Jo! It's too bad, but it can't be helped. So you must 
              try to be contented with making your name boyish, and playing brother 
              to us girls,&quot; said Beth, stroking the rough head with a hand 
              that all the dish washing and dusting in the world could not make 
              ungentle in its touch. </p>
            <p>&quot;As for you, Amy,&quot; continued Meg, &quot;you are altogether 
              to particular and prim. Your airs are funny now, but you'll grow 
              up an affected little goose, if you don't take care. I I like your 
              nice manners and refined ways of speaking, when you don't try to 
              be elegant. But your absurd words are as bad as Jo's slang.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;If Jo is a tomboy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?&quot; 
              asked Beth, ready to share the lecture. </p>
            <p>&quot;You're a dear, and nothing else,&quot; answered Meg warmly, 
              and no one contradicted her, for the `Mouse' was the pet of the 
              family. </p>
            <p>As young readers like to know `how people look', we will take this 
              moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters, who sat 
              knitting away in the twilight, while the December snow fell quietly 
              without, and the fire crackled cheerfully within. It was a comfortable 
              room, though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain, 
              for a good picture or two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses, 
              chrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a 
              pleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded it. </p>
            <p>Margaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, 
              being plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft brown hair, 
              a sweet mouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen- 
              year-old Jo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of 
              a colt, for she never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, 
              which were very much in her way. She had a decided mouth, a comical 
              nose, and sharp, gray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and 
              were by turns fierce, funny, or thoughtful. Her long, thick hair 
              was her one beauty, but it was usually bundled into a net, to be 
              out of her way. Round shoulders had Jo, big hands and feet, a flyaway 
              look to her clothes, and the uncomfortable appearance of a girl 
              who was rapidly shooting up into a woman and didn't like it. Elizabeth, 
              or Beth, as everyone called her, was a rosy, smooth- haired, bright-eyed 
              girl of thirteen, with a shy manner, a timid voice, and a ;peaceful 
              expression which was seldom disturbed. Her father called her `Little 
              Miss Tranquility', and the name suited her excellently, for she 
              seemed to live in a happy world of her own, only venturing out to 
              meet the few whom she trusted and loved. Amy, though the youngest, 
              was a most important person, in her own opinion at least. A regular 
              snow maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow hair curling on her shoulders, 
              pale and slender, and always carrying herself like a young lady 
              mindful of her manners. What the characters of the four sisters 
              were we will leave to be found out. </p>
            <p>The clock struck six and, having swept up the hearth, Beth put 
              a pair of slippers down to warm. Somehow the sight of the old shoes 
              had a good effect upon the girls, for Mother was coming, and everyone 
              brightened to welcome her. Meg stopped lecturing, and lighted the 
              lamp, Amy got out of the easy chair without being asked, and Jo 
              forgot how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer 
              to the blaze. </p>
            <p>&quot;They are quite worn out. Marmee must have a new pair.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;I thought I'd get her some with my dollar,&quot; said Beth.</p>
            <p> &quot;No, I shall!&quot; cried Amy. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'm the oldest,&quot; began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided, 
              &quot;I'm the man of the family now Papa is away, and I shall provide 
              the slippers, for he told me to take special care of Mother while 
              he was gone.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'll tell you what we'll do,&quot; said Beth, &quot;let's 
              each get her something for Christmas, land not get anything for 
              ourselves.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;That's like you, dear! What will we get?&quot; exclaimed 
              Jo. </p>
            <p>Everyone thought soberly for a minute, then Meg announced, as if 
              the idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands, &quot;I 
              shall give her a nice pair of gloves.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Army shoes, best to be had,&quot; cried Jo. &quot;Some handkerchiefs, 
              all hemmed,&quot; said Beth. </p>
            <p>&quot;I'll get a little bottle of cologne. She likes it, and it 
              won't cost much, so I'll have some left to buy my pencils,&quot; 
              added Amy. </p>
            <p>&quot;How will we give the things?&quot; asked Meg. </p>
            <p>&quot;Put them on the table, and bring her in and see her open 
              the bundles. Don't you remember how we used to do on our birthdays?&quot; 
              answered Jo. </p>
            <p>&quot;I used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in 
              the chair with the crown on, and see you all come marching round 
              to give the presents, with a kiss. I liked the things and the kisses, 
              but it was dreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened 
              the bundles,&quot; said Beth, who was toasting her face and the 
              bread for tea at the same time. </p>
            <p>&quot;Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and 
              then surprise her. We must go shopping tomorrow afternoon, Meg. 
              There is so much to do about the play for Christmas night,&quot; 
              said Jo, marching up and down, with her hands behind her back, and 
              her nose in the air. </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't mean to act any more after this time. I'm getting 
              too old for such things,&quot; observed Meg, who was as much a child 
              as ever about `dressing-up' frolics. </p>
            <p>&quot;You won't stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in 
              a white gown with your hair down, and wear gold-paper jewelryYou 
              are the best actress we've got, and there'll be an end of everything 
              if you quit the boards,&quot; said Jo. &quot;We ought to rehearse 
              tonight. Come here, Amy, and do the fainting scene, for you are 
              as stiff as a poker in that.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I can't help it. I never saw anyone faint, and I don't choose 
              to make myself all black and blue, tumbling flat as you do. If I 
              can go down easily, I'll drop. If I can't, I shall fall into a chair 
              and be graceful. I don't care if Hugo does come at me with a pistol,&quot; 
              returned Amy, who was not gifted with dramatic power, but was chosen 
              because she was small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain 
              of the piece. </p>
            <p>&quot;Do it this way. Clasp your hands so, and stagger across the 
              room, crying frantically, `Roderigo Save me! Save me!' and away 
              went Jo, with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling. </p>
            <p>Amy followed, but she poked her hands out stiffly before her, and 
              jerked herself along as if she went by machinery, and her &quot;Ow!&quot; 
              was more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and 
              anguish. Jo gave a despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright, while 
              Beth let her bread burn as she watched the fun with interest. &quot;It's 
              no use! Do the best you can when the time comes, and if the audience 
              laughs, don't blame me. Come on, Meg.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Then things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied the world 
              in a speech of two pages without a single break. Hagar, the witch, 
              chanted an awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads, 
              with weird effect. Roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully, and 
              Hugo died in agonies of remorse and arsenic, with a wild, &quot;Ha! 
              Ha!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;It's the best we've had yet,&quot; said Meg, as the dead 
              villain sat up and rubbed his elbows. </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't see how you can write and act such splendid things, 
              Jo. You're a regular Shakespeare!&quot; exclaimed Beth, who firmly 
              believed that her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all 
              things.</p>
            <p>&quot;Not quite,&quot; replied Jo modestly. &quot;I do think THE 
              WITCHES CURSE, an Operatic Tragedy is rather a nice thing, but I'd 
              like to try McBETH, if we only had a trapdoor for Banquo. I always 
              wanted to do the killing part. `Is that a dagger that I see before 
              me?&quot; muttered Jo, rolling her eyes and clutching at the air, 
              as she had seen a famous tragedian do.</p>
            <p>&quot;No, it's the toasting fork, with Mother's shoe on it instead 
              of the bread. Beth's stage-struck!&quot; cried Meg, and the rehearsal 
              ended in a general burst of laughter. </p>
            <p>&quot;Glad to find you so merry, my girls,&quot; said a cheery 
              voice at the door, and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall, 
              motherly lady with a `can I help you' look about her which was truly 
              delightful. She was not elegantly dressed, but a noble-looking woman, 
              and the girls thought the gray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered 
              the most splendid mother in the world.</p>
            <p>&quot;Well, dearies, how have you got on today? There was so much 
              to do, getting the boxes ready to go tomorrow, that I didn't come 
              home to dinner. Has anyone called, Beth? How is your cold, Meg? 
              Jo, you look tired to death. Come and kiss me, baby.&quot; </p>
            <p>While making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet things 
              off, her warm slippers on, and sitting down in the easy chair, drew 
              Amy to her lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy 
              day. The girls flew about, trying to make things comfortable, each 
              in her own way. Meg arranged the tea table, Jo brought wood and 
              set chairs, dropping, over-turning, and clattering everything she 
              touched. Beth trotted to and fro between parlor kitchen, quiet and 
              busy, while Amy gave directions to everyone, as she sat with her 
              hands folded. </p>
            <p>As they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with a particularly 
              happy face, &quot;I've got a treat for you after supper.&quot; </p>
            <p>A quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine. Beth 
              clapped her hands, regardless of the biscuit she held, and Jo tossed 
              up her napkin, crying, &quot;A letter! A letter! Three cheers for 
              Father!&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, a nice long letter. He is well, and thinks he shall 
              get through the cold season better than we feared. He sends all 
              sorts of loving wishes for Christmas, and an especial message to 
              you girls,&quot; said Mrs. March, patting her pocket as if she had 
              got a treasure there. </p>
            <p>&quot;Hurry and get done! Don't stop to quirk your little finger 
              and simper over your plate, Amy,&quot; cried Jo, choking on her 
              tea and dropping her bread, butter side down, on the carpet in her 
              haste to get at the treat. </p>
            <p>Beth ate no more, but crept away to sit in her shadowy corner and 
              brood over the delight to come, till the others were ready. </p>
            <p> &quot;I think it was so splendid in Father to go as chaplain when 
              he was too old to be drafted, and not strong enough for a soldier,&quot; 
              said Meg warmly. </p>
            <p>&quot;Don't I wish I could go as a drummer, a vivan--what's its 
              name? Or a nurse, so I could be near him and help him,&quot; exclaimed 
              Jo, with a groan. </p>
            <p>&quot;It must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent, and eat 
              all sorts of bad-tasting things, and drink out of a tin mug,&quot; 
              sighed Amy. </p>
            <p>&quot;When will he come home, Marmee? asked Beth, with a little 
              quiver in her voice. </p>
            <p>&quot;Not for many months, dear, unless he is sick. He will stay 
              and do his work faithfully as long as he can, and we won't ask for 
              him back a minute sooner than he can be spared. Now come and hear 
              the letter.&quot; </p>
            <p>They all drew to the fire, Mother in the big chair with Beth at 
              her feet, Meg and Amy perched on either arm of the chair, and Jo 
              leaning on the back, where no one would see any sign of emotion 
              if the letter should happen to be touching. Very few letters were 
              written in those hard times that were not touching, especially those 
              which fathers sent home. In this one little was said of the hardships 
              endured, the dangers faced, or the homesickness conquered. It was 
              a cheerful, hopeful letter, full of lively descriptions of camp 
              life, marches, and military news, and only at the end did the writer's 
              heart over-flow with fatherly love and longing for the little girls 
              at home. </p>
            <p>&quot;Give them all of my dear love and a kiss. Tell them I think 
              of them by day, pray for them by night, and find my best comfort 
              in their affection at all times. A year seems very long to wait 
              before I see them, but remind them that while we wait we may all 
              work, so that these hard days need not be wasted. I know they will 
              remember all I said to them, that they will be loving children to 
              you, will do their duty faithfully, fight their bosom enemies bravely, 
              and conquer themselves so beautifully that when I come back to them 
              I may be fonder and prouder than ever of my little women.&quot; 
              Everybody sniffed when they came to that part. Jo wasn't ashamed 
              of the great tear that dropped off the end of her nose, and Amy 
              never minded the rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on her 
              mother's shoulder and sobbed out, &quot;I am a selfish girl! But 
              I'll truly try to be better, so he mayn't be disappointed in me 
              by-and-by.&quot; </p>
            <p>We all will,&quot; cried Meg. &quot;I think too much of my looks 
              and hate to work, but won't any more, if I can help it.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;I'll try and be what he loves to call me, `a little woman' 
              and not be rough and wild, but do my duty here instead of wanting 
              to be somewhere else,&quot; said Jo, thinking that keeping her temper 
              at home was a much harder task than facing a rebel or two down South. 
            </p>
            <p>Beth said nothing, but wiped away her tears with the blue army 
              sock and began to knit with all her might, losing no time in doing 
              the duty that lay nearest her, while she resolved in her quiet little 
              soul to be all that Father hoped to find her when the year brought 
              round the happy coming home. </p>
            <p>Mrs. March broke the silence that followed Jo's words, by saying 
              in her cheery voice, &quot;Do you remember how you used to play 
              Pilgrims Progress when you were little things? Nothing delighted 
              you more than to have me tie my piece bags on your backs for burdens, 
              give you hats and sticks and rolls of paper, and let you travel 
              through the house from the cellar, which was the City of Destruction, 
              up, up, to the housetop, where you had all the lovely things you 
              could collect to make a Celestial City.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;What fun it was, especially going by the lions, fighting 
              Apollyon, and passing through the valley where the hob-goblins were,&quot; 
              said Jo. </p>
            <p>&quot;I liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled 
              downstairs,&quot; said Meg. </p>
            <p>&quot;I don't remember much about it, except that I was afraid 
              of the cellar and the dark entry, and always liked the cake and 
              milk we had up at the top. If I wasn't too old for such things, 
              I'd rather like to play it over again,&quot; said Amy, who began 
              to talk of renouncing childish things at the mature age of twelve. 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;We never are too old for this, my dear, because it is a play 
              we are playing all the time in one way or another. Out burdens are 
              here, our road is before us, and the longing for goodness and happiness 
              is the guide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to 
              the peace which is a true Celestial City. Now, my little pilgrims, 
              suppose you begin again, not in play, but in earnest, and see how 
              far on you can get before Father comes home.&quot; </p>
            <p> &quot;Really, Mother? Where are our bundles?&quot; asked Amy, 
              who was a very literal young lady. </p>
            <p>&quot;Each of you told what your burden was just now, except Beth. 
              I rather think she hasn't got any,&quot; said her mother. </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, I have. Mine is dishes and dusters, and envying girls 
              with nice pianos, and being afraid of people.&quot; </p>
            <p>Beth's bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh, 
              but nobody did, for it would have hurt her feelings very much.</p>
            <p>&quot;Let us do it,&quot; said Meg thoughtfully. &quot;It is only 
              another name for trying to be good, and the story may help us, for 
              though we do want to be good, it's hard work and we forget, and 
              don't do our best.&quot; </p>
            <p>&quot;We were in the Slough of Despond tonight, and Mother came 
              and pulled us out as Help did in the book. We ought to have our 
              roll of directions, like Christian. What shall we do about that?&quot; 
              asked Jo, delighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to 
              the very dull task of doing her duty. </p>
            <p>&quot;Look under your pillows christmas morning, and you will find 
              your guidebook,&quot; replied Mrs. March. </p>
            <p>They talked over the new plan while old Hannah cleared the table, 
              then out came the four little work baskets, and the needles flew 
              as the girls made sheets for Aunt March. It was uninteresting sewing, 
              but tonight no one grumbled. They adopted Jo's plan of dividing 
              the long seams into four parts, and calling the quarters Europe, 
              Asia, Africa, and America, and in that way got on capitally, especially 
              when they talked about the different countries as they stitched 
              their way through them. </p>
            <p>At nine they stopped work, and sang, as usual, before they went 
              to bed. No one but Beth could get much music out of the old piano, 
              but she had a way of softly touching the yellow keys and making 
              a pleasant accompaniment to the simple songs they sang. Meg had 
              a voice like a flute, and she and herr mother led the little choir. 
              Amy chirped like a cricket, and Jo wandered through the airs at 
              her own sweet will, always coming out at the wrong place with a 
              croak or a quaver that spoiled the most pensive tune. They had always 
              done this from the time they could lisp... </p>
            <p>Crinkle, crinkle, 'ittle 'tar, and it had become a household custom, 
              for the mother was a born singer. The first sound in the morning 
              was her voice as she went about the house singing like a lark, and 
              the last sound at night was the same cheery sound, for the girls 
              never grew too old for that familiar lullaby. </p>

            <p>There is a wisdom in this, beyond the rules of physic: a man\'s 
              own observation, what he finds good of, and what he finds hurt of, 
              is the best physic to preserve health. <br>
            </p>
            <p>But it is a safer conclusion to say; this agreeth not well with 
              me, therefore I will <br>
              not continue it; than this; I fmd no offence of this, therefore 
              I may use it. For <br>
              strength of nature in youth passeth over many excesses, which are 
              owing a man till <br>
              his age. Discern of the coming on of years, and think not, to do 
              the same things still; for age will not be defied. Beware of sudden 
              change in any great point of diet, and if necessity enforce it, 
              fit the rest to it. For it is a secret, both in nature, and <br>
              state; that it is safer to change many things, than one. Examine 
              thy customs, of diet, <br>
              sleep, exercise, apparel, and the like; and try in anything thou 
              shall judge hurtful, <br>
              to discontinue it by little and little; but so, as if thou doest 
              fmd any inconvenience <br>
              by the change, thou come back to it again: for it is hard to distinguish, 
              that which <br>
              is generally held good, and wholesome, from that, which is good 
              particularly, and <br>
              fit for thine own body. </p>
            <p>To be free minded, and cheerfully disposed, at hours of meat, and 
              of sleep, and of exercise, is one of the best precepts of long lasting. 
              As for the passions and studies of the mind; avoid envy; anxious 
              fears; anger fretting inwards; subtle and knotty inquisitions; joys, 
              and exhilarations in excess; sadness not communicated. Entertain 
              hopes; mirth rather than joy; variety of delights, rather than surfeit 
              of them; wonder, and admiration, and therefore novelties; studies 
              that fill the mind with splendid and illustrious objects, as histories, 
              fables, and contemplations of nature. If you fly physic in health 
              altogether, it will be too strange for your body, when you shall 
              need it If you make it too familiar, it will work no extraordinary 
              effect, when sickness cometh. I commend rather some diet, for certain 
              seasons, than frequent use of physic, except it be grown into a 
              custom. </p>
            <p>For those diets alter the body more, and trouble it less. Despise 
              no new accident in your body, but ask opinion of it In sickness, 
              respect health principally; and in health, action. </p>
            <p>For those that put their bodies to endure in health, may in most 
              sickness, <br>
              which are not very sharp, be cured only with diet, and tendering. 
              Celsus could never have spoken it as a physician, had he not been 
              a wise man withal, when he giveth it, for one of the great precepts 
              of health and lasting, that a man do vary, and interchange contraries; 
              but with an inclination to the more benign extreme: use fasting, 
              and full eating, but rather full eating; watching and sleep, but 
              rather sleep;<br>
              sitting, and exercise, but rather exercise; and the like. </p>
            <p>So shall nature be cherished, and yet taught masteries. Physicians 
              are some of them so pleasing, and conformable to the humour of the 
              patient, as they press not the true cure of the disease; and some 
              other are so regular, in proceeding according to art, for the disease, 
              as they respect not sufficiently the condition of the patient Take 
              one of a middle temper, or if it may not be found in one man, combine 
              two of either sort: and forget not to call, as well the best acquainted 
              with your body, as the best reputed of for his faculty.</p>

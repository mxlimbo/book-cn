            <p align="center" class="h">22 Of Cunning
            <p>We take cunning for a sinister or crooked wisdom. And certainly, 
              there is great difference, between a cunning man, and a wise man; 
              not only in point of honesty, but in point of ability. There be 
              that can pack the cards, and yet cannot play well; so there are 
              some, that are good in canvasses, and factions, that are otherwise 
              weak men. </p>
            <p>Again, it is one thing to understand persons, and another thing 
              to understand matters; for many are perfect in men\'s humours, that 
              are not greatly capable of the real part of business; which is the 
              constitution of one that hath studied men, more than books. Such 
              men are fitter for practice, than for counsel; and they are good 
              <br>
              but in their own alley: turn them to new men, and they have lost 
              their aim; so as the old rule, to know a fool from a wise man; nutte 
              ambos nudos ad ignotos .et videbis\', doth scarce hold for them. 
              And because these cunning men are like haberdashers of small wares, 
              it is <br>
              not amiss to set forth their shop.<br>
            </p>
            <p>It is a point of cunning to wait upon him, with whom you speak, 
              with your eye; as the Jesuits give it in precept: for there be many 
              wise men, that have secret hearts, and transparent countenances. 
              Yet this would be done with a demure abasing of your eye sometimes, 
              as the Jesuits also do use.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Another is, that when you have anything to obtain of present dispatch, 
              you entertain and amuse the party, with whom you deal, with some 
              other discourse; that he be not too much awake, to make objections. 
              I knew a counsellor and secretary, that never came to Queen Elizabeth 
              of England, with bills to sign, but he would always first put her 
              into some discourse of estate, that she mought the less mind the 
              bills.<br>
            </p>
            <p>The like surprise may be made, by moving things, when the party 
              is in haste, and cannot stay to consider advisedly of that is moved.<br>
            </p>
            <p>If a man would cross a business, that he doubts some other would 
              handsomely and effectually move, let him pretend to wish it well, 
              and move it himself, in such sort, as may foil it<br>
            </p>
            <p>The breaking off, in the midst of that one was about to say, as 
              if he took himself up, breeds a greater appetite in him, with whom 
              you confer, to know more.<br>
            </p>
            <p>And because it works better, when anything seemeth to be gotten 
              from you by question, than if you offer it of yourself, you may 
              lay a bait for a question, by showing another visage and countenance 
              than you are wont; to the end, to give occasion, for the party <br>
              to ask, what the matter is of the change? As Nehemias did; And I 
              had not before that time been sad before the king.<br>
            </p>
            <p>In things, that arc tender and unpleasing, it is good to break 
              the ice by some whose words are of less weight, and to reserve the 
              more weighty voice to come in, as by chance, so that he may be asked 
              the question upon the other\'s speech. </p>
            <p>As Narcissus did, in relating to Claudius the marriage of Messalina 
              and Silius. In things, that a man would not be seen in himself; 
              it is a point of cunning, to borrow the name of the world; as to 
              say; The world says, or. There is a speech abroad.<br>
            </p>
            <p>I knew one, that when he wrote a letter, he would put that which 
              was most material, in the post-script, as if it had been a by-matter.<br>
              I knew another, that when he came to have speech, he would pass 
              over that that he intended most, and go forth, and come back again, 
              and speak of it, as of a thing that he had almost forgot<br>
            </p>
            <p>Some procure themselves to be surprised, at such times as it is 
              like, the party that they work upon, will suddenly come upon them; 
              and to be found with a letter in their hand, or doing somewhat which 
              they are not accustomed; to the end, they may be apposed of those 
              things, which of themselves they are desirous to utter. It is a 
              point of cunning, to let fall those words, in a man\'s own name, 
              which he would have another man learn, and use, and thereupon take 
              advantage. I knew two, that were competitors, for the secretary\'s 
              place, in Queen Elizabeth\'s time, and yet kept good quarter between 
              themselves: and would confer, one with another, upon the business; 
              <br>
              and the one of them said, that to be a secretary, in the declination 
              of a monarchy, was a ticklish thing, and that he did not affect 
              it: the other, straight caught up those words, and discoursed with 
              divers of his friends, that he had no reason to desire to be secretary, 
              in the declination of a monarchy. The first man took hold of it, 
              and found means, it was told the queen; who hearing of a declination 
              of a monarchy, took it so ill, as she would never after hear of 
              the other\'s suit<br>
            </p>
            <p>There is a cunning, which we in England call the turning of the 
              cat in the pan; which is, when that which a man says to another, 
              he lays it, as if another had said it to him. And to say truth, 
              it is not easy, when such a matter passed between two, to make it 
              appear, from which of them it first moved and began.</p>
            <p> It is a way that some men have, to glance and dart at others, 
              by justifying themselves, by negatives; as to say, this do not: 
              as Tigellinus did towards Burrus; se non diversas spes, sed incolumitatem 
              imperatoris simplidter spectare.</p>
            <p> Some have in readiness so many tales and stories, as there is 
              nothing they would insinuate but they can wrap it into a tale; which 
              serveth both to keep themselves more in guard, and to make others 
              carry it, with more pleasure. </p>
            <p>It is a good point of cunning, for a man to shape the answer he 
              would have, in his own words, and propositions; for it makes the 
              other party stick the less.<br>
            </p>
            <p>It is strange, how long some men will lie in wait, to speak somewhat 
              they desire to say; and how far about they will fetch; and how many 
              other matters they will beat over, to come near it It is a thing 
              of great patience, but yet of much use.<br>
            </p>
            <p>A sudden, bold, and unexpected question, doth many times surprise 
              a man, and lay him open. Like to him, that having changed his name, 
              and walking in Paul\'s, another suddenly came behind him, and called 
              him by his true name, whereat straightways he looked back.<br>
            </p>
            <p>But these small wares, and petty points of cunning, are infinite: 
              and it were a good deed to make a list of them: for that nothing 
              doth more hurt in a state, than that cunning men pass for wise.<br>
            </p>
            <p>But certainly, some there are, that know the resorts and falls 
              of business, that cannot sink into the main of it: like a house, 
              that hath convenient stairs, and entries, but never a fair room. 
              Therefore, you shall see them find out pretty looses in the conclusion, 
              but are no ways able to examine, or debate matters. </p>
            <p>And yet commonly they take advantage of their inability, and would 
              be thought wits of direction. Some build rather upon the abusing 
              of others, and (as we now say) putting tricks upon them, than <br>
              upon soundness of their own proceedings. But Solomon saith; prudens 
              advertit ad gressus suos:<br>
              stultus divertit ad dolos.</p>

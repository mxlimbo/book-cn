            <p>Costly followers are not to be liked; lest while a man maketh his 
              train longer, he <br>
              make his wings shorter. I reckon to be costly, not them alone, which 
              charge the purse, but which are wearisome and importune in suits. 
              Ordinary followers ought to challenge no higher conditions, than 
              countenance, recommendation, and protection from wrongs. </p>
            <p>Factious followers are worse to be liked, which follow not upon 
              affection to him, <br>
              with whom they range themselves, but upon discontentment conceived 
              against some other: whereupon commonly ensueth that ill intelligence, 
              that we many times see between great personages. Likewise glorious 
              followers, who make themselves as trumpets, of the commendation 
              of those they follow, are full of inconvenience; for they taint 
              business through want of secrecy; and they export honour from a 
              man, and make him a return in envy. </p>
            <p>There is a kind of followers likewise, which are dangerous, being 
              indeed <br>
              espials; which enquire the secrets of the house, and bear tales 
              of them to others. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Yet such men, many times, are in great favour; for they are officious, 
              and commonly exchange tales. The following by certain estates of 
              men, answerable to that which a great person himself professeth 
              (as of soldiers to him that hath been employed in me wars, and the 
              like), hath ever been a thing civil, and well taken even in monarchies; 
              so it be without too much pomp or popularity. But the most honourable 
              kind of following, is to be followed as one that apprehendeth, to 
              advance virtue and desert, in all sorts of persons. </p>
            <p>And yet, where there is no eminent odds in sufficiency, it is better 
              to take with me more passable, than with the more able. And besides, 
              to speak truth, in base times, active men are of more use, than 
              virtuous. It is true that in government, it is good to use men of 
              one rank equally: for to countenance some extraordinarily, is to 
              make them insolent, and the rest discontent; because they may claim 
              a due. </p>
            <p>But contrariwise in favour, to use men with much difference and 
              election, is good; for it makelh the persons preferred more thankful, 
              and the rest more officious; because all is of favour. It is good 
              discretion, not to make too much of any man, at the first; because 
              one cannot hold out that proportion. </p>
            <p>To be governed (as we call it) by one, is not safe: for it shows 
              softness, and gives a freedom to scandal and disreputation: for 
              those that would not censure, or speak ill of a man immediately, 
              will talk more boldly of those that are so great with them, and 
              thereby wound their honour. Yet to be distracted with many is worse; 
              for it makes men to be of the last impression, and full of change. 
              To take advice of some few friends is ever honourable; for lookers-on, 
              many times, see more than gamesters; and the vale best discovered! 
              the hill. There is little friendship in the world, and least of 
              all between equals, which was wont to be magnified. That that is, 
              is between superior and inferior, whose fortunes may comprehend, 
              the one the other.</p>

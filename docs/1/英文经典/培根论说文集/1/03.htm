            <p align="center" class="h">3 Of Unity in Religion
            <p>Religion being the chief band of human society, it is a happy thing, 
              when itself is <br>
              well contained within the true band of unity. The quarrels, and 
              divisions about <br>
              religion, were evils unknown to the heathen. The reason was, because 
              the religion of the heathen consisted rather in rites and ceremonies 
              than in any constant belief. </p>
            <p>For you may imagine, what kind of faith theirs was, when the chief 
              doctors, and fathers of their church, were the poets. But the true 
              God haul this attribute, that he is a jealous God; and therefore, 
              his worship and religion will endure no mixture, nor partner. We 
              shall therefore speak a few words, concerning the unity of the church; 
              what are the fruits thereof; what the bounds; and what means?<br>
              The fruits of unity (next unto the well pleasing of God, which is 
              all in all) are <br>
              two; me one, towards those that are without the church; the other, 
              towards those that are within. For the former, it is certain, that 
              heresies, and schisms are of all others the greatest scandals; yea 
              more than corruption of manners. For as in the natural body, a wound 
              or solution of continuity is worse than a corrupt humour, so in 
              the spiritual. So that nothing, doth so much keep men out of the 
              church, and drive men out of the church, as breach of unity: and 
              therefore, whensoever it cometh to that pass, that one saith, ecce 
              in deserto; another saith, ecce in penetralibus; that is, when some 
              men seek Christ in the conventicles of heretics, and others in an 
              outward face of a church, that voice had need continually to sound 
              in men\'s ears, nolite exire, go not out. The doctor of the gentiles 
              (the propriety of whose vocation drew him to have a special care 
              of those without) saith: If an heathen come in and hear you speak 
              with several tongues will he not say that you are mad? And certainly, 
              it is lime better when atheists, and profane persons, do hear of 
              so many discordant and contrary opinions in religion; it doth avert 
              them from the church, and maketh them to sit down in the chair of 
              the scorners. It is but a light thing, to be vouched in so serious 
              a matter, but yet it expressed! well the deformity.</p>
            <p> There is a master of scoffing, that in his catalogue of books, 
              of a feigned library, sets down this title of a book: the moms dance 
              of heretics. For indeed, every sect of them hath a diverse posture, 
              or cringe by themselves, which cannot but move derision in worldlings, 
              and depraved politics, who are apt to contemn holy things. As for 
              the fruit towards those that are within; it is peace; which containe 
              infinite blessings: it establisheth faith; it kindleth charity; 
              the outward peace of the church distilleth into peace of conscience; 
              and it turneth the labours of writing, and reading of controversies, 
              into treaties of mortification, and devotion.<br>
              Concerning the bounds of unity; the true placing of them importeth 
              exceedingly. </p>
            <p>There appear to be two extremes. For to certain zealants all speech 
              of pacification is odious. Is it peace, Jehu? What hast thou to 
              do with peace? Turn thee behind me. Peace is not the matter, but 
              following and party. Contrariwise, certain Laodiceans, and lukewarm 
              persons, think they may accommodate points of religion by middle 
              ways, and taking part of both; and witty reconcilements; as if they 
              would make an arbitrement, between God and man. Both these extremes 
              are to be avoided; which will be done, if the league of Christians, 
              penned by our saviour himself, were in the two cross clauses thereof 
              soundly and plainly expounded; he that is not with us, is against 
              us; and again, he that is not against us is with us: that is, if 
              the points fundamental and of substance in religion were truly discerned 
              and distinguished from points not merely of faith, but of opinion, 
              order, or good intention. </p>
            <p>This is a thing may seem to many a matter trivial, and done already: 
              but if it were done less partially, it would be embraced more generally. 
              Of this I may give only this advice, according to my small model. 
              Men ought to take heed, of rending God\'s church, by two kinds of 
              controversies. The one is, when the matter of me point controverted 
              is too small and light, not worth the heat and strife <br>
              about it, kindled only by contradiction. For, as it is noted by 
              one of the fathers;<br>
              \'Christ\'s coat, indeed, had no seam: but the church\'s vesture 
              was of divers colours;\' whereupon he saith, in veste varietas sit, 
              scissura non sit; they be two things, unity, and uniformity. The 
              other is, when the matter of the point controverted is great, but 
              it is driven to an over-great subtlety, and obscurity; so that it 
              becometh a thing, rather ingenious, then substantial. </p>
            <p>A man that is of judgement and understanding, shall sometimes hear 
              ignorant men differ and know well within himself, mat those which 
              so differ, mean one thing, and yet they themselves would never agree. 
              And if it come so to pass, in that distance of judgement which is 
              between man and man, shall we not think, that God above, that knows 
              the heart, doth not discern that frail men, in some of their contradictions, 
              intend the same thing, and accepteth of both? The nature of such 
              controversies is excellently expressed by St Paul, in the warning 
              and precept that he giveth concerning the same, devita profanas 
              vocum novitates,et oppositiones falsi nominis scientiae. Men create 
              oppositions, which are not; and put them into new terms, so fixed, 
              as whereas the meaning ought to govern <br>
              the term, the term in effect govemeth the meaning. There be also 
              two false peaces, or unities; the one, when the peace is grounded, 
              but upon an implicit ignorance; for all colours will agree in the 
              dark: me other, when it is pieced up, upon a direct admission of 
              contraries, in fundamental points. For truth and falsehood, in such 
              things, are like the iron and clay in the toes of ebucadnezzar\'s 
              image; they may cleave, but they will not incorporate.</p>
            <p> Concerning the means of procuring unity; men must beware that 
              in the procuring, or muniting, of religious unity, they do not dissolve 
              and deface the laws of charity, and of human society. There be two 
              swords amongst Christians, the spiritual, and temporal; and both 
              have their due office, and place, in the maintenance of religion. 
            </p>
            <p>But we may not take up the third sword, which is Mohammed\'s sword, 
              or like unto it; that is, to propagate religion by wars, or by sanguinary 
              prosecutions, to force consciences; except it be in cases of overt 
              scandal, blasphemy, or intermixture of practice against the state; 
              much less to nourish seditions; to authorise conspiracies and rebellions; 
              to put the sword into the people\'s hands; and the like; tending 
              to the subversion of all government, which is the ordinance of God. 
              For this is but to dash the first table against the second; and 
              so to consider men as Christians, as we forget that they are men. 
              Lucretius the poet, when he beheld the act of Agamemnon, that could 
              endure the sacrificing of his own daughter, exclaimed; tantum religio 
              potuit suadere malorum.<br>
            </p>
            <p>What would he have said, if he had known of the massacre in France, 
              or the powder treason of England? he would have been seven times 
              more epicure and atheist, than he was. For as the temporal sword 
              is to be drawn with great circumspection, in cases of religion; 
              so it is a thing monstrous, to put it into the hands of the common 
              people. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Let that be left unto the Anabaptists, and other furies. It was 
              great blasphemy, when the devil said; I will ascend, and be like 
              the highest; but it is greater blasphemy, to personate God, and 
              bring him in saying; I will descend, <br>
              and be like the Prince of Darkness; and what, is it better, to make 
              the cause of <br>
              religion to descend to the cruel and execrable actions of murdering 
              princes, butchery of people, and subversion of states, and governments? 
              Surely, this is to bring down the holy ghost, in stead of the likeness 
              of a dove, in the shape of a vulture, or raven: and to set, out 
              of the bark of a Christian church, a flag <br>
              of a barque of pirates, and assassins. Therefore it is most necessary, 
              that the church by doctrine and decree; princes by their sword; 
              and all learnings, both Christian and moral, as by their mercury 
              rod; do damn and send to Hell, for ever, those facts and opinions, 
              tending to the support of me same; as hath been already in good 
              part done. Surely in counsels concerning religion, that counsel 
              of the apostle would be prefixed; ira hominis non implet justitiam 
              dei. And it was a notable observation, of a wise father, and no 
              less ingenuously confessed; that those, which held and persuaded 
              pressure of consciences were commonly interested therein, themselves, 
              for their own ends.</p>

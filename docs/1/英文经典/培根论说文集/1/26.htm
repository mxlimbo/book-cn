            <p>It hath been an opinion, that the French are wiser than they seem;<br>
              and the Spaniards seem wiser than they are. But howsoever it be 
              between nations, certainly it is so between man and man. For as 
              the apostle saith of godliness; Having a show of godliness, but 
              denying the power thereof; so certainly, there are in points of 
              wisdom, and sufficiency, that do nothing or little, very solemnly; 
              magno conatu nugas. </p>
            <p>It is a ridiculous thing, and fit for a satire, to persons of judgement, 
              to see what shifts these formalists have, and what prospectives, 
              to make superficies to seem body, that hath depth and bulk. Some 
              are so close and reserved, as they will not show their wares, but 
              by a dark light: and seem always to keep back somewhat: and when 
              they know within themselves, they speak of that they do not well 
              know, would nevertheless seem to others, to know of that which they 
              may not well speak. </p>
            <p>Some help themselves with countenance, and gesture, and are wise 
              by signs; as Cicero saith of Piso, that when he answered him, he 
              fetched one of his brows up to his forehead, and bent the other 
              down to his chin: respondes,ahero ad fronton sublato, altero ad 
              mention depresso supercilio, cnudelitatem tibi non placere </p>
            <p>Some think to bear it, by speaking a great word, and being peremptory; 
              and go on, and take by admittance that which they cannot make good. 
              Some, whatsoever is beyond their recall, will seem to despise or 
              make light of it, as impertinent, or curious; and so would have 
              their ignorance seem judgement. Some are never without a difference, 
              and commonly by amusing men with a <br>
              subtlety, blanch the matter; of whom A. Gellius saith; hominem delirum, 
              qui verborum minutiis rerum frangit pondera. Of which kind also, 
              Plato in his Protagoras bringeth in Prodicus, in scorn, and maketh 
              him make a speech, that consisted! of distinctions from the beginning 
              to the end. Generally, such men in all deliberations find ease to 
              be of the negative side, and affect a credit, to object and foretell 
              difficulties: for when propositions are denied, there is an end 
              of them; but if they be allowed, it requireth a new work: which 
              false point of wisdom is the bane of business. </p>
            <p>To conclude, there is no decaying merchant, or inward beggar, hath 
              so many tricks, to uphold the credit of their wealth, as these empty 
              persons have, to maintain the credit of their sufficiency. Seeming 
              wise men may make shift to get opinion: but let no man choose them 
              for employment; for certainly, you were better take for business 
              a man somewhat absurd than over formal.</p>

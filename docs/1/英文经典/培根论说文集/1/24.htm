            <p>As the births of living creatures, at first, are ill shapen: so 
              are all innovations, <br>
              which are the births of time. Yet notwithstanding, as those that 
              first bring honour <br>
              into their family, are commonly more worthy, than most that succeed: 
              so the first <br>
              precedent (if it be good) is seldom attained by mutation. </p>
            <p>For ill, to man\'s nature, as it stands perverted, hath a natural 
              motion, strongest in continuance: but good, as a forced motion, 
              strongest at first Surely every medicine is an innovation; and he 
              that will not apply new remedies, must expect new evils: for time 
              is the greatest innovator: and if time, of course, alter things 
              to the worse, and wisdom and counsel shall not alter them to the 
              better, what shall be the end? It is true, that what is settled 
              by custom, though it be not good, yet at least it is fit And those 
              things, which have long gone together, are as it were confederate 
              within themselves: whereas new things piece not so well; but though 
              they help by their utility, yet they trouble by their inconformity. 
              Besides, they are like strangers; more admired, and less favoured. 
            </p>
            <p>All this is true, if time stood still; which contrariwise moveth 
              so round, <br>
              that a froward retention of custom is as turbulent a thing as an 
              innovation:<br>
              and they that reverence too much old times, are but a scorn to the 
              new. It were good therefore, that men in their innovations, would 
              follow the example of time itself; which indeed innovated greatly, 
              but quietly, and by degrees, scarce to be perceived: for otherwise, 
              whatsoever is new, is unlocked for; and ever it mends some, and 
              pairs other: and he that is holpen, takes it for a fortune, and 
              thanks the time; and he that is hurt, for a wrong, and imputeth 
              it to the author. It is good also, not to try experiments in states, 
              except me necessity be urgent, or the utility evident: and well 
              to beware, that it be the reformation, that draweth on the change; 
              and not the desire of change, that pretendeth the reformation. And 
              lastly, that the novelty, though it be not rejected, yet be held 
              for a suspect: and, as the scripture saith; that we make a stand 
              upon the ancient way, and then look about us, and discover what 
              is the straight and right way, and so to walk in it.</p>

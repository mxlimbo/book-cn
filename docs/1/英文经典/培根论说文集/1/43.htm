            <p align="center" class="h">43 Of Beauty 
            <p>Virtue is like a rich stone, best plain set: and surely virtue 
              is best in a body that <br>
              is comely, though not of delicate features: and that hath rather 
              dignity of presence, <br>
              than beauty of aspect Neither is it almost seen, that very beautiful 
              persons are <br>
              otherwise of great virtue; as if nature were rather busy not to 
              err, than in labour <br>
              to produce excellency. And therefore, they prove accomplished, but 
              not of great spirit; and study rather behaviour, than virtue; but 
              this holds not always; for Augustus Caesar, Titus Vespasianus, Philip 
              Ie Belle of France, Edward the Fourth of England, Alcitriades of 
              Athens, Ismael the Sophy of Persia, were all high and great spirits; 
              and yet _e most beautiful men of their times. In beauty, that of 
              favour is more than that of colour, and that of decent and gracious 
              motion, more than that of favour. <br>
            </p>
            <p>That is the best part of beauty, which a picture cannot express; 
              no, nor the first <br>
              sight of the life. There is no excellent beauty, that hath not some 
              strangeness in <br>
              the proportion. A man cannot tell, whether Apelles, or Albert Durer, 
              were the more <br>
              trifler: whereof the one would make a personage by geometrical proportions: 
              the other, by taking the best parts out of divers faces, to make 
              one excellent. Such personages, I think, would please nobody but 
              the painter that made them. Not but I think a painter may make a 
              better face, than ever was; but he must do it, by a kind of felicity 
              (as a musician that maketh an excellent air in music) and not by 
              rule. </p>
            <p>A man shall see faces, that if you examine them, part by part, 
              you shall find never a good; and yet all together do well. If it 
              be true, that the principal part of beauty is in decent motion, 
              certainly it is no marvel though persons in years seem many times 
              more amiable; pulchravmautumnuspiiJcher: for no youth can be comely 
              but by pardon, and considering the youth as to make up the comeliness. 
            </p>
            <p>Beauty is as summer fruits, which are easy to corrupt, and cannot 
              last and, for the most part, it makes a dissolute youth, and an 
              age a little out of countenance: but yet certainly again, if it 
              light well, it maketh virtues shine, and vices blush.</p>

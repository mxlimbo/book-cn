            <p>The winning of honour is but the revealing of a man\'s virtue and 
              worth, without <br>
              disadvantage. For some in their actions do woo and affect honour 
              and reputation. </p>
            <p>Which sort of men are commonly much talked of, but inwardly little 
              admired. And some, contrariwise, darken their virtue, in the show 
              of it; so as they be undervalued in opinion. If a man perform that 
              which hath not been attempted before; or attempted and given over, 
              or ham been achieved, but not with so good circumstance; he shall 
              purchase more honour, than by effecting a matter of greater difficulty, 
              or virtue, wherein he is but a follower. If a man so temper his 
              actions, as in some one of them he doth content every faction, or 
              combination of people, the music will be the fuller. <br>
            </p>
            <p>A man is an ill husband of his honour, that entereth into any action, 
              the failing <br>
              wherein may disgrace him more, than the carrying of it through can 
              honour him. Honour that is gained and broken upon another, hath 
              the quickest reflection; like diamonds cut with facets. </p>
            <p>And therefore, let a man contend to excel any competitors of his 
              in honour, in out-shooting them, if he can, in their own bow. Discreet 
              followers and servants help much to reputation. Onuus farm a danestids 
              emanat. Envy, which is me <br>
              canker of honour, is best extinguished by declaring a man\'s self 
              in his ends, rather <br>
              to seek merit, man fame: and by attributing a man\'s successes, 
              rather to divine <br>
              providence and felicity, than to his own virtue or policy. The true 
              marshalling of <br>
              the degrees of sovereign honour are these. In the first place are 
              concStorvsynperionan; founders of states, and commonwealths: such 
              as were Romulus, Cyrus, Caesar, Ottoman, Ismael. In the second place 
              are kgidttones, lawgivers; which are also called, second founders, 
              or papead prindpes, because they govern by their ordinances, after 
              they are gone: such were Lycurgus, <br>
              Solon, Justinian, Eadgar, Alphonsus of Castile, the Wise, that made 
              the Siete Parados. <br>
            </p>
            <p>In the third place are Sbemta-es, or sahcams: such as compound 
              the long miseries of civil wars, or deliver their countries from 
              servitude of strangers or tyrants; as <br>
              Augustus Caesar, Vespasianus, Aurelianus, Theodoricus, Henry VH 
              of England and Henry IV of France. In me fourth place are propa^JSores 
              or prnpugnatores imperil; such as in honourable wars enlarge their 
              territories, or make noble defence against invaders</p>
            <p> And in the last place are patres patriae; which reign justly, 
              and make the times good, wherein they live. Both which last kinds 
              need no examples, they are in such number. </p>
            <p>Degrees of honour in subjects are; first, paiHapes cwarwn; those 
              upon whom princes do discharge the greatest weight of their affairs; 
              their right hands, as we call them. </p>
            <p>The next are duces beS, great leaders; such as are princes\' lieutenants, 
              and do them notable services in the wars. The third are ^arias\', 
              favourites; such as exceed not this scantling; to be solace to the 
              sovereign, and harmless to the people. And the fourth, negotas pares; 
              such as have great places under princes, and execute their places 
              with sufficiency. <br>
            </p>
            <p>There is an honour likewise, which may be ranked amongst the greatest, 
              which happeneth rarely: that is, of such as sacrifice themselves, 
              to death or danger, for the good of their country: as was M. Regulus, 
              and the two Decii.</p>

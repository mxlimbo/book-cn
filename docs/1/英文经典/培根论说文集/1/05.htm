            <p align="center" class="h">5 Of Adversity 
            <p>It was an high speech of Seneca (after the manner of the Stoics) 
              that the good things which belong to prosperity are to be wished; 
              but the good things that belong to adversity are to be admired. 
              Bona rerum secudarum optabilia; adversarum mirabilia.</p>
            <p> Certainly if miracles be the command over nature, they appear 
              most in adversity. It is yet a higher speech of his than the other 
              (much too high for a heathen): It is true greatness to have in one 
              the fragility of a man and the security of a God. Vere magnum habere 
              fragilitaterm hominis securitatem da. This would have done better 
              in poesy; where transcendencies are more allowed. And the poets 
              indeed, have been busy with it; for it is, in effect, the thing 
              which is figured in that strange fiction of the ancient poets, which 
              seemeth not to be without mystery; nay, and to have some approach 
              to the state of a Christian: that Hercules when he went to unbind 
              Prometheus (by whom human nature is represented) sailed the length 
              of the great ocean in an earthen pot or pitcher: lively describing 
              Christian resolution; that saileth, in the frail barque of the flesh, 
              through the waves of the world. But to speak in a mean. </p>
            <p>The virtue of prosperity is temperance; the virtue of adversity 
              is fortitude:<br>
              which in morals is the more heroical virtue. Prosperity is the blessing 
              of the Old <br>
              Testament; adversity is the blessing of the New; which carrieth 
              the greater <br>
              benediction, and the clearer revelation of God\'s favour. Yet, even 
              in the Old <br>
              Testament, if you listen to David\'s harp, you shall hear as many 
              hearselike airs, <br>
              as carols: and the pencil of the Holy Ghost hath laboured more, 
              in describing the <br>
              afflictions of Job, than the felicities of Solomon. Prosperity is 
              not without many <br>
              fears and distastes; and adversity is not without comforts and hopes. 
              We see in <br>
              needlework, and embroideries, it is more pleasing to have a lively 
              work upon a sad and solemn ground, than to have a dark and melancholy 
              work, upon a lightsome ground: judge therefore, of the pleasure 
              of the heart, by the pleasure of the eye. Certainly, virtue is like 
              precious odours, most fragrant when they are incensed, or crushed: 
              for prosperity doth best discover vice; but adversity doth best 
              discover virtue.</p>

            <p>Houses are built to live in, and not to look on: therefore let 
              use be preferred before <br>
              uniformity; except where both may be had. Leave the goodly fabrics 
              of houses, for <br>
              beauty only, to the enchanted palaces of the poets: who build them 
              wilh small cost <br>
              He that builds a fair house, upon an ill seat, committeth himself 
              to prison. Neither <br>
              do I reckon it an ill seat only where the air is unwholesome; but 
              likewise where the <br>
              air is unequal; as you shall see many fine seats, set upon a knap 
              of ground, environed with higher hills round about it: whereby the 
              heat of the sun is pent in, and the wind gathereth as in troubles; 
              so as you shall have, and that suddenly, as great diversity of heat 
              and cold, as if you dwelt in several places. Neither is it ill air 
              <br>
              only that maketh an ill seat, but ill ways, ill markets; and, if 
              you will consult <br>
              with Momus, ill neighbours. </p>
            <p>I speak not of many more: want of water, want of wood, shade, and 
              shelter, want of fruitfulness, and mixture of grounds of several 
              natures; want of prospect; want of level grounds; want of places, 
              at some near distance, for sports of hunting, hawking, and races; 
              too near the sea, too remote; having the commodity of navigable 
              rivers, or the discommodity of their overflowing; too far off from 
              great cities, which may hinder business; or too near them, which 
              lurcheth all provisions, and maketh every thing dear: where a man 
              hath a great living laid together, and where he is scanted: all 
              which, as it is impossible, perhaps, to find together, so it is 
              good to know them, and think of them, that a man may take as many 
              as he can: and if he have several dwellings, that he sort them so, 
              that what he wanteth in the one, he may find in the other. Lucullus 
              answered Pompey well; who when he saw his stately galleries, and 
              rooms, so large and lightsome, in one of his houses, said;<br>
            </p>
            <p>Surely, an excellent place for summer, but how do you in winter?<br>
              Lucullus answered; Why, do you not think me as wise as some fowl 
              are, that ever change their abode towards the winter?<br>
            </p>
            <p>To pass from the seat, to the house itself; we will do as Cicero 
              doth, in the orator\'s art; who writes books De Oratore, and a book 
              he entitles Orator: whereof the former delivers the precepts of 
              the art; and the latter the perfection. We will therefore describe 
              a princely palace, making a brief model thereof. For it is strange 
              to see, now in Europe, such huge buildings as the Vatican, and Escurial, 
              and some others be, and yet scarce a very fair room in them.<br>
            </p>
            <p>First therefore, I say, you cannot have a perfect palace, except 
              you have two several sides; a side for me banquet, as is spoken 
              of in the Book of Hester, and a side for the household: the one 
              for feasts and triumphs, and the other for dwelling. </p>
            <p>I understand both these sides to be not only returns, but parts 
              of the front; and to <br>
              be uniform without, though severally partitioned within; and to 
              be on both sides of <br>
              a great and stately tower, in the midst of the front; that as it 
              were, joinefh them <br>
              together, on either hand. I would have on the side of the banquet, 
              in front, one only <br>
              goodly room, above stairs, of some forty foot high; and under it, 
              a room for a dressing or preparing place, at times of triumphs. 
              On the other side, which is the household side, I wish it divided 
              at the first into a hall, and a chapel (with a partition <br>
              between); both of good state, and bigness: and those not to go all 
              the length, but <br>
              to have, at the further end, a winter and a summer parlour, both 
              fair. And under these rooms, a fair and large cellar, sunk under 
              ground: and likewise, some privy kitchens, with butteries, and pantries, 
              and the like. </p>
            <p>As for the tower, I would have it two storeys, of eighteen foot 
              high a piece, above the two wings; and a goodly leads upon the top, 
              railed with statues interposed; and the same tower to be divided 
              into rooms, as shall be thought fit The stairs likewise, to the 
              upper rooms, let them be upon a fair open newel, and finely railed 
              in, with images of wood, cast into a brass colour: and a very fair 
              landing place at the top. But this to be, if you do not point any 
              of the lower rooms, for a dining place of servants. For otherwise, 
              you shall have the servants\' dinner after your own: for the steam 
              of it will come up as in a tunnel. <br>
            </p>
            <p>And so much for the front. Only, I understand the height of the 
              first stairs to be <br>
              sixteen foot, which is the height of the lower room.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Beyond this front, is there to be a fair court, but three sides 
              of it, of a far lower <br>
              building than the front. And in all the four comers of that<br>
              court, fair staircases, cast into turrets, on the outside, and not 
              within the row <br>
              of buildings themselves. But those towers are not to be of the height 
              of the front; <br>
              but rather proportionable to the lower building. Let the court not 
              be paved, for that <br>
              striketh up a great heat in summer, and much cold in winter. But 
              only some side alleys, with a cross, and me quarters to graze, being 
              kept shorn, but not too near shorn. </p>
            <p>The row of return, on the banquet side, let it be all stately galleries; 
              in which <br>
              galleries, let there be three or four fine cupolas, in me length 
              of it, placed at <br>
              equal distance: and fine coloured windows of several works. On the 
              household side, chambers of presence, and ordinary entertainments, 
              with some bed-chambers; and let all three sides be a double house, 
              without through lights, on the sides, that you may have rooms from 
              the sun, both for forenoon, and afternoon. Cast it also, that you 
              may have-rooms, born for summer, and winter. shady for summer, and 
              warm for winter. <br>
            </p>
            <p>You shall have sometimes fair houses, so full of glass, that one 
              cannot tell where <br>
              to become, to be out of the sun, or cold: for inbowed windows, I 
              hold them of good use; (in cities indeed, upright do better, in 
              respect of the uniformity towards the street;) for they be pretty 
              retiring places for conference; and besides, they keep <br>
              both the wind and sun off: for that which would strike almost through 
              the room, doth scarce pass the window. But let them be but few, 
              four in the court, on the sides only.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Beyond this court, let there be an inward court of the same square 
              and height; which is to be environed, with the garden, on all sides: 
              and in the inside, cloistered on all sides, upon decent and beautiful 
              arches, as high as the first storey. On the under storey, towards 
              the garden, let it be turned to a grotto, or place of shade, or 
              estivation. And only have opening and windows towards the garden; 
              and be level upon the floor, no whit sunk under ground, to avoid 
              all dampishness. And let there be a fountain, or some fair work 
              of statues, in the midst of this court; and to be paved as the other 
              court was. These buildings to be for privy lodgings, on both sides; 
              and the end, for privy galleries. </p>
            <p>Whereof, you must foresee, that one of them be for an infirmary, 
              if the prince or any special person should be sick, with chambers, 
              bed-chamber, antecamera, and recamera, joining to it This upon the 
              second storey. Upon the ground storey, a fair gallery, open, upon 
              pillars: and upon uie third storey likewise, an open gallery upon 
              pillars, to take the prospect, and freshness of the garden. </p>
            <p>At both comers of the further side, by way of return, let there 
              be two delicate or rich cabinets, daintily paved, richly hanged, 
              glazed with crystalline glass, and a rich cupola in die midst; and 
              all other elegancy that may be thought upon. In the upper gallery 
              too, I wish that there may be, if the place will yield it, some 
              fountains running, in divers places, from the wall, with some fine 
              avoidances. And thus much, for the model of the palace: save that 
              you must have, before you come to the front, three courts. A green 
              court plain, with a wall about it: a second court of the same, but 
              more garnished, with little turrets, or rather embellishments, upon 
              the wall: and a third court, to make a square with the front, but 
              not to be built, nor yet enclosed with a naked wall, but enclosed 
              with terraces, leaded aloft, and fairly garnished, on the three 
              sides; and cloistered on the inside, with pillars, and not with 
              arches below. </p>
            <p>As for offices, let them stand at distance, with some lofty galleries, 
              to pass <br>
              from them to the palace itself.</p>

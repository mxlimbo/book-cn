            <p>It were better to have no opinion of God at all, than such an opinion, 
              as is unworthy of him: for the one is unbelief, the other is contumely:<br>
              and certainly superstition is the reproach of the deity. Plutarch 
              saith well to that <br>
              purpose: </p>
            <p>Surely (saith he) I had rather, a great deal, men should say, there 
              was no <br>
              such man at all as Plutarch; than that they should say, that there 
              was one Plutarch, that would eat his children, as soon as they were 
              born, as the poets speak of Saturn. </p>
            <p>And, as the contumely is greater towards God, so the danger is 
              greater towards men. Atheism leaves a man to sense; to philosophy; 
              to natural piety;<br>
              to laws; to reputation; all which may be guides to an outward moral 
              virtue, though religion were not; but superstition dismounts all 
              these, and erecteth an absolute monarchy in the minds of men. </p>
            <p>Therefore atheism did never perturb states; for it makes men wary 
              of themselves, as looking no further: and we see the times inclined 
              to atheism <br>
              (as the time of Augustus Caesar) were civil times. But superstition 
              halh been the <br>
              conclusion of many states; and bringeth in a new primum mobile, 
              that ravisheth all the spheres of government The master of superstition 
              is the people; and in all <br>
              superstition, wise men follow fools; and arguments are fitted to 
              practice, in a <br>
              reversed order. It was gravely said, by some of the prelates, in 
              the Council of Trent, where the doctrine of the schoolmen bare great 
              sway; that the schoolmen were like astronomers, which did feign 
              eccentrics and epicycles, and such engines of orbs, to save me phenomena; 
              though they knew, there were no such things: and, in like manner, 
              that the schoolmen had framed a number of subtle and intricate axioms, 
              and theorems, to save the practice of the Church. </p>
            <p>The causes of superstition are: pleasing and sensual rites and 
              ceremonies; excess of outward and pharisaical holiness; over-great 
              reverence of traditions, which cannot but load the Church; the stratagems 
              of prelates for then-own ambition and lucre; the favouring too much 
              of good intentions, which openeth the gate to conceits and novelties; 
              the taking an aim at divine matters by human, which cannot but breed 
              mixture of imaginations; and lastly, barbarous times, <br>
              especially joined with calamities and disasters. Superstition, without 
              a veil, is <br>
              a deformed thing; for, as it addeth deformity to an ape, to be so 
              like a man; so the similitude of superstition to religion, makes 
              it the more deformed. And as wholesome meat corrupteth to little 
              worms, so good forms and orders corrupt into a number of petty observances. 
            </p>
            <p>There is a superstition, in avoiding superstition; when men think 
              to do best, if they go furthest from the superstition formerly received: 
              therefore, care would be had, that (as it fareth in ill purgings) 
              the good be not taken away with the bad; which commonly is done, 
              when (he people is the reformer.</p>

            <p>A man that is young in years, may be old in hours, if he have lost 
              no time. But that <br>
              happeneth rarely. Generally, youth is like the first cogitations, 
              not so wise as the <br>
              second. For there is a youth in thoughts as well as in ages. And 
              yet the invention <br>
              of young men is more lively than that of old: and imaginations stream 
              into their minds better, and, as it were, more divinely. Natures 
              that have much heat, and great and violent desires and perturbations, 
              are not ripe for action, till they have passed <br>
              the meridian of meir years: as it was with Julius Caesar, and Septimius 
              Severus. Of <br>
              the latter of whom, it is said; iuventutem egit enwibus, imo fwonbus, 
              plenorn. And <br>
              yet he was the ablest emperor, almost, of all me list But reposed 
              natures may do well in youth. As it is seen in Augustus Caesar, 
              Cosmus Duke of Florence, Gaston de Fois, and others. </p>
            <p>On the other side, heat and vivacity in age is an excellent composition 
              <br>
              for business. Young men are fitter to invent, than to judge; fitter 
              for execution, <br>
              than for counsel; and fitter for new projects, man for settled business. 
              For the <br>
              experience of age, in things that fall within the compass of it, 
              directeth them; but <br>
              in new things, abuseth them. The errors of young men are the ruin 
              of business; but <br>
              me errors of aged men amount but to this; that more might have been 
              done, or sooner. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Young men, in the conduct and manage of actions, embrace more than 
              they can hold, stir more than they can quiet; fly to the end, without 
              consideration of the means, and degrees; pursue some few principles, 
              which they have chanced upon absurdly; care not to innovate, which 
              draws unknown inconveniences; use extreme remedies at first; and, 
              that which doubled all errors, will not acknowledge or retract them; 
              like an unready horse, that will neither stop, nor turn. Men of 
              age object too much, consult too long, adventure too little, repent 
              too soon, and seldom drive business home to the full period; but 
              content themselves with a mediocrity of success. </p>
            <p>Certainly, it is good to compound employments of both; for that 
              will be good for the present, because the virtues of either age 
              may correct the defects of both: and good for succession, mat young 
              men may be learners, while men in age are actors: and lastly, good 
              for extreme accidents, because authority followeth old men, and 
              favour and popularity youth. </p>
            <p>But far the moral part, perhaps youth will have the pre-eminence, 
              as age hath for the politic. A certain rabbin, upon the text; Your 
              young men that see visions, and your old men that dream dreams; 
              inferreth, that young men are admitted nearer to God than old; because 
              vision is a clearer revelation, than a dream. And certainly, me 
              more a man drinketh of the world, the more it intoxicateth; and 
              age doth profit rather in the powers of understanding, man in the 
              virtues of me will and affections. </p>
            <p>There be some have an over-early ripeness in their years, which 
              fadeth betimes: these are first, such as have brittle wits, the 
              edge whereof is soon turned; such as was Hermogenes the Rhetorician, 
              whose books are exceeding subtle; who afterwards waxed stupid. </p>
            <p>A second sort is of those, that have some natural dispositions, 
              which have <br>
              better grace in youth, than in age: such as is a fluent and luxuriant 
              speech; which <br>
              becomes youth well, but not age: so Tully saith of Hortentius; idem 
              manebat, neque <br>
              idem decdxtt. The third is of such as take too high a strain at 
              the first; and are <br>
              magnanimous, more than tract of years can uphold. As was Sdpio Africanus, 
              of whom Livy saith in effect; ultima prims cedebant.</p>

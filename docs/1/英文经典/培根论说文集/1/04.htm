            <p align="center" class="h">4 Of Revenge 
            <p>Revenge is a kind of wild justice; which the more man\'s nature 
              runs to, the more ought law to weed it out For as for the first 
              wrong, it doth but offend the law; but the revenge of that wrong, 
              putteth the law out of office. Certainly, in taking revenge, a man 
              is but even with his enemy; but in passing it over, he is superior: 
              for it is a prince\'s part to pardon. And Solomon, I am sure, saith, 
              It is the glory of a man to pass by an offence. That which is past, 
              is gone, and irrevocable; and wise men have enough to do, with things 
              present, and to come: therefore, they do but trifle with themselves, 
              that labour in past matters. There is no man doth a wrong, for the 
              wrong\'s sake; but thereby to purchase himself profit, or pleasure, 
              or honour, or the like. Therefore why should I be angry with a man, 
              for loving himself better than me? </p>
            <p>And if any man should do wrong, merely out of ill nature, why, 
              yet it is but like <br>
              the thorn, or briar, which prick, and scratch, because they can 
              do no other. The most tolerable sort of revenge, is for those wrongs 
              which there is no law to remedy: but then, let a man take heed the 
              revenge be such as there is no law to punish: else, a man\'s enemy 
              is still before hand, and it is two for one. Some, when they take 
              revenge, are desirous the party should know whence it cometh: this 
              is the more generous. For the delight seemeth to be, not so much 
              in doing the hurt, as in making the party repent: but base and crafty 
              cowards are like the arrow that flieth in the dark. Cosmus, Duke 
              of Florence, had a desperate saying, against perfidious or neglecting 
              friends, as if those wrongs were unpardonable: You shall read (saith 
              he) mat we are commanded to forgive our enemies; but you never read, 
              that we are commanded to forgive our friends. But yet the spirit 
              of Job, was in a better tune; Shall we (saith he) take good at God\'s 
              hands, and not be content to take evil also? And so of friends in 
              a proportion. This is certain; that a man that studieth revenge, 
              keeps his own wounds green, which otherwise would heal, and do well. 
              Public revenges, are, for the most part, fortunate; as that for 
              the death of Caesar, for the death of Pertinax; for the death of 
              Henry the Third of France; and many more. But in private revenges 
              it is not so. Nay rather, vindictive persons live the life of witches; 
              who as they are mischievous, so end they unfortunate.</p>

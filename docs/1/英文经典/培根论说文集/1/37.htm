            <p>These dungs are but toys, to come amongst such serious observations. 
              But yet, since princes will have such things, it is better they 
              should be graced with elegancy, than daubed with cost Dancing to 
              song, is a thing of great state, and pleasure. I understand it, 
              that the song be in choir, placed aloft, and accompanied with some 
              broken music; and the ditty fitted to the device. Acting in song, 
              especially in dialogues, hath an extreme good grace: I say acting, 
              not dancing (for that is a mean and vulgar thing), and the voices 
              of the dialogue would be strong and manly (a bass, and a tenor; 
              no treble) and the ditty high and tragical; not nice or dainty. 
              Several choirs, placed one over against another, and taking the 
              voice by catches, anthem-wise, give great pleasure. </p>
            <p>Turning dances into figure is a childish curiosity. And generally, 
              let it be noted, that those things which I here set down, are such 
              as do naturally take the sense, and not respect petty wonderments. 
              It is true, the alterations of scenes, so it be quietly, and without 
              noise, are things of great beauty, and pleasure: for they feed and 
              relieve the eye, before it be full of the same object. Let the scenes 
              abound with light, specially coloured and varied: and let the masquers, 
              or any other, that are to come down from the scene, have some motions 
              upon the scene itself, before their coming down: for it draws the 
              eye strangely, and makes it with great pleasure, to <br>
              desire to see that it cannot perfectly discern. </p>
            <p>Let the songs be loud, and cheerful, and not chirpings, or pulings. 
              Let the music likewise be sharp, and loud, and well placed. The 
              colours that show best by candlelight are; white, carnation, and 
              a kind of seawater-green; and oes, or spangs, as they are of no 
              great cost, so they are of most glory.</p>
            <p> As for rich embroidery, it is lost, and not discerned. Let the 
              suits of the masquers be graceful, and such as become the person, 
              when the vizors are off: not after examples of known attires; Turks, 
              soldiers, mariners, and the like. Let antimasques not be long; they 
              have been commonly of fools, satyrs, baboons, wild-men, antics, 
              beasts, sprites, witches, Ethiopes, pigmies, turquets, nymphs, rustics, 
              cupids, statues moving, and the like. </p>
            <p>As for angels, it is not comical enough, to put them in anti-masques; 
              and any thing that is hideous, as devils, giants, is on the other 
              side as unfit. But chiefly, let the music of them be recreative, 
              and with some strange changes. Some sweet odours, suddenly coming 
              forth, without any drops falling, are, in such a company, as there 
              is steam and heat, things of great pleasure and refreshment. Double 
              masques, one of men, another of ladies, addeth state and variety. 
              But all is nothing, except the room be kept clear and neat. For 
              justs, and tourneys, and barriers; the glories of them are chiefly 
              in the chariots, wherein the challengers make their entry; especially 
              if they be drawn with strange beasts; as lions, bears, camels, and 
              the like:<br>
              or in the devices of their entrance; or in the bravery of their 
              liveries; or in the goodly furniture of their horses, and armour. 
              But enough of these toys.</p>

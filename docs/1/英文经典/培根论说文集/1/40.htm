            <p>It cannot be denied, but outward accidents conduce much to fortune, 
              favour, <br>
              opportunity, death of others, occasion fitting virtue. But chiefly, 
              tile mould of <br>
              a man\'s fortune is in his own hands. Faber quisque fortunae suae; 
              saith the poet </p>
            <p>And the most frequent of external causes is, that the folly of 
              one man is the fortune <br>
              of another. For no man prospers so suddenly, as by others\' errors. 
              Serpens nisi <br>
              serpenterm comederit non fit draco. Overt and apparent virtues bring 
              forth praise;<br>
              but there be secret and hidden virtues, that bring forth fortune; 
              certain deliveries of a man\'s self, which have no name. The Spanish 
              name, desemboltura, partly expresseth them: when there be not stonds, 
              nor resdveness in a man\'s nature; <br>
              but that the wheels of his mind keep way with the wheels of his 
              fortune. For so Livy (after he had described Cato Major, in these 
              words; in ilh viro, tanturn robur corporis et animi fiit, ut quocwique 
              loco natus esset ,fortunarus sibi facturs videretur) falleth upon 
              that, that he had versatile ingenium Therefore, if a man look sharply, 
              and attentively, he shall see fortune: for though she be blind, 
              yet she is not <br>
              invisible. </p>
            <p>The way of fortune is like the Milken Way in the sky; which is 
              a meeting <br>
              or knot of a number of small stars; not seen asunder, but giving 
              light together. So are there a number of little, and scarce discerned 
              virtues, or rather faculties and customs, that make men fortunate.</p>
            <p> The Italians note some of them, such as a man would little think. 
              When they speak <br>
              of one that cannot do amiss, they will throw in, into his other 
              conditions, that he <br>
              hath poco di motto. And certainly, there be not two more fortunate 
              properties;<br>
              than to have a little of the fool; and not too much of the honest. 
              Therefore, extreme <br>
              lovers of their country, or masters, were never fortunate, neither 
              can they be. For <br>
              when a man placeth his thoughts without himself, he goeth not his 
              own way. An hasty fortune maketh an enterpriser, and remover (the 
              French hath it better, entrepreneur, or remuamt), but the exercised 
              fortune maketh the able man. Fortune is to be honoured, and respected, 
              and it be but for her daughters, Confidence, and Reputation. For 
              those two felicity hreedeth: the first within a man\'s self; the 
              latter, in others towards him. </p>
            <p>All wise men, to decline me envy of their own virtues, use to ascribe 
              them to <br>
              providence and fortune; for so they may the better assume them: 
              and besides, it is <br>
              greatness in a man, to be the care of me higher powers. So Caesar 
              said to me pilot <br>
              in the tempest, Caesarem portas, etfortunam ene. So Sulla chose 
              the name of Felix, <br>
              and not of Magnus. And it hath been noted, that those that ascribe 
              openly too much to their own wisdom, and policy, end unfortunate. 
              It is written, that </p>
            <p>Timotheus the Athenian, after he had, in the account he gave to 
              the state of his government, often interlaced this speech, \'and 
              in mis fortune had no part\', never prospered in anything he undertook 
              afterwards. Certainly, mere be, whose fortunes are like Homer\'s 
              verses, that have a slide, and easiness, more than the verses of 
              other poets: as Plutarch sailh of Timoleon\'s fortune, in respect 
              of that of Agesilaus, or Epaminondas. And that this should be, no 
              doubt it is much in a man\'s self.</p>

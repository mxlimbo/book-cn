            <p align="center" class="h">2 Of Death
            <p>Men fear death, as children fear to go in the dark: and as that 
              natural fear in children is increased with tales, so is the other. 
              Certainly, the contemplation of death, as the wages of sin, and 
              passage to another world, is holy and religious; but the fear of 
              it, as a tribute due unto nature, is weak. Yet in religious meditations, 
              there is sometimes mixture of vanity, and of superstition. </p>
            <p>You shall read, in some of the friars\' books of mortifications, 
              that a man should think with himself, what the pain is, if he have 
              but his finger\'s end pressed, or tortured; and thereby imagine, 
              what the pains of death are, when the whole body is corrupted and 
              dissolved; when many times, death passeth with less pain, then the 
              torture of a limb: for the most vital parts are not the quickest 
              of sense. And by him, that spoke only as a philosopher and natural 
              man, it was well said; pompa mortis magis terret, quam mars ipsa. 
              Groans and convulsions, and a discoloured face, and friends weeping, 
              and blacks, and obsequies, and the like, show death terrible. It 
              is worthy the observing, that there is no passion in the mind of 
              man so weak, but it mates, and masters, the fear of death: and therefore 
              death is no such terrible enemy, when a man hath so many attendants 
              about him that can win the combat of him. Revenge triumphs over 
              death; love slights it; honour aspireth to it; grief flieth to it; 
              fear preoccupieth it; nay we read, after Otho the Emperor had slain 
              himself, pity (which is the tenderest of affections) provoked many 
              to die, out of mere compassion to their sovereign, and as the truest 
              sort of followers. Nay, Seneca adds niceness and satiety; cogita 
              quarn diu. eadem feceris; mori velle, non tantun fortis, out miser, 
              sed etiam fastidiosus potest. </p>
            <p>A man would die, though he were neither valiant, nor miserable, 
              only upon a weariness to do the same thing, so oft over and over. 
              It is no less worthy to observe, how little alteration, in good 
              spirits, die approaches of death make; for they appear to be the 
              same men, till the last instant Augustus Caesar died in a compliment; 
              Livia, coniugii nostri memor, vive et vale. Tiberius in dissimulation; 
              as Tacitus saith of him; mm Tiberium vires, et corpus, non dissimulatio, 
              deserebant. Vespasian in a jest; sitting upon the stool, ut puto 
              deus fio. Galba with a sentence;feri\', si ex re sit populi Romani, 
              holding forth his neck. Septimius Severus in dispatch; adeste,si 
              quid mihi restat agendum. And the like. Certainly, the Stoics bestowed 
              too much cost upon death, and by their great preparations, made 
              it appear more fearful. Better saith he, qui finem vitae extremism 
              inter munera ponat naturae. It is as natural to die, as to be born; 
              and to a little infant, perhaps, the one is as painful as the other. 
              He that dies in an earnest pursuit, is like one that is wounded 
              in hot blood; who, for the time, scarce feels the hurt;and therefore, 
              a mind fixed, and bent upon somewhat that <br>
              is good, doth avert me dolours of death: but above all, believe 
              it, the sweetest <br>
              canticle is, minc difmittis; when a man hath obtained worthy ends, 
              and expectations. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Death hath this also; that it openeth the gate to good fame, and 
              extinguisheth envy. - exstinctus amabitur idem.</p>

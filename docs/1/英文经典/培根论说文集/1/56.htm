            <p align="center" class="h">56 Of Judicature
            <p>Judges ought to remember, that their office is ius dicere, and 
              not ius dare; to <br>
              interpret law, and not to make law, or give law. Else will it be 
              like the authority <br>
              claimed by the church of Rome; which under pretext of exposition 
              of scripture, doth not stick to add and alter, and to pronounce 
              that which they do not find; and by show of antiquity, to introduce 
              novelty. Judges ought to be more learned, than witty; more reverent, 
              than plausible; and more advised, than confident. Above all things, 
              integrity is their portion, and proper virtue. Cursed (saith the 
              law) is he that <br>
              removeth the landmark. </p>
            <p>The mislayer of a mere stone is to blame. But it is the unjust 
              judge that is the capital remover of landmarks, when he defineth 
              amiss of lands and property. One foul sentence doth more hurt, than 
              many foul examples. For these do but corrupt the stream; the other 
              corrupted! the fountain. So saith Solomon; Fons twbatus, et vena 
              corrupta, est iustus cadens in causa sua coram adversario. </p>
            <p>The office of judges may have reference unto the parties that sue; 
              unto me advocates that plead; unto the clerks and ministers of justice 
              underneath them and to the sovereign or state above them.<br>
            </p>
            <p>First, for the causes or parties that sue. There be (saith the 
              scripture) that turn <br>
              judgement into wormwood; and surely, there be also, that turn it 
              into vinegar, for <br>
              injustice maketh it bitter, and delays make it sour. The principal 
              duty of a judge <br>
              is to suppress force and fraud; whereof force is the more pernicious, 
              when it is open; and fraud, when it is close and disguised. </p>
            <p>Add thereto contentious suits, which ought to be spewed out, as 
              the surfeit of courts. A judge ought to prepare his way to a just 
              sentence, as God useth to prepare his way, by raising valleys, and 
              taking down hills: so when there appeared! on eidier side, an high 
              hand, violent prosecution, cunning advantages taken, <br>
              combination, power, great counsel, then is the virtue of a judge 
              seen, to make <br>
              inequality equal; that he may plant his judgement, as upon an even 
              ground. Qui fortiter emungit, elicit sangwiem; and where the winepress 
              is hard wrought, it yields a harsh wine, that tastes of the grapestone. 
              Judges must beware of hard constructions, and strained inferences; 
              for there is no worse torture, than the torture of laws. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Specially in case of laws penal, they ought to have care, that 
              that which was meant <br>
              for terror be not turned into rigour; and that they bring not upon 
              the people that <br>
              shower, whereof the scripture speaketh; plwt supa- eos laqueos: 
              for penal laws pressed, are a shower of snares upon the people. 
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, let penal laws, if they have been sleepers of long, 
              or if they be grown unfit for the present time, be by wise judges 
              confined in me execution; w_as cffidum est, ut res, ita tempora 
              renon, &amp;c. In causes of life and death; judges ought (as far 
              as the law permitteth) in justice to remember mercy; and to cast 
              <br>
              a severe eye upon the example, but a merciful eye upon the person.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, for me advocates and counsel that plead: patience and 
              gravity of hearing <br>
              is an essential part of justice; and an overspeaking judge is no 
              well tuned cymbal. <br>
              It is no grace to a judge, first to find that which he might have 
              heard, in due time, <br>
              from the bar, or to show quickness of conceit in cutting off evidence 
              or counsel too short; or to prevent information, by questions though 
              pertinent The parts of a judge in hearing are four: to direct the 
              evidence; to moderate length, repetition, or <br>
              impertinency of speech; to recapitulate, select, and collate the 
              material points of <br>
              that which ham been said; and to give the rule or sentence.</p>
            <p>Whatsoever is above these, is too much; and proceedeth, either 
              of glory and willingness to speak; or of impatience to hear, or 
              of shortness of memory; or of want of a staid and equal attention. 
              It is a strange thing to see, that the boldness of advocates should 
              prevail with judges; whereas they should imitate God, in whose seat 
              they sit; who represseth the presumptuous, and giveth grace to the 
              modest But it is more strange, that judges should have noted favourites; 
              which cannot but cause multiplication of fees, and suspicion of 
              byways. </p>
            <p>There is due from the judge, to me advocate, some commendation 
              and gracing, where causes are well handled, and fair pleaded; especially 
              towards the side which obtainem not; for that upholds, in the client, 
              the reputation of his counsel, <br>
              and beats down, in him, the conceit of his cause. There is likewise 
              due to the public a civil reprehension of advocates, where there 
              appeared! cunning counsel, gross neglect, slight information, indiscreet 
              pressing, or an over-bold defence. And let not the counsel at the 
              bar chop with the judge, nor wind himself into (he handling of the 
              cause anew, after the judge hath declared his sentence: but on the 
              other side, let not the judge meet the cause half way; nor give 
              occasion to the party to say; his counsel or proofs were not heard.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, for that that concerns clerks, and ministers. The place 
              of justice is an <br>
              hallowed place; and therefore, not only the bench, but the footpace, 
              and precincts, <br>
              and purprise thereof, ought to be preserved without scandal and 
              corruption. For <br>
              certainly, graves (as the scripture sailh) will not be gathered 
              of thorns or thistles: <br>
              neither can justice yield her fruit with sweetness, amongst the 
              briars and brambles, <br>
              of catching and polling clerks and ministers. </p>
            <p>The attendance of courts is subject to four bad instruments. First, 
              certain persons that are the sowers of suits; which make the court 
              swell, and the country pine. The second sort is of those that engage 
              courts -in quarrels of jurisdiction, and are not truly anidcuriae, 
              bvXpcaiasitiaiiiae; in puffing a court up beyond her bounds, for 
              their own scraps, and advantage. </p>
            <p>The third sort is of those that may be accounted the left hands 
              of courts; persons that are full of nimble and sinister tricks and 
              shifts, whereby they pervert the plain <br>
              and direct courses of courts, and bring justice into oblique lines 
              and labyrinths. <br>
              And the fourth is, the poller and exacter of fees; which justifies 
              the common <br>
              resemblance of the courts of justice to the bush, whereunto while 
              the sheep flies <br>
              for defence in weather, he is sure to lose part of his fleece. On 
              the other side, <br>
              an ancient clerk, skilful in precedents, wary in proceeding, and 
              understanding in <br>
              the business of the court, is an excellent finger of a court; and 
              doth many times <br>
              point the way to the judge himself.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, for that which may concern the sovereign and estate. 
              Judges ought above <br>
              all to remember the conclusion of the Roman twelve tables; sahispcpuli 
              supremo, lex; and to know that laws, except they be in order to 
              that end, are but things captious, and oracles not well inspired. 
            </p>
            <p>Therefore it is an happy thing in a state, when kings and states 
              do often consult with judges; and again, when judges do often consult 
              with the king and state: the one, when there is matter of law, intervenient 
              in business of state; the other, when there is some consideration 
              of state, intervenient in matter of law. For many times, the things 
              deduced to judgement may be moon and tuum, when the reason and consequence 
              thereof may trench to point of estate: I call matter of estate, 
              not only the parts of sovereignty, but whatsoever introduceth any 
              great alteration, or dangerous precedent; or concemeth manifestly 
              any great portion of people. And let no man weakly conceive that 
              just laws, and true policy, have any antipathy: for they are like 
              the spirits, and sinews, that one moves with the other. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Let judges also remember, that Solomon\'s throne was supported 
              by lions, on both sides; let them be lions, but yet lions under 
              the throne; being circumspect, that they do not check or oppose 
              any points of sovereignty. Let not judges also be so ignorant of 
              their own right, as to think there is not left to them, as a principal 
              part of <br>
              their office, a wise use, and application of laws. For they may 
              remember, what the <br>
              apostle saith, of a greater law than theirs; nos sdmus qwa lex bona 
              est, <br>
              nwdoqwseautatwkgUime.</p>

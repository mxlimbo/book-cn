            <p align="center" class="h">51 Of Faction
            <p>Many have an opinion not wise, that for a prince to govern his 
              estate, or for a great <br>
              person to govern his proceedings, according to the respect of factions, 
              is a principal part of policy: whereas contrariwise, the chiefest 
              wisdom is, either in ordering those things which are general, and 
              wherein men of several factions do nevertheless agree; or in dealing 
              with correspondence to particular persons, one by one. </p>
            <p>But I say not, that the consideration of factions is to be neglected. 
              Mean men, in their rising, must adhere; but great men, that have 
              strength in themselves, were better to maintain themselves indifferent, 
              and neutral. </p>
            <p>Yet even in beginners, to adhere so moderately, as he be a man 
              of the one faction, which is most passable with the other, commonly 
              giveth best way. The lower and weaker faction is the firmer in conjunction: 
              and it is often seen, that a few that are stiff, do tire out a greater 
              number that are more moderate. When one of the factions is extinguished, 
              the remaining subdivided!: as the faction, between Lucullus and 
              the rest of the nobles of the Senate (which they called Optimates) 
              held out a while, against the faction ofPompey and Caesar: but when 
              the senate\'s authority was ruled down, Caesar and Pompey soon after 
              brake. </p>
            <p>The faction or party of Antonius, and Octavianus Caesar, against 
              Brutus and Cassius, held out likewise for a time: but when Brutus 
              and Cassius were overthrown, then soon after Antonius and Octavianus 
              brake and subdivided. These examples are of wars, but the same holdeth 
              in private factions. And therefore, those that are seconds in factions 
              do many times, when the faction subdivided!, prove principals: but 
              many times also, they prove ciphers and cashiered: for many a man\'s 
              strength is in opposition; and when that faileth, he groweth out 
              of use. It is commonly seen, that men once placed, take in with 
              the contrary faction to that by which they enter, thinking belike 
              that they have the first sure; and now are ready for a new purchase. 
            </p>
            <p>The traitor in faction lightly goeth away with it; for when matters 
              have stuck long in balancing, the winning of some one man casteth 
              them, and he getteth all the thanks. The even carriage between two 
              factions proceedeth not always of moderation, but of a trueness 
              to a man\'s self, with end to make use of both. Certainly in Italy, 
              they hold it a little suspect in Popes, when they have often in 
              their mouth, padre oommne: and take it to be a sign of one, that 
              meaneth to refer all to the greatness of his own house. Kings had 
              need beware how they side themselves, and make themselves as of 
              a faction or party: for leagues within the state are ever pernicious 
              to monarchies; for they raise an obligation, paramount to obligation 
              of sovereignty, and make the king tanquam wws ex nobis: as was to 
              be seen in the league of France. </p>
            <p>When factions are carried too high, and too violently, it is a 
              sign of weakness in princes; and much to the prejudice, both of 
              their authority, and business. The motions of factions, under kings, 
              ought to be like the motions (as the astronomers speak) of the inferior 
              orbs; which may have their proper motions, but yet still, are quietly 
              carried by the higher motion of primum mobile.</p>

            <p align="center" class="h"> 1 Of Truth 
            <p>What is truth; said jesting Pilate; and would not stay for an answer. 
              Certainly there be, that delight in giddiness; and count it a bondage, 
              to fix a belief, affecting free-will in thinking, as well as in 
              acting. And though the sects of philosophers of that kind be gone, 
              yet there remain certain discoursing wits, which are of the same 
              veins, though there be not so much blood in them, as was in those 
              of the ancients. </p>
            <p>But it is not only the difficulty, and labour, which men take in 
              finding out of truth; nor again, mat when it is found, it imposeth 
              upon men s thoughts; that doth bring lies in favour: but a natural, 
              though corrupt love, of the lie itself. One of the later school 
              of me Grecians, examineth the matter, and is at a stand, to think 
              what should be in it, mat men should love lies; where neither they 
              make for pleasure, as with poets; nor for advantage, as with me 
              merchant; but for the lie\'s sake. But I cannot tell: this same 
              truth, is a naked, and open day light, mat doth not show, the masques, 
              and mummeries, and triumphs of the world, half so stately, and daintily, 
              as candlelights. Truth may perhaps come to the price of a pearl, 
              that showeth best by day: but it will not rise, to me price of a 
              diamond, or carbuncle, that showeth best in varied lights. A mixture 
              of a lie doth ever add pleasure. Doth any man doubt, mat if there 
              were taken out of men s minds, vain opinions, nattering hopes, false 
              valuations, imaginations as one would, and the like; but it would 
              leave the minds, of a number of men, poor shrunken things; full 
              of melancholy, and indisposition, and unpleasing to themselves? 
              One of the fathers, in great severity, called poesy, vinum daenwnwn; 
              because it filleth the imagination, and yet it is, but with me shadow 
              of a lie. But it is not me lie, that passeth through the mind, but 
              me lie mat sinketh in, and settleth in it, that doth me hurt, such 
              as we spake of before. But howsoever these things arc thus, in men\'s 
              depraved judgements, and affections, yet truth, which only doth 
              judge itself, teacheth, that the inquiry of truth, which is the 
              love-making, or wooing of it; the knowledge of truth, which is the 
              presence of it; and the belief of truth, which is the enjoying of 
              it; is the sovereign good of human nature.</p>
            <p> The first creature of God, in the works of the days, was the light 
              of the sense;<br>
              the last, was the light of reason; and his Sabbath work, ever since, 
              is the <br>
              illumination of his spirit First he breathed light, upon the face, 
              of the matter or <br>
              chaos; then he breathed light, into the face of man; and still he 
              breatheth and <br>
              inspireth light, into the face of his chosen. The poet, that beautified 
              the sect, <br>
              that was otherwise inferior to the rest, saith yet excellently well: 
              \'It is a pleasure <br>
              to stand upon the shore, and to see ships tossed upon the sea: a 
              pleasure to stand in the window of a castle, and to see a battle, 
              and the adventures thereof, below: but no pleasure is comparable, 
              to the standing, upon the vantage ground of truth:\' (a hill not 
              to be commanded, and where the air is always clear and serene;) 
              \'and to see the errors, and wanderings, and mists, and tempests, 
              in the vale below:\' so always, that this prospect, be with pity, 
              and not with swelling, or pride. Certainly, it is heaven upon earth, 
              to have a man\'s mind move in charity, rest in providence, and turn 
              upon the poles of truth. To pass from theological, and philosophical 
              truth, to the truth of civil business; it will be acknowledged, 
              even by those mat practise it not, that clear and round dealing 
              is the honour of man\'s nature; and that mixture of falsehood, is 
              like allay in coin of gold and silver, which may make the metal 
              work the better, but it embaseth it For these winding and crooked 
              courses, are the goings of the serpent; which goeth basely upon 
              the belly, and not upon the feet There is no vice, that doth so 
              cover a man with shame, as to be found false, and perfidious. And 
              therefore Mountaigny saith prettily, when he enquired the reason, 
              why the word of the lie should be such a disgrace, and such an odious 
              charge? saith he, \'If it be well weighed, to <br>
              lay that a man lieth, is as much to say, as mat he is brave towards 
              God, and a coward towards men.\' For a lie faces God, and shrinks 
              from man. Surely the wickedness of falsehoods, and breach of faith, 
              cannot possibly be so highly expressed, as in mat it shall be the 
              last peal, to call the judgements of God upon the generations of 
              men, it being foretold, that when Christ cometh. He shall not find 
              faith upon the earth.</p>

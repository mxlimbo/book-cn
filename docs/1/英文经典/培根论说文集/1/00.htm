            <p>EXCELLENT LORD - Solomon says; a good name is as a precious ointment; 
              and I assure my self, such will your Grace\'s name be, with posterity. 
              For your fortune, and merit both, have been eminent And you have 
              planted things, that are like to last I do now publish my essays; 
              which, of all my other works, have been most current: for that, 
              as it seems, they come home, to men\'s business, and bosoms. I have 
              enlarged them, both in number, and weight; so that they are indeed 
              a new work. I thought it therefore agreeable, to my affection, and 
              obligation to your Grace, to prefix your name before them, both 
              in English, and in Latin. For I do conceive, (hat the Latin volume 
              of them (being in the universal language) may last, as long as books 
              last My Instauation, I dedicated to the King: my History of Henry 
              the Seventh (which I have now also translated into Latin) and my 
              portions of Natural History, to the Prince: and these I dedicate 
              to your Grace;being of the best fruits, that by the good increase, 
              which God gives to my pen and labours, I could yield. God lead your 
              Grace by the hand. Your <br>
              Grace\'s most obliged and faithful servantã€‚</p>

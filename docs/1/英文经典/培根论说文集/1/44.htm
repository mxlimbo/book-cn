            <p>Deformed persons are commonly even with nature: for as nature hath 
              done ill by them, so do they by nature: being for the most part, 
              (as die scripture saith) void of natural affection; and so they 
              have their revenge of nature. Certainly there is a consent between 
              the body and the mind; and where nature erreth in the one, she ventureth 
              in the other. Ubipecattmiw.periditaturinaltem. But because there 
              is in man an election touching the frame of his mind, and a necessity 
              in the frame of his body, the stars of natural inclination are sometimes 
              obscured by the sun of discipline, and virtue. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, it is good to consider of deformity, not as a sign, 
              which is more deceivable; but as a cause, which seldom failed of 
              the effect Whosoever hath anything fixed in his person, thafdoth 
              induce contempt, hath also a perpetual spur in himself, to rescue 
              and deliver himself from scorn: therefore all deformed persons are 
              extreme bold. </p>
            <p>First, as in their own defence, as being exposed to scorn; but 
              in process of time, by a general habit Also it stirreth in (hem 
              industry, and especially of this kind, to watch and observe the 
              weakness of others, that they may have somewhat to repay. </p>
            <p>Again, in their superiors, it quencheth jealousy towards them, 
              as persons that they mink they may at pleasure despise: and it layeth 
              their competitors and emulators asleep; as never believing, they 
              should be in possibility of advancement till they see them in possession. 
              So that, upon the matter, in a great wit, deformity is an advantage 
              to rising. Kings in ancient times (and at this present in some countries) 
              were wont to put great trust in eunuchs; because they that are envious 
              towards all, are more obnoxious and officious towards one. But yet 
              their trust towards them hath rather been as to good spials, and 
              good whisperers; man good magistrates, and officers. </p>
            <p>And much like is the reason of deformed persons. Still the ground 
              is, they will, if they be of spirit, seek to free themselves from 
              scorn; which must be, either by virtue, or malice: and therefore, 
              let it not be marvelled, if sometimes they prove excellent persons; 
              as was Agesilaus, Zanger the son of Solyman, Aesop, Gasca President 
              of Peru; and Socrates may go likewise amongst them; with others.</p>

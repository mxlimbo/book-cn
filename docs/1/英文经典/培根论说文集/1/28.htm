            <p>Riches are for spending; and spending for honour and good actions. 
              Therefore extraordinary expense must be limited by the worth of 
              the occasion: for voluntary undoing may be as well for a man\'s 
              country as for the kingdom of heaven. But ordinary expense ought 
              to be limited by a man\'s estate; and governed with such regard, 
              as it <br>
              be within his compass; and not subject to deceit and abuse of servants; 
              and ordered to the best show, that the bills may be less than the 
              estimation abroad. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly, if a man will keep but of even hand, his ordinary expenses 
              ought to be but to the half of his receipts; and if he think to 
              wax rich, but to the third part. </p>
            <p>It is no baseness, for the greatest, to descend and look into their 
              own estate. Some forbear it, not upon negligence alone, but doubting 
              to bring themselves into melancholy, in respect they shall find 
              it broken. But wounds cannot be cured without searching. He that 
              cannot look into his own estate at all, had need both choose well, 
              those whom he employeth, and change them often: for new are more 
              timorous, and less subtle. He that can look into his estate but 
              seldom, it behoveth him to turn all to certainties. A man had need, 
              if he be plentiful in some kind of expense, to be as saving again, 
              in some other. As if he be plentiful in diet, to be saving in apparel: 
              if he be plentiful in the hall, to be saving in the stable: and 
              the like. For he that is plentiful in expenses of all kinds, will 
              hardly be preserved from decay. In clearing <br>
              of a man\'s estate, he may as well hurt himself in being too sudden, 
              as in letting it run on too long. For hasty selling is commonly 
              as disadvantageable as interest <br>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, he that clears at once, will relapse; for finding himself 
              out of straits, he will revert to his customs: but he that cleareth 
              by degrees, induceth a habit of frugality, and gained as well upon 
              his mind, as upon his estate. </p>
            <p>Certainly, who hath a state to repair, may not despise small things: 
              and commonly, it is less dishonourable to abridge petty charges 
              than to stoop to petty gettings. A man ought warily to begin charges, 
              which once begun will continue: but in matters that return not, 
              he may be more magnificent.</p>

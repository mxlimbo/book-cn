            <p>The greatest trust between man and man is the trust of giving counsel. 
              For in other confidences, men commit the parts of life; their lands, 
              their goods, their children, their credit, some particular affair, 
              but to such as they make their counsellors they commit the whole: 
              by how much the more, they are obliged to all faith and integrity. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>The wisest princes need not think it any diminution to their greatness, 
              or derogation to their sufficiency, to rely upon counsel. God himself 
              is not without: but hath made it one of the great names of his blessed 
              son; the counsellor. Solomon hath pronounced, that in counsel is 
              stability. Things will have their first or second agitation; if 
              they be not tossed upon the arguments of counsel they will be tossed 
              upon the waves of fortune; and be full of inconstancy, doing, and 
              undoing, like the reeling of a drunken man. Solomon\'s son found 
              the force of counsel as his father saw the necessity of it </p>
            <p>For the beloved kingdom of God was first rent and broken by ill 
              counsel; upon <br>
              which counsel there are set, for our instruction, the two marks, 
              whereby bad counsel is for ever best discerned: that it was young 
              counsel for the persons;<br>
              and violent counsel for the matter.<br>
            </p>
            <p>The ancient times do set forth in figure both the incorporation 
              and inseparable <br>
              conjunction of counsel with kings; and the wise and politic use 
              of counsel by kings: the one, in that they say, Jupiter did many 
              Metis, which signifieth counsel: whereby they intend, that sovereignty 
              is married to counsel: the other, in that which followeth, which 
              was thus: they say after Jupiter was married to Metis, she conceived 
              by him, and was with child; but Jupiter suffered her not to stay 
              till she brought forth, but ate her up; whereby he became himself 
              with child, and was delivered of Pallas armed, out of his head. 
              Which monstrous fable contained! a secret of empire; how kings are 
              to make use of their counsel of state. </p>
            <p>That first, they ought to refer matters unto them, which is the 
              first begetting or impregnation; but when they are elaborate, moulded, 
              and shaped, in the womb of their counsel, and grow ripe, and ready 
              to be brought forth; that then, they suffer not their counsel to 
              go through with the resolution, and direction, as if it depended 
              on them; but take the matter back into their own hands, and make 
              it appear to the world, that the decrees, and final directions (which, 
              because they come forth with prudence, and power, are resembled 
              to Pallas armed) proceeded from themselves: and not only from their 
              authority, but <br>
              (the more to add reputation to themselves) from their head, and 
              device.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now speak of the inconveniences of counsel, and of the remedies. 
              The <br>
              inconveniences, that have been noted in calling and using counsel, 
              are three. </p>
            <p>First, the revealing of affairs, whereby they become less secret 
              Secondly, the weakening of the authority of princes, as if they 
              were less of themselves. Thirdly, the danger of being unfaithfully 
              counselled, and more for me good of them that counsel, than of him 
              that is counselled. For which inconveniences, the doctrine of Italy, 
              and practice of France, in some kings\' times, haul introduced cabinet 
              counsels; a remedy worse then the disease.<br>
            </p>
            <p>As to secrecy; princes are not bound to communicate all matters 
              with all counsellors; but may extract and select Neither is it necessary, 
              that he that consulteth what he should do, should declare what he 
              will do. But let princes beware, that the unsecreting of their affairs 
              comes not from themselves. And as for cabinet counsels, it may be 
              their motto; plows rimarum sum: one futile person, that maketh it 
              his glory to tell, will do more hurt than many, that know it their 
              duty to conceal. It is true, there be some affairs, which require 
              extreme secrecy, which will hardly go beyond one or two persons, 
              besides the king: neither are those counsels unprosperous: for besides 
              the secrecy, they commonly go on constantly in one spirit of direction, 
              without distraction. </p>
            <p>But then it must be a prudent king, such as is able to grind with 
              a <br>
              hand-mill; and those inward counsellors had need also be wise men, 
              and especially true and trusty to the king\'s ends; as it was with 
              King Henry the Seventh of England, who in his greatest business 
              imparted himself to none, except it were to Morton, and Fox.<br>
            </p>
            <p>For weakening of authority; the fable showeth the remedy. Nay, 
              the majesty of kings is rather exalted, than diminished, when they 
              are in the chair of counsel: neither was there ever prince bereaved 
              of his dependencies by his counsel; except where there hath been, 
              either an overgreatness in one counsellor, or an overstrict combination 
              in divers; which are things soon found, and holpen.<br>
            </p>
            <p>For the last inconvenience, that men will counsel with an eye to 
              themselves; certainly, non inveniet fidem super terrain, is meant 
              of the nature of times, and not of all particular persons; there 
              be, that are in nature faithful, and sincere, and plain, and direct; 
              not crafty, and involved: let princes, above all, draw to themselves 
              such natures. Besides, counsellors are not commonly so united, but 
              that one counsellor keepeth sentinel over another, so that if any 
              do counsel out of faction, or private ends, it commonly comes to 
              the king\'s ear. But the best remedy is, if princes know their counsellors, 
              as well as their counsellors know them: principis est virtus maxima 
              nosse suos.<br>
            </p>
            <p>And on the other side, counsellors should not be too speculative 
              into their <br>
              sovereign\'s person. The true composition of a counsellor, is rather 
              to be skilful <br>
              in their master\'s business, than in his nature; for then he is 
              like to advise him, <br>
              and not to feed his humour. It is of singular use to princes, if 
              they take the opinions of their counsel both separately and together. 
            </p>
            <p>For private opinion is more free; but opinion before others is 
              more reverend. In private, men are more bold in their own humours; 
              and in consort, men are more obnoxious to others\' humours; therefore 
              it is good to take both: and of the inferior sort, rather in private, 
              to preserve freedom; of the greater, rather in consort, to preserve 
              respect It is in vain for princes to take counsel concerning matters, 
              if they take no counsel likewise concerning persons: for all matters, 
              are as dead images; and me life of the execution of affairs resteth 
              in the good choice of persons. Neither is it enough to consult concerning 
              persons, secundurn genera, as in an idea, or mathematical description, 
              what the kind and <br>
              character of the person should be; for the greatest errors are committed, 
              and the <br>
              most judgement is shown, in the choice of individuals. It was truly 
              said;<br>
              optimi consiliarii maud; books will speak plain, when counsellors 
              blanch: </p>
            <p>Therefore it is good to be conversant in them; specially the books 
              of such as themselves have been actors upon me stage.<br>
            </p>
            <p>The counsels, at this day, in most places are but familiar meetings;<br>
              where matters are rather talked on, than debated. And they run too 
              swift to the order or act of counsel. It were better, that in causes 
              of weight, the matter were propounded one day, and not spoken to, 
              till the next day; in nocte consilium. So was it done, in die commission 
              of union between England and Scotland; which was a grave and orderly 
              assembly. I commend set days for petitions: for both it gives the 
              suitors more certainty for their attendance; and it frees the meetings 
              for matters of estate, that they may hoc agere. In choice of committees, 
              for ripening business for the counsel, it is better to choose indifferent 
              persons, than to make an indifference, by putting in those that 
              are strong on both sides. I commend also standing commissions; as 
              for trade; for treasure; for war; for suits; for some provinces: 
              for where there be divers particular counsels, and but one counsel 
              of estate (as it is in Spain), they are in effect no more than standing 
              commissions; save that they have greater authority. Let such as 
              are to inform counsels, out of their particular professions (as 
              lawyers, seamen, mintmen, and the like), be first heard before committees; 
              and then, as occasion serves, before the counsel. </p>
            <p>And let them not come in multitudes, or in a tribunitious manner; 
              for that is to clamour counsels, not to inform them. A long table, 
              and a square table, or seats about the walls, seem things of form, 
              but are things of substance; for at a long table, a few at the upper 
              end, in effect, sway all the business; but in the other form, there 
              is more use of the counsellors\' opinions, that sit lower. <br>
            </p>
            <p>A king, when he presides in counsel, let him beware how he opens 
              his own inclination too much, in that which he propounded!: for 
              else counsellors will but take the wind of him; and instead of giving 
              free counsel, sing him a song of placebo.</p>

            <p align="center" class="h">46 Of Gardens 
            <p>God Almighty first planted a garden. And indeed, it is the purest 
              of human pleasure. It is the greatest refreshment to the spirits 
              of man;<br>
              without which buildings and palaces are but gross handy-works: and 
              a man shall ever see, that when ages grow to civility and elegance, 
              men come to build stately, sooner than to garden finely: as if gardening 
              were the greater perfection. I do hold it, in the royal ordering 
              of gardens, there ought to be gardens, for all the months in <br>
              me year: in which, severally, things of beauty may be then in season. 
              For December, and January, and the latter part of November, you 
              must take such things as are green all winter: holly; ivy; bays; 
              juniper, cypress trees; yew; pineapple trees; fir trees; rosemary; 
              lavender, periwinkle, the white, the purple, and the blue; germander, 
              flags; orange trees; lemon trees; and myrtles, if they be stoved; 
              and sweet marjoram warm set. </p>
            <p>There followeth, for the latter part of January, and February, 
              the mezereon tree, <br>
              which then blossoms; avcusvemus, both the yellow, and the grey; 
              primroses; anemones; the early tulip; hyadnthus onentalis; dmvsris;ftili!iana. 
              For March, there come violets, specially the single blue, which 
              are the earliest; the yellow daffodil;<br>
              the daisy; the almond tree in blossom; the peach tree in blossom; 
              the cornelian tree <br>
              in blossom; sweet briar. </p>
            <p>In April follow, the double white violet; the wallflower, the stock 
              gillyflower, the cowslip, fleur-de-lis, and lilies of [all] natures; 
              rosemary flowers; the tulip; the double peony; the pale daffodil; 
              the French honeysuckle; the cherry tree in blossom; the damson and 
              plum trees in blossom; the white thorn in leaf; the lilac tree. 
              In May and June, come pinks of all sorts, specially the blush pink; 
              roses of all kinds, except the musk, which comes later, honeysuckles; 
              strawberries; bugloss; columbine; the French marigold; ftos qfiiainus; 
              cheny tree in fruit, rihs., figs in fruit;<br>
              raspberries; vine flowers; lavender in flowers; the sweet satyrian, 
              with the white <br>
              flower, herba nvsoana; iilaan comaSwm; the apple tree in blossom. 
              In July, come <br>
              gillyflowers of all varieties; musk roses; the lime tree in blossom; 
              early pears, <br>
              and plums in fruit; ginnitings; quadlins. In August, come plums 
              of all sorts in fruit; pears; apricots; berberries; filberts; musk 
              melons; monks-hoods, of all colours. In September, come grapes; 
              apples; poppies of all colours; peaches; melo-cotones; nectarines; 
              cornelians; wardens; quinces. In October, and the beginning of November, 
              come services; medlars; bullises; roses cut or removed to come late; 
              holly oaks; and such like. </p>
            <p>These particulars are for the climate of London; but my meaning 
              is perceived, that you may have verperpeCuwn, as the place affords.<br>
            </p>
            <p>And because me breath of flowers is far sweeter in the air (where 
              it comes and goes, like the warbling of music) than in the hand, 
              therefore nothing is more fit for that delight, than to know, what 
              be the flowers, and plants that do best perfume the air. </p>
            <p>Roses, damask and red, are fast flowers of their smells; so that 
              you may walk by a <br>
              whole row of them, and find nothing of their sweetness; yea though 
              it be in a morning\'s dew. Bays likewise yield no smell, as they 
              grow. Rosemary little; nor sweet marjoram. <br>
            </p>
            <p>That which above all others yields the sweetest smell in the air, 
              is the violet; <br>
              specially the white double violet, which comes twice a year, about 
              the middle of April, and about Bartholomew-tide. Next to that is, 
              the musk rose. Then the strawberry leaves dying, which [yield] a 
              most excellent cordial smell. Then the flower of me vines; it is 
              a little dust, like the dust of a bent, which grows upon the cluster, 
              in the first coming forth. Then sweet briar. Then wallflowers, which 
              are very delightful, to be set under a parlour, or lower chamber 
              window. Then pinks, [and gillyflowers,] specially the matted pink, 
              and clove gillyflower. Then the flowers of the lime tree. </p>
            <p>Then the honeysuckles, so they be somewhat a far off. Of bean flowers 
              I speak not, because they are field flowers. But those which perfume 
              the air most delightfully, not passed by as me rest, but being trodden 
              upon and crushed, are three: that is bumet, wild thyme, and water 
              mints. Therefore, you are to set whole alleys of them, to have the 
              pleasure, when you walk or tread.<br>
            </p>
            <p>For gardens, (speaking of those, which are indeed princelike, as 
              we have done of <br>
              buildings) the contents ought not well to be under thirty acres 
              of ground; and to <br>
              be divided into three parts: a green in the entrance; a heath or 
              desert in die going <br>
              forth; and the [main] garden in the midst; besides alleys, on both 
              sides. And I like <br>
              well, that four acres of ground be assigned to the green; six to 
              the heath; four and <br>
              four to either side; and twelve to the main garden. The green hath 
              two pleasures, <br>
              the one, because nothing is more pleasant to the eye, than green 
              grass kept finely <br>
              shorn; the other, because it will give you a fair alley in the midst, 
              by which you <br>
              may go in front upon a stately hedge, which is to enclose the garden. 
            </p>
            <p>But, because the alley will be long, and in great heat of the year, 
              or day, you ought not to buy the shade, in the garden, by going 
              in the sun through the green, therefore you are, of either side 
              the green, to plant a covert alley, upon carpenter\'s work, about 
              twelve foot in height, by which you may go in shade into the garden. 
              As for the making of knots, or figures, with divers coloured earths, 
              mat they may lie under the windows of the house, on that side which 
              the garden stands, they be but toys: you may see as good sights, 
              many times, in tarts. T</p>
            <p>The garden is best to be square; encompassed, on all the four sides, 
              with a stately arched hedge. The arches to be upon pillars, of carpenter\'s 
              work, of some ten foot high, and six foot broad: and the spaces 
              between, of the same dimension, with the breadth of the arch. Over 
              the arches, let there be an entire hedge, of some four foot high, 
              framed also upon carpenter\'s work: and upon the upper hedge, over 
              every arch, a little turret, with a belly, enough to receive a cage 
              of birds: and over every space, between the arches, some other lime 
              figure, with broad plates of round coloured glass, gilt, for the 
              sun to play upon. But mis hedge I intend to be raised upon a bank, 
              not steep, but gently slope, of some six foot, set all with flowers. 
            </p>
            <p>Also I understand, that this square of the garden, should not be 
              the whole breadth of the ground, but to leave, on either side, ground 
              enough for diversity of side alleys: unto which, the two covert 
              alleys of the green may deliver you. But there must be no alleys 
              with hedges, at either end, of this great enclosure: not at the 
              hither end, for letting your prospect upon mis fair hedge from the 
              green; nor at the further end, for letting your prospect from the 
              hedge, through the arches, upon the heath.<br>
            </p>
            <p>For the ordering of the ground, within the great hedge, I leave 
              it to variety of device; advising nevertheless, that whatsoever 
              form you cast it into, first it be not too busy, or full of work. 
              Wherein I, for my part, do not like images cut out in juniper, or 
              other garden stuff: they be for children. Little low hedges, round, 
              like welts, with some pretty pyramids, I like well: and in some 
              places, fair columns upon frames of carpenter\'s work. I would also 
              have the alleys spacious and fair. </p>
            <p>You may have closer alleys upon the side grounds but none in the 
              main garden. I wish also, in the very middle, a fair mount, with 
              three ascents, and alleys, enough for four to walk abreast; which 
              I would have to be perfect circles, without any bulwarks, or embossment; 
              and the whole mount, to be thirty foot high; and some fine banqueting 
              house, with some chimneys neatly cast, and without too much glass.<br>
            </p>
            <p>For fountains, they are a great beauty, and refreshment; But pools 
              mar all, and make the garden unwholesome, and full of flies, and 
              frogs. Fountains I intend to be of two natures: the one, that sprinkleth 
              or spouteth water, the other a fair receipt <br>
              of water, of some thirty or forty foot square, but without fish, 
              or slime, or mud. <br>
              For the first, the ornaments of images gilt, or of marble, which 
              are in use, do well: <br>
              but the main matter is so to convey the water, as it never stay, 
              either in the bowls, <br>
              or in the cistern; that the water be never by rest discoloured, 
              green, or red, or <br>
              the like: or gather any mossiness or putrefaction. Besides that, 
              it is to be cleansed <br>
              every day by the hand. Also some steps up to it, and some fine pavement 
              about it, <br>
              doth well. </p>
            <p>As for the other kind of fountain, which we may call a bathing 
              pool, it may admit much curiosity, and beauty; wherewith we will 
              not trouble ourselves: as, <br>
              that the bottom be finely paved, and with images: the sides likewise; 
              and withal <br>
              embellished with coloured glass, and such things of lustre; encompassed 
              also, with <br>
              fine rails of low statues. But the main point is the same, which 
              we mentioned, in <br>
              the former kind of fountain; which is, that the water be in perpetual 
              motion, fed <br>
              by a water higher than the pool and delivered into it by fair spouts, 
              and then <br>
              discharged away under ground, by some equality of bores, that it 
              stay little. And <br>
              for fine devices, of arching water without spilling, and making 
              it rise in several <br>
              forms (of feathers, drinking glasses, canopies, and the like), they 
              be pretty things <br>
              to look on, but nothing to health and sweetness.</p>
            <p> For the heath, which was the third part of our plot, I wish it 
              to be framed, as much <br>
              as may be, to a natural wildness. Trees I would have none in it; 
              but some thickets, <br>
              made only of sweet-briar, and honeysuckle, and some wild vine amongst; 
              and the ground set with violets, strawberries, and primroses. For 
              these are sweet, and prosper in the shade. </p>
            <p>And these to be in the heath, here and there, not in any order. 
              I like <br>
              also little heaps, in the nature of mole-hills (such as are in wild 
              heaths), to be <br>
              set, some with wild thyme; some with pinks; some with germander, 
              that gives a good flower to the eye; some with periwinkles; some 
              with violets; some with strawberries; some with cowslips; some with 
              daisies; some with red roses; some with lilium convallium; some 
              with sweet-williams red; some with bears-foot; and the like low 
              flowers, being withal sweet, and sightly. Part of which heaps, to 
              be with standards of little bushes, pricked upon their top, and 
              part without. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The standards to be roses; jumper, holly; berberries (but here 
              and there, because of the smell of their blossom); red currants; 
              gooseberries; rosemary; bays; sweet-briar; and such like. But these 
              standards to be kept with cutting, that they grow not out of course.<br>
            </p>
            <p>For the side grounds, you are to fill them with variety of alleys, 
              private, to give <br>
              a full shade; some of them, wheresoever the sun be. You are to frame 
              some of them likewise for shelter, that when the wind blows sharp, 
              you may walk, as in a gallery. <br>
            </p>
            <p>And those alleys must be likewise hedged, at both ends, to keep 
              out the wind; and <br>
              these closer alleys, must be ever finely gravelled, and no grass, 
              because of going <br>
              wet In many of these alleys likewise, you are to set fruit trees 
              of all sorts; as <br>
              well upon the walls, as in ranges. And this would be generally observed, 
              that the <br>
              borders, wherein you plant your fruit trees, be fair and large, 
              and low, and not steep; and set with fine flowers, but thin and 
              sparingly, lest they deceive trees. At the end of both the side 
              grounds, I would have a mount of some pretty height, leaving the 
              wall of the enclosure, breast high, to look abroad into the fields.<br>
            </p>
            <p>For the main garden, I do not deny, but there should be some fair 
              alleys, ranged on <br>
              both sides, with fruit trees; and some pretty tufts of fruit trees, 
              and arbours with <br>
              seats, set in some decent order; but these to be by no means set 
              too thick; but to <br>
              leave the main garden, so as it be not close, but the air open and 
              free. For as for <br>
              shade, I would have you rest upon the alleys of the side grounds, 
              there to walk, if <br>
              you be disposed, in the heat of the year, or day; but to make account, 
              that the main <br>
              garden is for the more temperate parts of the year; and in the heat 
              of summer, for <br>
              the morning, and the evening, or over-cast days.<br>
            </p>
            <p>For aviaries, I like them not, except they be of that largeness, 
              as they may be turfed, and have living plants, and bushes, set in 
              them; that the birds may have more scope, and natural nesting, and 
              that no foulness appear in the floor of the aviary. So I have made 
              a platform of a princely garden, partly by precept, partly by drawing, 
              not a model, but some general lines of it; and in this I have spared 
              for no cost. But it is nothing for great princes, that for the most 
              part, taking advice with workmen, with no less cost, set their things 
              together, and sometimes add statues, and such things, for state, 
              and magnificence, but nothing to the true pleasure of a garden.</p>

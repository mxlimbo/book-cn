            <p align="center" class="h">13 Of Goodness, &amp; Goodness of Nature
            <p>I take goodness in this sense, the affecting of the weal of men, 
              which is that the <br>
              Grecians call philanthropia; and the word humanity (as it is used) 
              is a little too <br>
              light, to express it Goodness I call the habit, and goodness of 
              nature the inclination. </p>
            <p>This of all virtues, and dignities of the mind, is the greatest; 
              being the character <br>
              of the deity: and without it, man is a busy, mischievous, wretched 
              thing; no better than a kind of vermin. Goodness answers to the 
              theological virtue charity, and admits no excess, but error. The 
              desire of power in excess, caused the angels to fall; the desire 
              of knowledge in excess, caused man to fall; but in charity, there 
              is no excess; neither can angel, or man, come in danger by it. The 
              inclination to goodness is imprinted deeply in the nature of man: 
              in so much, that if it issue not towards men, it will take unto 
              other living creatures: as it is seen in the Turks, a cruel people, 
              who nevertheless are kind to beasts, and give alms to dogs, and 
              birds: in so much, as Busbechius reporteth; a Christian boy in Constantinople 
              had like to have been stoned, for gagging, in a waggishness, a long 
              billed fowl. Errors, indeed, in this virtue of goodness, or charity, 
              may be committed. The Italians have an ungracious proverb; tanto 
              buon che val niente: so good, that he is good for nothing. And one 
              of the doctors of Italy, Nicholas Machiavelli, had the confidence 
              to put in writing, almost in plain terms: That the Christian faith 
              had given up good men, in prey, to those that are tyrannical, and 
              unjust Which he spoke, because indeed there was never law, or sect, 
              or opinion, did so much magnify goodness, as the Christian religion 
              doth. </p>
            <p>Therefore to avoid the scandal, and the danger both, it is good 
              to take knowledge of the errors of an habit so excellent. Seek the 
              good of other men, but be not in bondage to their faces, or fancies; 
              for that is but facility, or softness; which taketh an honest mind 
              prisoner. Neither give thou Aesop\'s cock a gem, who would be better 
              pleased, and happier, if he had had a barley corn. </p>
            <p>The example of God teacheth the lesson truly: he sendeth his rain, 
              and maketh his sun to shine, upon the just, and unjust; but he doth 
              not rain wealth, nor shine honour, and virtues, upon men equally. 
              Common benefits are to be communicate with all; but peculiar benefits, 
              with choice. And beware, how in making the portraiture, thou breakest 
              the pattern: for divinity maketh the love of ourselves the pattern; 
              the love of our neighbours but the portraiture. Sell all thou hast, 
              and give it to me poor, and follow me: but sell not all thou hast, 
              except thou come, and follow me; that is, except thou have a vocation, 
              wherein thou may do as much good with little means as with great: 
              for otherwise, in <br>
              feeding the streams, thou driest the fountain. Neither is there 
              only a habit of <br>
              goodness, directed by right reason; but mere is, in some men, even 
              in nature, a <br>
              disposition towards it: as on the other side, there is a natural 
              malignity. </p>
            <p>For there be, that in their nature do not affect the good of others. 
              The lighter sort of malignity, turneth but to a crossness, or forwardness, 
              or aptness to oppose, or difficultness, or the like; but the deeper 
              sort, to envy, and mere mischief. Such men, in other men\'s calamities, 
              are, as it were, in season, and are ever on the loading part; not 
              so good as the dogs that licked Lazarus\'s sores; but like flies, 
              that are still buzzing upon anything that is raw; misanthropi, that 
              make it their practice, to bring men to the bough; and yet have 
              never a tree for the purpose, in their gardens, as Timon had. </p>
            <p>Such dispositions are the very errors of human nature: and yet 
              they are the fittest <br>
              timber, to make great politics of: like to knee timber, that is 
              good for ships that <br>
              are ordained to be tossed; but not for building houses, that shall 
              stand firm. The <br>
              parts and signs of goodness are many. If a man be gracious, and 
              courteous to strangers, it shows he is a citizen of the world; and 
              that his heart is no island, cut off from other lands; but a continent, 
              that joins to them. If he be compassionate towards the afflictions 
              of others, it shows mat his heart is like the noble tree, that is 
              wounded itself, when it gives the balm. If he easily pardons and 
              remits offences, it shows that his mind is planted above injuries; 
              so that he cannot be shot If he be thankful for small benefits, 
              it shows that he weighs men\'s minds, and not their trash. But above 
              all, if he have St Paul\'s perfection, that he would wish to be 
              an anathema from Christ, for the salvation of his brethren, it shows 
              much of a divine nature, and a kind of conformity with Christ himself.</p>

            <p>Many ill matters and projects are undertaken; and private suits 
              do putrefy the public <br>
              good. Many good matters are undertaken with bad minds; I mean not 
              only corrupt minds, but crafty minds, that intend not performance. 
              Some embrace suits, which never mean to deal effectually in them; 
              but if they see there may be life in the matter, by some other mean, 
              they will be content to win a thank, or take a second reward, or 
              at least to make use, in the mean time, of the suitor\'s hopes. 
            </p>
            <p>Some take hold of suits only for an occasion, to cross some other, 
              or to make an information, whereof they could not otherwise have 
              apt pretext; without care what become of the suit, when that turn 
              is served: or generally, to make other men\'s business a kind of 
              entertainment, to bring in their own. Nay, some undertake suits 
              with a full purpose, to let them fall; to the end, to gratify the 
              adverse party, or competitor. </p>
            <p>Surely, there is, in some sort, a right in every suit: either a 
              right of equity, if it be a suit of controversy; or a right of desert, 
              if it be a suit of petition. If affection lead a man to favour the 
              wrong side in justice, let him rather use his countenance to compound 
              the matter, than to carry it If affection lead a man to favour the 
              less worthy in desert, let him do it without depraving or disabling 
              the better deserver. In suits, which a man doth not well understand, 
              it is good to refer them to some friend of trust and judgement, 
              that may report whethe he may deal in them with honour: but let 
              him choose well his referendaries, for else he may be led by the 
              nose. </p>
            <p>Suitors are so distasted with delays, and abuses, that plain dealing, 
              in denying to deal in suits at first, and reporting the success 
              barely, and in challenging no more thanks than one hath deserved, 
              is grown not only honourable, but also gracious. In suits of favour, 
              the first coming ought to take little place: so far forth consideration 
              may be had of his trust, that if intelligence of the matter could 
              not otherwise have been had, but by him, advantage be not taken 
              of the note, but the party left to his other means; and, in some 
              sort, recompensed for his discovery. To be ignorant of the value 
              of a suit, is simplicity; as well as to be ignorant of the right 
              thereof, is want of conscience. </p>
            <p>Secrecy in suits is a great mean of obtaining; for voicing them, 
              to be in forwardness, may discourage some kind of suitors; but doth 
              quicken and awake others. But timing of the suit is the principal. 
              Timing, I say, not only in respect of the person that should grant 
              it, but in respect of those which are like to cross it Let a man, 
              in the choice of his mean, rather choose the fittest mean, man the 
              greatest mean: and rather them, that deal in certain things, than 
              those that are general. The reparation of a denial is sometimes 
              equal to the first grant; if a man show himself neither dejected, 
              nor discontented. Imqwsmpetas, utaeqwmferas; is a good rule, where 
              a man haul strength of favour: but otherwise, a man were better 
              rise in his suit; for he that would have ventured at first to have 
              lost the suitor, will not in the conclusion lose both the suitor, 
              and his own former favour. Nothing is thought so basic a request, 
              to a great person, as his letter; and yet, if it be not in a good 
              cause, it is so much out of his reputation. There are no worse instruments, 
              than these general contrivers of suits; for they are but a kind 
              of poison and infection to public proceedings.</p>

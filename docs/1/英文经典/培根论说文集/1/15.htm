            <p>Shepherds of people had need know the calendars of tempests in 
              state; which are commonly greatest, when things grow to equality; 
              as natural tempests are greatest about the equinoxes. And as there 
              are certain hollow blasts of wind, and secret swellings of seas, 
              before a tempest, so are there in states: ille etiam caecos instare 
              tumultus sa epe monet,fraudesqu et operta tumescere bella. Libels, 
              and licentious discourses against the state, when they are frequent 
              and open; and in like sort, false news, often running up and down, 
              to the disadvantage of the <br>
              state, and hastily embraced; are amongst the signs of troubles. 
              Virgil giving the <br>
              pedigree of fame, saith, she was sister to the giants.</p>
            <p> Illam terra parens ira irritata deorun, extrenmam(ut perhibent)CoeoEnceladoquesororem 
              progenuit. As if fame were the relics of seditions past; but they 
              are no less, indeed, the preludes of seditions to come. Howsoever, 
              he noteth it right, that seditious tumults and seditious fame differ 
              no more, but as brother and sister, masculine and feminine; especially, 
              if it come to that, that the best actions of a state, and the most 
              plausible, and which ought to give greatest contentment, are taken 
              in ill sense, and traduced: for that shows the envy great, as Tacitus 
              saith; conflata magnia invidia, seu bene, seu male, gesta premunt. 
              Neither doth it follow, that because these fames are a sign of troubles, 
              that the suppressing of them with too much severity, should be a 
              remedy <br>
              of troubles. </p>
            <p>For the despising of them, many times, checks them best; and the 
              going <br>
              about to stop them, doth but make a wonder long-lived. Also that 
              kind of obedience, which Tacitus speaketh of, is to be held suspected; 
              erant in cfficio, sed tamen qvi mallent mandata imperantium interpretari, 
              quam exseqid; disputing, excusing, calling upon mandates and directions, 
              is a kind of shaking off the yoke, and assay of disobedience: especially, 
              if in those disputings they which are for the direction, speak fearfully, 
              and tenderly; and those that are against it, audaciously. </p>
            <p>Also, as Machiavelli noteth well; when princes, that ought to be 
              common parents, make themselves as a party, and lean to a side, 
              it is as a boat that is overthrown by uneven weight on the one side; 
              as was well seen, in the time of Henry the Third of France: for 
              first, himself entered league for the extirpation of the Protestants; 
              and presently after, the same league was turned upon himself. For 
              when the authority of princes is made but an accessory to a cause; 
              and that there be other bands, that tie faster than the band of 
              sovereignty, kings begin to be put almost out of possession.</p>
            <p> Also, when discords and quarrels and factions are carried openly, 
              and audaciously; it is a sign, the reverence of government is lost 
              For the motions of the greatest persons in a government, ought to 
              be, as the motions of the planets, under primum mobile; according 
              to the old opinion: which is, that every of them is carried swiftly, 
              by the highest motion, and softly in their own motion. </p>
            <p>And therefore, when great ones, in their own particular motion, 
              move violently, and. as Tacitus expressed! it well, liberals quam 
              ut imperantium meminissent; it is a sign, the orbs are out of frame</p>
            <p> For reverence is that, wherewith princes are girt from God; who 
              threatneth the <br>
              dissolving thereof; solvam cingula regum.</p>
            <p> So when any of the four pillars of government are mainly shaken, 
              or weakened (which are religion, justice, counsel, and treasure), 
              men had need to pray for fair weather. But let us pass from this 
              part of predictions (concerning which, nevertheless, more light 
              may be taken, from that which followeth); and let us speak first 
              of the materials of seditions; then of the motives of them; and 
              thirdly of the remedies. </p>
            <p>Concerning the materials of seditions. It is a thing well to be 
              considered: for the <br>
              surest way to prevent seditions (if the times do bear it), is to 
              take away the matter of them. For if there be fuel prepared, it 
              is hard to tell, whence the spark shall come, that shall set it 
              on fire. The matter of seditions is of two kinds; much poverty, 
              and much discontentment It is certain, so many overthrown estates, 
              so many votes for troubles. Lucan noteth well the state of Rome, 
              before the civil war. </p>
            <p>Hinc usura vorax, rapidumque in tempore foenus, hinc concussa fides, 
              et multis utile bellum. This same mutes utile bellurn is an assured 
              and infallible sign of a state disposed to seditions and troubles. 
              And if this poverty and broken estate, in the better sort, be joined 
              with a want and necessity, in the mean people, the danger is imminent, 
              and great For the rebellions of the belly are the worst As for discontentments, 
              they are in the politic body, like to humours in the natural, which 
              are apt to gather a preternatural heat, and to inflame. And let 
              no prince measure the danger of them, by this; whether they be just, 
              or unjust. For that were to imagine people to be too reasonable; 
              who do often spurn at their own good: nor yet by this; whether me 
              griefs, whereupon they rise, be in fact, great or small: for they 
              are the most dangerous discontentments, where the fear is greater 
              than the feeling. Dolendi modus, timendi non item. Besides, in great 
              oppressions, the same things that provoke the patience, do withal 
              mate the courage: but in fears it is not so. Neither let any prince, 
              or state, be secure concerning discontentments, because they have 
              been often, or have been long and yet no peril hath ensued; for 
              as it is true, that every vapour, or fume, <br>
              doth not turn into a storm; so it is, nevertheless, true, that storms, 
              though they <br>
              blow over divers times, yet may fall at last; and as me Spanish 
              proverb noteth well; <br>
            </p>
            <p>The cord hreaketh at the last by me weakest pull.<br>
              The causes and motives of seditions are; innovation in religion;<br>
              taxes; alteration of laws and customs; breaking of privileges; general 
              oppression; <br>
              advancement of unworthy persons; strangers; dearths; disbanded soldiers; 
              factions grown desperate; and whatsoever in offending people, joined 
              and knitteth them, in a common cause.<br>
            </p>
            <p>For the remedies; there may be some general preservatives, whereof 
              we will speak; as for the just cure, it must answer to the particular 
              disease: and so be left to counsel, rather than rule.<br>
            </p>
            <p>The first remedy or prevention, is to remove by all means possible, 
              that material <br>
              cause of sedition, whereof we spoke; which is want and poverty in 
              the estate. </p>
            <p>To which purpose, serveth the opening and well balancing of trade; 
              the cherishing of manufactures; me banishing of idleness; the repressing 
              of waste and excess by sumptuary laws; the improvement and husbanding 
              of the soil; the regulating of prices of things vendible; the moderating 
              of taxes and tributes; and the like. </p>
            <p>Generally, it is to be foreseen, that the population of a kingdom, 
              (especially if it be not mown down by wars) do not exceed the stock 
              of the kingdom, which should maintain them. Neither is the population 
              to be reckoned only by number: for a smaller number, that spend 
              more, and earn less, do wear out an estate sooner than a greater 
              number, that live lower, and gather more. Therefore the multiplying 
              of nobility, and other degrees of quality, in an over proportion 
              to the common people, doth speedily bring a state to necessity: 
              and so doth likewise an overgrown clergy; for they bring nothing 
              to the stock; and in like manner, when more are bred scholars than 
              preferments can take off. It is likewise to be remembered, that 
              for as much as the increase of any estate must be upon the foreigner 
              (for whatsoever is somewhere gotten, is somewhere lost), there <br>
              be but three things, which one nation selleth unto another, the 
              commodity nature <br>
              yieldeth it; the manufacture; and the vecture or carriage. </p>
            <p>So that if these three wheels go, wealth will flow as in a spring 
              tide. And it cometh many times to pass, that materiam superabit 
              opus; that the work, and carriage, is more worth than the material, 
              and enricheth a state more; as is notably seen in the Low Countrymen, 
              who have the best mines, above ground, in the world.</p>
            <p> Above all things, good policy is to be used, that the treasure 
              and moneys in a state be not gathered into few hands. For otherwise, 
              a state may have a great stock, and yet starve. And money is like 
              muck, not good except it be spread. This is done, chiefly, by suppressing, 
              or at the least, keeping a strait hand, upon the devouring trades 
              of usury, engrossing, great pasturages, and the like.<br>
              For removing discontentments, or at least, the danger of them; there 
              is in every state (as we know) two portions of subjects; the noblesse, 
              and the commonality. </p>
            <p>When one of these is discontent, the danger is not great; for common 
              <br>
              people are of slow motion, if they be not excited by the greater 
              sort; and the greater sort are of small strength, except the multitude 
              be apt and ready to move of themselves. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Then is the danger, when the greater sort do but wait for the troubling 
              of the waters, amongst the meaner, that then they may declare themselves. 
              The poets feign, that the rest of the gods would have bound Jupiter, 
              which he hearing of, by the counsel of Pallas, sent for Briareus, 
              with his hundred hands, to come in to his aid. An emblem, no doubt, 
              to show how safe it is for monarchs to make sure of the good will 
              of common people.<br>
            </p>
            <p>To give moderate liberty for griefs and discontentments to evaporate 
              (so it be without too great insolency or bravery) is a safe way. 
              For he that turneth the humours back, and maketh the wound bleed 
              inwards, endangereth malign ulcers, and pernicious impostumations.<br>
            </p>
            <p>The part of Epimetheus mought well become Prometheus, in the case 
              of discontentments; for mere is not a better provision against them. 
              Epimetheus, when griefs and evils flew abroad, at last shut the 
              lid, and kept hope in the bottom of the vessel. Certainly, the politic 
              and artificial nourishing and entertaining of hopes, and carrying 
              men from hopes to hopes, is one of the best antidotes against me 
              poison of discontentments. And it is a certain sign of a wise government, 
              and proceeding, when it can hold men\'s hearts by hopes, when it 
              cannot by satisfaction: and when it can handle things in such manner 
              as no evil shall appear so peremptory, but that it hath some outlet 
              of hope: which is me less hard to do, because both particular persons, 
              and factions, are apt <br>
              enough to flatter themselves, or at least to brave that, which they 
              believe not.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Also, the foresight, and prevention, that there be no likely or 
              fit head, whereunto <br>
              discontented persons may resort, and under whom they may join, is 
              a known, but an excellent point of caution. I understand a fit head, 
              to be one that hath greatness, and reputation; that hath confidence 
              with the discontented party; and upon whom they turn their eyes; 
              and that is thought discontented in his own particular, which kind 
              of persons are either to be won, and reconciled to the state, and 
              that in a fast and true manner, or to be fronted, with some other 
              of the same party, that may oppose them, and so divide the reputation. 
            </p>
            <p>Generally, the dividing and breaking of all factions and combinations 
              that are adverse to the state, and setting them at distance, or 
              at least distrust amongst themselves, is not one of the worst remedies. 
              For it is a desperate case, if those that hold with the proceeding 
              of the state, be full of discord and faction; and those that are 
              against it, be entire and united. I have noted, that some witty 
              and sharp speeches, which have fallen from princes, have given fire 
              to seditions. Caesar did himself infinite hurt, in that speech; 
              Sulla nescivit literas, non potuit dictare\'. for it did, utterly 
              cut off that hope, which men had entertained, that he would, at 
              one time or other, give over his dictatorship. Galba undid himself 
              by that speech; legi a se militem, non am: for it put the soldiers 
              out of hope of the donative. Probus likewise, by that speech; si 
              vixero, non opus erit amplius Romanio imperio militibus. A speech 
              of great despair, for the soldiers: <br>
              and many the like. Surely, princes had need, in tender matters, 
              and ticklish times, <br>
              to beware what they say; especially in these short speeches, which 
              flee abroad like darts, and are thought to be shot out of their 
              secret intentions. </p>
            <p>For as for large discourses, they are flat things, and not so much 
              noted.<br>
              Lastly, let princes, against all events, not be without some great 
              person, one, or <br>
              rather more, of military valour near unto them, for the repressing 
              of seditions in <br>
              their beginnings. </p>
            <p>For without that, there useth to be more trepidation in court, 
              upon the first breaking out of troubles, than were fit And the state 
              runneth the danger <br>
              of that, which Tacitus saith; atque is habitus animorum fuit, ut 
              pessimum facinus <br>
              auderent pauci, plures vellent, crimes paterentur. But let such 
              military persons be <br>
              assured, and well reputed of, rather then factious, and popular, 
              holding also good correspondence with the other great men in the 
              state; or else the remedy is worse than the disease.</p>

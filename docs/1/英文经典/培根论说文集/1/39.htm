            <p>Men\'s thoughts are much according to their inclination: their 
              discourse and speeches according to their learning, and infused 
              opinions; but their deeds are after as they have been accustomed. 
              And therefore, as Machiavelli well noteth (though in an evil favoured 
              instance) there is no trusting to the force of nature, nor to the 
              bravery of words; except it be corroborate by custom. His instance 
              is, that for the achieving of a desperate conspiracy, a man should 
              not rest upon the fierceness of any man\'s nature, or his resolute 
              undertakings; but take Such an one, as hath had his hands formerly 
              in blood. But Machiavelli knew not of a Friar Clement, nor a Ravillac, 
              nor a Jaureguy, nor a Baltazar Gerard: yet his rule holdeth still, 
              that nature, nor the engagement of words, are not so forcible as 
              custom. Only superstition is now so well advanced, that men of the 
              first blood are as firm as butchers by occupation: and votary resolution 
              is made equipollent to custom, even in matter of blood. In other 
              things, the predominancy of custom is everywhere visible; in so 
              much, as a man would wonder, to hear men profess, protest, engage, 
              give great words, and then do just as they have done before: as 
              if they were dead images, and engines moved only by the wheels of 
              custom. </p>
            <p>We see also the reign or tyranny of custom, what it is. The Indians 
              (I mean <br>
              the sect of their wise men) lay themselves quietly upon a stack 
              of wood, and so <br>
              sacrifice themselves by fire. Nay, the wives strive to be burned 
              with the corpses <br>
              of their husbands. The lads of Sparta, of ancient time, were wont 
              to be scourged upon the altar of Diana, without so much as queening. 
              I remember in the beginning of Queen Elizabeth\'s time of England, 
              an Irish rebel condemned, put up a petition to the deputy, that 
              he might be hanged in a with, and not in an halter, because it had 
              been so used, with former rebels. </p>
            <p>There ON be monks in Russia, for penance, that will sit a whole 
              night in a vessel of water, till they be engaged with hard ice. 
              Many examples may be put of the force of custom, both upon mind, 
              and body. Therefore, since custom is the principal magistrate of 
              man\'s life, let men by all means endeavour to obtain good <br>
              customs. </p>
            <p>Certainly, custom is most perfect, when it beginneth in young years: 
              this <br>
              we call education; which is, in effect, but an early custom. So 
              we see, in languages the tongue is more pliant to all expressions 
              and sounds, the joints are more supple to all fears of activity 
              and motions, in youth than afterwards. For it is true, that late 
              learners cannot so well take the ply; except it be in some minds, 
              that have not suffered themselves to fix, but have kept themselves 
              open and prepared to receive continual amendment, which is exceeding 
              rare. <br>
            </p>
            <p>But if the force of custom simple and separate, be great: the force 
              of custom copulate, and conjoined and collegiate, is far greater. 
              For there example teacheth;<br>
              company comforteth; emulation quickeneth; glory raiseth: so as in 
              such places the <br>
              force of custom is in his exaltation. Certainly, the great multiplication 
              of virtues <br>
              upon human nature resteth upon societies well ordained, and disciplined. 
              For <br>
              commonwealths, and good governments, do nourish virtue grown, but 
              do not much mend the seeds. But the misery is, that the most effectual 
              means are now applied to the ends least to be desired.</p>

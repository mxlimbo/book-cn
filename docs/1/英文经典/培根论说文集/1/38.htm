            <p>Nature is often hidden; sometimes overcome; seldom extinguished. 
              Force maketh nature more violent in me return: doctrine and discourse 
              maketh nature less importune: but custom only doth alter and subdue 
              nature. He that seeketh victory over his nature, let him not set 
              himself too great, nor too small tasks: for the first will make 
              him dejected by often failings; and the second will make him a small 
              proceeder, though by often prevailings. </p>
            <p>And at the first, let him practise with helps, as swimmers do with 
              bladders, or rushes: but after a time, let him practise with disadvantages, 
              as dancers do with thick shoes. For it breeds great perfection, 
              if the practice be harder then the use. Where nature is mighty, 
              and therefore the victory hard, the degrees had need be; first to 
              stay and arrest nature in time; like to him, that would say over 
              the four and twenty letters, when he was angry: then to go less 
              in quantity; as if one should, in forbearing wine, come from drinking 
              healths, to a draught at a meal: and lastly, to discontinue altogether. 
              But if a man have the fortitude, and resolution, to enfranchise 
              himself at once, that is the best; optimus ille animi vindex, laedentia 
              pectus _vmcula qui rupit, dedoluitque semel.</p>
            <p> Neither is the ancient rule amiss, to bend nature as a wand, to 
              a contrary extreme, <br>
              whereby to set it right: understanding it, where the contrary extreme 
              is no vice. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Let not a man force a habit upon himself, with perpetual continuance, 
              but with some intermission. For both the pause reinforceth the new 
              onset; and if a man that is not perfect be ever in practice, he 
              shall as well practise his errors, as his abilities;<br>
              and induce one habit of both: and there is no means to help this, 
              but by seasonable <br>
              intermissions. </p>
            <p>But let not a man trust his victory over his nature too far, for 
              nature <br>
              will lay buried a great time, and yet revive, upon the occasion 
              or temptation. Like <br>
              as it was with Aesop\'s damsel, turned from a cat to a woman; who 
              sat very demurely, at the board\'s end, till a mouse ran before 
              her. Therefore let a man either avoid the occasion altogether, or 
              put himself often to it, that he may be little moved with it A man\'s 
              nature is best perceived in privateness, for there is no affectation; 
              in passion, for that puttefh a man out of his precepts; and in a 
              new case or experiment, for there custom leaveth him. </p>
            <p>They are happy men, whose natures sort with their vocations; otherwise 
              they may say, multum incola fuit aruma mea, when they converse in 
              those things, they do not affect In studies, whatsoever a man commandeth 
              upon himself, let him set hours for it: but whatsoever is agreeable 
              to his nature, let him take no care for any set times: for his thoughts 
              will fly to it of themselves; so as the spaces of other business, 
              or studies, will suffice. A man\'s nature runs either to herbs, 
              or weeds; therefore let him seasonably water the one, and destroy 
              the other.</p>

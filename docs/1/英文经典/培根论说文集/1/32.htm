            <p>Some in their discourse, desire rather commendation of wit, in 
              being able to hold <br>
              all arguments, than of judgment, in discerning what is true: as 
              if it were a praise, <br>
              to know what might be said, and not what should be thought Some 
              have certain common places, and themes, wherein they are good, and 
              want variety: which kind of poverty is for the most part tedious, 
              and when it is once perceived ridiculous. </p>
            <p>The honourablest part of talk is to give the occasion; and again 
              to moderate and pass to somewhat else; for then a man leads the 
              dance. It is good in discourse and speech of conversation, to vary, 
              and intermingle speech of the present occasion with arguments; tales 
              with reasons; asking of questions, with telling of opinions; and 
              jest with earnest: for it is a dull thing to tire, and, as we say 
              now, to jade, anything too far. </p>
            <p>As for jest, there be certain things, which ought to be privileged 
              from it; namely religion, matters of state, great persons, any man\'s 
              present business of <br>
              importance, and any case mat deserveth pity. Yet there be some, 
              that think their wits have been asleep, except they dart out somewhat 
              that is piquant, and to the quick: that is a vein which would be 
              bridled; parce,puer, stimulis, et fortius utere ions. </p>
            <p>And generally, men ought to find the difference, between saltness 
              and bitterness. <br>
              Certainly, he that hath a satyrical vein, as he maketh others afraid 
              of his wit, so <br>
              he had need be afraid of others\' memory. He that questioned! much, 
              shall learn much, and content much; but especially, if he apply 
              his questions to the skill of the persons whom he asketh: for he 
              shall give them occasion, to please themselves in speaking, and 
              himself shall continually gather knowledge. But let his questions 
              not be troublesome; for that is fit for a poser. And let him be 
              sure, to leave other men <br>
              their turns to speak. Nay, if there be any, that would reign, and 
              take up all the <br>
              time, let him find means to take them off, and to bring others on; 
              as musicians use <br>
              to do, with those that dance too long galliards. If you dissemble 
              sometimes your <br>
              knowledge, of that you are thought to know; you shall be thought 
              another time, to <br>
              know that, you know not. Speech of a man\'s self ought to be seldom, 
              and well chosen. <br>
            </p>
            <p>I knew one, was wont to say, in scorn; He must needs be a wise 
              man, he speaks so much of himself: and there is but one case, wherein 
              a man may commend himself, with good grace; and that is in commending 
              virtue in another; especially, if it be such a virtue, whereunto 
              himself pretendeth. Speech of touch towards others should be sparingly 
              used: for discourse ought to be as a field, without coming home 
              to any man. I knew two noblemen, of the west part of England; whereof 
              <br>
              the one was given to scoff, but kept ever royal cheer in his house: 
              the other would <br>
              ask of those, that had been at the other\'s table; Tell truly, was 
              there never a flout <br>
              or dry blow given; to which the guest would answer. </p>
            <p>Such and such a thing passed: the lord would say; I thought he 
              would mar a good dinner. Discretion of speech is more than eloquence; 
              and to speak agreeably to him, with whom we deal. is more than to 
              speak in good words, or in good order. A good continued speech, 
              without a good speech of interlocution, shows slowness: and a good 
              reply, or second speech, without a good settled speech, showeth 
              shallowness and weakness. As we see in beasts, that those that are 
              weakest in the course, are yet nimblest in the turn: as it is betwixt 
              the greyhound and the hare. To use too many circumstances, ere one 
              come to the matter, is wearisome; to use none at all, is blunt</p>

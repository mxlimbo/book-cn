            <p>Plantations are amongst ancient, primitive, and heroical works. 
              When the world was young, it begat more children; but now it is 
              old, it begets fewer: for I may jusuy account new plantations, to 
              be the children of former kingdoms. I like a plantation in a pure 
              soil; that is, where people are not displanted, to the end to plant 
              in others. </p>
            <p>For else, it is rather an extirpation, then a plantation. Planting 
              of countries, is like <br>
              planting of woeds; for you must make account, to lose almost twenty 
              years\' profit, <br>
              and expect your recompense in the end. For the principal thing, 
              that hath been the <br>
              destruction of most plantations, hath been the base and hasty drawing 
              of profit, in <br>
              the first years. It is true, speedy profit is not to be neglected, 
              as far as may stand <br>
              with the good of the plantation, but no further. It is a shameful 
              and unblessed thing, <br>
              to take the scum of people, and wicked condemned men, to be the 
              people with whom you plant: and not only so, but it spoileth the 
              plantation; for they will ever live like rogues, and not fall to 
              work, but be la2y, and do mischief, and spend victuals, and be quickly 
              weary, and then certify over to their country, to the discredit 
              of the plantation. </p>
            <p>The people wherewith you plant, ought to be gardeners, ploughmen, 
              <br>
              labourers, smiths, carpenters, joiners, fishermen, fowlers, with 
              some few <br>
              apothecaries, surgeons, cooks, and bakers. In a country of plantation, 
              first look <br>
              about, what kind of victual the country yields of itself, to hand: 
              as chestnuts, <br>
              walnuts, pineapples, olives, dates, plums, cherries, wild honey, 
              and the like: and <br>
              make use of them. Then consider, what victual or esculent things 
              there are, which <br>
              grow speedily, and within the year, as parsnips, carrots, turnips, 
              onions, radish, <br>
              artichokes of Jerusalem, maize and the like. For wheat, barley and 
              oats, they ask <br>
              too much labour: but with peas and beans, you may begin; both because 
              they ask less labour, and because they serve for meat, as well as 
              for bread. And of rice likewise cometh a great increase, and it 
              is a kind of meat Above all, there ought to be brought store of 
              biscuit, oat-meal, flower, meal, and the like, in the beginning, 
              till bread may be had. </p>
            <p>For beasts, or birds, take chiefly such as are least subject to 
              diseases, <br>
              and multiply fastest: as swine, goats, cocks, hens, turkeys, geese, 
              house-doves, and the like. The victual in plantations ought to be 
              expended, almost as in a besieged town; that is, with certain allowance. 
              And let the main part of the ground employed to gardens or corn, 
              be to a common stock; and to be laid in, and stored up, and then 
              delivered out in proportion; besides some spots of ground, that 
              any particular person will manure, for his own private. </p>
            <p>Consider likewise, what commodities the soil, where the plantation 
              is, doth naturally yield, that they may some way help to defray 
              the charge of the plantation: so it be not, as was said, to the 
              untimely prejudice of the main business; as it hath fared with tobacco 
              in Virginia. Wood commonly aboundeth but too much; and therefore, 
              timber is fit to be one. If there be iron ore, and streams whereupon 
              to set the mills; iron is a brave commodity, where wood aboundeth. 
              Making a bay salt, if the climate be proper for it, would be put 
              in experience. Growing silk likewise, if any be, is a likely commodity. 
              Pitch and tar, where store of firs and pines are, will not fail. 
              So drugs, and sweet woods, where they are, cannot but yield great 
              profit Soap ashes likewise, and other things that may be thought 
              of. But moil not too much under ground: for the hope of mines is 
              very uncertain, and useth to make the planters lazy in other things. 
              For government let it be in the hands of one, assisted with some 
              counsel: and let them have commission to exercise martial laws, 
              with some limitation. </p>
            <p>And above all, let men make that profit of being in the wilderness, 
              as they have God always, and his service before their eyes. Let 
              not the government of the plantation depend upon too many counsellors, 
              and undertakers, in the country that planteth, but upon a temperate 
              number, and let those be rather noblemen, and gentlemen, than merchants: 
              for they look ever to the present gain. Let there be freedoms from 
              custom, till the plantation be of strength: and not only freedom 
              from custom, but freedom to carry their commodities, where they 
              may make their best of them, except there be some special cause 
              of caution. Cram not in people, by sending too fast company after 
              company; but rather hearken how they waste, and send supplies proportionably; 
              but so, as the number may live well in the plantation, and not by 
              surcharge be in penury. It hath been a great endangering to the 
              health of some plantations, that they have built along the sea, 
              and rivers, in marsh and unwholesome grounds. </p>
            <p>Therefore, though you begin there, to avoid carriage, and other 
              like discommodities, yet build still rather upwards, from the streams, 
              than along. It concerneth likewise the health of the plantation, 
              that they have good store of salt with them, that they may use it 
              in their victuals, when it shall be necessary. If you plant, where 
              savages are, do not only entertain them with trifles, and gingles; 
              but use them justly, and graciously, with sufficient guard nevertheless: 
              and do not win their favour, by helping them to invade their enemies, 
              but for their defence it is not amiss: and send oft of them, over 
              to the country that plants, that they may see a better condition 
              then their own, and commend it when they return.</p>
            <p> When the plantation grows to strength, then it is time to plant 
              with women, as well as with men; that the plantation may spread 
              into generations, and not be ever pieced from without. It is the 
              sinfullest thing in the world, to forsake or destitute a plantation, 
              once in forwardness: for besides the dishonour, it is the guiltiness 
              of blood of many commiserable persons.</p>

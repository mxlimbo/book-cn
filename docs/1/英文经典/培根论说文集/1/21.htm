            <p>Fortune is like the market; where many times, if you can stay a 
              little, the price <br>
              will fall. And again, it is sometimes like Sybilla\'s offer, which 
              at first offereth <br>
              the commodity at full, then consumeth part and part, and still holdeth 
              up the price. <br>
            </p>
            <p>For occasion (as it is in the common verse) tumefh a bald noddle, 
              after he hath <br>
              presented her locks in front, and no hold taken: or at least tumeth 
              the handle of <br>
              the bottle, first to be received, and after the belly, which is 
              hard to clasp. There <br>
              is surely no greater wisdom, then well to time the beginnings and 
              onsets of things. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Dangers are no more light, if they once seem light:<br>
              and more dangers have deceived men, than forced them. Nay, it were 
              better, to meet some dangers half way, though they come nothing 
              near, than to keep too long a watch upon their approaches; for if 
              a man watch too long, it is odds he will fall asleep. </p>
            <p>On the other side, to be deceived, with too long shadows (as some 
              have been, when the moon was low, and shone on their enemies back), 
              and so to shoot off before the time; or to teach dangers to come 
              on, by over early buckling towards them, is another extreme. The 
              ripeness, or unripeness of the occasion (as we said) must ever be 
              well weighed; and generally, it is good, to commit the beginnings 
              of all great actions to Argos with his hundred eyes; and the ends 
              to Briareus with his hundred hands: first to watch, and then to 
              speed. For the helmet of Pluto, which maketh the politic man go 
              invisible, is secrecy in the counsel, and celerity in the execution. 
            </p>
            <p>For when things are once come to the execution, there is no secrecy 
              comparable to celerity; like the motion of a bullet in the air, 
              which flieth so swift, as it outruns the eye.</p>

            <p align="center" class="h">8 Of Marriage &amp; Single Life 
            <p>He that hath wife and children, hath given hostages to fortune; 
              for they are impediment to great enterprises, either of virtue, 
              or mischief. Certainly, the best works, and of greatest merit for 
              the public, have proceeded from the unmarried or childless men; 
              which both in affection, and means, have married and endowed the 
              public. Yet it were great reason, that those that have children, 
              should have greatest care of future times; unto which, they know, 
              they must transmit their dearest pledges. Some there are, who though 
              they lead a single life, yet their thoughts do end with themselves, 
              and account future times impertinences. Nay, there are some other, 
              that account wife and children <br>
              but as bills of charges. Nay more, there are some foolish rich covetous 
              men, that <br>
              take a pride in having no children, because they may be thought 
              so much the richer. </p>
            <p>For perhaps, they have heard some talk; Such an one is a great 
              rich man; and another except to it; Yea, but he hath a great charge 
              of children: as if it were an abatement to his riches. But the most 
              ordinary cause of a single life is liberty; especially in certain 
              self-pleasing and humorous minds, which are so sensible of every 
              restraint, as they will go near to think their girdles and garters 
              to be bonds and shackles.</p>
            <p> Unmarried men are best friends; best masters; best servants; but 
              not always best subjects; for they are light to run away; and almost 
              all fugitives are of that <br>
              condition. A single life doth well with church men: for charity 
              will hardly water <br>
              the ground, where it must first fill a pool. It is indifferent for 
              judges and magistrates: for if they be facile, and corrupt, you 
              shall have a servant five times <br>
              worse than a wife. For soldiers, I find the generals commonly in 
              their hortatives, <br>
              put men in mind of their wives and children: and I think the despising 
              of marriage <br>
              amongst the Turks, maketh the vulgar soldier more base. Certainly, 
              wife and children are a kind of discipline of humanity: and single 
              men though they be many times more charitable, because their means 
              are less exhaust; yet, on the other side, they are more cruel, and 
              hard hearted (good to make severe inquisitors), because their tenderness 
              is not so oft called upon. Grave natures, led by custom, and therefore 
              constant, are commonly loving husbands; as was said of Ulysses; 
              vetulam suam praetulit immortalitati. </p>
            <p>Chaste women are often proud and forward, as presuming upon the 
              merit of their chastity. It is one of the best bonds, both of chastity 
              and obedience, in the wife, if she think her husband wise; which 
              she will never do, if she find him jealous. Wives are young men\'s 
              mistresses; companions for middle age; and old men\'s nurses. So 
              as a man may have a quarrel to many, when he will. But yet, he was 
              reputed one of the wise men, mat made answer to the question, when 
              a man should marry? A young man not yet, an elder man not at all. 
              It is often seen, that bad husbands have very good wives; whether 
              it be, that it raiseth the price of their husband\'s kindness, when 
              it comes; or that the wives take a pride in their patience. But 
              this never fails, if the bad husbands were of their own choosing, 
              against their friends\' consent; for then, they will be sure to 
              make good their own folly.</p>

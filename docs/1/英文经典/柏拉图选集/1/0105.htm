                    Athenian Stranger. Listen, all ye who have just now heard 
                    the lawsabout Gods, and about our dear forefathers:-Of all 
                    the things whicha man has, next to the Gods, his soul is the 
                    most divine and mosttruly his own. Now in every man there 
                    are two parts: the better andsuperior, which rules, and the 
                    worse and inferior, which serves; andthe ruling part of him 
                    is always to be preferred to the subject.Wherefore I am right 
                    in bidding every one next to the Gods, who areour masters, 
                    and those who in order follow them [i.e., the demons], tohonour 
                    his own soul, which every one seems to honour, but no onehonours 
                    as he ought; for honour is a divine good, and no evil thing 
                    ishonourable; and he who thinks that he can honour the soul 
                    by word orgift, or any sort of compliance, without making 
                    her in any way better,seems to honour her, but honours her 
                    not at all. For example, everyman, from his very boyhood, 
                    fancies that he is able to knoweverything, and thinks that 
                    he honours his soul by praising her, andhe is very ready to 
                    let her do whatever she may like. But I mean tosay that in 
                    acting thus he injures his soul, and is far from honouringher; 
                    whereas, in our opinion, he ought to honour her as second 
                    only tothe Gods. Again, when a man thinks that others are 
                    to be blamed, andnot himself, for the errors which he has 
                    committed from time totime, and the many and great evils which 
                    befell him in consequence,and is always fancying himself to 
                    be exempt and innocent, he isunder the idea that he is honouring 
                    his soul; whereas the very reverseis the fact, for he is really 
                    injuring her. And when, disregarding theword and approval 
                    of the legislator, he indulges in pleasure, thenagain he is 
                    far from honouring her; he only dishonours her, andfills her 
                    full of evil and remorse; or when he does not endure tothe 
                    end the labours and fears and sorrows and pains which thelegislator 
                    approves, but gives way before them, then, by yielding,he 
                    does not honour the soul, but by all such conduct he makes 
                    her tobe dishonourable; nor when he thinks that life at any 
                    price is a good,does he honour her, but yet once more he dishonours 
                    her; for thesoul having a notion that the world below is all 
                    evil, he yields toher, and does not resist and teach or convince 
                    her that, for aught sheknows, the world of the Gods below, 
                    instead of being evil, may bethe greatest of all goods. Again, 
                    when any one prefers beauty tovirtue, what is this but the 
                    real and utter dishonour of the soul? Forsuch a preference 
                    implies that the body is more honourable than thesoul; and 
                    this is false, for there is nothing of earthly birth whichis 
                    more honourable than the heavenly, and he who thinks otherwise 
                    ofthe soul has no idea how greatly he undervalues this wonderfulpossession; 
                    nor, again, when a person is willing, or not unwilling, toacquire 
                    dishonest gains, does he then honour his soul with gifts-farotherwise; 
                    he sells her glory and honour for a small piece of gold;but 
                    all the gold which is under or upon the earth is not enough 
                    togive in exchange for virtue. In a word, I may say that he 
                    who does notestimate the base and evil, the good and noble, 
                    according to thestandard of the legislator, and abstain in 
                    every possible way from theone and practise the other to the 
                    utmost of his power, does not knowthat in all these respects 
                    he is most foully and disgracefully abusinghis soul, which 
                    is the divinest part of man; for no one, as I may say,ever 
                    considers that which is declared to be the greatest penalty 
                    ofevil-doing--namely, to grow into the likeness of bad men, 
                    andgrowing like them to fly from the conversation of the good, 
                    and be cutoff from them, and cleave to and follow after the 
                    company of thebad. And he who is joined to them must do and 
                    suffer what such menby nature do and say to one another-a 
                    suffering which is not justicebut retribution; for justice 
                    and the just are noble, whereasretribution is the suffering 
                    which waits upon injustice; and whether aman escape or endure 
                    this, he is miserable-in the former case, becausehe is not 
                    cured; while in the latter, he perishes in order that therest 
                    of mankind may be saved.</p>
                  <p>Speaking generally, our glory is to follow the better and 
                    improvethe inferior, which is susceptible of improvement, 
                    as far as this ispossible. And of all human possessions, the 
                    soul is by nature mostinclined to avoid the evil, and track 
                    out and find the chief good;which when a man has found, he 
                    should take up his abode with it duringthe remainder of his 
                    life. Wherefore the soul also is second [ornext to God] in 
                    honour; and third, as every one will perceive, comesthe honour 
                    of the body in natural order. Having determined this, wehave 
                    next to consider that there is a natural honour of the body,and 
                    that of honours some are true and some are counterfeit. Todecide 
                    which are which is the business of the legislator; and he, 
                    Isuspect, would intimate that they are as follows:-Honour 
                    is not tobe given to the fair body, or to the strong or the 
                    swift or thetall, or to the healthy body (although many may 
                    think otherwise),any more than to their opposites; but the 
                    mean states of all thesehabits are by far the safest and most 
                    moderate; for the one extrememakes the soul braggart and insolent, 
                    and the other, illiberal andbase; and money, and property, 
                    and distinction all go to the sametune. The excess of any 
                    of these things is apt to be a source ofhatreds and divisions 
                    among states and individuals; and the defectof them is commonly 
                    a cause of slavery. And, therefore, I would nothave any one 
                    fond of heaping up riches for the sake of his children,in 
                    order that he may leave them as rich as possible. For thepossession 
                    of great wealth is of no use, either to them or to thestate. 
                    The condition of youth which is free from flattery, and atthe 
                    same time not in need of the necessaries of life, is the bestand 
                    most harmonious of all, being in accord and agreement with 
                    ournature, and making life to be most entirely free from sorrow. 
                    Letparents, then, bequeath to their children not a heap of 
                    riches, butthe spirit of reverence. We, indeed, fancy that 
                    they will inheritreverence from us, if we rebuke them when 
                    they show a want ofreverence. But this quality is not really 
                    imparted to them by thepresent style of admonition, which 
                    only tells them that the youngought always to be reverential. 
                    A sensible legislator will ratherexhort the elders to reverence 
                    the younger, and above all to take heedthat no young man sees 
                    or hears one of themselves doing or sayinganything disgraceful; 
                    for where old men have no shame, there young menwill most 
                    certainly be devoid of reverence. The best way of trainingthe 
                    young is to train yourself at the same time; not to admonish 
                    them,but to be always carrying out your own admonitions in 
                    practice. He whohonours his kindred, and reveres those who 
                    share in the same Godsand are of the same blood and family, 
                    may fairly expect that theGods who preside over generation 
                    will be propitious to him, and willquicken his seed. And he 
                    who deems the services which his friendsand acquaintances 
                    do for him, greater and more important than theythemselves 
                    deem them, and his own favours to them less than theirsto 
                    him, will have their good-will in the intercourse of life. 
                    Andsurely in his relations to the state and his fellow citizens, 
                    he is byfar the best, who rather than the Olympic or any other 
                    victory ofpeace or war, desires to win the palm of obedience 
                    to the laws ofhis country, and who, of all mankind, is the 
                    person reputed to haveobeyed them best through life. In his 
                    relations to strangers, a manshould consider that a contract 
                    is a most holy thing, and that allconcerns and wrongs of strangers 
                    are more directly dependent on theprotection of God, than 
                    wrongs done to citizens; for the stranger,having no kindred 
                    and friends, is more to be pitied by Gods and men.Wherefore, 
                    also, he who is most able to avenge him is most zealousin 
                    his cause; and he who is most able is the genius and the god 
                    of thestranger, who follow in the train of Zeus, the god of 
                    strangers. Andfor this reason, he who has a spark of caution 
                    in him, will do hisbest to pass through life without sinning 
                    against the stranger. And ofoffences committed, whether against 
                    strangers or fellow-countrymen,that against suppliants is 
                    the greatest. For the god who witnessedto the agreement made 
                    with the suppliant, becomes in a specialmanner the guardian 
                    of the sufferer; and he will certainly notsuffer unavenged.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have fairly described the manner in which a man is 
                    to actabout his parents, and himself, and his own affairs; 
                    and in relationto the state, and his friends, and kindred, 
                    both in what concernshis own countrymen, and in what concerns 
                    the stranger. We will nowconsider what manner of man he must 
                    be who would best pass throughlife in respect of those other 
                    things which are not matters of law,but of praise and blame 
                    only; in which praise and blame educate a man,and make him 
                    more tractable and amenable to the laws which are aboutto 
                    be imposed.</p>
                  <p>Truth is the beginning of every good thing, both to Gods 
                    and men;and he who would be blessed and happy, should be from 
                    the first apartaker of the truth, that he may live a true 
                    man as long aspossible, for then he can be trusted; but he 
                    is not to be trustedwho loves voluntary falsehood, and he 
                    who loves involuntaryfalsehood is a fool. Neither condition 
                    is enviable, for theuntrustworthy and ignorant has no friend, 
                    and as time advances hebecomes known, and lays up in store 
                    for himself isolation in crabbedage when life is on the wane: 
                    so that, whether his children or friendsare alive or not, 
                    he is equally solitary.-Worthy of honour is he whodoes no 
                    injustice, and of more than twofold honour, if he not onlydoes 
                    no injustice himself, but hinders others from doing any; thefirst 
                    may count as one man, the second is worth many men, because 
                    heinforms the rulers of the injustice of others. And yet more 
                    highlyto be esteemed is he who co-operates with the rulers 
                    in correcting thecitizens as far as he can-he shall be proclaimed 
                    the great and perfectcitizen, and bear away the palm of virtue. 
                    The same praise may begiven about temperance and wisdom, and 
                    all other goods which may beimparted to others, as well as 
                    acquired by a man for himself; he whoimparts them shall be 
                    honoured as the man of men, and he who iswilling, yet is not 
                    able, may be allowed the second place; but hewho is jealous 
                    and will not, if he can help, allow others to partakein a 
                    friendly way of any good, is deserving of blame: the good,however, 
                    which he has, is not to be undervalued by us because it ispossessed 
                    by him, but must be acquired by us also to the utmost of ourpower. 
                    Let every man, then, freely strive for the prize of virtue, 
                    andlet there be no envy. For the unenvious nature increases 
                    the greatnessof states-he himself contends in the race, blasting 
                    the fair fame ofno man; but the envious, who thinks that he 
                    ought to get the better bydefaming others, is less energetic 
                    himself in the pursuit of truevirtue, and reduces his rivals 
                    to despair by his unjust slanders ofthem. And so he makes 
                    the whole city to enter the arena untrained inthe practice 
                    of virtue, and diminishes her glory as far as in himlies. 
                    Now every man should be valiant, but he should also be gentle.From 
                    the cruel, or hardly curable, or altogether incurable acts 
                    ofinjustice done to him by others, a man can only escape by 
                    fighting anddefending himself and conquering, and by never 
                    ceasing to punish them;and no man who is not of a noble spirit 
                    is able to accomplish this. Asto the actions of those who 
                    do evil, but whose evil is curable, in thefirst place, let 
                    us remember that the unjust man is not unjust ofhis own free 
                    will. For no man of his own free will would choose topossess 
                    the greatest of evils, and least of all in the most honourablepart 
                    of himself. And the soul, as we said, is of a truth deemed 
                    by allmen the most honourable. In the soul, then, which is 
                    the mosthonourable part of him, no one, if he could help, 
                    would admit, orallow to continue the greatest of evils. The 
                    unrighteous and viciousare always to be pitied in any case; 
                    and one can afford to forgiveas well as pity him who is curable, 
                    and refrain and calm one'sanger, not getting into a passion, 
                    like a woman, and nursingill-feeling. But upon him who is 
                    incapable of reformation and whollyevil, the vials of our 
                    wrath should be poured out; wherefore I saythat good men ought, 
                    when occasion demands, to be both gentle andpassionate.</p>
                  <p>Of all evils the greatest is one which in the souls of most 
                    men isinnate, and which a man is always excusing in himself 
                    and nevercorrecting; mean, what is expressed in the saying 
                    that &quot;Every man bynature is and ought to be his own friend.&quot; 
                    Whereas the excessivelove of self is in reality the source 
                    to each man of all offences; forthe lover is blinded about 
                    the beloved, so that he judges wrongly ofthe just, the good, 
                    and the honourable, and thinks that he oughtalways to prefer 
                    himself to the truth. But he who would be a great manought 
                    to regard, not himself or his interests, but what is just,whether 
                    the just act be his own or that of another. Through asimilar 
                    error men are induced to fancy that their own ignorance iswisdom, 
                    and thus we who may be truly said to know nothing, thinkthat 
                    we know all things; and because we will not let others act 
                    for usin what we do not know, we are compelled to act amiss 
                    ourselves.Wherefore let every man avoid excess of self-love, 
                    and condescend tofollow a better man than himself, not allowing 
                    any false shame tostand in the way. There are also minor precepts 
                    which are oftenrepeated, and are quite as useful; a man should 
                    recollect them andremind himself of them. For when a stream 
                    is flowing out, there shouldbe water flowing in too; and recollection 
                    flows in while wisdom isdeparting. Therefore I say that a 
                    man should refrain from excesseither of laughter or tears, 
                    and should exhort his neighbour to do thesame; he should veil 
                    his immoderate sorrow or joy, and seek tobehave with propriety, 
                    whether the genius of his good fortuneremains with him, or 
                    whether at the crisis of his fate, when heseems to be mounting 
                    high and steep places, the Gods oppose him insome of his enterprises. 
                    Still he may ever hope, in the case of goodmen, that whatever 
                    afflictions are to befall them in the future Godwill lessen, 
                    and that present evils he will change for the better; andas 
                    to the goods which are the opposite of these evils, he will 
                    notdoubt that they will be added to them, and that they will 
                    befortunate. Such should be men's hopes, and such should be 
                    theexhortations with which they admonish one another, never 
                    losing anopportunity, but on every occasion distinctly reminding 
                    themselves andothers of all these things, both in jest and 
                    earnest.</p>
                  <p>Enough has now been said of divine matters, both as touching 
                    thepractices which men ought to follow, and as to the sort 
                    of persons whothey ought severally to be. But of human things 
                    we have not as yetspoken, and we must; for to men we are discoursing 
                    and not to Gods.Pleasures and pains and desires are a part 
                    of human nature, and onthem every mortal being must of necessity 
                    hang and depend with themost eager interest. And therefore 
                    we must praise the noblest life,not only as the fairest in 
                    appearance, but as being one which, if aman will only taste, 
                    and not, while still in his youth, desert foranother, he will 
                    find to surpass also in the very thing which we allof us desire-I 
                    mean in having a greater amount of pleasure and less ofpain 
                    during the whole of life. And this will be plain, if a man 
                    hasa true taste of them, as will be quickly and clearly seen. 
                    But what isa true taste? That we have to learn from the argument-the 
                    pointbeing what is according to nature, and what is not according 
                    tonature. One life must be compared with another, the more 
                    pleasurablewith the more painful, after this manner:-We desire 
                    to havepleasure, but we neither desire nor choose pain; and 
                    the neutral statewe are ready to take in exchange, not for 
                    pleasure but for pain; andwe also wish for less pain and greater 
                    pleasure, but less pleasure andgreater pain we do not wish 
                    for; and an equal balance of either wecannot venture to assert 
                    that we should desire. And all these differor do not differ 
                    severally in number and magnitude and intensity andequality, 
                    and in the opposites of these when regarded as objects ofchoice, 
                    in relation to desire. And such being the necessary order 
                    ofthings, we wish for that life in which there are many great 
                    andintense elements of pleasure and pain, and in which the 
                    pleasuresare in excess, and do not wish for that in which 
                    the opposites exceed;nor, again, do we wish for that in which 
                    the clements of either aresmall and few and feeble, and the 
                    pains exceed. And when, as I saidbefore, there is a balance 
                    of pleasure and pain in life, this is to beregarded by us 
                    as the balanced life; while other lives are preferredby us 
                    because they exceed in what we like, or are rejected by usbecause 
                    they exceed in what we dislike. All the lives of men may beregarded 
                    by us as bound up in these, and we must also consider whatsort 
                    of lives we by nature desire. And if we wish for any others, 
                    Isay that we desire them only through some ignorance and inexperienceof 
                    the lives which actually exist.</p>
                  <p>Now, what lives are they, and how many in which, having searched 
                    outand beheld the objects of will and desire and their opposites, 
                    andmaking of them a law, choosing, I say, the dear and the 
                    pleasant andthe best and noblest, a man may live in the happiest 
                    way possible? Letus say that the temperate life is one kind 
                    of life, and the rationalanother, and the courageous another, 
                    and the healthful another; and tothese four let us oppose 
                    four other lives-the foolish, the cowardly,the intemperate, 
                    the diseased. He who knows the temperate life willdescribe 
                    it as in all things gentle, having gentle pains and gentlepleasures, 
                    and placid desires and loves not insane; whereas theintemperate 
                    life is impetuous in all things, and has violent pains andpleasures, 
                    and vehement and stinging desires, and loves utterlyinsane; 
                    and in the temperate life the pleasures exceed the pains,but 
                    in the intemperate life the pains exceed the pleasures ingreatness 
                    and number and frequency. Hence one of the two lives isnaturally 
                    and necessarily more pleasant and the other more painful,and 
                    he who would live pleasantly cannot possibly choose to liveintemperately. 
                    And if this is true, the inference clearly is that noman is 
                    voluntarily intemperate; but that the whole multitude of menlack 
                    temperance in their lives, either from ignorance, or from 
                    want ofself-control, or both. And the same holds of the diseased 
                    andhealthy life; they both have pleasures and pains, but in 
                    health thepleasure exceeds the pain, and in sickness the pain 
                    exceeds thepleasure. Now our intention in choosing the lives 
                    is not that thepainful should exceed, but the life in which 
                    pain is exceeded bypleasure we have determined to be the more 
                    pleasant life. And weshould say that the temperate life has 
                    the elements both of pleasureand pain fewer and smaller and 
                    less frequent than the intemperate, andthe wise life than 
                    the foolish life, and the life of courage thanthe life of 
                    cowardice; one of each pair exceeding in pleasure andthe other 
                    in pain, the courageous surpassing the cowardly, and thewise 
                    exceeding the foolish. And so the one dass of lives exceeds 
                    theother class in pleasure; the temperate and courageous and 
                    wise andhealthy exceed the cowardly and foolish and intemperate 
                    and diseasedlives; and generally speaking, that which has 
                    any virtue, whether ofbody or soul, is pleasanter than the 
                    vicious life, and far superior inbeauty and rectitude and 
                    excellence and reputation, and causes him wholives accordingly 
                    to be infinitely happier than the opposite.</p>
                  <p>Enough of the preamble; and now the laws should follow; or, 
                    to speakmore correctly, outline of them. As, then, in the 
                    case of a web or anyother tissue, the warp and the woof cannot 
                    be made of the samematerials, but the warp is necessarily 
                    superior as being stronger, andhaving a certain character 
                    of firmness, whereas the woof is softer andhas a proper degree 
                    of elasticity;-in a similar manner those who areto hold great 
                    offices in states, should be distinguished truly in eachcase 
                    from those who have been but slenderly proven by education. 
                    Letus suppose that there are two parts in the constitution 
                    of a state-onethe creation of offices, the other the laws 
                    which are assigned to themto administer.</p>
                  <p>But, before all this, comes the following consideration:-Theshepherd 
                    or herdsman, or breeder of horses or the like, when he hasreceived 
                    his animals will not begin to train them until he has firstpurified 
                    them in a manner which befits a community of animals; he willdivide 
                    the healthy and unhealthy, and the good breed and the badbreed, 
                    and will send away the unhealthy and badly bred to other herds,and 
                    tend the rest, reflecting that his labours will be vain and 
                    haveno effect, either on the souls or bodies of those whom 
                    nature andill nurture have corrupted, and that they will involve 
                    indestruction the pure and healthy nature and being of every 
                    otheranimal, if he should neglect to purify them. Now the 
                    case of otheranimals is not so important-they are only worth 
                    introducing for thesake of illustration; but what relates 
                    to man is of the highestimportance; and the legislator should 
                    make enquiries, and indicatewhat is proper for each one in 
                    the way of purification and of anyother procedure. Take, for 
                    example, the purification of a city-thereare many kinds of 
                    purification, some easier and others more difficult;and some 
                    of them, and the best and most difficult of them, thelegislator, 
                    if he be also a despot, may be able to effect; but thelegislator, 
                    who, not being a despot, sets up a new government andlaws, 
                    even if he attempt the mildest of purgations, may thinkhimself 
                    happy if he can complete his work. The best kind ofpurification 
                    is painful, like similar cures in medicine, involvingrighteous 
                    punishment and inflicting death or exile in the last resort.For 
                    in this way we commonly dispose of great sinners who areincurable, 
                    and are the greatest injury of the whole state. But themilder 
                    form of purification is as follows:-when men who havenothing, 
                    and are in want of food, show a disposition to follow theirleaders 
                    in an attack on the property of the rich-these, who are thenatural 
                    plague of the state, are sent away by the legislator in afriendly 
                    spirit as far as he is able; and this dismissal of them iseuphemistically 
                    termed a colony. And every legislator shouldcontrive to do 
                    this at once. Our present case, however, is peculiar.For there 
                    is no need to devise any colony or purifying separationunder 
                    the circumstances in which we are placed. But as, when manystreams 
                    flow together from many sources, whether springs or mountaintorrents, 
                    into a single lake, we ought to attend and take care thatthe 
                    confluent waters should be perfectly clear, and in order to 
                    effectthis, should pump and draw off and divert impurities, 
                    so in everypolitical arrangement there may be trouble and 
                    danger. But, seeingthat we are now only discoursing and not 
                    acting, let our selectionbe supposed to be completed, and 
                    the desired purity attained. Touchingevil men, who want to 
                    join and be citizens of our state, after we havetested them 
                    by every sort of persuasion and for a sufficient time,we will 
                    prevent them from coming; but the good we will to the utmostof 
                    our ability receive as friends with open arms.</p>
                  <p>Another piece of good fortune must not be forgotten, which, 
                    as wewere saying, the Heraclid colony had, and which is also 
                    ours-that wehave escaped division of land and the abolition 
                    of debts; for theseare always a source of dangerous contention, 
                    and a city which isdriven by necessity to legislate upon such 
                    matters can neither allowthe old ways to continue, nor yet 
                    venture to alter them. We musthave recourse to prayers, so 
                    to speak, and hope that a slight changemay be cautiously effected 
                    in a length of time. And such a changecan be accomplished 
                    by those who have abundance of land, and havingalso many debtors, 
                    are willing, in a kindly spirit, to share withthose who are 
                    in want, sometimes remitting and sometimes giving,holding 
                    fast in a path of moderation, and deeming poverty to be theincrease 
                    of a man's desires and not the diminution of his property.For 
                    this is the great beginning of salvation to a state, and upon 
                    thislasting basis may be erected afterwards whatever political 
                    order issuitable under the circumstances; but if the change 
                    be based upon anunsound principle, the future administration 
                    of the country will befull of difficulties. That is a danger 
                    which, as I am saying, isescaped by us, and yet we had better 
                    say how, if we had not escaped,we might have escaped; and 
                    we may venture now to assert that noother way of escape, whether 
                    narrow or broad, can be devised butfreedom from avarice and 
                    a sense of justice-upon this rock our cityshall be built; 
                    for there ought to be no disputes among citizens aboutproperty. 
                    If there are quarrels of long standing among them, nolegislator 
                    of any degree of sense will proceed a step in thearrangement 
                    of the state until they are settled. But that they to whomGod 
                    has given, as he has to us, to be the founders of a new state 
                    asyet free from enmity-that they should create themselves 
                    enmities bytheir mode of distributing lands and houses, would 
                    be superhuman follyand wickedness.</p>
                  <p>How then can we rightly order the distribution of the land? 
                    In thefirst place, the number of the citizens has to be determined, 
                    and alsothe number and size of the divisions into which they 
                    will have to beformed; and the land and the houses will then 
                    have to be apportionedby us as fairly as we can. The number 
                    of citizens can only beestimated satisfactorily in relation 
                    to the territory and theneighbouring states. The territory 
                    must be sufficient to maintain acertain number of inhabitants 
                    in a moderate way of life-more than thisis not required; and 
                    the number of citizens should be sufficient todefend themselves 
                    against the injustice of their neighbours, andalso to give 
                    them the power of rendering efficient aid to theirneighbours 
                    when they are wronged. After having taken a survey oftheirs 
                    and their neighbours' territory, we will determine the limitsof 
                    them in fact as well as in theory. And now, let us proceed 
                    tolegislate with a view to perfecting the form and outline 
                    of our state.The number of our citizens shall be 5040-this 
                    will be a convenientnumber; and these shall be owners of the 
                    land and protectors of theallotment. The houses and the land 
                    will be divided in the same way, sothat every man may correspond 
                    to a lot. Let the whole number befirst divided into two parts, 
                    and then into three; and the number isfurther capable of being 
                    divided into four or five parts, or anynumber of parts up 
                    to ten. Every legislator ought to know so mucharithmetic as 
                    to be able to tell what number is most likely to beuseful 
                    to all cities; and we are going to take that number whichcontains 
                    the greatest and most regular and unbroken series ofdivisions. 
                    The whole of number has every possible division, and thenumber 
                    5040 can be divided by exactly fifty-nine divisors, and tenof 
                    these proceed without interval from one to ten: this will 
                    furnishnumbers for war and peace, and for all contracts and 
                    dealings,including taxes and divisions of the land. These 
                    properties ofnumber should be ascertained at leisure by those 
                    who are bound bylaw to know them; for they are true, and should 
                    be proclaimed at thefoundation of the city, with a view to 
                    use. Whether the legislatoris establishing a new state or 
                    restoring an old and decayed one, inrespect of Gods and temples-the 
                    temples which are to be built ineach city, and the Gods or 
                    demi-gods after whom they are to becalled-if he be a man of 
                    sense, he will make no change in anythingwhich the oracle 
                    of Delphi, or Dodona, or the God Ammon, or anyancient tradition 
                    has sanctioned in whatever manner, whether byapparitions or 
                    reputed inspiration of Heaven, in obedience to whichmankind 
                    have established sacrifices in connection with mystic rites,either 
                    originating on the spot, or derived from Tyrrhenia or Cyprus 
                    orsome other place, and on the strength of which traditions 
                    they haveconsecrated oracles and images, and altars and temples, 
                    andportioned out a sacred domain for each of them. The least 
                    part ofall these ought not to be disturbed by the legislator; 
                    but he shouldassign to the several districts some God, or 
                    demi-god, or hero, and,in the distribution of the soil, should 
                    give to these first theirchosen domain and all things fitting, 
                    that the inhabitants of theseveral districts may meet at fixed 
                    times, and that they may readilysupply their various wants, 
                    and entertain one another with sacrifices,and become friends 
                    and acquaintances; for there is no greater goodin a state 
                    than that the citizens should be known to one another. Whennot 
                    light but darkness and ignorance of each other's charactersprevails 
                    among them, no one will receive the honour of which he isdeserving, 
                    or the power or the justice to which he is fairly entitled:wherefore, 
                    in every state, above all things, every man should takeheed 
                    that he have no deceit in him, but that he be always true 
                    andsimple; and that no deceitful person take any advantage 
                    of him.</p>
                  <p>The next move in our pastime of legislation, like the withdrawalof 
                    the stone from the holy line in the game of draughts, being 
                    anunusual one, will probably excite wonder when mentioned 
                    for thefirst time. And yet, if a man will only reflect and 
                    weigh the matterwith care, he will see that our city is ordered 
                    in a manner which,if not the best, is the second best. Perhaps 
                    also some one may notapprove this form, because he thinks 
                    that such a constitution is illadapted to a legislator who 
                    has not despotic power. The truth is, thatthere are three 
                    forms of government, the best, the second and thethird best, 
                    which we may just mention, and then leave the selection tothe 
                    ruler of the settlement. Following this method in the presentinstance, 
                    let us speak of the states which are respectively first,second, 
                    and third in excellence, and then we will leave the choiceto 
                    Cleinias now, or to any one else who may hereafter have to 
                    make asimilar choice among constitutions, and may desire to 
                    give to hisstate some feature which is congenial to him and 
                    which he approvesin his own country.</p>
                  <p>The first and highest form of the state and of the government 
                    and ofthe law is that in which there prevails most widely 
                    the ancientsaying, that &quot;Friends have all things in common.&quot; 
                    Whether there isanywhere now, or will ever be, this communion 
                    of women and childrenand of property, in which the private 
                    and individual is altogetherbanished from life, and things 
                    which are by nature private, such aseyes and ears and hands, 
                    have become common, and in some way see andhear and act in 
                    common, and all men express praise and blame andfeel joy and 
                    sorrow on the same occasions, and whatever laws there areunite 
                    the city to the utmost-whether all this is possible or not, 
                    Isay that no man, acting upon any other principle, will ever 
                    constitutea state which will be truer or better or more exalted 
                    in virtue.Whether such a state is governed by Gods or sons 
                    of Gods, one, or morethan one, happy are the men who, living 
                    after this manner, dwellthere; and therefore to this we are 
                    to look for the pattern of thestate, and to cling to this, 
                    and to seek with all our might for onewhich is like this. 
                    The state which we have now in hand, when created,will be 
                    nearest to immortality and the only one which takes the secondplace; 
                    and after that, by the grace of God, we will complete the 
                    thirdone. And we will begin by speaking of the nature and 
                    origin of thesecond.</p>
                  <p>Let the citizens at once distribute their land and houses, 
                    and nottill the land in common, since a community of goods 
                    goes beyondtheir proposed origin, and nurture, and education. 
                    But in making thedistribution, let the several possessors 
                    feel that their particularlots also belong to the whole city; 
                    and seeing that the earth is theirparent, let them tend her 
                    more carefully than children do theirmother. For she is a 
                    goddess and their queen, and they are hermortal subjects. 
                    Such also are the feelings which they ought toentertain to 
                    the Gods and demi-gods of the country. And in orderthat the 
                    distribution may always remain, they ought to considerfurther 
                    that the present number of families should be always retained,and 
                    neither increased nor diminished. This may be secured for 
                    thewhole city in the following manner:-Let the possessor of 
                    a lot leavethe one of his children who is his best beloved, 
                    and one only, to bethe heir of his dwelling, and his successor 
                    in the duty of ministeringto the Gods, the state and the family, 
                    as well the living members ofit as those who are departed 
                    when he comes into the inheritance; butof his other children, 
                    if he have more than one, he shall give thefemales in marriage 
                    according to the law to be hereafter enacted,and the males 
                    he shall distribute as sons to those citizens who haveno children 
                    and are disposed to receive them; or if there should benone 
                    such, and particular individuals have too many children, maleor 
                    female, or too few, as in the case of barrenness-in all these 
                    caseslet the highest and most honourable magistracy created 
                    by us judge anddetermine what is to be done with the redundant 
                    or deficient, anddevise a means that the number of 5040 houses 
                    shall always remainthe same. There are many ways of regulating 
                    numbers; for they inwhom generation is affluent may be made 
                    to refrain, and, on theother hand, special care may be taken 
                    to increase the number of birthsby rewards and stigmas, or 
                    we may meet the evil by the elder mengiving advice and administering 
                    rebuke to the younger-in this waythe object may be attained. 
                    And if after all there be very greatdifficulty about the equal 
                    preservation of the 5040 houses, andthere be an excess of 
                    citizens, owing to the too great love of thosewho live together, 
                    and we are at our wits' end, there is still the olddevice 
                    often mentioned by us of sending out a colony, which willpart 
                    friends with us, and be composed of suitable persons. If, 
                    onthe other hand, there come a wave bearing a deluge of disease, 
                    or aplague of war, and the inhabitants become much fewer than 
                    theappointed number by reason of bereavement, we ought not 
                    to introducecitizens of spurious birth and education, if this 
                    can be avoided;but even God is said not to be able to fight 
                    against necessity.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore let us suppose this &quot;high argument&quot; of 
                    ours to addressus in the following terms:-Best of men, cease 
                    not to honouraccording to nature similarity and equality and 
                    sameness andagreement, as regards number and every good and 
                    noble quality. And,above all, observe the aforesaid number 
                    5040 throughout life; in thesecond place, do not disparage 
                    the small and modest proportions of theinheritances which 
                    you received in the distribution, by buying andselling them 
                    to one another. For then neither will the God who gaveyou 
                    the lot be your friend, nor will the legislator; and indeed 
                    thelaw declares to the disobedient that these are the terms 
                    upon which hemay or may not take the lot. In the first place, 
                    the earth as he isinformed is sacred to the Gods; and in the 
                    next place, priests andpriestesses will offer up prayers over 
                    a first, and second, and even athird sacrifice, that he who 
                    buys or sells the houses or lands whichhe has received, may 
                    suffer the punishment which he deserves; andthese their prayers 
                    they shall write down in the temples, on tabletsof cypress-wood, 
                    for the instruction of posterity. Moreover theywill set a 
                    watch over all these things, that they may be observed;-themagistracy 
                    which has the sharpest eyes shall keep watch that anyinfringement 
                    of these commands may be discovered and punished asoffences 
                    both against the law and the God. How great is the benefit 
                    ofsuch an ordinance to all those cities, which obey and are 
                    administeredaccordingly, no bad man can ever know, as the 
                    old proverb says; butonly a man of experience and good habits. 
                    For in such an order ofthings there will not be much opportunity 
                    for making money; no maneither ought, or indeed will be allowed, 
                    to exercise any ignobleoccupation, of which the vulgarity 
                    is a matter of reproach to afreeman, and should never want 
                    to acquire riches by any such means.</p>
                  <p>Further, the law enjoins that no private man shall be allowed 
                    topossess gold and silver, but only coin for daily use, which 
                    isalmost necessary in dealing with artisans, and for payment 
                    ofhirelings, whether slaves or immigrants, by all those persons 
                    whorequire the use of them. Wherefore our citizens, as we 
                    say, shouldhave a coin passing current among themselves, but 
                    not accepted amongthe rest of mankind; with a view, however, 
                    to expeditions and journeysto other lands-for embassies, or 
                    for any other occasion which mayarise of sending out a herald, 
                    the state must also possess a commonHellenic currency. If 
                    a private person is ever obliged to go abroad,let him have 
                    the consent of the magistrates and go; and if when hereturns 
                    he has any foreign money remaining, let him give the surplusback 
                    to the treasury, and receive a corresponding sum in the localcurrency. 
                    And if he is discovered to appropriate it, let it beconfiscated, 
                    and let him who knows and does not inform be subject tocurse 
                    and dishonour equally him who brought the money, and also 
                    to afine not less in amount than the foreign money which has 
                    beenbrought back. In marrying and giving in marriage, no one 
                    shall give orreceive any dowry at all; and no one shall deposit 
                    money withanother whom he does not trust as a friend, nor 
                    shall he lend moneyupon interest; and the borrower should 
                    be under no obligation to repayeither capital or interest. 
                    That these principles are best, any onemay see who compares 
                    them with the first principle and intention ofa state. The 
                    intention, as we affirm, of a reasonable statesman, isnot 
                    what the many declare to be the object of a good legislator,namely, 
                    that the state for the true interests of which he isadvising 
                    should be as great and as rich as possible, and shouldpossess 
                    gold and silver, and have the greatest empire by sea andland;-this 
                    they imagine to be the real object of legislation, at thesame 
                    time adding, inconsistently, that the true legislator desiresto 
                    have the city the best and happiest possible. But they do 
                    not seethat some of these things are possible, and some of 
                    them areimpossible; and he who orders the state will desire 
                    what ispossible, and will not indulge in vain wishes or attempts 
                    toaccomplish that which is impossible. The citizen must indeed 
                    behappy and good, and the legislator will seek to make him 
                    so; butvery rich and very good at the same time he cannot 
                    be, not, atleast, in the sense in which the many speak of 
                    riches. For they meanby &quot;the rich&quot; the few who have 
                    the most valuable possessions, althoughthe owner of them may 
                    quite well be a rogue. And if this is true, Ican never assent 
                    to the doctrine that the rich man will be happy-hemust be 
                    good as well as rich. And good in a high degree, and rich 
                    in ahigh degree at the same time, he cannot be. Some one will 
                    ask, whynot? And we shall answer-Because acquisitions which 
                    come fromsources which are just and unjust indifferently, 
                    are more thandouble those which come from just sources only; 
                    and the sums which areexpended neither honourably nor disgracefully, 
                    are only half asgreat as those which are expended honourably 
                    and on honourablepurposes. Thus, if the one acquires double 
                    and spends half, theother who is in the opposite case and 
                    is a good man cannot possibly bewealthier than he. The first-I 
                    am speaking of the saver and not of thespender-is not always 
                    bad; he may indeed in some cases be utterly bad,but, as I 
                    was saying, a good man he never is. For he who receivesmoney 
                    unjustly as well as justly, and spends neither nor unjustly,will 
                    be a rich man if he be also thrifty. On the other hand, theutterly 
                    bad is in general profligate, and therefore very poor; whilehe 
                    who spends on noble objects, and acquires wealth by just meansonly, 
                    can hardly be remarkable for riches, any more than he can 
                    bevery poor. Our statement, then, is true, that the very rich 
                    are notgood, and, if they are not good, they are not happy. 
                    But the intentionof our laws was that the citizens should 
                    be as happy as may be, and asfriendly as possible to one another. 
                    And men who are always at lawwith one another, and amongst 
                    whom there are many wrongs done, cannever be friends to one 
                    another, but only those among whom crimesand lawsuits are 
                    few and slight. Therefore we say that gold and silverought 
                    not to be allowed in the city, nor much of the vulgar sort 
                    oftrade which is carried on by lending money, or rearing the 
                    meanerkinds of live stock; but only the produce of agriculture, 
                    and onlyso much of this as will not compel us in pursuing 
                    it to neglect thatfor the sake of which riches exist-I mean, 
                    soul and body, whichwithout gymnastics, and without education, 
                    will never be worthanything; and therefore, as we have said 
                    not once but many times,the care of riches should have the 
                    last place in our thoughts. Forthere are in all three things 
                    about which every man has an interest;and the interest about 
                    money, when rightly regarded, is the thirdand lowest of them: 
                    midway comes the interest of the body; and,first of all, that 
                    of the soul; and the state which we aredescribing will have 
                    been rightly constituted if it ordains honoursaccording to 
                    this scale. But if, in any of the laws which have beenordained, 
                    health has been preferred to temperance, or wealth to healthand 
                    temperate habits, that law must clearly be wrong. Wherefore, 
                    also,the legislator ought often to impress upon himself thequestion-&quot;What 
                    do I want?&quot; and &quot;Do I attain my aim, or do I miss 
                    themark?&quot; In this way, and in this way only, he ma acquit 
                    himself andfree others from the work of legislation.</p>
                  <p>Let the allottee then hold his lot upon the conditions which 
                    we havementioned.</p>
                  <p>It would be well that every man should come to the colony 
                    having allthings equal; but seeing that this is not possible, 
                    and one man willhave greater possessions than another, for 
                    many reasons and inparticular in order to preserve equality 
                    in special crises of thestate, qualifications of property 
                    must be unequal, in order thatoffices and contributions and 
                    distributions may be proportioned to thevalue of each person's 
                    wealth, and not solely to the virtue of hisancestors or himself, 
                    nor yet to the strength and beauty of hisperson, but also 
                    to the measure of his wealth or poverty; and so bya law of 
                    inequality, which will be in proportion to his wealth, hewill 
                    receive honours and offices as equally as possible, and therewill 
                    be no quarrels and disputes. To which end there should be 
                    fourdifferent standards appointed according to the amount 
                    of property:there should be a first and a second and a third 
                    and a fourth class,in which the citizens will be placed, and 
                    they will be called by theseor similar names: they may continue 
                    in the same rank, or pass intoanother in any individual case, 
                    on becoming richer from being, poorer,or poorer from being 
                    richer. The form of law which I should propose asthe natural 
                    sequel would be as follows:-In a state which is desirousof 
                    being saved from the greatest of all plagues-not faction, 
                    butrather distraction;-here should exist among the citizens 
                    neitherextreme poverty, nor, again, excess of wealth, for 
                    both are productiveof both these evils. Now the legislator 
                    should determine what is to bethe limit of poverty or wealth. 
                    Let the limit of poverty be thevalue of the lot; this ought 
                    to be preserved, and no ruler, nor anyone else who aspires 
                    after a reputation for virtue, will allow the lotto be impaired 
                    in any case. This the legislator gives as a measure,and he 
                    will permit a man to acquire double or triple, or as much 
                    asfour times the amount of this. But if a person have yet 
                    greaterriches, whether he has found them, or they have been 
                    given to him,or he has made them in business, or has acquired 
                    by any stroke offortune that which is in excess of the measure, 
                    if he give back thesurplus to the state, and to the Gods who 
                    are the patrons of thestate, he shall suffer no penalty or 
                    loss of reputation; but if hedisobeys this our law any one 
                    who likes may inform against him andreceive half the value 
                    of the excess, and the delinquent shall pay asum equal to 
                    the excess out of his own property, and the other half ofthe 
                    excess shall belong to the Gods. And let every possession 
                    of everyman, with the exception of the lot, be publicly registered 
                    beforethe magistrates whom the law appoints, so that all suits 
                    about moneymay be easy and quite simple.</p>
                  <p>The next thing to be noted is, that the city should be placed 
                    asnearly as possible in the centre of the country; we should 
                    choose aplace which possesses what is suitable for a city, 
                    and this may easilybe imagined and described. Then we will 
                    divide the city into twelveportions, first founding temples 
                    to Hestia, to Zeus and to Athene,in a spot which we will call 
                    the Acropolis, and surround with acircular wall, making the 
                    division of the entire city and countryradiate from this point. 
                    The twelve portions shall be equalized by theprovision that 
                    those which are of good land shall be smaller. whilethose 
                    of inferior quality shall be larger. The number of the lotsshall 
                    be 5040, and each of them shall be divided into two, and everyallotment 
                    shall be composed of two such sections; one of land near thecity, 
                    the other of land which is at a distance. This arrangement 
                    shallbe carried out in the following manner: The section which 
                    is nearthe city shall be added to that which is on borders, 
                    and form one lot,and the portion which is next nearest shall 
                    be added to the portionwhich is next farthest; and so of the 
                    rest. Moreover, in the twosections of the lots the same principle 
                    of equalization of the soilought to be maintained; the badness 
                    and goodness shall becompensated by more and less. And the 
                    legislator shall divide thecitizens into twelve parts, and 
                    arrange the rest of their property, asfar as possible, so 
                    as to form twelve equal parts; and there shallbe a registration 
                    of all. After this they shall assign twelve lotsto twelve 
                    Gods, and call them by their names, and dedicate to each Godtheir 
                    several portions, and call the tribes after them. And they 
                    shalldistribute the twelve divisions of the city in the same 
                    way in whichthey divided the country; and every man shall 
                    have two habitations,one in the centre of the country, and 
                    the other at the extremity.Enough of the manner of settlement.</p>
                  <p>Now we ought by all means to consider that there can never 
                    be such ahappy concurrence of circumstances as we have described; 
                    neither canall things coincide as they are wanted. Men who 
                    will not takeoffence at such a mode of living together, and 
                    will endure all theirlife long to have their property fixed 
                    at a moderate limit, and tobeget children in accordance with 
                    our ordinances, and will allowthemselves to be deprived of 
                    gold and other things which thelegislator, as is evident from 
                    these enactments, will certainly forbidthem; and will endure, 
                    further, the situation of the land with thecity in the middle 
                    and dwellings round about;-all this is as if thelegislator 
                    were telling his dreams, or making a city and citizens ofwax. 
                    There is truth in these objections, and therefore every oneshould 
                    take to heart what I am going to say. Once more, then, thelegislator 
                    shall appear and address us:-&quot;O my friends,&quot; he 
                    will say tous, &quot;do not suppose me ignorant that there 
                    is a certain degree oftruth in your words; but I am of opinion 
                    that, in matters which arenot present but future, he who exhibits 
                    a pattern of that at whichhe aims, should in nothing fall 
                    short of the fairest and truest; andthat if he finds any part 
                    of this work impossible of execution heshould avoid and not 
                    execute it, but he should contrive to carry outthat which 
                    is nearest and most akin to it; you must allow thelegislator 
                    to perfect his design, and when it is perfected, you shouldjoin 
                    with him in considering what part of his legislation is expedientand 
                    what will arouse opposition; for surely the artist who is 
                    to bedeemed worthy of any regard at all, ought always to make 
                    his workself-consistent.&quot;</p>
                  <p>Having determined that there is to be a distribution into 
                    twelveparts, let us now see in what way this may be accomplished. 
                    There isno difficulty in perceiving that the twelve parts 
                    admit of thegreatest number of divisions of that which they 
                    include, or inseeing the other numbers which are consequent 
                    upon them, and areproduced out of them up to 5040; wherefore 
                    the law ought to orderphratries and demes and villages, and 
                    also military ranks andmovements, as well as coins and measures, 
                    dry and liquid, and weights,so as to be commensurable and 
                    agreeable to one another. Nor shouldwe fear the appearance 
                    of minuteness, if the law commands that all thevessels which 
                    a man possesses should have a common measure, when weconsider 
                    generally that the divisions and variations of numbers have 
                    ause in respect of all the variations of which they are susceptible,both 
                    in themselves and as measures of height and depth, and in 
                    allsounds, and in motions, as well those which proceed in 
                    a straightdirection, upwards or downwards, as in those which 
                    go round and round.The legislator is to consider all these 
                    things and to bid thecitizens, as far as possible, not to 
                    lose sight of numerical order;for no single instrument of 
                    youthful education has such mightypower, both as regards domestic 
                    economy and politics, and in the arts,as the study of arithmetic. 
                    Above all, arithmetic stirs up him whois by nature sleepy 
                    and dull, and makes him quick to learn, retentive,shrewd, 
                    and aided by art divine he makes progress quite beyond hisnatural 
                    powers. All such things, if only the legislator, by other 
                    lawsand institutions, can banish meanness and covetousness 
                    from thesouls of men, so that they can use them properly and 
                    to their owngood, will be excellent and suitable instruments 
                    of education. Butif he cannot, he will unintentionally create 
                    in them, instead ofwisdom, the habit of craft, which evil 
                    tendency may be observed in theEgyptians and Phoenicians, 
                    and many other races, through the generalvulgarity of their 
                    pursuits and acquisitions, whether some unworthylegislator 
                    theirs has been the cause, or some impediment of chanceor 
                    nature. For we must not fail to observe, O Megillus and Cleinias,that 
                    there is a difference in places, and that some beget better 
                    menand others worse; and we must legislate accordingly. Some 
                    places aresubject to strange and fatal influences by reason 
                    of diverse winds andviolent heats, some by reason of waters; 
                    or, again, from the characterof the food given by the earth, 
                    which not only affects the bodies ofmen for good or evil, 
                    but produces similar results in their souls. Andin all such 
                    qualities those spots excel in which there is a divineinspiration, 
                    and in which the demi-gods have their appointed lots, andare 
                    propitious, not adverse, to the settlers in them. To all thesematters 
                    the legislator, if he have any sense in him, will attend asfar 
                    as man can, and frame his laws accordingly. And this is whatyou, 
                    Cleinias, must do, and to matters of this kind you must turn 
                    yourmind since you are going to colonize a new country.</p>
                  <p>Cleinias. Your words, Athenian Stranger, are excellent, and 
                    I will do as you say.</p>

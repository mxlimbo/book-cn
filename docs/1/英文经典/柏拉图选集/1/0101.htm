                    PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: An ATHENIAN STRANGER; CLEINIAS, aCretan; 
                    MEGILLUS, a Lacedaemonian</p>
                  <p>Athenian Stranger. Tell me, Strangers, is a God or some man 
                    supposedto be the author of your laws?</p>
                  <p>Cleinias. A God, Stranger; in very truth a, God: among us 
                    Cretans heis said to have been Zeus, but in Lacedaemon, whence 
                    our friend herecomes, I believe they would say that Apollo 
                    is their lawgiver: wouldthey not, Megillus?</p>
                  <p>Megillus. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And do you, Cleinias, believe, as Homer tells, that 
                    every ninthyear Minos went to converse with his Olympian sire, 
                    and was inspiredby him to make laws for your cities?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes, that is our tradition; and there was Rhadamanthus, 
                    abrother of his, with whose name you are familiar; he is reputed 
                    tohave been the justest of men, and we Cretans are of opinion 
                    that heearned this reputation from his righteous administration 
                    of justicewhen he was alive.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Yes, and a noble reputation it was, worthy of a son 
                    of Zeus. Asyou and Megillus have been trained in these institutions, 
                    I dare saythat you will not be unwilling to give an account 
                    of your governmentand laws; on our way we can pass the time 
                    pleasantly in about them,for I am told that the distance from 
                    Cnosus to the cave and templeof Zeus is considerable; and 
                    doubtless there are shady places underthe lofty trees, which 
                    will protect us from this scorching sun.Being no longer young, 
                    we may often stop to rest beneath them, and getover the whole 
                    journey without difficulty, beguiling the time byconversation.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes, Stranger, and if we proceed onward we shall come 
                    to grovesof cypresses, which are of rare height and beauty, 
                    and there are greenmeadows, in which we may repose and converse.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Very good.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very good, indeed; and still better when we see them; 
                    let usmove on cheerily.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I am willing-And first, I want to know why the law has 
                    ordainedthat you shall have common meals and gymnastic exercises, 
                    and weararms.</p>
                  <p>Cle. I think, Stranger, that the aim of our institutions 
                    is easilyintelligible to any one. Look at the character of 
                    our country: Creteis not like Thessaly, a large plain; and 
                    for this reason they havehorsemen in Thessaly, and we have 
                    runners-the inequality of the groundin our country is more 
                    adapted to locomotion on foot; but then, if youhave runners 
                    you must have light arms-no one can carry a heavyweight when 
                    running, and bows and arrows are convenient because theyare 
                    light. Now all these regulations have been made with a view 
                    towar, and the legislator appears to me to have looked to 
                    this in allhis arrangements:-the common meals, if I am not 
                    mistaken, wereinstituted by him for a similar reason, because 
                    he saw that while theyare in the field the citizens are by 
                    the nature of the casecompelled to take their meals together 
                    for the sake of mutualprotection. He seems to me to have thought 
                    the world foolish in notunderstanding that all are always 
                    at war with one another; and if inwar there ought to be common 
                    meals and certain persons regularlyappointed under others 
                    to protect an army, they should be continued inpeace. For 
                    what men in general term peace would be said by him to beonly 
                    a name; in reality every city is in a natural state of war 
                    withevery other, not indeed proclaimed by heralds, but everlasting. 
                    And ifyou look closely, you will find that this was the intention 
                    of theCretan legislator; all institutions, private as well 
                    as public, werearranged by him with a view to war; in giving 
                    them he was under theimpression that no possessions or institutions 
                    are of any value to himwho is defeated in battle; for all 
                    the good things of the conqueredpass into the hands of the 
                    conquerors.</p>
                  <p>Ath. You appear to me, Stranger, to have been thoroughly 
                    trainedin the Cretan institutions, and to be well informed 
                    about them; willyou tell me a little more explicitly what 
                    is the principle ofgovernment which you would lay down? You 
                    seem to imagine that a wellgoverned state ought to be so ordered 
                    as to conquer all other statesin war: am I right in supposing 
                    this to be your meaning?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly; and our Lacedaemonian friend, if I am notmistaken, 
                    will agree with me.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Why, my good friend, how could any Lacedaemonian say 
                    anythingelse?</p>
                  <p>Ath. And is what you say applicable only to states, or also 
                    tovillages?</p>
                  <p>Cle. To both alike.</p>
                  <p>Ath. The case is the same?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And in the village will there be the same war of family 
                    againstfamily, and of individual against individual?</p>
                  <p>Cle. The same.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And should each man conceive himself to be his ownenemy:-what 
                    shall we say?</p>
                  <p>Cle. O Athenian Stranger-inhabitant of Attica I will not 
                    call you,for you seem to deserve rather to be named after 
                    the goddessherself, because you go back to first principles 
                    you have thrown alight upon the argument, and will now be 
                    better able to understandwhat I was just saying-that all men 
                    are publicly one another'senemies, and each man privately 
                    his own.</p>
                  <p>(Ath. My good sir, what do you mean?)--</p>
                  <p>Cle..... Moreover, there is a victory and defeat-the first 
                    andbest of victories, the lowest and worst of defeats-which 
                    each mangains or sustains at the hands, not of another, but 
                    of himself; thisshows that there is a war against ourselves 
                    going on within everyone of us.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us now reverse the order of the argument: Seeing 
                    that everyindividual is either his own superior or his own 
                    inferior, may wesay that there is the same principle in the 
                    house, the village, andthe state?</p>
                  <p>Cle. You mean that in each of them there is a principle ofsuperiority 
                    or inferiority to self?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Cle. You are quite right in asking the question, for there 
                    certainlyis such a principle, and above all in states; and 
                    the state in whichthe better citizens win a victory over the 
                    mob and over the inferiorclasses may be truly said to be better 
                    than itself, and may bejustly praised, where such a victory 
                    is gained, or censured in theopposite case.</p>
                  <p> Ath. Whether the better is ever really conquered by the 
                    worse, is aquestion which requires more discussion, and may 
                    be therefore left forthe present. But I now quite understand 
                    your meaning when you say thatcitizens who are of the same 
                    race and live in the same cities mayunjustly conspire, and 
                    having the superiority in numbers mayovercome and enslave 
                    the few just; and when they prevail, the statemay be truly 
                    called its own inferior and therefore bad; and whenthey are 
                    defeated, its own superior and therefore good.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Your remark, Stranger, is a paradox, and yet we cannot 
                    possiblydeny it.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Here is another case for consideration;-in a family 
                    there maybe several brothers, who are the offspring of a single 
                    pair; verypossibly the majority of them may be unjust, and 
                    the just may be ina minority.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very possibly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And you and I ought not to raise a question of words 
                    as towhether this family and household are rightly said to 
                    be superior whenthey conquer, and inferior when they are conquered; 
                    for we are not nowconsidering what may or may not be the proper 
                    or customary way ofspeaking, but we are considering the natural 
                    principles of right andwrong in laws.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What you say, Stranger, is most true.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Quite excellent, in my opinion, as far as we have gone.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Again; might there not be a judge over these brethren, 
                    ofwhom we were speaking?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Now, which would be the better judge-one who destroyed 
                    thebad and appointed the good to govern themselves; or one 
                    who, whileallowing the good to govern, let the bad live, and 
                    made themvoluntarily submit? Or third, I suppose, in the scale 
                    of excellencemight be placed a judge, who, finding the family 
                    distracted, notonly did not destroy any one, but reconciled 
                    them to one another forever after, and gave them laws which 
                    they mutually observed, and wasable to keep them friends.</p>
                  <p>Cle. The last would be by far the best sort of judge and 
                    legislator.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And yet the aim of all the laws which he gave would 
                    be thereverse of war.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And will he who constitutes the state and orders the 
                    life ofman have in view external war, or that kind of intestine 
                    war calledcivil, which no one, if he could prevent, would 
                    like to have occurringin his own state; and when occurring, 
                    every one would wish to bequit of as soon as possible?</p>
                  <p>Cle. He would have the latter chiefly in view.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And would he prefer that this civil war should be terminated 
                    bythe destruction of one of the parties, and by the victory 
                    of theother, or that peace and friendship should be re-established, 
                    andthat, being reconciled, they should give their attention 
                    to foreignenemies?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Every one would desire the latter in the case of his 
                    own state.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And would not that also be the desire of the legislator?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And would not every one always make laws for the sake 
                    of thebest?</p>
                  <p>Cle. To be sure.</p>
                  <p>Ath. But war, whether external or civil, is not the best, 
                    and theneed of either is to be deprecated; but peace with 
                    one another, andgood will, are best. Nor is the victory of 
                    the state over itself to beregarded as a really good thing, 
                    but as a necessity; a man might aswell say that the body was 
                    in the best state when sick and purged bymedicine, forgetting 
                    that there is also a state of the body whichneeds no purge. 
                    And in like manner no one can be a true statesman,whether 
                    he aims at the happiness of the individual or state, who looksonly, 
                    or first of all, to external warfare; nor will he ever be 
                    asound legislator who orders peace for the sake of war, and 
                    not war forthe sake of peace.</p>
                  <p>Cle. I suppose that there is truth, Stranger, in that remark 
                    ofyours; and yet I am greatly mistaken if war is not the entire 
                    aimand object of our own institutions, and also of the Lacedaemonian.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I dare say; but there is no reason why we should rudely 
                    quarrelwith one another about your legislators, instead of 
                    gently questioningthem, seeing that both we and they are equally 
                    in earnest. Pleasefollow me and the argument closely:-And 
                    first I will put forwardTyrtaeus, an Athenian by birth, but 
                    also a Spartan citizen, who of allmen was most eager about 
                    war: Well, he says, &quot;I sing not, I carenot, about any 
                    man, even if he were the richest of men, andpossessed every 
                    good (and then he gives a whole list of them), if hebe not 
                    at all times a brave warrior.&quot; I imagine that you, too, 
                    musthave heard his poems; our Lacedaemonian friend has probably 
                    heard morethan enough of them.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Cle. And they have found their way from Lacedaemon to Crete.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Come now and let us all join in asking this question 
                    ofTyrtaeus: O most divine poet, we will say to him, the excellent 
                    praisewhich you have bestowed on those who excel in war sufficientlyproves 
                    that you are wise and good, and I and Megillus and Cleiniasof 
                    Cnosus do, as I believe, entirely agree with you. But we shouldlike 
                    to be quite sure that we are speaking of the same men; tell 
                    us,then, do you agree with us in thinking that there are two 
                    kinds ofwar; or what would you say? A far inferior man to 
                    Tyrtaeus wouldhave no difficulty in replying quite truly, 
                    that war is of two kindsone which is universally called civil 
                    war, and is as we were justnow saying, of all wars the worst; 
                    the other, as we should alladmit, in which we fall out with 
                    other nations who are of adifferent race, is a far milder 
                    form of warfare.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly, far milder.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Well, now, when you praise and blame war in this high-flownstrain, 
                    whom are you praising or blaming, and to which kind of war 
                    areyou referring? I suppose that you must mean foreign war, 
                    if I am tojudge from expressions of yours in which you say 
                    that you abominatethose</p>
                  <p>Who refuse to look upon fields of blood, and will not draw 
                    nearand strike at their enemies.And we shall naturally go 
                    on to say to him-You, Tyrtaeus, as it seems,praise those who 
                    distinguish themselves in external and foreign war;and he 
                    must admit this.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Evidently.</p>
                  <p>Ath. They are good; but we say that there are still better 
                    men whosevirtue is displayed in the greatest of all battles. 
                    And we too havea poet whom we summon as a witness, Theognis, 
                    citizen of Megara inSicily:</p>
                  <p>Cyrnus, he who is faithful in a civil broil is worth his 
                    weight ingold and silver.And such an one is far better, as 
                    we affirm, than the other in amore difficult kind of war, 
                    much in the same degree as justice andtemperance and wisdom, 
                    when united with courage, are better thancourage only; for 
                    a man cannot be faithful and good in civil strifewithout having 
                    all virtue. But in the war of which Tyrtaeus speaks,many a 
                    mercenary soldier will take his stand and be ready to die 
                    athis post, and yet they are generally and almost without 
                    exceptioninsolent, unjust, violent men, and the most senseless 
                    of human beings.You will ask what the conclusion is, and what 
                    I am seeking to prove: Imaintain that the divine legislator 
                    of Crete, like any other who isworthy of consideration, will 
                    always and above all things in makinglaws have regard to the 
                    greatest virtue; which, according to Theognis,is loyalty in 
                    the hour of danger, and may be truly called perfectjustice. 
                    Whereas, that virtue which Tyrtaeus highly praises is wellenough, 
                    and was praised by the poet at the right time, yet in placeand 
                    dignity may be said to be only fourth rate.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Stranger, we are degrading our inspired lawgiver to 
                    a rankwhich is far beneath him.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Nay, I think that we degrade not him but ourselves, 
                    if weimagine that Lycurgus and Minos laid down laws both in 
                    Lacedaemonand Crete mainly with a view to war.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What ought we to say then?</p>
                  <p>Ath. What truth and what justice require of us, if I am notmistaken, 
                    when speaking in behalf of divine excellence;-at thelegislator 
                    when making his laws had in view not a part only, andthis 
                    the lowest part of virtue, but all virtue, and that he devisedclasses 
                    of laws answering to the kinds of virtue; not in the way inwhich 
                    modern inventors of laws make the classes, for they onlyinvestigate 
                    and offer laws whenever a want is felt, and one man hasa class 
                    of laws about allotments and heiresses, another aboutassaults; 
                    others about ten thousand other such matters. But wemaintain 
                    that the right way of examining into laws is to proceed as 
                    wehave now done, and I admired the spirit of your exposition; 
                    for youwere quite right in beginning with virtue, and saying 
                    that this wasthe aim of the giver of the law, but I thought 
                    that you went wrongwhen you added that all his legislation 
                    had a view only to a part, andthe least part of virtue, and 
                    this called forth my subsequent remarks.Will you allow me 
                    then to explain how I should have liked to haveheard you expound 
                    the matter?</p>
                  <p>Cle. By all means.</p>
                  <p>Ath. You ought to have said, Stranger-The Cretan laws are 
                    withreason famous among the Hellenes; for they fulfil the 
                    object oflaws, which is to make those who use them happy; 
                    and they confer everysort of good. Now goods are of two kinds: 
                    there are human and thereare divine goods, and the human hang 
                    upon the divine; and the statewhich attains the greater, at 
                    the same time acquires the less, or, nothaving the greater, 
                    has neither. Of the lesser goods the first ishealth, the second 
                    beauty, the third strength, including swiftnessin running 
                    and bodily agility generally, and the fourth is wealth, notthe 
                    blind god [Pluto], but one who is keen of sight, if only he 
                    haswisdom for his companion. For wisdom is chief and leader 
                    of the divinedass of goods, and next follows temperance; and 
                    from the union ofthese two with courage springs justice, and 
                    fourth in the scale ofvirtue is courage. All these naturally 
                    take precedence of the othergoods, and this is the order in 
                    which the legislator must placethem, and after them he will 
                    enjoin the rest of his ordinances onthe citizens with a view 
                    to these, the human looking to the divine,and the divine looking 
                    to their leader mind. Some of his ordinanceswill relate to 
                    contracts of marriage which they make one with another,and 
                    then to the procreation and education of children, both male 
                    andfemale; the duty of the lawgiver will be to take charge 
                    of hiscitizens, in youth and age, and at every time of life, 
                    and to givethem punishments and rewards; and in reference 
                    to all theirintercourse with one another, he ought to consider 
                    their pains andpleasures and desires, and the vehemence of 
                    all their passions; heshould keep a watch over them, and blame 
                    and praise them rightly bythe mouth of the laws themselves. 
                    Also with regard to anger andterror, and the other perturbations 
                    of the soul, which arise out ofmisfortune, and the deliverances 
                    from them which prosperity brings,and the experiences which 
                    come to men in diseases, or in war, orpoverty, or the opposite 
                    of these; in all these states he shoulddetermine and teach 
                    what is the good and evil of the condition ofeach. In the 
                    next place, the legislator has to be careful how thecitizens 
                    make their money and in what way they spend it, and to havean 
                    eye to their mutual contracts and dissolutions of contracts,whether 
                    voluntary or involuntary: he should see how they order allthis, 
                    and consider where justice as well as injustice is found or 
                    iswanting in their several dealings with one another; and 
                    honour thosewho obey the law, and impose fixed penalties on 
                    those who disobey,until the round of civil life is ended, 
                    and the time has come forthe consideration of the proper funeral 
                    rites and honours of the dead.And the lawgiver reviewing his 
                    work, will appoint guardians to presideover these things-some 
                    who walk by intelligence, others by trueopinion only, and 
                    then mind will bind together all his ordinancesand show them 
                    to be in harmony with temperance and justice, and notwith 
                    wealth or ambition. This is the spirit, Stranger, in which 
                    Iwas and am desirous that you should pursue the subject. And 
                    I wantto know the nature of all these things, and how they 
                    are arranged inthe laws of Zeus, as they are termed, and in 
                    those of the PythianApollo, which Minos and Lycurgus gave; 
                    and how the order of them isdiscovered to his eyes, who has 
                    experience in laws gained either bystudy or habit, although 
                    they are far from being self-evident to therest of mankind 
                    like ourselves.</p>
                  <p>Cle. How shall we proceed, Stranger?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I think that we must begin again as before, and firstconsider 
                    the habit of courage; and then we will go on and discussanother 
                    and then another form of virtue, if you please. In this way 
                    weshall have a model of the whole; and with these and similar 
                    discourseswe will beguile the way. And when we have gone through 
                    all thevirtues, we will show, by the grace of God, that the 
                    institutions ofwhich I was speaking look to virtue.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Very good; and suppose that you first criticize this 
                    praiser ofZeus and the laws of Crete.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I will try to criticize you and myself, as well as him, 
                    for theargument is a common concern. Tell me-were not first 
                    the syssitia, andsecondly the gymnasia, invented by your legislator 
                    with a view to war?</p>
                  <p>Meg. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And what comes third, and what fourth? For that, I think, 
                    isthe sort of enumeration which ought to be made of the remainingparts 
                    of virtue, no matter whether you call them parts or what theirname 
                    is, provided the meaning is clear.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Then I, or any other Lacedaemonian, would reply that 
                    hunting isthird in order.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us see if we can discover what comes fourth and 
                    fifth.</p>
                  <p>Meg. I think that I can get as far as the fouth head, which 
                    is thefrequent endurance of pain, exhibited among us Spartans 
                    in certainhand-to-hand fights; also in stealing with the prospect 
                    of getting agood beating; there is, too, the so-called Crypteia, 
                    or secretservice, in which wonderful endurance is shown-our 
                    people wanderover the whole country by day and by night, and 
                    even in winter havenot a shoe to their foot, and are without 
                    beds to lie upon, and haveto attend upon themselves. Marvellous, 
                    too, is the endurance which ourcitizens show in their naked 
                    exercises, contending against the violentsummer heat; and 
                    there are many similar practices, to speak of whichin detail 
                    would be endless.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Excellent, O Lacedaemonian Stranger. But how ought we 
                    to definecourage? Is it to be regarded only as a combat against 
                    fears andpains, or also against desires and pleasures, and 
                    againstflatteries; which exercise such a tremendous power, 
                    that they make thehearts even of respectable citizens to melt 
                    like wax?</p>
                  <p>Meg. I should say the latter.</p>
                  <p>Ath. In what preceded, as you will remember, our Cnosian 
                    friendwas speaking of a man or a city being inferior to themselves:-Were 
                    younot, Cleinias?</p>
                  <p>Cle. I was.</p>
                  <p> Ath. Now, which is in the truest sense inferior, the man 
                    who isovercome by pleasure or by pain?</p>
                  <p>Cle. I should say the man who is overcome by pleasure; for 
                    all mendeem him to be inferior in a more disgraceful sense, 
                    than the otherwho is overcome by pain.</p>
                  <p>Ath. But surely the lawgivers of Crete and Lacedaemon have 
                    notlegislated for a courage which is lame of one leg, able 
                    only to meetattacks which come from the left, but impotent 
                    against the insidiousflatteries which come from the right?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Able to meet both, I should say.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then let me once more ask, what institutions have you 
                    in eitherof your states which give a taste of pleasures, and 
                    do not avoidthem any more than they avoid pains; but which 
                    set a person in themidst of them, and compel or induce him 
                    by the prospect of reward toget the better of them? Where 
                    is an ordinance about pleasure similarto that about pain to 
                    be found in your laws? Tell me what there isof this nature 
                    among you:-What is there which makes your citizenequally brave 
                    against pleasure and pain, conquering what they ought toconquer, 
                    and superior to the enemies who are most dangerous andnearest 
                    home?</p>
                  <p>Meg. I was able to tell you, Stranger, many laws which were 
                    directedagainst pain; but I do not know that I can point out 
                    any great orobvious examples of similar institutions which 
                    are concerned withpleasure; there are some lesser provisions, 
                    however, which I mightmention.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Neither can I show anything of that sort which is at 
                    allequally prominent in the Cretan laws.</p>
                  <p>Ath. No wonder, my dear friends; and if, as is very likely, 
                    in oursearch after the true and good, one of us may have to 
                    censure the lawsof the others, we must not be offended, but 
                    take kindly what anothersays.</p>
                  <p>Cle. You are quite right, Athenian Stranger, and we will 
                    do as yousay.</p>
                  <p>Ath. At our time of life, Cleinias, there should be no feeling 
                    ofirritation.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly not.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I will not at present determine whether he who censures 
                    theCretan or Lacedaemonian polities is right or wrong. But 
                    I believe thatI can tell better than either of you what the 
                    many say about them. Forassuming that you have reasonably 
                    good laws, one of the best of themwill be the law forbidding 
                    any young men to enquire which of themare right or wrong; 
                    but with one mouth and one voice they must allagree that the 
                    laws are all good, for they came from God; and anyone who 
                    says the contrary is not to be listened to. But an old man 
                    whoremarks any defect in your laws may communicate his observation 
                    to aruler or to an equal in years when no young man is present.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Exactly so, Stranger; and like a diviner, although not 
                    there atthe time, you seem to me quite to have hit the meaning 
                    of thelegislator, and to say what is most true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. As there are no young men present, and the legislator 
                    has givenold men free licence, there will be no impropriety 
                    in our discussingthese very matters now that we are alone.</p>
                  <p>Cle. True. And therefore you may be as free as you like in 
                    yourcensure of our laws, for there is no discredit in knowing 
                    what iswrong; he who receives what is said in a generous and 
                    friendlyspirit will be all the better for it.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Very good; however, I am not going to say anything against 
                    yourlaws until to the best of my ability I have examined them, 
                    but I amgoing to raise doubts about them. For you are the 
                    only people known tous, whether Greek or barbarian, whom the 
                    legislator commanded toeschew all great pleasures and amusements 
                    and never to touch them;whereas in the matter of pains or 
                    fears which we have just beendiscussing, he thought that they 
                    who from infancy had always avoidedpains and fears and sorrows, 
                    when they were compelled to face themwould run away from those 
                    who were hardened in them, and wouldbecome their subjects. 
                    Now the legislator ought to have consideredthat this was equally 
                    true of pleasure; he should have said tohimself, that if our 
                    citizens are from their youth upward unacquaintedwith the 
                    greatest pleasures, and unused to endure amid the temptationsof 
                    pleasure, and are not disciplined to refrain from all thingsevil, 
                    the sweet feeling of pleasure will overcome them just as fearwould 
                    overcome the former class; and in another, and even a worsemanner, 
                    they will be the slaves of those who are able to endure amidpleasures, 
                    and have had the opportunity of enjoying them, they beingoften 
                    the worst of mankind. One half of their souls will be a slave,the 
                    other half free; and they will not be worthy to be called 
                    in thetrue sense men and freemen. Tell me whether you assent 
                    to my words?</p>
                  <p>Cle. On first hearing, what you say appears to be the truth; 
                    butto be hasty in coming to a conclusion about such important 
                    matterswould be very childish and simple.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Suppose, Cleinias and Megillus, that we consider the 
                    virtuewhich follows next of those which we intended to discuss 
                    (for aftercourage comes temperance), what institutions shall 
                    we find relating totemperance, either in Crete or Lacedaemon, 
                    which, like your militaryinstitutions, differ from those of 
                    any ordinary state.</p>
                  <p>Meg. That is not an easy question to answer; still I should 
                    say thatthe common meals and gymnastic exercises have been 
                    excellently devisedfor the promotion both of temperance and 
                    courage.</p>
                  <p>Ath. There seems to be a difficulty, Stranger, with regard 
                    tostates, in making words and facts coincide so that there 
                    can be nodispute about them. As in the human body, the regimen 
                    which doesgood in one way does harm in another; and we can 
                    hardly say that anyone course of treatment is adapted to a 
                    particular constitution. Nowthe gymnasia and common meals 
                    do a great deal of good, and yet theyare a source of evil 
                    in civil troubles; as is shown in the case of theMilesian, 
                    and Boeotian, and Thurian youth, among whom theseinstitutions 
                    seem always to have had a tendency to degrade the ancientand 
                    natural custom of love below the level, not only of man, but 
                    ofthe beasts. The charge may be fairly brought against your 
                    cities aboveall others, and is true also of most other states 
                    which especiallycultivate gymnastics. Whether such matters 
                    are to be regardedjestingly or seriously, I think that the 
                    pleasure is to be deemednatural which arises out of the intercourse 
                    between men and women; butthat the intercourse of men with 
                    men, or of women with women, iscontrary to nature, and that 
                    the bold attempt was originally due tounbridled lust. The 
                    Cretans are always accused of having inventedthe story of 
                    Ganymede and Zeus because they wanted to justifythemselves 
                    in the enjoyment of unnatural pleasures by the practiceof 
                    the god whom they believe to have been their lawgiver. Leavingthe 
                    story, we may observe that any speculation about laws turns 
                    almostentirely on pleasure and pain, both in states and in 
                    individuals:these are two fountains which nature lets flow, 
                    and he who drawsfrom them where and when, and as much as he 
                    ought, is happy; andthis holds of men and animals-of individuals 
                    as well as states; and hewho indulges in them ignorantly and 
                    at the wrong time, is thereverse of happy.</p>
                  <p>Meg. I admit, Stranger, that your words are well spoken, 
                    and Ihardly know what to say in answer to you; but still I 
                    think that theSpartan lawgiver was quite right in forbidding 
                    pleasure. Of the Cretanlaws, I shall leave the defence to 
                    my Cnosian friend. But the lawsof Sparta, in as far as they 
                    relate to pleasure, appear to me to bethe best in the world; 
                    for that which leads mankind in general intothe wildest pleasure 
                    and licence, and every other folly, the law hasclean driven 
                    out; and neither in the country nor in towns which areunder 
                    the control of Sparta, will you find revelries and the manyincitements 
                    of every kind of pleasure which accompany them; and anyone 
                    who meets a drunken and disorderly person, will immediately 
                    havehim most severely punished, and will not let him off on 
                    anypretence, not even at the time of a Dionysiac festival; 
                    although Ihave remarked that this may happen at your performances 
                    &quot;on the cart,&quot;as they are called; and among our 
                    Tarentine colonists I have seenthe whole city drunk at a Dionysiac 
                    festival; but nothing of thesort happens among us.</p>
                  <p>Ath. O Lacedaemonian Stranger, these festivities are praiseworthywhere 
                    there is a spirit of endurance, but are very senseless when 
                    theyare under no regulations. In order to retaliate, an Athenian 
                    hasonly to point out the licence which exists among your women. 
                    To allsuch accusations, whether they are brought against the 
                    Tarentines,or us, or you, there is one answer which exonerates 
                    the practice inquestion from impropriety. When a stranger 
                    expresses wonder at thesingularity of what he sees, any inhabitant 
                    will naturally answerhim:-Wonder not, O stranger; this is 
                    our custom, and you may verylikely have some other custom 
                    about the same things. Now we arespeaking, my friends, not 
                    about men in general, but about the meritsand defects of the 
                    lawgivers themselves. Let us then discourse alittle more at 
                    length about intoxication, which is a very importantsubject, 
                    and will seriously task the discrimination of the legislator.I 
                    am not speaking of drinking, or not drinking, wine at all, 
                    but ofintoxication. Are we to follow the custom of the Scythians, 
                    andPersians, and Carthaginians, and Celts, and Iberians, and 
                    Thracians,who are all warlike nations, or that of your countrymen, 
                    for they,as you say, altogether abstain? But the Scythians 
                    and Thracians,both men and women, drink unmixed wine, which 
                    they pour on theirgarments, and this they think a happy and 
                    glorious institution. ThePersians, again, are much given to 
                    other practices of luxury which youreject, but they have more 
                    moderation in them than the Thracians andScythians.</p>
                  <p>Meg. O best of men, we have only to take arms into our hands, 
                    and wesend all these nations flying before us.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Nay, my good friend, do not say that; there have been, 
                    as therealways will be, flights and pursuits of which no account 
                    can be given,and therefore we cannot say that victory or defeat 
                    in battle affordsmore than a doubtful proof of the goodness 
                    or badness of institutions.For when the greater states conquer 
                    and enslave the lesser, as theSyracusans have done the Locrians, 
                    who appear to be thebest-governed people in their part of 
                    the world, or as the Athenianshave done the Ceans (and there 
                    are ten thousand other instances of thesame sort of thing), 
                    all this is not to the point; let us endeavourrather to form 
                    a conclusion about each institution in itself and saynothing, 
                    at present, of victories and defeats. Let us only say thatsuch 
                    and such a custom is honourable, and another not. And firstpermit 
                    me to tell you how good and bad are to be estimated inreference 
                    to these very matters.</p>
                  <p>Meg. How do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. All those who are ready at a moment's notice to praise 
                    orcensure any practice which is matter of discussion, seem 
                    to me toproceed in a wrong way. Let me give you an illustration 
                    of what Imean:-You may suppose a person to be praising wheat 
                    as a good kindof food, whereupon another person instantly 
                    blames wheat, without everenquiring into its effect or use, 
                    or in what way, or to whom, orwith what, or in what state 
                    and how, wheat is to be given. And that isjust what we are 
                    doing in this discussion. At the very mention ofthe word intoxication, 
                    one side is ready with their praises and theother with their 
                    censures; which is absurd. For either side adducetheir witnesses 
                    and approvers, and some of us think that we speak withauthority 
                    because we have many witnesses; and others because theysee 
                    those who abstain conquering in battle, and this again is 
                    disputedby us. Now I cannot say that I shall be satisfied, 
                    if we go ondiscussing each of the remaining laws in the same 
                    way. And aboutthis very point of intoxication I should like 
                    to speak in another way,which I hold to be the right one; 
                    for if number is to be thecriterion, are there not myriads 
                    upon myriads of nations ready todispute the point with you, 
                    who are only two cities?</p>
                  <p>Meg. I shall gladly welcome any method of enquiry which is 
                    right.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let me put the matter thus:-Suppose a person to praise 
                    thekeeping of goats, and the creatures themselves as capital 
                    things tohave, and then some one who had seen goats feeding 
                    without agoatherd in cultivated spots, and doing mischief, 
                    were to censure agoat or any other animal who has no keeper, 
                    or a bad keeper, wouldthere be any sense or justice in such 
                    censure?</p>
                  <p>Meg. Certainly not.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Does a captain require only to have nautical knowledge 
                    in orderto be a good captain, whether he is sea-sick or not? 
                    What do you say?</p>
                  <p>Meg. I say that he is not a good captain if, although he 
                    havenautical skill, he is liable to sea-sickness.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And what would you say of the commander of an army? 
                    Will hebe able to command merely because he has military skill 
                    if he be acoward, who, when danger comes, is sick and drunk 
                    with fear?</p>
                  <p>Meg. Impossible.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And what if besides being a coward he has no skill?</p>
                  <p>Meg. He is a miserable fellow, not fit to be a commander 
                    of men, butonly of old women.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And what would you say of some one who blames or praises 
                    anysort of meeting which is intended by nature to have a ruler, 
                    and iswell enough when under his presidency? The critic, however, 
                    hasnever seen the society meeting together at an orderly feast 
                    underthe control of a president, but always without a ruler 
                    or with a badone:-when observers of this class praise or blame 
                    such meetings, arewe to suppose that what they say is of any 
                    value?</p>
                  <p>Meg. Certainly not, if they have never seen or been present 
                    atsuch a meeting when rightly ordered.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Reflect; may not banqueters and banquets be said toconstitute 
                    a kind of meeting?</p>
                  <p>Meg. Of course.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And did any one ever see this sort of convivial meeting 
                    rightlyordered? Of course you two will answer that you have 
                    never seen themat all, because they are not customary or lawful 
                    in your country;but I have come across many of them in many 
                    different places, andmoreover I have made enquiries about 
                    them wherever I went, as I maysay, and never did I see or 
                    hear of anything of the kind which wascarried on altogether 
                    rightly; in some few particulars they might beright, but in 
                    general they were utterly wrong.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What do you mean, Stranger, by this remark? Explain; 
                    For we, asyou say, from our inexperience in such matters, 
                    might very likelynot know, even if they came in our way, what 
                    was right or wrong insuch societies.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Likely enough; then let me try to be your instructor: 
                    You wouldacknowledge, would you not, that in all gatherings 
                    of man, kind, ofwhatever sort, there ought to be a leader?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly I should.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And we were saying just now, that when men are at war 
                    theleader ought to be a brave man?</p>
                  <p>Cle. We were.</p>
                  <p>Ath. The brave man is less likely than the coward to be disturbed 
                    byfears?</p>
                  <p>Cle. That again is true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And if there were a possibility of having a general 
                    of anarmy who was absolutely fearless and imperturbable, should 
                    we not byall means appoint him?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Assuredly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Now, however, we are speaking not of a general who is 
                    tocommand an army, when foe meets foe in time of war, but 
                    of one whois to regulate meetings of another sort, when friend 
                    meets friend intime of peace.</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And that sort of meeting, if attended with drunkenness, 
                    isapt to be unquiet.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly; the reverse of quiet.</p>
                  <p>Ath. In the first place, then, the revellers as well as the 
                    soldierswill require a ruler?</p>
                  <p>Cle. To be sure; no men more so.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And we ought, if possible, to provide them with a quiet 
                    ruler?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Of course.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And he should be a man who understands society; for 
                    his duty isto preserve the friendly feelings which exist among 
                    the company at thetime, and to increase them for the future 
                    by his use of the occasion.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Must we not appoint a sober man and a wise to be our 
                    masterof the revels? For if the ruler of drinkers be himself 
                    young anddrunken, and not over-wise, only by some special 
                    good fortune willhe be saved from doing some great evil.</p>
                  <p>Cle. It will be by a singular good fortune that he is saved.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Now suppose such associations to be framed in the best 
                    waypossible in states, and that some one blames the very fact 
                    of theirexistence-he may very likely be right. But if he blames 
                    a practicewhich he only sees very much mismanaged, he shows 
                    in the first placethat he is not aware of the mismanagement, 
                    and also not aware thateverything done in this way will turn 
                    out to be wrong, because donewithout the superintendence of 
                    a sober ruler. Do you not see that adrunken pilot or a drunken 
                    ruler of any sort will ruin ship,chariot, army-anything, in 
                    short, of which he has the direction?</p>
                  <p>Cle. The last remark is very true, Stranger; and I see quite 
                    clearlythe advantage of an army having a good leader-he will 
                    give victoryin war to his followers, which is a very great 
                    advantage; and so ofother things. But I do not see any similar 
                    advantage which eitherindividuals or states gain from the 
                    good management of a feast; andI want you to tell me what 
                    great good will be effected, supposing thatthis drinking ordinance 
                    is duly established.</p>
                  <p>Ath. If you mean to ask what great good accrues to the state 
                    fromthe right training of a single youth, or of a single chorus-when 
                    thequestion is put in that form, we cannot deny that the good 
                    is not verygreat in any particular instance. But if you ask 
                    what is the good ofeducation in general, the answer is easy-that 
                    education makes goodmen, and that good men act nobly, and 
                    conquer their enemies in battle,because they are good. Education 
                    certainly gives victory, althoughvictory sometimes produces 
                    forgetfulness of education; for many havegrown insolent from 
                    victory in war, and this insolence hasengendered in them innumerable 
                    evils; and many a victory has beenand will be suicidal to 
                    the victors; but education is never suicidal.</p>
                  <p>Cle. You seem to imply, my friend, that convivial meetings, 
                    whenrightly ordered, are an important element of education.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Certainly I do.</p>
                  <p>Cle. And can you show that what you have been saying is true?</p>
                  <p>Ath. To be absolutely sure of the truth of matters concerningwhich 
                    there are many opinions, is an attribute of the Gods not givento 
                    man, Stranger; but I shall be very happy to tell you what 
                    Ithink, especially as we are now proposing to enter on a discussionconcerning 
                    laws and constitutions.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Your opinion, Stranger, about the questions which are 
                    now beingraised, is precisely what we want to hear.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Very good; I will try to find a way of explaining my 
                    meaning,and you shall try to have the gift of understanding 
                    me. But firstlet me make an apology. The Athenian citizen 
                    is reputed among allthe Hellenes to be a great talker, whereas 
                    Sparta is renowned forbrevity, and the Cretans have more wit 
                    than words. Now I am afraidof appearing to elicit a very long 
                    discourse out of very smallmaterials. For drinking indeed 
                    may appear to be a slight matter, andyet is one which cannot 
                    be rightly ordered according to nature,without correct principles 
                    of music; these are necessary to anyclear or satisfactory 
                    treatment of the subject, and music again runsup into education 
                    generally, and there is much to be said about allthis. What 
                    would you say then to leaving these matters for thepresent, 
                    and passing on to some other question of law?</p>
                  <p>Meg. O Athenian Stranger, let me tell you what perhaps you 
                    do notknow, that our family is the proxenus of your state. 
                    I imagine thatfrom their earliest youth all boys, when they 
                    are told that they arethe proxeni of a particular state, feel 
                    kindly towards their secondand this has certainly been my 
                    own feeling. I can well remember fromthe days of my boyhood, 
                    how, when any Lacedaemonians praised or blamedthe Athenians, 
                    they used to say to me-&quot;See, Megillus, how ill or howwell,&quot; 
                    as the case might be, &quot;has your state treated us&quot;; 
                    and havingalways had to fight your battles against detractors 
                    when I heard youassailed, I became warmly attached to you. 
                    And I always like to hearthe Athenian tongue spoken; the common 
                    saying is quite true, that agood Athenian is more than ordinarily 
                    good, for he is the only man whois freely and genuinely good 
                    by the divine inspiration of his ownnature, and is not manufactured. 
                    Therefore be assured that I shalllike to hear you say whatever 
                    you have to say.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes, Stranger; and when you have heard me speak, say 
                    boldlywhat is in your thoughts. Let me remind you of a tie 
                    which unitesyou to Crete. You must have heard here the story 
                    of the prophetEpimenides, who was of my family, and came to 
                    Athens ten yearsbefore the Persian war, in accordance with 
                    the response of the Oracle,and offered certain sacrifices 
                    which the God commanded. TheAthenians were at that time in 
                    dread of the Persian invasion; and hesaid that for ten years 
                    they would not come, and that when theycame, they would go 
                    away again without accomplishing any of theirobjects, and 
                    would suffer more evil than they inflicted. At thattime my 
                    forefathers formed ties of hospitality with you; thusancient 
                    is the friendship which I and my parents have had for you.</p>
                  <p>Ath. You seem to be quite ready to listen; and I am also 
                    ready toperform as much as I can of an almost impossible task, 
                    which I willnevertheless attempt. At the outset of the discussion, 
                    let me definethe nature and power of education; for this is 
                    the way by which ourargument must travel onwards to the God 
                    Dionysus.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Let us proceed, if you please.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Well, then, if I tell you what are my notions of education,will 
                    you consider whether they satisfy you?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Let us hear.</p>
                  <p>Ath. According to my view, any one who would be good at anythingmust 
                    practise that thing from his youth upwards, both in sport 
                    andearnest, in its several branches: for example, he who is 
                    to be agood builder, should play at building children's houses; 
                    he who isto be a good husbandman, at tilling the ground; and 
                    those who have thecare of their education should provide them 
                    when young with mimictools. They should learn beforehand the 
                    knowledge which they willafterwards require for their art. 
                    For example, the future carpentershould learn to measure or 
                    apply the line in play; and the futurewarrior should learn 
                    riding, or some other exercise, for amusement,and the teacher 
                    should endeavour to direct the children's inclinationsand 
                    pleasures, by the help of amusements, to their final aim inlife. 
                    The most important part of education is right training in 
                    thenursery. The soul of the child in his play should be guided 
                    to thelove of that sort of excellence in which when he grows 
                    up to manhoodhe will have to be perfected. Do you agree with 
                    me thus far?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then let us not leave the meaning of education ambiguous 
                    orill-defined. At present, when we speak in terms of praise 
                    or blameabout the bringing-up of each person, we call one 
                    man educated andanother uneducated, although the uneducated 
                    man may be sometimesvery well educated for the calling of 
                    a retail trader, or of a captainof a ship, and the like. For 
                    we are not speaking of education inthis narrower sense, but 
                    of that other education in virtue fromyouth upwards, which 
                    makes a man eagerly pursue the ideal perfectionof citizenship, 
                    and teaches him how rightly to rule and how to obey.This is 
                    the only education which, upon our view, deserves the name;that 
                    other sort of training, which aims at the acquisition of wealthor 
                    bodily strength, or mere cleverness apart from intelligence 
                    andjustice, is mean and illiberal, and is not worthy to be 
                    callededucation at all. But let us not quarrel with one another 
                    about aword, provided that the proposition which has just 
                    been granted holdgood: to wit, that those who are rightly 
                    educated generally becomegood men. Neither must we cast a 
                    slight upon education, which is thefirst and fairest thing 
                    that the best of men can ever have, and which,though liable 
                    to take a wrong direction, is capable of reformation.And this 
                    work of reformation is the great business of every manwhile 
                    he lives.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true; and we entirely agree with you.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And we agreed before that they are good men who are 
                    able torule themselves, and bad men who are not.</p>
                  <p>Cle. You are quite right.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let me now proceed, if I can, to clear up the subject 
                    alittle further by an illustration which I will offer you.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Proceed.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Do we not consider each of ourselves to be one?</p>
                  <p>Cle. We do.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And each one of us has in his bosom two counsellors, 
                    bothfoolish and also antagonistic; of which we call the one 
                    pleasure,and the other pain.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Exactly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Also there are opinions about the future, which have 
                    thegeneral name of expectations; and the specific name of 
                    fear, whenthe expectation is of pain; and of hope, when of 
                    pleasure; andfurther, there is reflection about the good or 
                    evil of them, and this,when embodied in a decree by the State, 
                    is called Law.</p>
                  <p>Cle. I am hardly able to follow you; proceed, however, as 
                    if I were.</p>
                  <p>Meg. I am in the like case.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us look at the matter thus: May we not conceive 
                    each ofus living beings to be a puppet of the Gods, either 
                    their playthingonly, or created with a purpose-which of the 
                    two we cannot certainlyknow? But we do know, that these affections 
                    in us are like cords andstrings, which pull us different and 
                    opposite ways, and to oppositeactions; and herein lies the 
                    difference between virtue and vice.According to the argument 
                    there is one among these cords which everyman ought to grasp 
                    and never let go, but to pull with it against allthe rest; 
                    and this is the sacred and golden cord of reason, calledby 
                    us the common law of the State; there are others which are 
                    hard andof iron, but this one is soft because golden; and 
                    there are severalother kinds. Now we ought always to cooperate 
                    with the lead of thebest, which is law. For inasmuch as reason 
                    is beautiful and gentle,and not violent, her rule must needs 
                    have ministers in order to helpthe golden principle in vanquishing 
                    the other principles. And thus themoral of the tale about 
                    our being puppets will not have been lost, andthe meaning 
                    of the expression &quot;superior or inferior to a man's self&quot;will 
                    become clearer; and the individual, attaining to right reasonin 
                    this matter of pulling the strings of the puppet, should liveaccording 
                    to its rule; while the city, receiving the same from somegod 
                    or from one who has knowledge of these things, should embody 
                    it ina law, to be her guide in her dealings with herself and 
                    with otherstates. In this way virtue and vice will be more 
                    clearly distinguishedby us. And when they have become clearer, 
                    education and otherinstitutions will in like manner become 
                    clearer; and in particularthat question of convivial entertainment, 
                    which may seem, perhaps,to have been a very trifling matter, 
                    and to have taken a great manymore words than were necessary.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Perhaps, however, the theme may turn out not to be unworthyof 
                    the length of discourse.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Very good; let us proceed with any enquiry which really 
                    bearson our present object.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Proceed.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Suppose that we give this puppet of ours drink-what 
                    will be theeffect on him?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Having what in view do you ask that question?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Nothing as yet; but I ask generally, when the puppet 
                    is broughtto the drink, what sort of result is likely to follow. 
                    I willendeavour to explain my meaning more clearly: what I 
                    am now askingis this-Does the drinking of wine heighten and 
                    increase pleasuresand pains, and passions and loves?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very greatly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And are perception and memory, and opinion and prudence,heightened 
                    and increased? Do not these qualities entirely desert a manif 
                    he becomes saturated with drink?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes, they entirely desert him.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Does he not return to the state of soul in which he 
                    was whena young child?</p>
                  <p>Cle. He does.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then at that time he will have the least control over 
                    himself?</p>
                  <p>Cle. The least.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And will he not be in a most wretched plight?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Most wretched.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then not only an old man but also a drunkard becomes 
                    a secondtime a child?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Well said, Stranger.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Is there any argument which will prove to us that we 
                    ought toencourage the taste for drinking instead of doing 
                    all we can toavoid it?</p>
                  <p>Cle. I suppose that there is; you at any rate, were just 
                    nowsaying that you were ready to maintain such a doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Ath. True, I was; and I am ready still, seeing that you have 
                    bothdeclared that you are anxious to hear me.</p>
                  <p>Cle. To sure we are, if only for the strangeness of the paradox,which 
                    asserts that a man ought of his own accord to plunge intoutter 
                    degradation.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Are you speaking of the soul?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And what would you say about the body, my friend? Are 
                    you notsurprised at any one of his own accord bringing upon 
                    himselfdeformity, leanness, ugliness, decrepitude?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Yet when a man goes of his own accord to a doctor's 
                    shop, andtakes medicine, is he not aware that soon, and for 
                    many daysafterwards, he will be in a state of body which he 
                    would die ratherthan accept as the permanent condition of 
                    his life? Are not thosewho train in gymnasia, at first beginning 
                    reduced to a state ofweakness?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes, all that is well known.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Also that they go of their own accord for the sake of 
                    thesubsequent benefit?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very good.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And we may conceive this to be true in the same way 
                    of otherpractices?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And the same view may be taken of the pastime of drinking 
                    wine,if we are right in supposing that the same good effect 
                    follows?</p>
                  <p>Cle. To be sure.</p>
                  <p>Ath. If such convivialities should turn out to have any advantageequal 
                    in importance to that of gymnastic, they are in their verynature 
                    to be preferred to mere bodily exercise, inasmuch as theyhave 
                    no accompaniment of pain.</p>
                  <p>Cle. True; but I hardly think that we shall be able to discoverany 
                    such benefits to be derived from them.</p>
                  <p>Ath. That is just what we must endeavour to show. And let 
                    me ask youa question:-Do we not distinguish two kinds of fear, 
                    which are verydifferent?</p>
                  <p>Cle. What are they?</p>
                  <p>Ath. There is the fear of expected evil.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes.</p>
                  <p> Ath. And there is the fear of an evil reputation; we are 
                    afraidof being thought evil, because we do or say some dishonourablething, 
                    which fear we and all men term shame.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. These are the two fears, as I called them; one of which 
                    isthe opposite of pain and other fears, and the opposite also 
                    of thegreatest and most numerous sort of pleasures.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And does not the legislator and every one who is good 
                    foranything, hold this fear in the greatest honour? This is 
                    what he termsreverence, and the confidence which is the reverse 
                    of this he termsinsolence; and the latter he always deems 
                    to be a very great evil bothto individuals and to states.</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Does not this kind of fear preserve us in many importantways? 
                    What is there which so surely gives victory and safety in 
                    war?For there are two things which give victory-confidence 
                    before enemies,and fear of disgrace before friends.</p>
                  <p>Cle. There are.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then each of us should be fearless and also fearful; 
                    and why weshould be either has now been determined.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And when we want to make any one fearless, we and the 
                    law bringhim face to face with many fears.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Clearly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And when we want to make him rightly fearful, must we 
                    notintroduce him to shameless pleasures, and train him to 
                    take up armsagainst them, and to overcome them? Or does this 
                    principle apply tocourage only, and must he who would be perfect 
                    in valour fight againstand overcome his own natural character-since 
                    if he be unpractisedand inexperienced in such conflicts, he 
                    will not be half the man whichhe might have been-and are we 
                    to suppose, that with temperance it isotherwise, and that 
                    he who has never fought with the shameless andunrighteous 
                    temptations of his pleasures and lusts, and conqueredthem, 
                    in earnest and in play, by word, deed, and act, will still 
                    beperfectly temperate?</p>
                  <p>Cle. A most unlikely supposition.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Suppose that some God had given a fear-potion to men, 
                    andthat the more a man drank of this the more he regarded 
                    himself atevery draught as a child of misfortune, and that 
                    he fearedeverything happening or about to happen to him; and 
                    that at last themost courageous of men utterly lost his presence 
                    of mind for a time,and only came to himself again when he 
                    had slept off the influenceof the draught.</p>
                  <p>Cle. But has such a draught, Stranger, ever really been knownamong 
                    men?</p>
                  <p>Ath. No; but, if there had been, might not such a draught 
                    havebeen of use to the legislator as a test of courage? Might 
                    we not goand say to him, &quot;O legislator, whether you are 
                    legislating for theCretan, or for any other state, would you 
                    not like to have atouchstone of the courage and cowardice 
                    of your citizens?&quot;</p>
                  <p>Cle. &quot;I should,&quot; will be the answer of every one.</p>
                  <p>Ath. &quot;And you would rather have a touchstone in which 
                    there is norisk and no great danger than the reverse?&quot;</p>
                  <p>Cle. In that proposition every one may safely agree.</p>
                  <p>Ath. &quot;And in order to make use of the draught, you would 
                    lead themamid these imaginary terrors, and prove them, when 
                    the affection offear was working upon them, and compel them 
                    to be fearless,exhorting and admonishing them; and also honouring 
                    them, butdishonouring any one who will not be persuaded by 
                    you to be in allrespects such as you command him; and if he 
                    underwent the trial welland manfully, you would let him go 
                    unscathed; but if ill, you wouldinflict a punishment upon 
                    him? Or would you abstain from using thepotion altogether, 
                    although you have no reason for abstaining?&quot;</p>
                  <p>Cle. He would be certain, Stranger, to use the potion.</p>
                  <p>Ath. This would be a mode of testing and training which would 
                    bewonderfully easy in comparison with those now in use, and 
                    might beapplied to a single person, or to a few, or indeed 
                    to any number;and he would do well who provided himself with 
                    the potion only, ratherthan with any number of other things, 
                    whether he preferred to be byhimself in solitude, and there 
                    contend with his fears, because hewas ashamed to be seen by 
                    the eye of man until he was perfect; ortrusting to the force 
                    of his own nature and habits, and believing thathe had been 
                    already disciplined sufficiently, he did not hesitate totrain 
                    himself in company with any number of others, and display 
                    hispower in conquering the irresistible change effected by 
                    thedraught-his virtue being such, that he never in any instance 
                    fell intoany great unseemliness, but was always himself, and 
                    left off before hearrived at the last cup, fearing that he, 
                    like all other men, might beovercome by the potion.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes, Stranger, in that last case, too, he might equally 
                    showhis self-control.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us return to the lawgiver, and say to him:-&quot;Well, 
                    lawgiver,there is certainly no such fear-potion which man 
                    has either receivedfrom the Gods or himself discovered; for 
                    witchcraft has no place atour board. But is there any potion 
                    which might serve as a test ofoverboldness and excessive and 
                    indiscreet boasting?</p>
                  <p>Cle. I suppose that he will say, Yes-meaning that wine is 
                    such apotion.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Is not the effect of this quite the opposite of the 
                    effect ofthe other? When a man drinks wine he begins to be 
                    better pleasedwith himself, and the more he drinks the more 
                    he is filled full ofbrave hopes, and conceit of his power, 
                    and at last the string of histongue is loosened, and fancying 
                    himself wise, he is brimming overwith lawlessness, and has 
                    no more fear or respect, and is ready todo or say anything.</p>
                  <p>Cle. I think that every one will admit the truth of yourdescription.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Now, let us remember, as we were saying, that there 
                    are twothings which should be cultivated in the soul: first, 
                    the greatestcourage; secondly, the greatest fear-</p>
                  <p>Cle. Which you said to be characteristic of reverence, if 
                    I am notmistaken.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Thank you for reminding me. But now, as the habit of 
                    courageand fearlessness is to be trained amid fears, let us 
                    considerwhether the opposite quality is not also to be trained 
                    amongopposites.</p>
                  <p>Cle. That is probably the case.</p>
                  <p>Ath. There are times and seasons at which we are by nature 
                    more thancommonly valiant and bold; now we ought to train 
                    ourselves on theseoccasions to be as free from impudence and 
                    shamelessness aspossible, and to be afraid to say or suffer 
                    or do anything that isbase.</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Are not the moments in which we are apt to be bold andshameless 
                    such as these?-when we are under the influence of anger,love, 
                    pride, ignorance, avarice, cowardice? or when wealth, beauty,strength, 
                    and all the intoxicating workings of pleasure madden us?What 
                    is better adapted than the festive use of wine, in the firstplace 
                    to test, and in the second place to train the character of 
                    aman, if care be taken in the use of it? What is there cheaper, 
                    or moreinnocent? For do but consider which is the greater 
                    risk:-Would yourather test a man of a morose and savage nature, 
                    which is the sourceof ten thousand acts of injustice, by making 
                    bargains with him at arisk to yourself, or by having him as 
                    a companion at the festival ofDionysus? Or would you, if you 
                    wanted to apply a touchstone to a manwho is prone to love, 
                    entrust your wife, or your sons, or daughters tohim, perilling 
                    your dearest interests in order to have a view of thecondition 
                    of his soul? I might mention numberless cases, in whichthe 
                    advantage would be manifest of getting to know a character 
                    insport, and without paying dearly for experience. And I do 
                    notbelieve that either a Cretan, or any other man, will doubt 
                    that such atest is a fair test, and safer, cheaper, and speedier 
                    than any other.</p>
                  <p>Cle. That is certainly true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And this knowledge of the natures and habits of men's 
                    soulswill be of the greatest use in that art which has the 
                    management ofthem; and that art, if I am not mistaken, is 
                    politics.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Exactly so.</p>

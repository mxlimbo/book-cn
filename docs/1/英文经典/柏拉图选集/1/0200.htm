                  <p><br>
                    THE Republic of Plato is the longest of his works with the 
                    exceptionof the Laws, and is certainly the greatest of them. 
                    There are nearerapproaches to modern metaphysics in the Philebus 
                    and in the Sophist;the Politicus or Statesman is more ideal; 
                    the form and institutions ofthe State are more clearly drawn 
                    out in the Laws; as works of art, theSymposium and the Protagoras 
                    are of higher excellence. But no otherDialogue of Plato has 
                    the same largeness of view and the sameperfection of style; 
                    no other shows an equal knowledge of the world,or contains 
                    more of those thoughts which are new as well as old, andnot 
                    of one age only but of all. Nowhere in Plato is there a deeperirony 
                    or a greater wealth of humor or imagery, or more dramatic 
                    power.Nor in any other of his writings is the attempt made 
                    to interweavelife and speculation, or to connect politics 
                    with philosophy. TheRepublic is the centre around which the 
                    other Dialogues may begrouped; here philosophy reaches the 
                    highest point to which ancientthinkers ever attained. Plato 
                    among the Greeks, like Bacon among themoderns, was the first 
                    who conceived a method of knowledge, althoughneither of them 
                    always distinguished the bare outline or form from thesubstance 
                    of truth; and both of them had to be content with anabstraction 
                    of science which was not yet realized. He was the greatestmetaphysical 
                    genius whom the world has seen; and in him, more thanin any 
                    other ancient thinker, the germs of future knowledge arecontained. 
                    The sciences of logic and psychology, which have suppliedso 
                    many instruments of thought to after-ages, are based upon 
                    theanalyses of Socrates and Plato. The principles of definition, 
                    thelaw of contradiction, the fallacy of arguing in a circle, 
                    thedistinction between the essence and accidents of a thing 
                    or notion,between means and ends, between causes and conditions; 
                    also thedivision of the mind into the rational, concupiscent, 
                    and irascibleelements, or of pleasures and desires into necessary 
                    and unnecessary--these and other great forms of thought are 
                    all of them to be foundin the Republic, and were probably 
                    first invented by Plato. Thegreatest of all logical truths, 
                    and the one of which writers onphilosophy are most apt to 
                    lose sight, the difference between wordsand things, has been 
                    most strenuously insisted on by him, althoughhe has not always 
                    avoided the confusion of them in his own writings.But he does 
                    not bind up truth in logical formulae, --logic is stillveiled 
                    in metaphysics; and the science which he imagines to&quot;contemplate 
                    all truth and all existence&quot; is very unlike thedoctrine 
                    of the syllogism which Aristotle claims to have discovered.</p>
                  <p>Neither must we forget that the Republic is but the third 
                    part ofa still larger design which was to have included an 
                    ideal history ofAthens, as well as a political and physical 
                    philosophy. The fragmentof the Critias has given birth to 
                    a world-famous fiction, secondonly in importance to the tale 
                    of Troy and the legend of Arthur; andis said as a fact to 
                    have inspired some of the early navigators of thesixteenth 
                    century. This mythical tale, of which the subject was ahistory 
                    of the wars of the Athenians against the Island of Atlantis,is 
                    supposed to be founded upon an unfinished poem of Solon, to 
                    whichit would have stood in the same relation as the writings 
                    of thelogographers to the poems of Homer. It would have told 
                    of a strugglefor Liberty, intended to represent the conflict 
                    of Persia andHellas. We may judge from the noble commencement 
                    of the Timaeus,from the fragment of the Critias itself, and 
                    from the third book ofthe Laws, in what manner Plato would 
                    have treated this highargument. We can only guess why the 
                    great design was abandoned;perhaps because Plato became sensible 
                    of some incongruity in afictitious history, or because he 
                    had lost his interest in it, orbecause advancing years forbade 
                    the completion of it; and we mayplease ourselves with the 
                    fancy that had this imaginary narrative everbeen finished, 
                    we should have found Plato himself sympathizing withthe struggle 
                    for Hellenic independence, singing a hymn of triumph overMarathon 
                    and Salamis, perhaps making the reflection of Herodotus wherehe 
                    contemplates the growth of the Athenian empire--&quot;How 
                    brave athing is freedom of speech, which has made the Athenians 
                    so far exceedevery other state of Hellas in greatness!&quot; 
                    or, more probably,attributing the victory to the ancient good 
                    order of Athens and to thefavor of Apollo and Athene.</p>
                  <p>Again, Plato may be regarded as the &quot;captain&quot; ('arhchegoz') 
                    orleader of a goodly band of followers; for in the Republic 
                    is to befound the original of Cicero's De Republica, of St. 
                    Augustine's Cityof God, of the Utopia of Sir Thomas More, 
                    and of the numerous otherimaginary States which are framed 
                    upon the same model. The extent towhich Aristotle or the Aristotelian 
                    school were indebted to him in thePolitics has been little 
                    recognized, and the recognition is the morenecessary because 
                    it is not made by Aristotle himself. The twophilosophers had 
                    more in common than they were conscious of; andprobably some 
                    elements of Plato remain still undetected inAristotle. In 
                    English philosophy too, many affinities may be traced,not 
                    only in the works of the Cambridge Platonists, but in greatoriginal 
                    writers like Berkeley or Coleridge, to Plato and his ideas.That 
                    there is a truth higher than experience, of which the mindbears 
                    witness to herself, is a conviction which in our owngeneration 
                    has been enthusiastically asserted, and is perhapsgaining 
                    ground. Of the Greek authors who at the Renaissance broughta 
                    new life into the world Plato has had the greatest influence. 
                    TheRepublic of Plato is also the first treatise upon education, 
                    ofwhich the writings of Milton and Locke, Rousseau, Jean Paul, 
                    andGoethe are the legitimate descendants. Like Dante or Bunyan, 
                    he hasa revelation of another life; like Bacon, he is profoundly 
                    impressedwith the un unity of knowledge; in the early Church 
                    he exercised areal influence on theology, and at the Revival 
                    of Literature onpolitics. Even the fragments of his words 
                    when &quot;repeated atsecond-hand&quot; have in all ages ravished 
                    the hearts of men, who haveseen reflected in them their own 
                    higher nature. He is the father ofidealism in philosophy, 
                    in politics, in literature. And many of thelatest conceptions 
                    of modern thinkers and statesmen, such as the unityof knowledge, 
                    the reign of law, and the equality of the sexes, havebeen 
                    anticipated in a dream by him.</p>
                  <p>ARGUMENT</p>
                  <p>The argument of the Republic is the search after Justice, 
                    the natureof which is first hinted at by Cephalus, the just 
                    and blameless oldman --then discussed on the basis of proverbial 
                    morality by Socratesand Polemarchus --then caricatured by 
                    Thrasymachus and partiallyexplained by Socrates --reduced 
                    to an abstraction by Glaucon andAdeimantus, and having become 
                    invisible in the individual reappears atlength in the ideal 
                    State which is constructed by Socrates. Thefirst care of the 
                    rulers is to be education, of which an outline isdrawn after 
                    the old Hellenic model, providing only for an improvedreligion 
                    and morality, and more simplicity in music and gymnastic, 
                    amanlier strain of poetry, and greater harmony of the individual 
                    andthe State. We are thus led on to the conception of a higher 
                    State,in which &quot;no man calls anything his own,&quot; 
                    and in which there isneither &quot;marrying nor giving in 
                    marriage,&quot; and &quot;kings arephilosophers&quot; and 
                    &quot;philosophers are kings;&quot; and there is another andhigher 
                    education, intellectual as well as moral and religious, ofscience 
                    as well as of art, and not of youth only but of the whole 
                    oflife. Such a State is hardly to be realized in this world 
                    and wouldquickly degenerate. To the perfect ideal succeeds 
                    the government ofthe soldier and the lover of honor, this 
                    again declining intodemocracy, and democracy into tyranny, 
                    in an imaginary but regularorder having not much resemblance 
                    to the actual facts. When &quot;the wheelhas come full circle&quot; 
                    we do not begin again with a new period of humanlife; but 
                    we have passed from the best to the worst, and there we end.The 
                    subject is then changed and the old quarrel of poetry andphilosophy 
                    which had been more lightly treated in the earlier books ofthe 
                    Republic is now resumed and fought out to a conclusion. Poetryis 
                    discovered to be an imitation thrice removed from the truth, 
                    andHomer, as well as the dramatic poets, having been condemned 
                    as animitator, is sent into banishment along with them. And 
                    the idea of theState is supplemented by the revelation of 
                    a future life.</p>
                  <p>The division into books, like all similar divisions, is probablylater 
                    than the age of Plato. The natural divisions are five in number;--(1) 
                    Book I and the first half of Book II down to the paragraphbeginning, 
                    &quot;I had always admired the genius of Glaucon andAdeimantus,&quot; 
                    which is introductory; the first book containing arefutation 
                    of the popular and sophistical notions of justice, andconcluding, 
                    like some of the earlier Dialogues, without arriving atany 
                    definite result. To this is appended a restatement of the 
                    natureof justice according to common opinion, and an answer 
                    is demanded tothe question --What is justice, stripped of 
                    appearances? The seconddivision (2) includes the remainder 
                    of the second and the whole of thethird and fourth books, 
                    which are mainly occupied with theconstruction of the first 
                    State and the first education. The thirddivision (3) consists 
                    of the fifth, sixth, and seventh books, in whichphilosophy 
                    rather than justice is the subject of inquiry, and thesecond 
                    State is constructed on principles of communism and ruled 
                    byphilosophers, and the contemplation of the idea of good 
                    takes theplace of the social and political virtues. In the 
                    eighth and ninthbooks (4) the perversions of States and of 
                    the individuals whocorrespond to them are reviewed in succession; 
                    and the nature ofpleasure and the principle of tyranny are 
                    further analyzed in theindividual man. The tenth book (5) 
                    is the conclusion of the whole,in which the relations of philosophy 
                    to poetry are finally determined,and the happiness of the 
                    citizens in this life, which has now beenassured, is crowned 
                    by the vision of another.</p>
                  <p>Or a more general division into two parts may be adopted; 
                    thefirst (Books I - IV) containing the description of a State 
                    framedgenerally in accordance with Hellenic notions of religion 
                    andmorality, while in the second (Books V - X) the Hellenic 
                    State istransformed into an ideal kingdom of philosophy, of 
                    which all othergovernments are the perversions. These two 
                    points of view are reallyopposed, and the opposition is only 
                    veiled by the genius of Plato. TheRepublic, like the Phaedrus, 
                    is an imperfect whole; the higher lightof philosophy breaks 
                    through the regularity of the Hellenic temple,which at last 
                    fades away into the heavens. Whether this imperfectionof structure 
                    arises from an enlargement of the plan; or from theimperfect 
                    reconcilement in the writer's own mind of the strugglingelements 
                    of thought which are now first brought together by him; or,perhaps, 
                    from the composition of the work at different times --arequestions, 
                    like the similar question about the Iliad and theOdyssey, 
                    which are worth asking, but which cannot have a distinctanswer. 
                    In the age of Plato there was no regular mode ofpublication, 
                    and an author would have the less scruple in alteringor adding 
                    to a work which was known only to a few of his friends.There 
                    is no absurdity in supposing that he may have laid his laborsaside 
                    for a time, or turned from one work to another; and suchinterruptions 
                    would be more likely to occur in the case of a long thanof 
                    a short writing. In all attempts to determine the chronologicalhe 
                    order of the Platonic writings on internal evidence, thisuncertainty 
                    about any single Dialogue being composed at one time isa disturbing 
                    element, which must be admitted to affect longer works,such 
                    as the Republic and the Laws, more than shorter ones. But, 
                    on theother hand, the seeming discrepancies of the Republic 
                    may only ariseout of the discordant elements which the philosopher 
                    has attemptedto unite in a single whole, perhaps without being 
                    himself able torecognize the inconsistency which is obvious 
                    to us. For there is ajudgment of after ages which few great 
                    writers have ever been ableto anticipate for themselves. They 
                    do not perceive the want ofconnection in their own writings, 
                    or the gaps in their systems whichare visible enough to those 
                    who come after them. In the beginningsof literature and philosophy, 
                    amid the first efforts of thought andlanguage, more inconsistencies 
                    occur than now, when the paths ofspeculation are well worn 
                    and the meaning of words preciselydefined. For consistency, 
                    too, is the growth of time; and some ofthe greatest creations 
                    of the human mind have been wanting in unity.Tried by this 
                    test, several of the Platonic Dialogues, according toour modern 
                    ideas, appear to be defective, but the deficiency is noproof 
                    that they were composed at different times or by differenthands. 
                    And the supposition that the Republic was writtenuninterruptedly 
                    and by a continuous effort is in some degree confirmedby the 
                    numerous references from one part of the work to another.</p>
                  <p>The second title, &quot;Concerning Justice,&quot; is not 
                    the one by whichthe Republic is quoted, either by Aristotle 
                    or generally in antiquity,and, like the other second titles 
                    of the Platonic Dialogues, maytherefore be assumed to be of 
                    later date. Morgenstern and othershave asked whether the definition 
                    of justice, which is the professedaim, or the construction 
                    of the State is the principal argument of thework. The answer 
                    is, that the two blend in one, and are two faces ofthe same 
                    truth; for justice is the order of the State, and the Stateis 
                    the visible embodiment of justice under the conditions of 
                    humansociety. The one is the soul and the other is the body, 
                    and theGreek ideal of the State, as of the individual, is 
                    a fair mind in afair body. In Hegelian phraseology the State 
                    is the reality of whichjustice is the ideal. Or, described 
                    in Christian language, the kingdomof God is within, and yet 
                    develops into a Church or externalkingdom; &quot;the house 
                    not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,&quot; isreduced 
                    to the proportions of an earthly building. Or, to use aPlatonic 
                    image, justice and the State are the warp and the woofwhich 
                    run through the whole texture. And when the constitution ofthe 
                    State is completed, the conception of justice is not dismissed,but 
                    reappears under the same or different names throughout the 
                    work,both as the inner law of the individual soul, and finally 
                    as theprinciple of rewards and punishments in another life. 
                    The virtuesare based on justice, of which common honesty in 
                    buying and selling isthe shadow, and justice is based on the 
                    idea of good, which is theharmony of the world, and is reflected 
                    both in the institutions ofStates and in motions of the heavenly 
                    bodies. The Timaeus, which takesup the political rather than 
                    the ethical side of the Republic, andis chiefly occupied with 
                    hypotheses concerning the outward world,yet contains many 
                    indications that the same law is supposed to reignover the 
                    State, over nature, and over man.</p>
                  <p>Too much, however, has been made of this question both in 
                    ancientand in modern times. There is a stage of criticism 
                    in which all works,whether of nature or of art, are referred 
                    to design. Now in ancientwritings, and indeed in literature 
                    generally, there remains often alarge element which was not 
                    comprehended in the original design. Forthe plan grows under 
                    the author's hand; new thoughts occur to him inthe act of 
                    writing; he has not worked out the argument to the endbefore 
                    he begins. The reader who seeks to find some one idea underwhich 
                    the whole may be conceived, must necessarily seize on thevaguest 
                    and most general. Thus Stallbaum, who is dissatisfied with 
                    theordinary explanations of the argument of the Republic, 
                    imagineshimself to have found the true argument &quot;in the 
                    representation ofhuman life in a State perfected by justice 
                    and governed according tothe idea of good.&quot; There may 
                    be some use in such general descriptions,but they can hardly 
                    be said to express the design of the writer. Thetruth is, 
                    that we may as well speak of many designs as of one; norneed 
                    anything be excluded from the plan of a great work to which 
                    themind is naturally led by the association of ideas, and 
                    which doesnot interfere with the general purpose. What kind 
                    or degree of unityis to be sought after in a building, in 
                    the plastic arts, in poetry,in prose, is a problem which has 
                    to be determined relatively to thesubject-matter. To Plato 
                    himself, the inquiry &quot;what was theintention of the writer,&quot; 
                    or &quot;what was the principal argument of theRepublic&quot; 
                    would have been hardly intelligible, and therefore hadbetter 
                    be at once dismissed.</p>
                  <p>Is not the Republic the vehicle of three or four great truths 
                    which,to Plato's own mind, are most naturally represented 
                    in the form of theState? Just as in the Jewish prophets the 
                    reign of Messiah, or &quot;theday of the Lord,&quot; or the 
                    suffering Servant or people of God, or the&quot;Sun of righteousness 
                    with healing in his wings&quot; only convey, to us atleast, 
                    their great spiritual ideals, so through the Greek StatePlato 
                    reveals to us his own thoughts about divine perfection, which 
                    isthe idea of good --like the sun in the visible world; --about 
                    humanperfection, which is justice --about education beginning 
                    in youthand continuing in later years --about poets and sophists 
                    and tyrantswho are the false teachers and evil rulers of mankind 
                    --about &quot;theworld&quot; which is the embodiment of them 
                    --about a kingdom whichexists nowhere upon earth but is laid 
                    up in heaven to be the patternand rule of human life. No such 
                    inspired creation is at unity withitself, any more than the 
                    clouds of heaven when the sun piercesthrough them. Every shade 
                    of light and dark, of truth, and offiction which is the veil 
                    of truth, is allowable in a work ofphilosophical imagination. 
                    It is not all on the same plane; iteasily passes from ideas 
                    to myths and fancies, from facts to figuresof speech. It is 
                    not prose but poetry, at least a great part of it,and ought 
                    not to be judged by the rules of logic or theprobabilities 
                    of history. The writer is not fashioning his ideasinto an 
                    artistic whole; they take possession of him and are too muchfor 
                    him. We have no need therefore to discuss whether a State 
                    suchas Plato has conceived is practicable or not, or whether 
                    the outwardform or the inward life came first into the mind 
                    of the writer. Forthe practicability of his ideas has nothing 
                    to do with their truth;and the highest thoughts to which he 
                    attains may be truly said to bearthe greatest &quot;marks 
                    of design&quot; --justice more than the externalframe-work 
                    of the State, the idea of good more than justice. The greatscience 
                    of dialectic or the organization of ideas has no real content;but 
                    is only a type of the method or spirit in which the higherknowledge 
                    is to be pursued by the spectator of all time and allexistence. 
                    It is in the fifth, sixth, and seventh books that Platoreaches 
                    the &quot;summit of speculation,&quot; and these, although 
                    they failto satisfy the requirements of a modern thinker, 
                    may therefore beregarded as the most important, as they are 
                    also the most original,portions of the work.</p>
                  <p>It is not necessary to discuss at length a minor question 
                    whichhas been raised by Boeckh, respecting the imaginary date 
                    at whichthe conversation was held (the year 411 B. C. which 
                    is proposed by himwill do as well as any other); for a writer 
                    of fiction, and especiallya writer who, like Plato, is notoriously 
                    careless of chronology,only aims at general probability. Whether 
                    all the persons mentioned inthe Republic could ever have met 
                    at any one time is not a difficultywhich would have occurred 
                    to an Athenian reading the work fortyyears later, or to Plato 
                    himself at the time of writing (any more thanto Shakespeare 
                    respecting one of his own dramas); and need not greatlytrouble 
                    us now. Yet this may be a question having no answer &quot;whichis 
                    still worth asking,&quot; because the investigation shows 
                    that we cannot argue historically from the dates in Plato; 
                    it would be uselesstherefore to waste time in inventing far-fetched 
                    reconcilements ofthem in order avoid chronological difficulties, 
                    such, for example,as the conjecture of C. F. Hermann, that 
                    Glaucon and Adeimantus arenot the brothers but the uncles 
                    of Plato, or the fancy of Stallbaumthat Plato intentionally 
                    left anachronisms indicating the dates atwhich some of his 
                    Dialogues were written.</p>
                  <p>CHARACTERS</p>
                  <p>The principal characters in the Republic are Cephalus,Polemarchus, 
                    Thrasymachus, Socrates, Glaucon, and Adeimantus. Cephalusappears 
                    in the introduction only, Polemarchus drops at the end ofthe 
                    first argument, and Thrasymachus is reduced to silence at 
                    theclose of the first book. The main discussion is carried 
                    on bySocrates, Glaucon, and Adeimantus. Among the company 
                    are Lysias (theorator) and Euthydemus, the sons of Cephalus 
                    and brothers ofPolemarchus, an unknown Charmantides --these 
                    are mute auditors; alsothere is Cleitophon, who once interrupts, 
                    where, as in the Dialoguewhich bears his name, he appears 
                    as the friend and ally ofThrasymachus.</p>
                  <p>Cephalus, the patriarch of house, has been appropriately 
                    engagedin offering a sacrifice. He is the pattern of an old 
                    man who hasalmost done with life, and is at peace with himself 
                    and with allmankind. He feels that he is drawing nearer to 
                    the world below, andseems to linger around the memory of the 
                    past. He is eager thatSocrates should come to visit him, fond 
                    of the poetry of the lastgeneration, happy in the consciousness 
                    of a well-spent life, glad athaving escaped from the tyranny 
                    of youthful lusts. His love ofconversation, his affection, 
                    his indifference to riches, even hisgarrulity, are interesting 
                    traits of character. He is not one of thosewho have nothing 
                    to say, because their whole mind has been absorbed inmaking 
                    money. Yet he acknowledges that riches have the advantage 
                    ofplacing men above the temptation to dishonesty or falsehood. 
                    Therespectful attention shown to him by Socrates, whose love 
                    ofconversation, no less than the mission imposed upon him 
                    by the Oracle,leads him to ask questions of all men, young 
                    and old alike, shouldalso be noted. Who better suited to raise 
                    the question of justice thanCephalus, whose life might seem 
                    to be the expression of it? Themoderation with which old age 
                    is pictured by Cephalus as a verytolerable portion of existence 
                    is characteristic, not only of him, butof Greek feeling generally, 
                    and contrasts with the exaggeration ofCicero in the De Senectute. 
                    The evening of life is described byPlato in the most expressive 
                    manner, yet with the fewest possibletouches. As Cicero remarks 
                    (Ep. ad Attic. iv. 16), the aged Cephaluswould have been out 
                    of place in the discussion which follows, andwhich he could 
                    neither have understood nor taken part in without aviolation 
                    of dramatic propriety.</p>
                  <p>His &quot;son and heir&quot; Polemarchus has the frankness 
                    and impetuousnessof youth; he is for detaining Socrates by 
                    force in the openingscene, and will not &quot;let him off&quot; 
                    on the subject of women andchildren. Like Cephalus, he is 
                    limited in his point of view, andrepresents the proverbial 
                    stage of morality which has rules of liferather than principles; 
                    and he quotes Simonides as his father hadquoted Pindar. But 
                    after this he has no more to say; the answers whichhe makes 
                    are only elicited from him by the dialectic of Socrates. Hehas 
                    not yet experienced the influence of the Sophists like Glaucon 
                    andAdeimantus, nor is he sensible of the necessity of refuting 
                    them; hebelongs to the pre-Socratic or pre-dialectical age. 
                    He is incapable ofarguing, and is bewildered by Socrates to 
                    such a degree that he doesnot know what he is saying. He is 
                    made to admit that justice is athief, and that the virtues 
                    follow the analogy of the arts. From hisbrother Lysias we 
                    learn that he fell a victim to the Thirty Tyrants,but no allusion 
                    is here made to his fate, nor to the circumstance thatCephalus 
                    and his family were of Syracusan origin, and had migratedfrom 
                    Thurii to Athens.</p>
                  <p>The &quot;Chalcedonian giant,&quot; Thrasymachus, of whom 
                    we have alreadyheard in the Phaedrus, is the personification 
                    of the Sophists,according to Plato's conception of them, in 
                    some of their worstcharacteristics. He is vain and blustering, 
                    refusing to discourseunless he is paid, fond of making an 
                    oration, and hoping thereby toescape the inevitable Socrates; 
                    but a mere child in argument, andunable to foresee that the 
                    next &quot;move&quot; (to use a Platonicexpression) will &quot;shut 
                    him up.&quot; He has reached the stage of framinggeneral notions, 
                    and in this respect is in advance of Cephalus andPolemarchus. 
                    But he is incapable of defending them in a discussion,and 
                    vainly tries to cover his confusion in banter and insolence.Whether 
                    such doctrines as are attributed to him by Plato were reallyheld 
                    either by him or by any other Sophist is uncertain; in theinfancy 
                    of philosophy serious errors about morality might easilygrow 
                    up --they are certainly put into the mouths of speakers inThucydides; 
                    but we are concerned at present with Plato's descriptionof 
                    him, and not with the historical reality. The inequality of 
                    thecontest adds greatly to the humor of the scene. The pompous 
                    andempty Sophist is utterly helpless in the hands of the great 
                    masterof dialectic, who knows how to touch all the springs 
                    of vanity andweakness in him. He is greatly irritated by the 
                    irony of Socrates, buthis noisy and imbecile rage only lays 
                    him more and more open to thethrusts of his assailant. His 
                    determination to cram down theirthroats, or put &quot;bodily 
                    into their souls&quot; his own words, elicits a cryof horror 
                    from Socrates. The state of his temper is quite as worthy 
                    ofremark as the process of the argument. Nothing is more amusing 
                    thanhis complete submission when he has been once thoroughly 
                    beaten. Atfirst he seems to continue the discussion with reluctance, 
                    but soonwith apparent good-will, and he even testifies his 
                    interest at a laterstage by one or two occasional remarks. 
                    When attacked by Glaucon he ishumorously protected by Socrates 
                    &quot;as one who has never been hisenemy and is now his friend.&quot; 
                    From Cicero and Quintilian and fromAristotle's Rhetoric we 
                    learn that the Sophist whom Plato has madeso ridiculous was 
                    a man of note whose writings were preserved in laterages. 
                    The play on his name which was made by his contemporaryHerodicus, 
                    &quot;thou wast ever bold in battle,&quot; seems to show that 
                    thedescription of him is not devoid of verisimilitude.</p>
                  <p>When Thrasymachus has been silenced, the two principalrespondents, 
                    Glaucon and Adeimantus, appear on the scene: here, asin Greek 
                    tragedy, three actors are introduced. At first sight thetwo 
                    sons of Ariston may seem to wear a family likeness, like the 
                    twofriends Simmias and Cebes in the Phaedo. But on a nearer 
                    examinationof them the similarity vanishes, and they are seen 
                    to be distinctcharacters. Glaucon is the impetuous youth who 
                    can &quot;just never haveenough of fechting&quot; (cf. the 
                    character of him in Xen. Mem. iii. 6);the man of pleasure 
                    who is acquainted with the mysteries of love;the &quot;juvenis 
                    qui gaudet canibus,&quot; and who improves the breed ofanimals; 
                    the lover of art and music who has all the experiences ofyouthful 
                    life. He is full of quickness and penetration, piercingeasily 
                    below the clumsy platitudes of Thrasymachus to the realdifficulty; 
                    he turns out to the light the seamy side of human life,and 
                    yet does not lose faith in the just and true. It is Glaucon 
                    whoseizes what may be termed the ludicrous relation of the 
                    philosopher tothe world, to whom a state of simplicity is 
                    &quot;a city of pigs,&quot; who isalways prepared with a jest 
                    when the argument offers him anopportunity, and who is ever 
                    ready to second the humor of Socrates andto appreciate the 
                    ridiculous, whether in the connoisseurs of music, orin the 
                    lovers of theatricals, or in the fantastic behavior of thecitizens 
                    of democracy. His weaknesses are several times alluded toby 
                    Socrates, who, however, will not allow him to be attacked 
                    by hisbrother Adeimantus. He is a soldier, and, like Adeimantus, 
                    has beendistinguished at the battle of Megara.</p>
                  <p>The character of Adeimantus is deeper and graver, and the 
                    profounderobjections are commonly put into his mouth. Glaucon 
                    is moredemonstrative, and generally opens the game. Adeimantus 
                    pursues theargument further. Glaucon has more of the liveliness 
                    and quicksympathy of youth; Adeimantus has the maturer judgment 
                    of a grown-upman of the world. In the second book, when Glaucon 
                    insists thatjustice and injustice shall be considered without 
                    regard to theirconsequences, Adeimantus remarks that they 
                    are regarded by mankindin general only for the sake of their 
                    consequences; and in a similarvein of reflection he urges 
                    at the beginning of the fourth book thatSocrates falls in 
                    making his citizens happy, and is answered thathappiness is 
                    not the first but the second thing, not the direct aimbut 
                    the indirect consequence of the good government of a State. 
                    In thediscussion about religion and mythology, Adeimantus 
                    is the respondent,but Glaucon breaks in with a slight jest, 
                    and carries on theconversation in a lighter tone about music 
                    and gymnastic to the end ofthe book. It is Adeimantus again 
                    who volunteers the criticism ofcommon sense on the Socratic 
                    method of argument, and who refuses tolet Socrates pass lightly 
                    over the question of women and children.It is Adeimantus who 
                    is the respondent in the more argumentative, asGlaucon in 
                    the lighter and more imaginative portions of theDialogue. 
                    For example, throughout the greater part of the sixthbook, 
                    the causes of the corruption of philosophy and the conception 
                    ofthe idea of good are discussed with Adeimantus. Then Glaucon 
                    resumeshis place of principal respondent; but he has a difficulty 
                    inapprehending the higher education of Socrates, and makes 
                    some falsehits in the course of the discussion. Once more 
                    Adeimantus returnswith the allusion to his brother Glaucon 
                    whom he compares to thecontentious State; in the next book 
                    he is again superseded, andGlaucon continues to the end.</p>
                  <p>Thus in a succession of characters Plato represents the successivestages 
                    of morality, beginning with the Athenian gentleman of the 
                    oldentime, who is followed by the practical man of that day 
                    regulatinghis life by proverbs and saws; to him succeeds the 
                    wild generalizationof the Sophists, and lastly come the young 
                    disciples of the greatteacher, who know the sophistical arguments 
                    but will not beconvinced by them, and desire to go deeper 
                    into the nature ofthings. These too, like Cephalus, Polemarchus, 
                    Thrasymachus, areclearly distinguished from one another. Neither 
                    in the Republic, norin any other Dialogue of Plato, is a single 
                    character repeated.</p>
                  <p>The delineation of Socrates in the Republic is not whollyconsistent. 
                    In the first book we have more of the real Socrates,such as 
                    he is depicted in the Memorabilia of Xenophon, in the earliestDialogues 
                    of Plato, and in the Apology. He is ironical, provoking,questioning, 
                    the old enemy of the Sophists, ready to put on the maskof 
                    Silenus as well as to argue seriously. But in the sixth book 
                    hisenmity towards the Sophists abates; he acknowledges that 
                    they arethe representatives rather than the corrupters of 
                    the world. He alsobecomes more dogmatic and constructive, 
                    passing beyond the rangeeither of the political or the speculative 
                    ideas of the real Socrates.In one passage Plato himself seems 
                    to intimate that the time had nowcome for Socrates, who had 
                    passed his whole life in philosophy, togive his own opinion 
                    and not to be always repeating the notions ofother men. There 
                    is no evidence that either the idea of good or theconception 
                    of a perfect State were comprehended in the Socraticteaching, 
                    though he certainly dwelt on the nature of the universal andof 
                    final causes (cp. Xen. Mem. i. 4; Phaedo 97); and a deep thinkerlike 
                    him in his thirty or forty years of public teaching, could 
                    hardlyhave falled to touch on the nature of family relations, 
                    for whichthere is also some positive evidence in the Memorabilia 
                    (Mem. i. 2, 51foll.) The Socratic method is nominally retained; 
                    and everyinference is either put into the mouth of the respondent 
                    orrepresented as the common discovery of him and Socrates. 
                    But any onecan see that this is a mere form, of which the 
                    affectation growswearisome as the work advances. The method 
                    of inquiry has passedinto a method of teaching in which by 
                    the help of interlocutors thesame thesis is looked at from 
                    various points of view.</p>
                  <p>The nature of the process is truly characterized by Glaucon, 
                    when hedescribes himself as a companion who is not good for 
                    much in aninvestigation, but can see what he is shown, and 
                    may, perhaps, givethe answer to a question more fluently than 
                    another.</p>
                  <p>Neither can we be absolutely certain that, Socrates himself 
                    taughtthe immortality of the soul, which is unknown to his 
                    discipleGlaucon in the Republic; nor is there any reason to 
                    suppose that heused myths or revelations of another world 
                    as a vehicle ofinstruction, or that he would have banished 
                    poetry or have denouncedthe Greek mythology. His favorite 
                    oath is retained, and a slightmention is made of the daemonium, 
                    or internal sign, which is alludedto by Socrates as a phenomenon 
                    peculiar to himself. A real elementof Socratic teaching, which 
                    is more prominent in the Republic thanin any of the other 
                    Dialogues of Plato, is the use of example andillustration 
                    ('taphorhtika auto prhospherhontez'): &quot;Let us apply thetest 
                    of common instances.&quot; &quot;You,&quot; says Adeimantus, 
                    ironically, inthe sixth book, &quot;are so unaccustomed to 
                    speak in images.&quot; And this useof examples or images, 
                    though truly Socratic in origin, is enlarged bythe genius 
                    of Plato into the form of an allegory or parable, whichembodies 
                    in the concrete what has been already described, or isabout 
                    to be described, in the abstract. Thus the figure of the cave 
                    inBook VII is a recapitulation of the divisions of knowledge 
                    in Book VI.The composite animal in Book IX is an allegory 
                    of the parts of thesoul. The noble captain and the ship and 
                    the true pilot in Book VI area figure of the relation of the 
                    people to the philosophers in theState which has been described. 
                    Other figures, such as the dog inthe second, third, and fourth 
                    books, or the marriage of theportionless maiden in the sixth 
                    book, or the drones and wasps in theeighth and ninth books, 
                    also form links of connection in longpassages, or are used 
                    to recall previous discussions.</p>
                  <p>Plato is most true to the character of his master when hedescribes 
                    him as &quot;not of this world.&quot; And with this representationof 
                    him the ideal State and the other paradoxes of the Republic 
                    arequite in accordance, though they can not be shown to have 
                    beenspeculations of Socrates. To him, as to other great teachers 
                    bothphilosophical and religious, when they looked upward, 
                    the world seemedto be the embodiment of error and evil. The 
                    common sense of mankindhas revolted against this view, or 
                    has only partially admitted it. Andeven in Socrates himself 
                    the sterner judgment of the multitude attimes passes into 
                    a sort of ironical pity or love. Men in generalare incapable 
                    of philosophy, and are therefore at enmity with thephilosopher; 
                    but their misunderstanding of him is unavoidable: forthey 
                    have never seen him as he truly is in his own image; they 
                    areonly acquainted with artificial systems possessing no native 
                    forceof truth --words which admit of many applications. Their 
                    leadershave nothing to measure with, and are therefore ignorant 
                    of theirown stature. But they are to be pitied or laughed 
                    at, not to bequarrelled with; they mean well with their nostrums, 
                    if they couldonly learn that they are cutting off a Hydra's 
                    head. This moderationtowards those who are in error is one 
                    of the most characteristicfeatures of Socrates in the Republic. 
                    In all the differentrepresentations of Socrates, whether of 
                    Xenophon or Plato, and thedifferences of the earlier or later 
                    Dialogues, he always retains thecharacter of the unwearied 
                    and disinterested seeker after truth,without which he would 
                    have ceased to be Socrates.</p>
                  <p>Leaving the characters we may now analyze the contents of 
                    theRepublic, and then proceed to consider</p>
                  <p> (1) The general aspects of thisHellenic ideal of the State,<br>
                    (2) The modern lights in which thethoughts of Plato may be 
                    read.</p>

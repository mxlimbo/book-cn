                    And now, assuming children of both sexes to have been born, 
                    itwill be proper for us to consider, in the next place, their 
                    nurtureand education; this cannot be left altogether unnoticed, 
                    and yet maybe thought a subject fitted rather for precept 
                    and admonition than forlaw. In private life there are many 
                    little things, not alwaysapparent, arising out of the pleasures 
                    and pains and desires ofindividuals, which run counter to 
                    the intention of the legislator, andmake the characters of 
                    the citizens various and dissimilar:-this is anevil in states; 
                    for by reason of their smallness and frequentoccurrence, there 
                    would be an unseemliness and want of propriety inmaking them 
                    penal by law; and if made penal, they are thedestruction of 
                    the written law because mankind get the habit offrequently 
                    transgressing the law in small matters. The result isthat 
                    you cannot legislate about them, and still less can you besilent. 
                    I speak somewhat darkly, but I shall endeavour also to bringmy 
                    wares into the light of day, for I acknowledge that at presentthere 
                    is a want of clearness in what I am saying.</p>
                  <p>Cleinias. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Athenian. Stranger. Am I not right in maintaining that a 
                    goodeducation is that which tends most, to the improvement 
                    of mind andbody?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Undoubtedly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And nothing can be plainer than that the fairest bodies 
                    arethose which grow up from infancy in the best and straightest 
                    manner?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And do we not further observe that the first shoot of 
                    everyliving thing is by far the greatest and fullest? Many 
                    will evencontend that a man at twenty-five does not reach 
                    twice the heightwhich he attained at five.</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Well, and is not rapid growth without proper and abundantexercise 
                    the source endless evils in the body?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And the body should have the most exercise when it receivesmost 
                    nourishment?</p>
                  <p>Cle. But, Stranger, are we to impose this great amount of 
                    exerciseupon newly-born infants?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Nay, rather on the bodies of infants still unborn.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What do you mean, my good sir? In the process of gestation?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Exactly. I am not at all surprised that you have never 
                    heard ofthis very peculiar sort of gymnastic applied to such 
                    little creatures,which, although strange, I will endeavour 
                    to explain to you.</p>
                  <p>Cle. By all means.</p>
                  <p>Ath. The practice is more easy for us to understand than 
                    for you, byreason of certain amusements which are carried 
                    to excess by us atAthens. Not only boys, but often older persons, 
                    are in the habit ofkeeping quails and cocks, which they train 
                    to fight one another. Andthey are far from thinking that the 
                    contests in which they stir themup to fight with one another 
                    are sufficient exercise; for, in additionto this, they carry 
                    them about tucked beneath their armpits, holdingthe smaller 
                    birds in their hands, the larger under their arms, andgo for 
                    a walk of a great many miles for the sake of health, that 
                    is tosay, not their own, health, but the health of the birds; 
                    wherebythey prove to any intelligent person, that all bodies 
                    are benefited byshakings and movements, when they are moved 
                    without weariness, whethermotion proceeds from themselves, 
                    or is caused by a swing, or at sea,or on horseback, or by 
                    other bodies in whatever way moving, and thatthus gaining 
                    the mastery over food and drink, they are able toimpart beauty 
                    and health and strength. But admitting all this, whatfollows? 
                    Shall we make a ridiculous law that the pregnant womanshall 
                    walk about and fashion the embryo within as we fashion waxbefore 
                    it hardens, and after birth swathe the infant for two years?Suppose 
                    that we compel nurses, under penalty of a legal fine, to bealways 
                    carrying the children somewhere or other, either to thetemples, 
                    or into the country, or to their relations, houses, untilthey 
                    are well able to stand, and to take care that their limbs 
                    are notdistorted by leaning on them when they are too young-they 
                    shouldcontinue to carry them until the infant has completed 
                    its thirdyear; the nurses should be strong, and there should 
                    be more than oneof them. Shall these be our rules, and shall 
                    we impose a penalty forthe neglect of them? No, no; the penalty 
                    of which we were speakingwill fall upon our own heads more 
                    than enough.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What penalty?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Ridicule, and the difficulty of getting the feminine 
                    andservant-like dispositions of the nurses to comply.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Then why was there any need to speak of the matter at 
                    all?</p>
                  <p>Ath. The reason is that masters and freemen in states, when 
                    theyhear of it, are very likely to arrive at a true conviction 
                    thatwithout due regulation of private life in cities, stability 
                    in thelaying down of laws is hardly to be expected; and he 
                    who makes thisreflection may himself adopt the laws just now 
                    mentioned, and,adopting them, may order his house and state 
                    well and be happy.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Likely enough.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And therefore let us proceed with our legislation until 
                    we havedetermined the exercises which are suited to the souls 
                    of youngchildren, in the same manner in which we have begun 
                    to go throughthe rules relating to their bodies.</p>
                  <p>Cle. By all means.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us assume, then, as a first principle in relation 
                    both tothe body and soul of very young creatures, that nursing 
                    and movingabout by day and night is good for them all, and 
                    that the younger theyare, the more they will need it; infants 
                    should live, if that werepossible, as if they were always 
                    rocking at sea. This is the lessonwhich we may gather from 
                    the experience of nurses, and likewise fromthe use of the 
                    remedy of motion in the rites of the Corybantes; forwhen mothers 
                    want their restless children to go to sleep they do notemploy 
                    rest, but, on the contrary, motion-rocking them in theirarms; 
                    nor do they give them silence, but they sing to them and lapthem 
                    in sweet strains; and the Bacchic women are cured of their 
                    frenzyin the same manner by the use of the dance and of music.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Well, Stranger, and what is the reason of this?</p>
                  <p>Ath. The reason is obvious.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What?</p>
                  <p>Ath. The affection both of the Bacchantes and of the children 
                    isan emotion of fear, which springs out of an evil habit of 
                    the soul.And when some one applies external agitation to affections 
                    of thissort, the motion coming from without gets the better 
                    of the terribleand violent internal one, and produces a peace 
                    and calm in the soul,and quiets the restless palpitation of 
                    the heart, which is a thingmuch to be desired, sending the 
                    children to sleep, and making theBacchantes, although they 
                    remain awake, to dance to the pipe withthe help of the Gods 
                    to whom they offer acceptable sacrifices, andproducing in 
                    them a sound mind, which takes the place of their frenzy.And, 
                    to express what I mean in a word, there is a good deal to 
                    be saidin favour of this treatment.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. But if fear has such a power we ought to infer from 
                    thesefacts, that every soul which from youth upward has been 
                    familiarwith fears, will be made more liable to fear, and 
                    every one will allowthat this is the way to form a habit of 
                    cowardice and not of courage.</p>
                  <p>Cle. No doubt.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And, on the other hand, the habit of overcoming, from 
                    our youthupwards, the fears and terrors which beset us, may 
                    be said to be anexercise of courage.</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And we may say that the use of exercise and motion in 
                    theearliest years of life greatly contributes to create a 
                    part ofvirtue in the soul.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Quite true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Further, a cheerful temper, or the reverse, may be regardedas 
                    having much to do with high spirit on the one hand, or withcowardice 
                    on the other.</p>
                  <p>Cle. To be sure.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then now we must endeavour to show how and to what extent 
                    wemay, if we please, without difficulty implant either character 
                    inthe young.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. There is a common opinion, that luxury makes the disposition 
                    ofyouth discontented and irascible and vehemently excited 
                    by trifles;that on the other hand excessive and savage servitude 
                    makes men meanand abject, and haters of their kind, and therefore 
                    makes themundesirable associates.</p>
                  <p>Cle. But how must the state educate those who do not as yetunderstand 
                    the language of the country, and are therefore incapable ofappreciating 
                    any sort of instruction?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I will tell you how:-Every animal that is born is wont 
                    to uttersome cry, and this is especially the case with man, 
                    and he is alsoaffected with the inclination to weep more than 
                    any other animal.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Quite true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Do not nurses, when they want to know what an infant 
                    desires,judge by these signs?-when anything is brought to 
                    the infant and he issilent, then he is supposed to be pleased, 
                    but, when he weeps andcries out, then he is not pleased. For 
                    tears and cries are theinauspicious signs by which children 
                    show what they love and hate. Nowthe time which is thus spent 
                    is no less than three years, and is avery considerable portion 
                    of life to be passed ill or well.</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Does not the discontented and ungracious nature appear 
                    to youto be full of lamentations and sorrows more than a good 
                    man ought tobe?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Well, but if during these three years every possible 
                    carewere taken that our nursling should have as little of 
                    sorrow and fear,and in general of pain as was possible, might 
                    we not expect in earlychildhood to make his soul more gentle 
                    and cheerful?</p>
                  <p>Cle. To be sure, Stranger-more especially if we could procure 
                    hima variety of pleasures.</p>
                  <p>Ath. There I can no longer agree, Cleinias: you amaze me. 
                    To bringhim up in such a way would be his utter ruin; for 
                    the beginning isalways the most critical part of education. 
                    Let us see whether I amright.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Proceed.</p>
                  <p>Ath. The point about which you and I differ is of greatimportance, 
                    and I hope that you, Megillus, will help to decide betweenus. 
                    For I maintain that the true life should neither seek forpleasures, 
                    nor, on the other hand, entirely avoid pains, but shouldembrace 
                    the middle state, which I just spoke of as gentle andbenign, 
                    and is a state which we by some divine presage and inspirationrightly 
                    ascribe to God. Now, I say, he among men, too, who would bedivine 
                    ought to pursue after this mean habit-he should not rushheadlong 
                    into pleasures, for he will not be free from pains; norshould 
                    we allow any one, young or old, male or female, to be thusgiven 
                    any more than ourselves, and least of all the newly-born infant,for 
                    in infancy more than at any other time the character isengrained 
                    by habit. Nay, more, if I were not afraid of appearing to 
                    beridiculous, I would say that a woman during her year of 
                    pregnancyshould of all women be most carefully tended, and 
                    kept from violent orexcessive pleasures and pains, and should 
                    at that time cultivategentleness and benevolence and kindness.</p>
                  <p>Cle. You need not, ask Megillus, Stranger, which of us has 
                    mosttruly spoken; for I myself agree that all men ought to 
                    avoid thelife of unmingled pain or pleasure, and pursue always 
                    a middle course.And having spoken well, may I add that you 
                    have been well answered?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Very good, Cleinias; and now let us all three consider 
                    afurther point.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What is it?</p>
                  <p>Ath. That all the matters which we are now describing are 
                    commonlycalled by the general name of unwritten customs, and 
                    what are termedthe laws of our ancestors are all of similar 
                    nature. And thereflection which lately arose in our minds, 
                    that we can neither callthese things laws, nor yet leave them 
                    unmentioned, is justified; forthey are the bonds of the whole 
                    state, and come in between the writtenlaws which are or are 
                    hereafter to be laid down; they are justancestral customs 
                    of great antiquity, which, if they are rightlyordered and 
                    made habitual, shield and preserve the previously existingwritten 
                    law; but if they depart from right and fall into disorder,then 
                    they are like the props of builders which slip away out oftheir 
                    Place and cause a universal ruin-one part drags another down,and 
                    the fair super-structure falls because the old foundations 
                    areundermined. Reflecting upon this, Cleinias, you ought to 
                    bind togetherthe new state in every possible way, omitting 
                    nothing, whether greator small, of what are called laws or 
                    manners or pursuits, for by thesemeans a city is bound together, 
                    and all these things are onlylasting when they depend upon 
                    one another; and, therefore, we must notwonder if we find 
                    that many apparently trifling customs or usages comepouring 
                    in and lengthening out our laws.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true: we are disposed to agree with you.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Up to the age of three years, whether of boy or girl, 
                    if aperson strictly carries out our previous regulations and 
                    makes thema principal aim, he will do much for the advantage 
                    of the youngcreatures. But at three, four, five, and even 
                    six years the childishnature will require sports; now is the 
                    time to get rid of self-will inhim, punishing him, but not 
                    so as to disgrace him. We were sayingabout slaves, that we 
                    ought neither to add insult to punishment soas to anger them, 
                    nor yet to leave them unpunished lest they becomeself-willed; 
                    and a like rule is to be observed in the case of thefree-born. 
                    Children at that age have certain natural modes ofamusement 
                    which they find out for themselves when they meet. And allthe 
                    children who are between the ages of three and six ought to 
                    meetat the temples the villages, the several families of a 
                    village unitingon one spot. The nurses are to see that the 
                    children behave properlyand orderly-they themselves and all 
                    their companies are to be underthe control of twelve matrons, 
                    one for each company, who areannually selected to inspect 
                    them from the women previously mentioned,[i.e., the women 
                    who have authority over marriage], whom the guardiansof the 
                    law appoint. These matrons shall be chosen by the women whohave 
                    authority over marriage, one out of each tribe; all are to 
                    beof the same age; and let each of them, as soon as she is 
                    appointed,hold office and go to the temples every day, punishing 
                    alloffenders, male or female, who are slaves or strangers, 
                    by the help ofsome of the public slaves; but if any citizen 
                    disputes the punishment,let her bring him before the wardens 
                    of the city; or, if there be nodispute, let her punish him 
                    herself. After the age of six years thetime has arrived for 
                    the separation of the sexes-let boys live withboys, and girls 
                    in like manner with girls. Now they must begin tolearn-the 
                    boys going to teachers of horsemanship and the use of thebow, 
                    the javelin, and sling, and the girls too, if they do not 
                    object,at any rate until they know how to manage these weapons, 
                    andespecially how to handle heavy arms; for I may note, that 
                    the practicewhich now prevails is almost universally misunderstood.</p>
                  <p>Cle. In what respect?</p>
                  <p>Ath. In that the right and left hand are supposed to be by 
                    naturedifferently suited for our various uses of them; whereas 
                    no differenceis found in the use of the feet and the lower 
                    limbs; but in the use ofthe hands we are, as it were, maimed 
                    by the folly of nurses andmothers; for although our several 
                    limbs are by nature balanced, wecreate a difference in them 
                    by bad habit. In some cases this is ofno consequence, as, 
                    for example, when we hold the lyre in the lefthand, and the 
                    plectrum in the right, but it is downright folly to makethe 
                    same distinction in other cases. The custom of the Scythiansproves 
                    our error; for they not only hold the bow from them with theleft 
                    hand and draw the arrow to them with their right, but useeither 
                    hand for both purposes. And there are many similar examplesin 
                    charioteering and other things, from which we may learn thatthose 
                    who make the left side weaker than the right act contrary 
                    tonature. In the case of the plectrum, which is of horn only, 
                    andsimilar instruments, as I was saying, it is of no consequence, 
                    butmakes a great difference, and may be of very great importance 
                    to thewarrior who has to use iron weapons, bows and javelins, 
                    and thelike; above all, when in heavy armour, he has to fight 
                    against heavyarmour. And there is a very great difference 
                    between one who haslearnt and one who has not, and between 
                    one who has been trained ingymnastic exercises and one who 
                    has not been. For as he who isperfectly skilled in the Pancratium 
                    or boxing or wrestling, is notunable to fight from his left 
                    side, and does not limp and draggle inconfusion when his opponent 
                    makes him change his position, so inheavy-armed fighting, 
                    and in all other things if I am not mistaken,the like holds-he 
                    who has these double powers of attack and defenceought not 
                    in any case to leave them either unused or untrained, ifhe 
                    can help; and if a person had the nature of Geryon or Briareus 
                    heought to be able with his hundred hands to throw a hundred 
                    darts. Now,the magistrates, male and female, should see to 
                    all these things,the women superintending the nursing and 
                    amusements of the children,and the men superintending their 
                    education, that all of them, boys andgirls alike, may be sound 
                    hand and foot, and may not, if they canhelp, spoil the gifts 
                    of nature by bad habits.</p>
                  <p>Education has two branches-one of gymnastic, which is concerned 
                    withthe body, and the other of music, which is designed for 
                    theimprovement of the soul. And gymnastic has also two branches-dancingand 
                    wrestling; and one sort of dancing imitates musical recitation,and 
                    aims at preserving dignity and freedom, the other aims atproducing 
                    health, agility, and beauty in the limbs and parts of thebody, 
                    giving the proper flexion and extension to each of them, aharmonious 
                    motion being diffused everywhere, and forming a suitableaccompaniment 
                    to the dance. As regards wrestling, the tricks whichAntaeus 
                    and Cercyon devised in their systems out of a vain spirit 
                    ofcompetition, or the tricks of boxing which Epeius or Amycusinvented, 
                    are useless and unsuitable for war, and do not deserve tohave 
                    much said about them; but the art of wrestling erect andkeeping 
                    free the neck and hands and sides, working with energy andconstancy, 
                    with a composed strength, and for the sake ofhealth-these 
                    are always useful, and are not to be neglected, but to beenjoined 
                    alike on masters and scholars, when we reach that part oflegislation; 
                    and we will desire the one to give their instructionsfreely, 
                    and the others to receive them thankfully. Nor, again, must 
                    weomit suitable imitations of war in our choruses; here in 
                    Crete youhave the armed dances if the Curetes, and the Lacedaemonians 
                    havethose of the Dioscuri. And our virgin lady, delighting 
                    in theamusement of the dance, thought it not fit to amuse 
                    herself with emptyhands; she must be clothed in a complete 
                    suit of armour, and in thisattire go through the dance; and 
                    youths and maidens should in everyrespect imitate her, esteeming 
                    highly the favour of the Goddess,both with a view to the necessities 
                    of war, and to festiveoccasions: it will be right also for 
                    the boys, until such time as theygo out to war, to make processions 
                    and supplications to all the Godsin goodly array, armed and 
                    on horseback, in dances, and marches,fast or slow, offering 
                    up prayers to the Gods and to the sons of Gods;and also engaging 
                    in contests and preludes of contests, if at all,with these 
                    objects: For these sorts of exercises, and no others, areuseful 
                    both in peace and war, and are beneficial alike to states 
                    andto private houses. But other labours and sports and exercises 
                    of thebody are unworthy of freemen, O Megillus and Cleinias.</p>
                  <p>I have now completely described the kind of gymnastic which 
                    I saidat first ought to be described; if you know of any better, 
                    will youcommunicate your thoughts?</p>
                  <p>Cle. It is not easy, Stranger, to put aside these principles 
                    ofgymnastic and wrestling and to enunciate better ones.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Now we must say what has yet to be said about the gifts 
                    ofthe Muses and of Apollo: before, we fancied that we had 
                    said all,and that gymnastic alone remained; but now we see 
                    clearly whatpoints have been omitted, and should be first 
                    proclaimed; of these,then, let us proceed to speak.</p>
                  <p>Cle. By all means.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let me tell you once more-although you have heard me 
                    say thesame before that caution must be always exercised, 
                    both by the speakerand by the hearer, about anything that 
                    is very singular and unusual.For my tale is one, which many 
                    a man would be afraid to tell, andyet I have a confidence 
                    which makes me go on.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What have you to say, Stranger?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I say that in states generally no one has observed that 
                    theplays of childhood have a great deal to do with the permanence 
                    or wantof permanence in legislation. For when plays are ordered 
                    with a viewto children having the same plays, and amusing 
                    themselves after thesame manner, and finding delight in the 
                    same playthings, the moresolemn institutions of the state 
                    are allowed to remain undisturbed.Whereas if sports are disturbed, 
                    and innovations are made in them, andthey constantly change, 
                    and the young never speak of their havingthe same likings, 
                    or the same established notions of good and badtaste, either 
                    in the bearing of their bodies or in their dress, but hewho 
                    devises something new and out of the way in figures and coloursand 
                    the like is held in special honour, we may truly say that 
                    nogreater evil can happen in a state; for he who changes the 
                    sports issecretly changing the manners of the young, and making 
                    the old to bedishonoured among them and the new to be honoured. 
                    And I affirm thatthere is nothing which is a greater injury 
                    to all states than sayingor thinking thus. Will you hear me 
                    tell how great I deem the evil tobe?</p>
                  <p>Cle. You mean the evil of blaming antiquity in states?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Exactly.</p>
                  <p>Cle. If you are speaking of that, you will find in us hearers 
                    whoare disposed to receive what you say not unfavourably but 
                    mostfavourably.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I should expect so.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Proceed.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Well, then, let us give all the greater heed to one 
                    another'swords. The argument affirms that any change whatever 
                    except fromevil is the most dangerous of all things; this 
                    is true in the caseof the seasons and of the winds, in the 
                    management of our bodies andthe habits of our minds-true of 
                    all things except, as I said before,of the bad. He who looks 
                    at the constitution of individuals accustomedto eat any sort 
                    of meat, or drink any drink, or to do any work whichthey can 
                    get, may see that they are at first disordered by them, butafterwards, 
                    as time goes on, their bodies grow adapted to them, andthey 
                    learn to know and like variety, and have good health andenjoyment 
                    of life; and if ever afterwards they are confined again to 
                    asuperior diet, at first they are troubled with disorders, 
                    and withdifficulty become habituated to their new food. A 
                    similar principle wemay imagine to hold good about the minds 
                    of men and the natures oftheir souls. For when they have been 
                    brought up in certain laws, whichby some Divine Providence 
                    have remained unchanged during long ages, sothat no one has 
                    any memory or tradition of their ever having beenotherwise 
                    than they are, then every one is afraid and ashamed tochange 
                    that which is established. The legislator must somehow find 
                    away of implanting this reverence for antiquity, and I would 
                    proposethe following way:-People are apt to fancy, as I was 
                    saying before,that when the plays of children are altered 
                    they are merely plays, notseeing that the most serious and 
                    detrimental consequences arise out ofthe change; and they 
                    readily comply with the child's wishes instead ofdeterring 
                    him, not considering that these children who makeinnovations 
                    in their games, when they grow up to be men, will bedifferent 
                    from the last generation of children, and, beingdifferent, 
                    will desire a different sort of life, and under theinfluence 
                    of this desire will want other institutions and laws; and 
                    noone of them reflects that there will follow what I just 
                    now called thegreatest of evils to states. Changes in bodily 
                    fashions are no suchserious evils, but frequent changes in 
                    the praise and censure ofmanners are the greatest of evils, 
                    and require the utmost prevision.</p>
                  <p>Cle. To be sure.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And now do we still hold to our former assertion, thatrhythms 
                    and music in general are imitations of good and evilcharacters 
                    in men? What say you?</p>
                  <p>Cle. That is the only doctrine which we can admit.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Must we not, then, try in every possible way to prevent 
                    ouryouth from even desiring to imitate new modes either in 
                    dance or song?nor must any one be allowed to offer them varieties 
                    of pleasures.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Most true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Can any of us imagine a better mode of effecting this 
                    objectthan that of the Egyptians?</p>
                  <p>Cle. What is their method?</p>
                  <p>Ath. To consecrate every sort of dance or melody. First we 
                    shouldordain festivals-calculating for the year what they 
                    ought to be, andat what time, and in honour of what Gods, 
                    sons of Gods, and heroesthey ought to be celebrated; and, 
                    in the next place, what hymnsought to be sung at the several 
                    sacrifices, and with what dances theparticular festival is 
                    to be honoured. This has to be arranged atfirst by certain 
                    persons, and, when arranged, the whole assembly ofthe citizens 
                    are to offer sacrifices and libations to the Fates andall 
                    the other Gods, and to consecrate the several odes to gods 
                    andheroes: and if any one offers any other hymns or dances 
                    to any oneof the Gods, the priests and priestesses, acting 
                    in concert with theguardians of the law, shall, with the sanction 
                    of religion and thelaw, exclude him, and he who is excluded, 
                    if he do not submit, shallbe liable all his life long to have 
                    a suit of impiety broughtagainst him by any one who likes.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very good.</p>
                  <p>Ath. In the consideration of this subject, let us remember 
                    what isdue to ourselves.</p>
                  <p>Cle. To what are you referring?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I mean that any young man, and much more any old one, 
                    when hesees or hears anything strange or unaccustomed, does 
                    not at once runto embrace the paradox, but he stands considering, 
                    like a person whois at a place where three paths meet, and 
                    does not very well knowhis way-he may be alone or he may be 
                    walking with others, and hewill say to himself and them, &quot;Which 
                    is the way?&quot; and will not moveforward until he is satisfied 
                    that he is going right. And this is whatwe must do in the 
                    present instance:-A strange discussion on thesubject of law 
                    has arisen, which requires the utmost consideration,and we 
                    should not at our age be too ready to speak about such greatmatters, 
                    or be confident that we can say anything certain all in amoment.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Most true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then we will allow time for reflection, and decide when 
                    we havegiven the subject sufficient consideration. But that 
                    we may not behindered from completing the natural arrangement 
                    of our laws, let usproceed to the conclusion of them in due 
                    order; for very possibly,if God will, the exposition of them, 
                    when completed, may throw lighton our present perplexity.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Excellent, Stranger; let us do as you propose.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us then affirm the paradox that strains of music 
                    are ourlaws (nomoi), and this latter being the name which 
                    the ancients gaveto lyric songs, they probably would not have 
                    very much objected to ourproposed application of the word. 
                    Some one, either asleep or awake,must have had a dreamy suspicion 
                    of their nature. And let our decreebe as follows:-No one in 
                    singing or dancing shall offend againstpublic and consecrated 
                    models, and the general fashion among theyouth, any more than 
                    he would offend against any other law. And he whoobserves 
                    this law shall be blameless; but he who is disobedient, asI 
                    was saying, shall be punished by the guardians of the laws, 
                    and bythe priests and priestesses. Suppose that we imagine 
                    this to be ourlaw.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very good.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Can any one who makes such laws escape ridicule? Let 
                    us see.I think that our only safety will be in first framing 
                    certain modelsfor composers. One of these models shall be 
                    as follows:-If when asacrifice is going on, and the victims 
                    are being burnt according tolaw-if, I say, any one who may 
                    be a son or brother, standing byanother at the altar and over 
                    the victims, horribly blasphemes, willnot his words inspire 
                    despondency and evil omens and forebodings inthe mind of his 
                    father and of his other kinsmen?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Of course.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And this is just what takes place in almost all our 
                    cities. Amagistrate offers a public sacrifice, and there come 
                    in not one butmany choruses, who take up a position a little 
                    way from the altar, andfrom time to time pour forth all sorts 
                    of horrible blasphemies onthe sacred rites, exciting the souls 
                    of the audience with words andrhythms and melodies most sorrowful 
                    to hear; and he who at themoment when the city is offering 
                    sacrifice makes the citizens weepmost, carries away the palm 
                    of victory. Now, ought we not to forbidsuch strains as these? 
                    And if ever our citizens must hear suchlamentations, then 
                    on some unblest and inauspicious day let there bechoruses 
                    of foreign and hired minstrels, like those hirelings whoaccompany 
                    the departed at funerals with barbarous Carian chants.That 
                    is the sort of thing which will be appropriate if we have 
                    suchstrains at all; and let the apparel of the singers be, 
                    not circletsand ornaments of gold, but the reverse. Enough 
                    of all this. I willsimply ask once more whether we shall lay 
                    down as one of ourprinciples of song-</p>
                  <p>Cle. What?</p>
                  <p>Ath. That we should avoid every word of evil omen; let that 
                    kindof song which is of good omen be heard everywhere and 
                    always in ourstate. I need hardly ask again, but shall assume 
                    that you agree withme.</p>
                  <p>Cle. By all means; that law is approved by the suffrages 
                    of us all.</p>
                  <p>Ath. But what shall be our next musical law or type? Ought 
                    notprayers to be offered up to the Gods when we sacrifice?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And our third law, if I am not mistaken, will be to 
                    theeffect that our poets, understanding prayers to be requests 
                    which wemake to the Gods, will take especial heed that they 
                    do not bymistake ask for evil instead of good. To make such 
                    a prayer wouldsurely be too ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Were we not a little while ago quite convinced that 
                    no silveror golden Plutus should dwell in our state?</p>
                  <p>Cle. To be sure.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And what has it been the object of our argument to show? 
                    Did wenot imply that the poets are not always quite capable 
                    of knowingwhat is good or evil? And if one of them utters 
                    a mistaken prayer insong or words, he will make our citizens 
                    pray for the opposite of whatis good in matters of the highest 
                    import; than which, as I was saying,there can be few greater 
                    mistakes. Shall we then propose as one of ourlaws and models 
                    relating to the Muses-</p>
                  <p>Cle. What?-will you explain the law more precisely?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Shall we make a law that the poet shall compose nothingcontrary 
                    to the ideas of the lawful, or just, or beautiful, or good,which 
                    are allowed in the state? nor shall he be permitted tocommunicate 
                    his compositions to any private individuals, until heshall 
                    have shown them to the appointed judges and the guardians 
                    of thelaw, and they are satisfied with them. As to the persons 
                    whom weappoint to be our legislators about music and as to 
                    the director ofeducation, these have been already indicated. 
                    Once more then, as Ihave asked more than once, shall this 
                    be our third law, and type,and model-What do you say?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Let it be so, by all means.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then it will be proper to have hymns and praises of 
                    the Gods,intermingled with prayers; and after the Gods prayers 
                    and praisesshould be offered in like manner to demigods and 
                    heroes, suitable totheir several characters.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. In the next place there will be no objection to a law, 
                    thatcitizens who are departed and have done good and energetic 
                    deeds,either with their souls or with their bodies, and have 
                    been obedientto the laws, should receive eulogies; this will 
                    be very fitting.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Quite true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. But to honour with hymns and panegyrics those who are 
                    stillalive is not safe; a man should run his course, and make 
                    a fairending, and then we will praise him; and let praise 
                    be given equallyto women as well as men who have been distinguished 
                    in virtue. Theorder of songs and dances shall be as follows:-There 
                    are manyancient musical compositions and dances which are 
                    excellent, andfrom these the newly-founded city may freely 
                    select what is proper andsuitable; and they shall choose judges 
                    of not less than fifty years ofage, who shall make the selection, 
                    and any of the old poems which theydeem sufficient they shall 
                    include; any that are deficient oraltogether unsuitable, they 
                    shall either utterly throw aside, orexamine and amend, taking 
                    into their counsel poets and musicians,and making use of their 
                    poetical genius; but explaining to them thewishes of the legislator 
                    in order that they may regulate dancing,music, and all choral 
                    strains, according to the mind of the judges;and not allowing 
                    them to indulge, except in some few matters, theirindividual 
                    pleasures and fancies. Now the irregular strain of music isalways 
                    made ten thousand times better by attaining to law and order,and 
                    rejecting the honeyed Muse-not however that we mean wholly 
                    toexclude pleasure, which is the characteristic of all music. 
                    And if aman be brought up from childhood to the age of discretion 
                    and maturityin the use of the orderly and severe music, when 
                    he hears the oppositehe detests it, and calls it illiberal; 
                    but if trained in the sweet andvulgar music, he deems the 
                    severer kind cold and displeasing. So that,as I was saying 
                    before, while he who hears them gains no more pleasurefrom 
                    the one than from the other, the one has the advantage ofmaking 
                    those who are trained in it better men, whereas the other 
                    makesthem worse.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Again, we must distinguish and determine on some generalprinciple 
                    what songs are suitable to women, and what to men, andmust 
                    assign to them their proper melodies and rhythms. It isshocking 
                    for a whole harmony to be inharmonical, or for a rhythm to 
                    beunrhythmical, and this will happen when the melody is inappropriate 
                    tothem. And therefore the legislator must assign to these 
                    also theirforms. Now both sexes have melodies and rhythms 
                    which of necessitybelong to them; and those of women are clearly 
                    enough indicated bytheir natural difference. The grand, and 
                    that which tends tocourage, may be fairly called manly; but 
                    that which inclines tomoderation and temperance, may be declared 
                    both in law and in ordinaryspeech to be the more womanly quality. 
                    This, then, will be the generalorder of them.</p>
                  <p>Let us now speak of the manner of teaching and imparting 
                    them, andthe persons to whom, and the time when, they are 
                    severally to beimparted. As the shipwright first lays down 
                    the lines of the keel, andthus, as it were, draws the ship 
                    in outline, so do I seek todistinguish the patterns of life, 
                    and lay down their keels accordingto the nature of different 
                    men's souls; seeking truly to consider bywhat means, and in 
                    what ways, we may go through the voyage of lifebest. Now human 
                    affairs are hardly worth considering in earnest, andyet we 
                    must be in earnest about them-a sad necessity constrains us.And 
                    having got thus far, there will be a fitness in our completing 
                    thematter, if we can only find some suitable method of doing 
                    so. But whatdo I mean? Some one may ask this very question, 
                    and quite rightly,too.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I say that about serious matters a man should be serious, 
                    andabout a matter which is not serious he should not be, serious; 
                    andthat God is the natural and worthy object of our most serious 
                    andblessed endeavours, for man, as I said before, is made 
                    to be theplaything of God, and this, truly considered, is 
                    the best of him;wherefore also every man and woman should 
                    walk seriously, and passlife in the noblest of pastimes, and 
                    be of another mind from what theyare at present.</p>
                  <p>Cle. In what respect?</p>
                  <p>Ath. At present they think that their serious suits should 
                    be forthe sake of their sports, for they deem war a serious. 
                    pursuit,which must be managed well for the sake of peace; 
                    but the truth is,that there neither is, nor has been, nor 
                    ever will be, eitheramusement or instruction in any degree 
                    worth, speaking of in war,which is nevertheless deemed by 
                    us to be the most serious of ourpursuits. And therefore, as 
                    we say, every one of us should live thelife of peace as long 
                    and as well as he can. And what is the right wayof living? 
                    Are we to live in sports always? If so, in what kind ofsports? 
                    We ought to live sacrificing, and singing, and dancing, andthen 
                    a man will be able to propitiate the Gods, and to defendhimself 
                    against his enemies and conquer them in battle. The type ofsong 
                    or dance by which he will propitiate them has been described, 
                    andthe paths along which he is to proceed have been cut for 
                    him. Hewill go forward in the spirit of the poet:</p>
                  <p>Telemachus, some things thou wilt thyself find in thy heart, 
                    butother things God will suggest; for I deem that thou wast 
                    not broughtup without the will of the Gods.And this ought 
                    to be the view of our alumni; they ought to thinkthat what 
                    has been said is enough for them, and that any otherthings 
                    their Genius and God will suggest to them-he will tell themto 
                    whom, and when, and to what Gods severally they are to sacrificeand 
                    perform dances, and how they may propitiate the deities, andlive 
                    according to the appointment of nature; being for the most 
                    partpuppets, but having some little share of reality.</p>
                  <p>Megillus. You have a low opinion of mankind, Stranger.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Nay, Megillus, be not amazed, but forgive me:-I was 
                    comparingthem with the Gods; and under that feeling I spoke. 
                    Let us grant, ifyou wish, that the human race is not to be 
                    despised, but is worthyof some consideration.</p>
                  <p>Next follow the buildings for gymnasia and schools open to 
                    all;these are to be in three places in the midst of the city; 
                    andoutside the city and in the surrounding country, also in 
                    three places,there shall be schools for horse exercise, and 
                    large groundsarranged with a view to archery and the throwing 
                    of missiles, at whichyoung men may learn and practise. Of 
                    these mention has already beenmade, and if the mention be 
                    not sufficiently explicit, let us speak,further of them and 
                    embody them in laws. In these several schoolslet there be 
                    dwellings for teachers, who shall be brought from foreignparts 
                    by pay, and let them teach those who attend the schools theart 
                    of war and the art of music, and the children shall come notonly 
                    if their parents please, but if they do not please; there 
                    shallbe compulsory education, as the saying is, of all and 
                    sundry, as farthis is possible; and the pupils shall be regarded 
                    as belonging to thestate rather than to their parents. My 
                    law would apply to females aswell as males; they shall both 
                    go through the same exercises. I assertwithout fear of contradiction 
                    that gymnastic and horsemanship are assuitable to women as 
                    to men. Of the truth of this I am persuadedfrom ancient tradition, 
                    and at the present day there are said to becountless myriads 
                    of women in the neighbourhood of the Black Sea,called Sauromatides, 
                    who not only ride on horseback like men, but haveenjoined 
                    upon them the use of bows and other weapons equally withthe 
                    men. And I further affirm, that if these things are possible,nothing 
                    can be more absurd than the practice which prevails in our 
                    owncountry, of men and women not following the same pursuits 
                    with alltheir strength and with one mind, for thus the state, 
                    instead of beinga whole, is reduced to a half, but has the 
                    same imposts to pay and thesame toils to undergo; and what 
                    can be a greater mistake for anylegislator to make than this?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true; yet much of what has been asserted by us, 
                    Strangeris contrary to the custom of states; still, in saying 
                    that thediscourse should be allowed to proceed, and that when 
                    the discussionis completed, we should choose what seems best, 
                    you spoke veryproperly, and I now feel compunction for what 
                    I have said. Tell me,then, what you would next wish to say.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I should wish to say, Cleinias, as I said before, that 
                    if thepossibility of these things were not sufficiently proven 
                    in fact, thenthere might be an objection to the argument, 
                    but the fact being as Ihave said, he who rejects the law must 
                    find some other ground ofobjection; and, failing this, our 
                    exhortation will still hold good,nor will any one deny that 
                    women ought to share as far as possiblein education and in 
                    other ways with men. For consider;-if women do notshare in 
                    their whole life with men, then they must have some otherorder 
                    of life.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And what arrangement of life to be found anywhere is 
                    preferableto this community which we are now assigning to 
                    them? Shall weprefer that which is adopted by the Thracians 
                    and many other races whouse their women to till the ground 
                    and to be shepherds of theirherds and flocks, and to minister 
                    to them like slaves?-Or shall wedo as we and people in our 
                    part of the world do-getting together, asthe phrase is, all 
                    our goods and chattels into one dwelling, weentrust them to 
                    our women, who are the stewards of them, and whoalso preside 
                    over the shuttles and the whole art of spinning? Or shallwe 
                    take a middle course, in Lacedaemon, Megillus-letting the 
                    girlsshare in gymnastic and music, while the grown-up women, 
                    no longeremployed in spinning wool, are hard at work weaving 
                    the web of life,which will be no cheap or mean employment, 
                    and in the duty ofserving and taking care of the household 
                    and bringing up children,in which they will observe a sort 
                    of mean, not participating in thetoils of war; and if there 
                    were any necessity that they should fightfor their city and 
                    families, unlike the Amazons, they would beunable to take 
                    part in archery or any other skilled use of missiles,nor could 
                    they, after the example of the Goddess, carry shield orspear, 
                    or stand up nobly for their country when it was beingdestroyed, 
                    and strike terror into their enemies, if only becausethey 
                    were seen in regular order? Living as they do, they would 
                    neverdare at all to imitate the Sauromatides, who, when compared 
                    withordinary women, would appear to be like men. Let him who 
                    will,praise your legislators, but I must say what I think. 
                    The legislatorought to be whole and perfect, and not half 
                    a man only; he ought notto let the female sex live softly 
                    and waste money and have no order oflife, while he takes the 
                    utmost care of the male sex, and leaveshalf of life only blest 
                    with happiness, when he might have made thewhole state happy.</p>
                  <p>Meg. What shall we do, Cleinias? Shall we allow a stranger 
                    to rundown Sparta in this fashion?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes; for as we have given him liberty of speech we must 
                    let himgo on until we have perfected the work of legislation.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then now I may proceed?</p>
                  <p>Cle. By all means.</p>
                  <p>Ath. What will be the manner of life among men who may be 
                    supposedto have their food and clothing provided for them 
                    in moderation, andwho have entrusted the practice of the arts 
                    to others, and whosehusbandry, committed to slaves paying 
                    a part of the produce, bringsthem a return sufficient for 
                    men living temperately; who, moreover,have common tables in 
                    which the men are placed apart, and near themare the common 
                    tables of their families, of their daughters andmothers, which 
                    day by day, the officers, male and female, are toinspect-they 
                    shall see to the behaviour of the company, and so dismissthem; 
                    after which the presiding magistrate and his attendants shallhonour 
                    with libations those Gods to whom that day and night arededicated, 
                    and then go home? To men whose lives are thus ordered, isthere 
                    no work remaining to be done which is necessary and fitting, 
                    butshall each one of them live fattening like a beast? Such 
                    a life isneither just nor honourable, nor can he who lives 
                    it fail of meetinghis due; and the due reward of the idle 
                    fatted beast is that he shouldbe torn in pieces by some other 
                    valiant beast whose fatness is worndown by brave deeds and 
                    toil. These regulations, if we duly considerthem, will never 
                    be exactly carried into execution under presentcircumstances, 
                    nor as long as women and children and houses and allother 
                    things are the private property of individuals; but if we 
                    canattain the second-best form of polity, we shall be very 
                    well off.And to men living under this second polity there 
                    remains a work tobe accomplished which is far from being small 
                    or insignificant, but isthe greatest of all works, and ordained 
                    by the appointment ofrighteous law. For the life which may 
                    be truly said to be concernedwith the virtue of body and soul 
                    is twice, or more than twice, as fullof toil and trouble as 
                    the pursuit after Pythian and Olympicvictories, which debars 
                    a man from every employment of life. For thereought to be 
                    no bye-work interfering with the greater work of providingthe 
                    necessary exercise and nourishment for the body, and instructionand 
                    education for the soul. Night and day are not long enough 
                    forthe accomplishment of their perfection and consummation; 
                    and thereforeto this end all freemen ought to arrange the 
                    way in which they willspend their time during the whole course 
                    of the day, from morning tillevening and from evening till 
                    the morning of the next sunrise. Theremay seem to be some 
                    impropriety in the legislator determining minutelythe numberless 
                    details of the management of the house, includingsuch particulars 
                    as the duty of wakefulness in those who are to beperpetual 
                    watchmen of the whole city; for that any citizen shouldcontinue 
                    during the whole of any night in sleep, instead of being seenby 
                    all his servants, always the first to awake and get up-this,whether 
                    the regulation is to be called a law or only a practice,should 
                    be deemed base and unworthy of a freeman; also that themistress 
                    of the house should be awakened by her handmaidens instead 
                    ofherself first awakening them, is what the slaves, male and 
                    female, andthe serving-boys, and, if that were possible, everybody 
                    and everythingin the house should regard as base. If they 
                    rise early, they may allof them do much of their public and 
                    of their household business, asmagistrates in the city, and 
                    masters and mistresses in their privatehouses, before the 
                    sun is up. Much sleep is not required by nature,either for 
                    our souls or bodies, or for the actions which they perform.For 
                    no one who is asleep is good for anything, any more than if 
                    hewere dead; but he of us who has the most regard for life 
                    and reasonkeeps awake as long he can, reserving only so much 
                    time for sleep asis expedient for health; and much sleep is 
                    not required, if thehabit of moderation be once rightly formed. 
                    Magistrates in stateswho keep awake at night are terrible 
                    to the bad, whether enemies orcitizens, and are honoured and 
                    reverenced by the just and temperate,and are useful to themselves 
                    and to the whole state.</p>
                  <p>A night which is passed in such a manner, in addition to 
                    all theabove-mentioned advantages, infuses a sort of courage 
                    into the mindsof the citizens. When the day breaks, the time 
                    has arrived for youthto go to their schoolmasters. Now neither 
                    sheep nor any otheranimals can live without a shepherd, nor 
                    can children be leftwithout tutors, or slaves without masters. 
                    And of all animals theboy is the most unmanageable, inasmuch 
                    as he has the fountain ofreason in him not yet regulated; 
                    he is the most insidious,sharp-witted, and insubordinate of 
                    animals. Wherefore he must be boundwith many bridles; in the 
                    first place, when he gets away frommothers and nurses, he 
                    must be under the management of tutors onaccount of his childishness 
                    and foolishness; then, again, being afreeman, he must be controlled 
                    by teachers, no matter what they teach,and by studies; but 
                    he is also a slave, and in that regard any freemanwho comes 
                    in his way may punish him and his tutor and hisinstructor, 
                    if any of them does anything wrong; and he who comesacross 
                    him and does not inflict upon him the punishment which hedeserves, 
                    shall incur the greatest disgrace; and let the guardian ofthe 
                    law, who is the director of education, see to him who coming 
                    inthe way of the offences which we have mentioned, does not 
                    chastisethem when he ought, or chastises them in a way which 
                    he ought not; lethim keep a sharp look-out, and take especial 
                    care of the training ofour children, directing their natures, 
                    and always turning them to goodaccording to the law.</p>
                  <p>But how can our law sufficiently train the director of education.himself; 
                    for as yet all has been imperfect, and nothing has beensaid 
                    either clear or satisfactory? Now, as far as possible, the 
                    lawought to leave nothing to him, but to explain everything, 
                    that hemay be an interpreter and tutor to others. About dances 
                    and musicand choral strains, I have already spoken both to 
                    the character of theselection of them, and the manner in which 
                    they are to be amendedand consecrated. But we have not as 
                    yet spoken, O illustrious guardianof education, of the manner 
                    in which your pupils are to use thosestrains which are written 
                    in prose, although you have been informedwhat martial strains 
                    they are to learn and practise; what relates inthe first place 
                    to the learning of letters, and secondly, to the lyre,and 
                    also to calculation, which, as we were saying, is needful 
                    for themall to learn, and any other things which are required 
                    with a view towar and the management of house and city, and, 
                    looking to the sameobject, what is useful in the revolutions 
                    of the heavenly bodies-thestars and sun and moon, and the 
                    various regulations about thesematters which are necessary 
                    for the whole state-I am speaking of thearrangements of; days 
                    in periods of months, and of months in years,which are to 
                    be observed, in order that seasons and sacrifices andfestivals 
                    may have their regular and natural order, and keep thecity 
                    alive and awake, the Gods receiving the honours due to them,and 
                    men having a better understanding about them: all these things,O 
                    my friend, have not yet been sufficiently declared to you 
                    by thelegislator. Attend, then, to what I am now going to 
                    say:-We weretelling you, in the first place, that you were 
                    not sufficientlyinformed about letters, and the objection 
                    was to this effect-thatyou were never told whether he who 
                    was meant to be a respectablecitizen should apply himself 
                    in detail to that sort of learning, ornot apply himself at 
                    all; and the same remark holds good of thestudy of the lyre. 
                    But now we say that he ought to attend to them. Afair time 
                    for a boy of ten years old to spend in letters is threeyears; 
                    the age of thirteen is the proper time for him to begin tohandle 
                    the lyre, and he may continue at this for another threeyears, 
                    neither more nor less, and whether his father or himself likeor 
                    dislike the study, he is not to be allowed to spend more or 
                    lesstime in learning music than the law allows. And let him 
                    who disobeysthe law be deprived of those youthful honours 
                    of which we shallhereafter speak. Hear, however, first of 
                    all, what the young oughtto learn in the early years of life, 
                    and what their instructorsought to teach them. They ought 
                    to be occupied with their lettersuntil they are to read and 
                    write; but the acquisition of perfectbeauty or quickness in 
                    writinig, if nature has not stimulated themto acquire these 
                    accomplishments in the given number of years, theyshould let 
                    alone. And as to the learning of compositions committedto 
                    writing which are not set to the lyre, whether metrical orwithout 
                    rhythmical divisions, compositions in prose, as they aretermed, 
                    having no rhythm or harmony-seeing how dangerous are thewritings 
                    handed down to us by many writers of this class-what will 
                    youdo with them, O most excellent guardians of the law? or 
                    how can thelawgiver rightly direct you about them? I believe 
                    that he will be ingreat difficulty.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What troubles you, Stranger? and why are you so perplexed 
                    inyour mind?</p>
                  <p>Ath. You naturally ask, Cleinias, and to you and Megillus, 
                    who aremy partners in the work of legislation, I must state 
                    the moredifficult as well as the easier parts of the task.</p>
                  <p>Cle. To what do you refer in this instance?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I will tell you. There is a difficulty in opposing many 
                    myriadsof mouths.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Well, and have we not already opposed the popular voice 
                    in manyimportant enactments?</p>
                  <p>Ath. That is quite true; and you mean to imply, that the 
                    roadwhich we are taking may be disagreeable to some but is 
                    agreeable to asmany others, or if not to as many, at any rate 
                    to persons not inferiorto the others, and in company with 
                    them you bid me, at whateverrisk, to proceed along the path 
                    of legislation which has opened out ofour present discourse, 
                    and to be of good cheer, and not to faint.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And I do not faint; I say, indeed, that we have a great 
                    manypoets writing in hexameter, trimeter, and all sorts of 
                    measures-somewho are serious, others who aim only at raising 
                    a laugh-and allmankind declare that the youth who are rightly 
                    educated should bebrought up in them and saturated with them; 
                    some insist that theyshould be constantly hearing them read 
                    aloud, and always learningthem, so as to get by heart entire 
                    poets; while others select choicepassages and long speeches, 
                    and make compendiums of them, sayingthat these ought to be 
                    committed to memory, if a man is to be madegood and wise by 
                    experience and learning of many things. And youwant me now 
                    to tell them plainly in what they are right and in whatthey 
                    are wrong.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes, I do. Ath. But how can I in one word rightly comprehend 
                    all of them? I amof opinion, and, if I am not mistaken, there 
                    is a general agreement,that every one of these poets has said 
                    many things well and manythings the reverse of well; and if 
                    this be true, then I do affirm thatmuch learning is dangerous 
                    to youth.</p>
                  <p>Cle. How would you advise the guardian of the law to act?</p>
                  <p>Ath. In what respect?</p>
                  <p>Cle. I mean to what pattern should he look as his guide inpermitting 
                    the young to learn some things and forbidding them to learnothers. 
                    Do not shrink from answering.</p>
                  <p>Ath. My good Cleinias, I rather think that I am fortunate.</p>
                  <p>Cle. How so?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I think that I am not wholly in want of a pattern, for 
                    when Iconsider the words which we have spoken from early dawn 
                    until now, andwhich, as I believe, have been inspired by Heaven, 
                    they appear to meto be quite like a poem. When I reflected 
                    upon all these words ofours. I naturally felt pleasure, for 
                    of all the discourses which Ihave ever learnt or heard, either 
                    in poetry or prose, this seemed tome to be the justest, and 
                    most suitable for young men to hear; Icannot imagine any better 
                    pattern than this which the guardian ofthe law who is also 
                    the director of education can have. He cannot dobetter than 
                    advise the teachers to teach the young these words and anywhich 
                    are of a like nature, if he should happen to find them, eitherin 
                    poetry or prose, or if he come across unwritten discourses 
                    akinto ours, he should certainly preserve them, and commit 
                    them towriting. And, first of all, he shall constrain the 
                    teachers themselvesto learn and approve them, and any of them 
                    who will not, shall notbe employed by him, but those whom 
                    he finds agreeing in hisjudgment, he shall make use of and 
                    shall commit to them theinstruction and education of youth. 
                    And here and on this wise let myfanciful tale about letters 
                    and teachers of letters come to an end.</p>
                  <p>Cle. I do not think, Stranger, that we have wandered out 
                    of theproposed limits of the argument; but whether we are 
                    right or not inour whole conception, I cannot be very certain.</p>
                  <p>Ath. The truth, Cleinias, may be expected to become clearer 
                    when, aswe have often said, we arrive at the end of the whole 
                    discussion aboutlaws.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And now that we have done with the teacher of letters, 
                    theteacher of the lyre has to receive orders from us.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I think that we have only to recollect our previousdiscussions, 
                    and we shall be able to give suitable regulationstouching 
                    all this part of instruction and education to the teachers 
                    ofthe lyre.</p>
                  <p>Cle. To what do you refer?</p>
                  <p>Ath. We were saying, if I remember rightly, that thesixty-year-old 
                    choristers of Dionysus were to be specially quick intheir 
                    perceptions of rhythm and musical composition, that they mightbe 
                    able to distinguish good and bad imitation, that is to say, 
                    theimitation of the good or bad soul when under the influence 
                    of passion,rejecting the one and displaying the other in hymns 
                    and songs,charming the souls of youth, and inviting them to 
                    follow and attainvirtue by the way of imitation.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And with this view, the teacher and the learner ought 
                    to usethe sounds of the lyre, because its notes are pure, 
                    the player whoteaches and his pupil rendering note for note 
                    in unison; butcomplexity, and variation of notes, when the 
                    strings give one soundand the poet or composer of the melody 
                    gives another-also when theymake concords and harmonies in 
                    which lesser and greater intervals,slow and quick, or high 
                    and low notes, are combined-or, again, whenthey make complex 
                    variations of rhythms, which they adapt to the notesof the 
                    lyre-all that sort of thing is not suited to those who haveto 
                    acquire a speedy and useful knowledge of music in three years;for 
                    opposite principles are confusing, and create a difficulty 
                    inlearning, and our young men should learn quickly, and their 
                    merenecessary acquirements are not few or trifling, as will 
                    be shown indue course. Let the director of education attend 
                    to the principlesconcerning music which we are laying down. 
                    As to the songs and wordsthemselves which the masters of choruses 
                    are to teach and thecharacter of them, they have been already 
                    described by us, and are thesame which, when consecrated and 
                    adapted to the different festivals,we said were to benefit 
                    cities by affording them an innocentamusement.</p>
                  <p>Cle. That, again, is true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then let him who has been elected a director of music 
                    receivethese rules from us as containing the very truth; and 
                    may he prosperin his office! Let us now proceed to lay down 
                    other rules inaddition to the preceding about dancing and 
                    gymnastic exercise ingeneral. Having said what remained to 
                    be said about the teaching ofmusic, let us speak in like manner 
                    about gymnastic. For boys and girlsought to learn to dance 
                    and practise gymnastic exercises-ought theynot?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then the boys ought to have dancing masters, and the 
                    girlsdancing mistresses to exercise them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very good.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then once more let us summon him who has the chief concern 
                    inthe business, the superintendent of youth [i.e., the director 
                    ofeducation]; he will have plenty to do, if he is to have 
                    the chargeof music and gymnastic.</p>
                  <p>Cle. But how will old man be able to attend to such great 
                    charges?</p>
                  <p>Ath. O my friend, there will be no difficulty, for the law 
                    hasalready given and will give him permission to select as 
                    his assistantsin this charge any citizens, male or female, 
                    whom he desires; and hewill know whom he ought to choose, 
                    and will be anxious not to make amistake, from a due sense 
                    of responsibility, and from aconsciousness of the importance 
                    of his office, and also because hewill consider that if young 
                    men have been and are well brought up,then all things go swimmingly, 
                    but if not, it is not meet to say,nor do we say, what will 
                    follow, lest the regarders of omens shouldtake alarm about 
                    our infant state. Many things have been said by usabout dancing 
                    and about gymnastic movements in general; for we includeunder 
                    gymnastics all military exercises, such as archery, and allhurling 
                    of weapons, and the use of the light shield, and allfighting 
                    with heavy arms, and military evolutions, and movements ofarmies, 
                    and encampings, and all that relates to horsemanship. Of allthese 
                    things there ought to be public teachers, receiving pay from 
                    thestate, and their pupils should be the men and boys in the 
                    state, andalso the girls and women, who are to know all these 
                    things. While theyare yet girls they should have practised 
                    dancing in arms and the wholeart of fighting-when grown-up 
                    women, they should apply themselves toevolutions and tactics, 
                    and the mode of grounding and taking uparms; if for no other 
                    reason, yet in case the whole military forceshould have to 
                    leave the city and carry on operations of waroutside, that 
                    those who will have to guard the young and the rest ofthe 
                    city may be equal to the task; and, on the other hand, whenenemies, 
                    whether barbarian or Hellenic, come from without withmighty 
                    force and make a violent assault upon them, and thus compelthem 
                    to fight for the possession of the city, which is far frombeing 
                    an impossibility, great would be the disgrace to the state, 
                    ifthe women had been so miserably trained that they could 
                    not fightfor their young, as birds will, against any creature 
                    however strong,and die or undergo any danger, but must instantly 
                    rush to thetemples and crowd at the altars and shrines, and 
                    bring upon humannature the reproach, that of all animals man 
                    is the most cowardly!</p>
                  <p>Cle. Such a want of education, Stranger, is certainly an 
                    unseemlything to happen in a state, as well as a great misfortune.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Suppose that we carry our law to the extent of saying 
                    thatwomen ought not to neglect military matters, but that 
                    all citizens,male and female alike, shall attend to them?</p>
                  <p>Cle. I quite agree.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Of wrestling we have spoken in part, but of what I shouldcall 
                    the most important part we have not spoken, and cannot easilyspeak 
                    without showing at the same time by gesture as well as in 
                    wordwhat we mean; when word and action combine, and not till 
                    then, weshall explain clearly what has been said, pointing 
                    out that of allmovements wrestling is most akin to the military 
                    art, and is to bepursued for the sake of this, and not this 
                    for the sake of wrestling.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Excellent.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Enough of wrestling; we will now proceed to speak of 
                    othermovements of the body. Such motion may be in general 
                    called dancing,and is of two kinds: one of nobler figures, 
                    imitating thehonourable, the other of the more ignoble figures, 
                    imitating the mean;and of both these there are two further 
                    subdivisions. Of theserious, one kind is of those engaged 
                    in war and vehement action,and is the exercise of a noble 
                    person and a manly heart; the otherexhibits a temperate soul 
                    in the enjoyment of prosperity and modestpleasures, and may 
                    be truly called and is the dance of peace. Thewarrior dance 
                    is different from the peaceful one, and may be rightlytermed 
                    Pyrrhic; this imitates the modes of avoiding blows and missilesby 
                    dropping or giving way, or springing aside, or rising up or 
                    fallingdown; also the opposite postures which are those of 
                    action, as, forexample, the imitation of archery and the hurling 
                    of javelins, andof all sorts of blows. And when the imitation 
                    is of brave bodies andsouls, and the action is direct and 
                    muscular, giving for the most parta straight movement to the 
                    limbs of the body-that, I say, is thetrue sort; but the opposite 
                    is not right. In the dance of peace whatwe have to consider 
                    is whether a man bears himself naturally andgracefully, and 
                    after the manner of men who duly conform to the law.But before 
                    proceeding I must distinguish the dancing about which thereis 
                    any doubt, from that about which there is no doubt. Which 
                    is thedoubtful kind, and how are the two to be distinguished? 
                    There aredances of the Bacchic sort, both those in which, 
                    as they say, theyimitate drunken men, and which are named 
                    after the Nymphs, and Pan,and Silenuses, and Satyrs; and also 
                    those in which purifications aremade or mysteries celebrated-all 
                    this sort of dancing cannot berightly defined as having either 
                    a peaceful or a warlike character, orindeed as having any 
                    meaning whatever and may, I think, be mosttruly described 
                    as distinct from the warlike dance, and distinctfrom the peaceful, 
                    and not suited for a city at all. There let it lie;and so 
                    leaving it to lie, we will proceed to the dances of war andpeace, 
                    for with these we are undoubtedly concerned. Now theunwarlike 
                    muse, which honours in dance the Gods and the sons of theGods, 
                    is entirely associated with the consciousness of prosperity;this 
                    class may be subdivided into two lesser classes, of which 
                    oneis expressive of an escape from some labour or danger into 
                    good, andhas greater pleasures, the other expressive of preservation 
                    andincrease of former good, in which the pleasure is less 
                    exciting;-inall these cases, every man when the pleasure is 
                    greater, moves hisbody more, and less when the pleasure is 
                    less; and, again, if he bemore orderly and has learned courage 
                    from discipline he waves less,but if he be a coward, and has 
                    no training or self-control, he makesgreater and more violent 
                    movements, and in general when he is speakingor singing he 
                    is not altogether able to keep his body still; and soout of 
                    the imitation of words in gestures the whole art of dancing 
                    hasarisen. And in these various kinds of imitation one man 
                    moves in anorderly, another in a disorderly manner; and as 
                    the ancients may beobserved to have given many names which 
                    are according to nature anddeserving of praise, so there is 
                    an excellent one which they havegiven to the dances of men 
                    who in their times of prosperity aremoderate in their pleasures-the 
                    giver of names, whoever he was,assigned to them a very true, 
                    and poetical, and rational name, when hecalled them Emmeleiai, 
                    or dances of order, thus establishing two kindsof dances of 
                    the nobler sort, the dance of war which he called thePyrrhic, 
                    and the dance of peace which he called Emmeleia, or the danceof 
                    order; giving to each their appropriate and becoming name. 
                    Thesethings the legislator should indicate in general outline, 
                    and theguardian of the law should enquire into them and search 
                    them out,combining dancing with music, and assigning to the 
                    several sacrificialfeasts that which is suitable to them; 
                    and when he has consecrated allof them in due order, he shall 
                    for the future change nothing,whether of dance or song. Thenceforward 
                    the city and the citizensshall continue to have the same pleasures, 
                    themselves being as faras possible alike, and shall live well 
                    and happily.</p>
                  <p>I have described the dances which are appropriate to noble 
                    bodiesand generous souls. But it is necessary also to consider 
                    and knowuncomely persons and thoughts, and those which are 
                    intended to producelaughter in comedy, and have a comic character 
                    in respect of style,song, and dance, and of the imitations 
                    which these afford. For seriousthings cannot be understood 
                    without laughable things, nor opposites atall without opposites, 
                    if a man is really to have intelligence ofeither; but he can 
                    not carry out both in action, if he is to haveany degree of 
                    virtue. And for this very reason he should learn themboth, 
                    in order that he may not in ignorance do or say anything whichis 
                    ridiculous and out of place-he should command slaves and hiredstrangers 
                    to imitate such things, but he should never take any seriousinterest 
                    in them himself, nor should any freeman or freewoman bediscovered 
                    taking pains to learn them; and there should always be someelement 
                    of novelty in the imitation. Let these then be laid down, 
                    bothin law and in our discourse, as the regulations of laughableamusements 
                    which are generally called comedy. And, if any of theserious 
                    poets, as they are termed, who write tragedy, come to us andsay-&quot;O 
                    strangers, may we go to your city and country or may we not,and 
                    shall we bring with us our poetry-what is your will about 
                    thesematters?&quot;-how shall we answer the divine men? I 
                    think that ouranswer should be as follows:-Best of strangers, 
                    we will say to them,we also according to our ability are tragic 
                    poets, and our tragedyis the best and noblest; for our whole 
                    state is an imitation of thebest and noblest life, which we 
                    affirm to be indeed the very truthof tragedy. You are poets 
                    and we are poets, both makers of the samestrains, rivals and 
                    antagonists in the noblest of dramas, which truelaw can alone 
                    perfect, as our hope is. Do not then suppose that weshall 
                    all in a moment allow you to erect your stage in the agora, 
                    orintroduce the fair voices of your actors, speaking above 
                    our own,and permit you to harangue our women and children, 
                    and the commonpeople, about our institutions, in language 
                    other than our own, andvery often the opposite of our own. 
                    For a state would be mad whichgave you this licence, until 
                    the magistrates had determined whetheryour poetry might be 
                    recited, and was fit for publication or not.Wherefore, O ye 
                    sons and scions of the softer Muses, first of all showyour 
                    songs to the magistrates, and let them compare them with our 
                    own,and if they are the same or better we will give you a 
                    chorus; but ifnot, then, my friends, we cannot. Let these, 
                    then, be the customsordained by law about all dances and the 
                    teaching of them, and letmatters relating to slaves be separated 
                    from those relating tomasters, if you do not object.</p>
                  <p>Cle. We can have no hesitation in assenting when you put 
                    thematter thus.</p>
                  <p>Ath. There still remain three studies suitable for freemen.Arithmetic 
                    is one of them; the measurement of length, surface, anddepth 
                    is the second; and the third has to do with the revolutions 
                    ofthe stars in relation to one another. Not every one has 
                    need to toilthrough all these things in a strictly scientific 
                    manner, but only afew, and who they are to be we will hereafter 
                    indicate at the end,which will be the proper place; not to 
                    know what is necessary formankind in general, and what is 
                    the truth, is disgraceful to everyone: and yet to enter into 
                    these matters minutely is neither easy, norat all possible 
                    for every one; but there is something in them which isnecessary 
                    and cannot be set aside, and probably he who made theproverb 
                    about God originally had this in view when he said, that&quot;not 
                    even God himself can fight against necessity&quot;;-he meant, 
                    if Iam not mistaken, divine necessity; for as to the human 
                    necessitiesof which the many speak, when they talk in this 
                    manner, nothing can bemore ridiculous than such an application 
                    of the words.</p>
                  <p>Cle. And what necessities of knowledge are there, Stranger, 
                    whichare divine and not human?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I conceive them to be those of which he who has no use 
                    norany knowledge at all cannot be a God, or demi-god, or hero 
                    to mankind,or able to take any serious thought or charge of 
                    them. And very unlikea divine man would he be, who is unable 
                    to count one, two, three, orto distinguish odd and even numbers, 
                    or is unable to count at all,or reckon night and day, and 
                    who is totally unacquainted with therevolution of the sun 
                    and moon, and the other stars. There would begreat folly in 
                    supposing that all these are not necessary parts ofknowledge 
                    to him who intends to know anything about the highestkinds 
                    of knowledge; but which these are, and how many there are 
                    ofthem, and when they are to be learned, and what is to be 
                    learnedtogether and what apart, and the whole correlation 
                    of them, must berightly apprehended first; and these leading 
                    the way we may proceed tothe other parts of knowledge. For 
                    so necessity grounded in natureconstrains us, against which 
                    we say that no God contends, or ever willcontend.</p>
                  <p>Cle. I think, Stranger, that what you have now said is very 
                    true andagreeable to nature.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Yes, Cleinias, that is so. But it is difficult for thelegislator 
                    to begin with these studies; at a more convenient time wewill 
                    make regulations for them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. You seem, Stranger, to be afraid of our habitual ignorance 
                    ofthe subject: there is no reason why that should prevent 
                    you fromspeaking out.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I certainly am afraid of the difficulties to which youallude, 
                    but I am still more afraid of those who apply themselves tothis 
                    sort of knowledge, and apply themselves badly. For entireignorance 
                    is not so terrible or extreme an evil, and is far from beingthe 
                    greatest of all; too much cleverness and too much learning,accompanied 
                    with an ill bringing up, are far more fatal.</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. All freemen, I conceive, should learn as much of these 
                    branchesof knowledge as every child in Egypt is taught when 
                    he learns thealphabet. In that country arithmetical games 
                    have been invented forthe use of mere children, which they 
                    learn as a pleasure andamusement. They have to distribute 
                    apples and garlands, using the samenumber sometimes for a 
                    larger and sometimes for a lesser number ofpersons; and they 
                    arrange pugilists, and wrestlers as they pairtogether by lot 
                    or remain over, and show how their turns come innatural order. 
                    Another mode of amusing them is to distributevessels, sometimes 
                    of gold, brass, silver, and the like, intermixedwith one another, 
                    sometimes of one metal only; as I was saying theyadapt to 
                    their amusement the numbers in common use, and in this waymake 
                    more intelligible to their pupils the arrangements andmovements 
                    of armies and expeditions, in the management of ahousehold 
                    they make people more useful to themselves, and more wideawake; 
                    and again in measurements of things which have length, andbreadth, 
                    and depth, they free us from that natural ignorance of allthese 
                    things which is so ludicrous and disgraceful.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What kind of ignorance do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. O my dear Cleinias, I, like yourself, have late in life 
                    heardwith amazement of our ignorance in these matters; to 
                    me we appear tobe more like pigs than men, and I am quite 
                    ashamed, not only ofmyself, but of all Hellenes.</p>
                  <p>Cle. About what? Say, Stranger, what you mean.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I will; or rather I will show you my meaning by a question, 
                    anddo you please to answer me: You know, I suppose, what length 
                    is?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And what breadth is?</p>
                  <p>Cle. To be sure.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And you know that these are two distinct things, and 
                    that thereis a third thing called depth?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Of course.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And do not all these seem to you to be commensurable 
                    withthemselves?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Ath. That is to say, length is naturally commensurable withlength, 
                    and breadth with breadth, and depth in like manner with depth?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Undoubtedly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. But if some things are commensurable and others whollyincommensurable, 
                    and you think that all things are commensurable, whatis your 
                    position in regard to them?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Clearly, far from good.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Concerning length and breadth when compared with depth, 
                    orbreadth when and length when compared with one another, 
                    are not allthe Hellenes agreed that these are commensurable 
                    with one in some way?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Quite true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. But if they are absolutely incommensurable, and yet 
                    all of usregard them as commensurable, have we not reason 
                    to be ashamed ofour compatriots; and might we not say to them:-O 
                    ye best ofHellenes, is not this one of the things of which 
                    we were saying thatnot to know them is disgraceful, and of 
                    which to have a bare knowledgeonly is no great distinction?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And there are other things akin to these, in which there 
                    springup other errors of the same family.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What are they?</p>
                  <p>Ath. The natures of commensurable and incommensurable quantitiesin 
                    their relation to one another. A man who is good for a thingought 
                    to be able, when he thinks, to distinguish them; and differentpersons 
                    should compete with one another in asking questions, whichwill 
                    be a fair, better and more graceful way of passing their timethan 
                    the old man's game of draughts.</p>
                  <p>Cle. I dare say; and these pastimes are not so very unlike 
                    a game ofdraughts.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And these, as I maintain, Cleinias, are the studies 
                    which ouryouth ought to learn, for they are innocent and not 
                    difficult; thelearning of them will be an amusement, and they 
                    will benefit thestate. If anyone is of another mind, let him 
                    say what he has to say.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then if these studies are such as we maintain we will 
                    includethem; if not, they shall be excluded.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Assuredly: but may we not now, Stranger, prescribe thesestudies 
                    as necessary, and so fill up the lacunae of our laws?</p>
                  <p>Ath. They shall be regarded as pledges which may be hereafterredeemed 
                    and removed from our state, if they do not please either uswho 
                    give them, or you who accept them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. A fair condition.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Next let us see whether we are or are not willing that 
                    thestudy of astronomy shall be proposed for our youth.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Proceed.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Here occurs a strange phenomenon, which certainly cannot 
                    in anypoint of view be tolerated.</p>
                  <p>Cle. To what are you referring?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Men say that we ought not to enquire into the supreme 
                    God andthe nature of the universe, nor busy ourselves in searching 
                    out thecauses of things, and that such enquiries are impious; 
                    whereas thevery opposite is the truth.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Perhaps what I am saying may seem paradoxical, and atvariance 
                    with the usual language of age. But when any one has any goodand 
                    true notion which is for the advantage of the state and in 
                    everyway acceptable to God, he cannot abstain from expressing 
                    it.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Your words are reasonable enough; but shall we find 
                    any good ortrue notion about the stars?</p>
                  <p>Ath. My good friends, at this hour all of us Hellenes tell 
                    lies,if I may use such an expression, about those great Gods, 
                    the Sun andthe Moon.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Lies of what nature?</p>
                  <p>Ath. We say that they and divers other stars do not keep 
                    the samepath, and we call them planets or wanderers.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true, Stranger; and in the course of my life I 
                    haveoften myself seen the morning star and the evening star 
                    and diversothers not moving in their accustomed course, but 
                    wandering out oftheir path in all manner of ways, and I have 
                    seen the sun and moondoing what we all know that they do.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Just so, Megillus and Cleinias; and I maintain that 
                    ourcitizens and our youth ought to learn about the nature 
                    of the Godsin heaven, so far as to be able to offer sacrifices 
                    and pray to themin pious language, and not to blaspheme about 
                    them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. There you are right if such a knowledge be only attainable; 
                    andif we are wrong in our mode of speaking now, and can be 
                    betterinstructed and learn to use better language, then I 
                    quite agree withyou that such a degree of knowledge as will 
                    enable us to speak rightlyshould be acquired by us. And now 
                    do you try to explain to us yourwhole meaning, and we, on 
                    our part, will endeavour to understand you.</p>
                  <p>Ath. There is some difficulty in understanding my meaning, 
                    but not avery great one, nor will any great length of time 
                    be required. Andof this I am myself a proof; for I did not 
                    know these things long ago,nor in the days of my youth, and 
                    yet I can explain them to you in abrief space of time; whereas 
                    if they had been difficult I couldcertainly never have explained 
                    them all, old as I am, to old menlike yourselves.</p>
                  <p>Cle. True; but what is this study which you describe as wonderfuland 
                    fitting for youth to learn, but of which we are ignorant? 
                    Tryand explain the nature of it to us as clearly as you can.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I will. For, O my good friends, that other doctrine 
                    about thewandering of the sun and the moon and the other stars 
                    is not thetruth, but the very reverse of the truth. Each of 
                    them moves in thesame path-not in many paths, but in one only, 
                    which is circular, andthe varieties are only apparent. Nor 
                    are we right in supposing thatthe swiftest of them is the 
                    slowest, nor conversely, that theslowest is the quickest. 
                    And if what I say is true, only justimagine that we had a 
                    similar notion about horses running atOlympia, or about men 
                    who ran in the long course, and that weaddressed the swiftest 
                    as the slowest and the slowest as the swiftest,and sang the 
                    praises of the vanquished as though he were thevictor,-in 
                    that case our praises would not be true, nor very agreeableto 
                    the runners, though they be but men; and now, to commit the 
                    sameerror about the Gods which would have been ludicrous and 
                    erroneousin the case of men-is not that ludicrous and erroneous?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Worse than ludicrous, I should say.</p>
                  <p>Ath. At all events, the Gods cannot like us to be spreading 
                    afalse report of them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Most true, if such is the fact.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And if we can show that such is really the fact, then 
                    all thesematters ought to be learned so far as is necessary 
                    for the avoidanceof impiety; but if we cannot, they may be 
                    let alone, and let this beour decision.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very good.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Enough of laws relating to education and learning. Buthunting 
                    and similar pursuits in like manner claim our attention. Forthe 
                    legislator appears to have a duty imposed upon him which goesbeyond 
                    mere legislation. There is something over and above law whichlies 
                    in a region between admonition and law, and has several timesoccurred 
                    to us in the course of discussion; for example, in theeducation 
                    of very young children there were things, as we maintain,which 
                    are not to be defined, and to regard them as matters of positivelaw 
                    is a great absurdity. Now, our laws and the whole constitutionof 
                    our state having been thus delineated, the praise of the virtuouscitizen 
                    is not complete when he is described as the person whoserves 
                    the laws best and obeys them most, but the higher form ofpraise 
                    is that which describes him as the good citizen who passesthrough 
                    life undefiled and is obedient to the words of the legislator,both 
                    when he is giving laws and when he assigns praise and blame. 
                    Thisis the truest word that can be spoken in praise of a citizen; 
                    andthe true legislator ought not only to write his laws, but 
                    also tointerweave with them all such things as seem to him 
                    honourable anddishonourable. And the perfect citizen ought 
                    to seek to strengthenthese no less than the principles of 
                    law which are sanctioned bypunishments. I will adduce an example 
                    which will clear up mymeaning, and will be a sort of witness 
                    to my words. Hunting is of wideextent, and has a name under 
                    which many things are included, for thereis a hunting of creatures 
                    in the water, and of creatures in the air,and there is a great 
                    deal of hunting of land animals of all kinds, andnot of wild 
                    beasts only. The hunting after man is also worthy ofconsideration; 
                    there is the hunting after him in war, and there isoften a 
                    hunting after him in the way of friendship, which is praisedand 
                    also blamed; and there is thieving, and the hunting which 
                    ispractised by robbers, and that of armies against armies. 
                    Now thelegislator, in laying down laws about hunting, can 
                    neither abstainfrom noting these things, nor can he make threatening 
                    ordinances whichwill assign rules and penalties about all 
                    of them. What is he to do?He will have to praise and blame 
                    hunting with a view to the exerciseand pursuits of youth. 
                    And, on the other hand, the young man mustlisten obediently; 
                    neither pleasure nor pain should hinder him, and heshould 
                    regard as his standard of action the praises and injunctions 
                    ofthe legislator rather than the punishments which he imposes 
                    by law.This being premised, there will follow next in order 
                    moderate praiseand censure of hunting; the praise being assigned 
                    to that kind whichwill make the souls of young men better, 
                    and the censure to that whichhas the opposite effect.</p>
                  <p>And now let us address young men in the form of a prayer 
                    for theirwelfare: O friends, we will say to them, may no desire 
                    or love ofhunting in the sea, or of angling or of catching 
                    the creatures inthe waters, ever take possession of you, either 
                    when you are awakeor when you are asleep, by hook or with 
                    weels, which latter is avery lazy contrivance; and let not 
                    any desire of catching men and ofpiracy by sea enter into 
                    your souls and make you cruel and lawlesshunters. And as to 
                    the desire of thieving in town or country, may itnever enter 
                    into your most passing thoughts; nor let the insidiousfancy 
                    of catching birds, which is hardly worthy of freemen, comeinto 
                    the head of any youth. There remains therefore for our athletesonly 
                    the hunting and catching of land animals, of which the one 
                    sortis called hunting by night, in which the hunters sleep 
                    in turn and arelazy; this is not to be commended any more 
                    than that which hasintervals of rest, in which the will strength 
                    of beasts is subduedby nets and snares, and not by the victory 
                    of a laborious spirit.Thus, only the best kind of hunting 
                    is allowed at all-that ofquadrupeds, which is carried on with 
                    horses and dogs and men's ownpersons, and they get the victory 
                    over the animals by running themdown and striking them and 
                    hurling at them, those who have a care ofgodlike manhood taking 
                    them with their own hands. The praise and blamewhich is assigned 
                    to all these things has now been declared; and letthe law 
                    be as follows:-Let no one hinder these who verily are sacredhunters 
                    from following the chase wherever and whither soever theywill; 
                    but the hunter by night, who trusts to his nets and gins,shall 
                    not be allowed to hunt anywhere. The fowler in the mountains 
                    andwaste places shall be permitted, but on cultivated ground 
                    and onconsecrated wilds he shall not be permitted; and any 
                    one who meets himmay stop him. As to the hunter in waters, 
                    he may hunt anywhereexcept in harbours or sacred streams or 
                    marshes or pools, providedonly that he do not pollute the 
                    water with poisonous juices. And nowwe may say that all our 
                    enactments about education are complete.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very good.</p>

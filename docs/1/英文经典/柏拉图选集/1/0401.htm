                  <p> PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: SOCRATES; ION</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p> Socrates. Welcome, Ion. Are you from your native city of 
                    Ephesus?</p>
                  <p> Ion. No, Socrates; but from Epidaurus, where I attended 
                    the festival</p>
                  <p>of Asclepius.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And do the Epidaurians have contests of rhapsodes at 
                    the</p>
                  <p>festival?</p>
                  <p> Ion. O yes; and of all sorts of musical performers.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And were you one of the competitors- and did you succeed?</p>
                  <p> Ion. I obtained the first prize of all, Socrates.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Well done; and I hope that you will do the same for 
                    us at the</p>
                  <p>Panathenaea.</p>
                  <p> Ion. And I will, please heaven.</p>
                  <p> Soc. I often envy the profession of a rhapsode, </p>
                  <p>Ion; for you have always to wear fine clothes, and to look 
                    as beautiful </p>
                  <p>as you can is a part of your art. Then, again, you are obliged 
                    to be </p>
                  <p>continually in the company of many good poets; and especially 
                    of </p>
                  <p>Homer, who is the best and most divine of them; and to understand 
                  </p>
                  <p>him, and not merely learn his words by rote, is a thing greatly 
                    to be </p>
                  <p>envied. And no man can be a rhapsode who does not understand 
                    the </p>
                  <p>meaning of the poet. For the rhapsode ought to interpret 
                    the mind of </p>
                  <p>the poet to his hearers, but how can he interpret him well 
                    unless he </p>
                  <p>knows what he means? All this is greatly to be envied.</p>
                  <p> Ion. Very true, Socrates; interpretation has certainly been 
                    the most</p>
                  <p>laborious part of my art; and I believe myself able to speak 
                    about</p>
                  <p>Homer better than any man; and that neither Metrodorus of 
                  </p>
                  <p>Lampsacus, nor Stesimbrotus of Thasos, nor Glaucon, nor any 
                    one </p>
                  <p>else who ever was, had as good ideas about Homer as I have, 
                    or as </p>
                  <p>many.</p>
                  <p> Soc. I am glad to hear you say so, Ion; I see that you will 
                    not</p>
                  <p>refuse to acquaint me with them.</p>
                  <p> Ion. Certainly, Socrates; and you really ought to hear how</p>
                  <p>exquisitely I render Homer. I think that the Homeridae should 
                    give</p>
                  <p>me a golden crown.</p>
                  <p> Soc. I shall take an opportunity of hearing your embellishments 
                    of</p>
                  <p>him at some other time. But just now I should like to ask 
                    you a</p>
                  <p>question: Does your art extend to Hesiod and Archilochus, 
                    or to</p>
                  <p>Homer only?</p>
                  <p> Ion. To Homer only; he is in himself quite enough.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Are there any things about which Homer and Hesiod agree?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Yes; in my opinion there are a good many.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And can you interpret better what Homer says, or what 
                    Hesiod</p>
                  <p>says, about these matters in which they agree?</p>
                  <p> Ion. I can interpret them equally well, Socrates, where 
                    they agree.</p>
                  <p> Soc. But what about matters in which they do not agree?- 
                    for</p>
                  <p>example, about divination, of which both Homer and Hesiod 
                    have</p>
                  <p>something to say-</p>
                  <p> Ion. Very true:</p>
                  <p> Soc. Would you or a good prophet be a better interpreter 
                    of what</p>
                  <p>these two poets say about divination, not only when they 
                    agree, but</p>
                  <p>when they disagree?</p>
                  <p> Ion. A prophet.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And if you were a prophet, would you be able to interpret</p>
                  <p>them when they disagree as well as when they agree?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Clearly.</p>
                  <p> Soc. But how did you come to have this skill about Homer 
                    only, and</p>
                  <p>not about Hesiod or the other poets? Does not Homer speak 
                    of the</p>
                  <p>same themes which all other poets handle? Is not war his 
                    great</p>
                  <p>argument? and does he not speak of human society and of </p>
                  <p>intercourse of men, good and bad, skilled and unskilled, 
                    and of the </p>
                  <p>gods conversing with one another and with mankind, and about 
                    what </p>
                  <p>happens in heaven and in the world below, and the generations 
                    of </p>
                  <p>gods and heroes? Are not these the themes of which Homer 
                    sings?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Very true, Socrates.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And do not the other poets sing of the same?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Yes, Socrates; but not in the same way as Homer.</p>
                  <p> Soc. What, in a worse way?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Yes, in a far worse.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And Homer in a better way?</p>
                  <p> Ion. He is incomparably better.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And yet surely, my dear friend Ion, in a discussion 
                    about</p>
                  <p>arithmetic, where many people are speaking, and one speaks 
                    better </p>
                  <p>than the rest, there is somebody who can judge which of them 
                    is the </p>
                  <p>good speaker?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Yes.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And he who judges of the good will be the same as he 
                    who </p>
                  <p>judges of the bad speakers?</p>
                  <p> Ion. The same.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And he will be the arithmetician?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Yes.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Well, and in discussions about the wholesomeness of 
                    food,</p>
                  <p>when many persons are speaking, and one speaks better than 
                    the rest,</p>
                  <p>will he who recognizes the better speaker be a different 
                    person from</p>
                  <p>him who recognizes the worse, or the same?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Clearly the same.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And who is he, and what is his name?</p>
                  <p> Ion. The physician.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And speaking generally, in all discussions in which 
                    the subject</p>
                  <p>is the same and many men are speaking, will not he who knows 
                    the</p>
                  <p>good know the bad speaker also? For if he does not know the 
                    bad,</p>
                  <p>neither will he know the good when the same topic is being 
                  </p>
                  <p>discussed.</p>
                  <p> Ion. True.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Is not the same person skilful in both?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Yes.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And you say that Homer and the other poets, such as 
                    Hesiod</p>
                  <p>and Archilochus, speak of the same things, although not in 
                    the same</p>
                  <p>way; but the one speaks well and the other not so well?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Yes; and I am right in saying so.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And if you knew the good speaker, you would also know 
                    the</p>
                  <p>inferior speakers to be inferior?</p>
                  <p> Ion. That is true.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Then, my dear friend, can I be mistaken in saying that 
                    Ion is</p>
                  <p>equally skilled in Homer and in other poets, since he himself</p>
                  <p>acknowledges that the same person will be a good judge of 
                    all those</p>
                  <p>who speak of the same things; and that almost all poets do 
                    speak of</p>
                  <p>the same things?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Why then, Socrates, do I lose attention and go to sleep 
                    and</p>
                  <p>have absolutely no ideas of the least value, when any one 
                    speaks of</p>
                  <p>any other poet; but when Homer is mentioned, I wake up at 
                    once and</p>
                  <p>am all attention and have plenty to say?</p>
                  <p> Soc. The reason, my friend, is obvious. No one can fail 
                    to see</p>
                  <p>that you speak of Homer without any art or knowledge. If 
                    you were </p>
                  <p>able to speak of him by rules of art, you would have been 
                    able to </p>
                  <p>speak of all other poets; for poetry is a whole.</p>
                  <p> Ion. Yes.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And when any one acquires any other art as a whole, 
                    the same</p>
                  <p>may be said of them. Would you like me to explain my meaning, 
                    Ion?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Yes, indeed, Socrates; I very much wish that you would: 
                    for I</p>
                  <p>love to hear you wise men talk.</p>
                  <p> Soc. O that we were wise, Ion, and that you could truly 
                    call us</p>
                  <p>so; but you rhapsodes and actors, and the poets whose verses 
                    you </p>
                  <p>sing, are wise; whereas I am a common man, who only speak 
                    the </p>
                  <p>truth. For consider what a very commonplace and trivial thing 
                    is this </p>
                  <p>which I have said- a thing which any man might say: that 
                    when a man </p>
                  <p>has acquired a knowledge of a whole art, the enquiry into 
                    good and </p>
                  <p>bad is one and the same. Let us consider this matter; is 
                    not the art of</p>
                  <p>painting a whole?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Yes.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And there are and have been many painters good and 
                    bad?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Yes.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And did you ever know any one who was skilful in pointing 
                    out</p>
                  <p>the excellences and defects of Polygnotus the son of Aglaophon, 
                    but</p>
                  <p>incapable of criticizing other painters; and when the work 
                    of any</p>
                  <p>other painter was produced, went to sleep and was at a loss, 
                    and had</p>
                  <p>no ideas; but when he had to give his opinion about Polygnotus, 
                    or</p>
                  <p>whoever the painter might be, and about him only, woke up 
                    and was</p>
                  <p>attentive and had plenty to say?</p>
                  <p> Ion. No indeed, I have never known such a person.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Or did you ever know of any one in sculpture, who was 
                    skilful</p>
                  <p>in expounding the merits of Daedalus the son of Metion, or 
                    of Epeius</p>
                  <p>the son of Panopeus, or of Theodorus the Samian, or of any</p>
                  <p>individual sculptor; but when the works of sculptors in general 
                    were</p>
                  <p>produced, was at a loss and went to sleep and had nothing 
                    to say?</p>
                  <p> Ion. No indeed; no more than the other.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And if I am not mistaken, you never met with any one 
                    among</p>
                  <p>flute-players or harp- players or singers to the harp or 
                    rhapsodes who</p>
                  <p>was able to discourse of Olympus or Thamyras or Orpheus, 
                    or </p>
                  <p>Phemius the rhapsode of Ithaca, but was at a loss when he 
                    came to </p>
                  <p>speak of Ion of Ephesus, and had no notion of his merits 
                    or defects?</p>
                  <p> Ion. I cannot deny what you say, Socrates. Nevertheless 
                    I am</p>
                  <p>conscious in my own self, and the world agrees with me in 
                    thinking</p>
                  <p>that I do speak better and have more to say about Homer than 
                    any </p>
                  <p>other man. But I do not speak equally well about others- 
                    tell me the</p>
                  <p>reason of this.</p>
                  <p> Soc. I perceive, Ion; and I will proceed to explain to you 
                    what I</p>
                  <p>imagine to be the reason of this. The gift which you possess 
                    of</p>
                  <p>speaking excellently about Homer is not an art, but, as I 
                    was just</p>
                  <p>saying, an inspiration; there is a divinity moving you, like 
                    that</p>
                  <p>contained in the stone which Euripides calls a magnet, but 
                    which is</p>
                  <p>commonly known as the stone of Heraclea. This stone not only</p>
                  <p>attracts iron rings, but also imparts to them a similar power 
                    of</p>
                  <p>attracting other rings; and sometimes you may see a number 
                    of pieces</p>
                  <p>of iron and rings suspended from one another so as to form 
                    quite a</p>
                  <p>long chain: and all of them derive their power of suspension 
                    from</p>
                  <p>the original stone. In like manner the Muse first of all 
                    inspires</p>
                  <p>men herself; and from these inspired persons a chain of other</p>
                  <p>persons is suspended, who take the inspiration. For all good 
                    poets,</p>
                  <p>epic as well as lyric, compose their beautiful poems not 
                    by art, but</p>
                  <p>because they are inspired and possessed. And as the Corybantian</p>
                  <p>revellers when they dance are not in their right mind, so 
                    the lyric</p>
                  <p>poets are not in their right mind when they are composing 
                    their</p>
                  <p>beautiful strains: but when falling under the power of music 
                    and metre</p>
                  <p>they are inspired and possessed; like Bacchic maidens who 
                    draw milk</p>
                  <p>and honey from the rivers when they are under the influence 
                    of</p>
                  <p>Dionysus but not when they are in their right mind. And the 
                    soul of</p>
                  <p>the lyric poet does the same, as they themselves say; for 
                    they tell us</p>
                  <p>that they bring songs from honeyed fountains, culling them 
                    out of</p>
                  <p>the gardens and dells of the Muses; they, like the bees, 
                    winging their</p>
                  <p>way from flower to flower. And this is true. For the poet 
                    is a light</p>
                  <p>and winged and holy thing, and there is no invention in him 
                    until he</p>
                  <p>has been inspired and is out of his senses, and the mind 
                    is no</p>
                  <p>longer in him: when he has not attained to this state, he 
                    is powerless</p>
                  <p>and is unable to utter his oracles.</p>
                  <p> Many are the noble words in which poets speak concerning 
                    the </p>
                  <p>actions of men; but like yourself when speaking about Homer, 
                    they </p>
                  <p>do not speak of them by any rules of art: they are simply 
                    inspired to </p>
                  <p>utter that to which the Muse impels them, and that only; 
                    and when </p>
                  <p>inspired, one of them will make dithyrambs, another hymns 
                    of praise, </p>
                  <p>another choral strains, another epic or iambic verses- and 
                    he who is </p>
                  <p>good at one is not good any other kind of verse: for not 
                    by art does </p>
                  <p>the poet sing,but by power divine. Had he learned by rules 
                    of art, he </p>
                  <p>would have known how to speak not of one theme only, but 
                    of all; </p>
                  <p>and therefore God takes away the minds of poets, and uses 
                    them as </p>
                  <p>his ministers,as he also uses diviners and holy prophets, 
                    in order that </p>
                  <p>we who hear them may know them to be speaking not of themselves 
                  </p>
                  <p>who utter these priceless words in a state of unconsciousness, 
                    but </p>
                  <p>that God himself is the speaker, and that through them he 
                    is </p>
                  <p>conversing with us. And Tynnichus the Chalcidian affords 
                    a striking </p>
                  <p>instance of what I am saying: he wrote nothing that any one 
                    would </p>
                  <p>care to remember but the famous paean which; in every one's 
                    mouth, </p>
                  <p>one of the finest poems ever written, simply an invention 
                    of the </p>
                  <p>Muses, as he himself says. For in this way, the God would 
                    seem to </p>
                  <p>indicate to us and not allow us to doubt that these beautiful 
                    poems are </p>
                  <p>not human, or the work of man, but divine and the work of 
                    God; and </p>
                  <p>that the poets are only the interpreters of the Gods by whom 
                    they are </p>
                  <p>severally possessed. Was not this the lesson which the God 
                    intended </p>
                  <p>to teach when by the mouth of the worst of poets he sang 
                    the best of </p>
                  <p>songs?</p>
                  <p>Am I not right, Ion?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Yes, indeed, Socrates, I feel that you are; for your 
                    words</p>
                  <p>touch my soul, and I am persuaded that good poets by a divine</p>
                  <p>inspiration interpret the things of the Gods to us.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And you rhapsodists are the interpreters of the poets?</p>
                  <p> Ion. There again you are right.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Then you are the interpreters of interpreters?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Precisely.</p>
                  <p> Soc. I wish you would frankly tell me, Ion, what I am going 
                    to ask</p>
                  <p>of you: When you produce the greatest effect upon the audience 
                    in</p>
                  <p>the recitation of some striking passage, such as the apparition 
                    of</p>
                  <p>Odysseus leaping forth on the floor, recognized by the suitors 
                    and</p>
                  <p>casting his arrows at his feet, or the description of Achilles 
                    rushing</p>
                  <p>at Hector, or the sorrows of Andromache, Hecuba, or Priam,- 
                    are </p>
                  <p>you in your right mind? Are you not carried out of yourself, 
                    and does </p>
                  <p>not your soul in an ecstasy seem to be among the persons 
                    or places </p>
                  <p>of which you are speaking, whether they are in Ithaca or 
                    in Troy or</p>
                  <p>whatever may be the scene of the poem?</p>
                  <p> Ion. That proof strikes home to me, Socrates. For I must 
                    frankly</p>
                  <p>confess that at the tale of pity, my eyes are filled with 
                    tears, and</p>
                  <p>when I speak of horrors, my hair stands on end and my heart 
                    throbs.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Well, Ion, and what are we to say of a man who at a 
                    sacrifice</p>
                  <p>or festival, when he is dressed in holiday attire and has 
                    golden</p>
                  <p>crowns upon his head, of which nobody has robbed him, appears 
                  </p>
                  <p>sweeping or panic-stricken in the presence of more than twenty 
                  </p>
                  <p>thousand friendly faces, when there is no one despoiling 
                    or wronging </p>
                  <p>him;- is he in his right mind or is he not?</p>
                  <p> Ion. No indeed, Socrates, I must say that, strictly speaking, 
                    he</p>
                  <p>is not in his right mind.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And are you aware that you produce similar effects 
                    on most</p>
                  <p>spectators?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Only too well; for I look down upon them from the stage, 
                    and</p>
                  <p>behold the various emotions of pity, wonder, sternness, stamped 
                  </p>
                  <p>upon their countenances when I am speaking: and I am obliged 
                    to </p>
                  <p>give my very best attention to them; for if I make them cry 
                    I myself </p>
                  <p>shall laugh, and if I make them laugh I myself shall cry 
                    when the time </p>
                  <p>of payment arrives.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Do you know that the spectator is the last of the rings</p>
                  <p>which, as I am saying, receive the power of the original 
                    magnet from</p>
                  <p>one another? The rhapsode like yourself and the actor are 
                  </p>
                  <p>intermediate links, and the poet himself is the first of 
                    them. Through </p>
                  <p>all these the God sways the souls of men in any direction 
                    which he </p>
                  <p>pleases, and makes one man hang down from another. Thus there 
                    is a </p>
                  <p>vast chain of dancers and masters and undermasters of choruses, 
                  </p>
                  <p>who are suspended, as if from the stone, at the side of the 
                    rings </p>
                  <p>which hang down from the Muse. And every poet has some Muse 
                  </p>
                  <p>from whom he is suspended, and by whom he is said to be </p>
                  <p>possessed, which is nearly the same thing; for he is taken 
                    hold of. </p>
                  <p>And from these first rings, which are the poets, depend others, 
                    some </p>
                  <p>deriving their inspiration from Orpheus, others from Musaeus; 
                    but the </p>
                  <p>greater number are possessed and held by Homer. Of whom, 
                    Ion, </p>
                  <p>you are one, and are possessed by Homer; and when any one 
                    repeats </p>
                  <p>the words of another poet you go to sleep, and know not what 
                    to say; </p>
                  <p>but when any one recites a strain of Homer you wake up in 
                    a moment, </p>
                  <p>and your soul leaps within you,and you have plenty to say; 
                    for not by </p>
                  <p>art or knowledge about Homer do you say what you say, but 
                    by </p>
                  <p>divine inspiration and by possession;</p>
                  <p>just as the Corybantian revellers too have a quick perception 
                    of</p>
                  <p>that strain only which is appropriated to the God by whom 
                    they are</p>
                  <p>possessed, and have plenty of dances and words for that, 
                    but take no</p>
                  <p>heed of any other. And you, Ion, when the name of Homer is 
                  </p>
                  <p>mentioned have plenty to say, and have nothing to say of 
                    others. You </p>
                  <p>ask, &quot;Why is this?&quot; The answer is that you praise 
                    Homer not by art </p>
                  <p>but by divine inspiration.</p>
                  <p> Ion. That is good, Socrates; and yet I doubt whether you 
                    will ever</p>
                  <p>have eloquence enough to persuade me that I praise Homer 
                    only </p>
                  <p>when I am mad and possessed; and if you could hear me speak 
                    of </p>
                  <p>him I am sure you would never think this to be the case.</p>
                  <p> Soc. I should like very much to hear you, but not until 
                    you have</p>
                  <p>answered a question which I have to ask. On what part of 
                    Homer do</p>
                  <p>you speak well?- not surely about every part.</p>
                  <p> Ion. There is no part, Socrates, about which I do not speak 
                    well</p>
                  <p>of that I can assure you.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Surely not about things in Homer of which you have 
                    no</p>
                  <p>knowledge?</p>
                  <p> Ion. And what is there in Homer of which I have no knowledge?</p>
                  <p> Soc. Why, does not Homer speak in many passages about arts? 
                    For</p>
                  <p>example, about driving; if I can only remember the lines 
                    I will repeat</p>
                  <p>them.</p>
                  <p> Ion. I remember, and will repeat them.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Tell me then, what Nestor says to Antilochus, his son, 
                    where he</p>
                  <p>bids him be careful of the turn at the horse-race in honour 
                    of</p>
                  <p>Patroclus.</p>
                  <p> Ion. He says: Bend gently in the polished chariot to the 
                    left of them, </p>
                  <p>and urge the horse on the right hand with whip and voice; 
                    and slacken </p>
                  <p>the rein. And when you are at the goal, let the left horse 
                    draw near, yet </p>
                  <p>so that the nave of the well-wrought wheel may not even seem 
                    to </p>
                  <p>touch the extremity; and avoid catching the stone.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p> Soc. Enough. Now, Ion, will the charioteer or the physician 
                    be the</p>
                  <p>better judge of the propriety of these lines?</p>
                  <p> Ion. The charioteer, clearly.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And will the reason be that this is his art, or will 
                    there be</p>
                  <p>any other reason?</p>
                  <p> Ion. No, that will be the reason.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And every art is appointed by God to have knowledge 
                    of a</p>
                  <p>certain work; for that which we know by the art of the pilot 
                    we do not</p>
                  <p>know by the art of medicine?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Certainly not.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Nor do we know by the art of the carpenter that which 
                    we know</p>
                  <p>by the art of medicine?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Certainly not.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And this is true of all the arts;- that which we know 
                    with</p>
                  <p>one art we do not know with the other? But let me ask a prior</p>
                  <p>question: You admit that there are differences of arts?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Yes.</p>
                  <p> Soc. You would argue, as I should, that when one art is 
                    of one</p>
                  <p>kind of knowledge and another of another, they are different?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Yes.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Yes, surely; for if the subject of knowledge were the 
                    same,</p>
                  <p>there would be no meaning in saying that the arts were different,-</p>
                  <p>if they both gave the same knowledge. For example, I know 
                    that here</p>
                  <p>are five fingers, and you know the same. And if I were to 
                    ask</p>
                  <p>whether I and you became acquainted with this fact by the 
                    help of</p>
                  <p>the same art of arithmetic, you would acknowledge that we 
                    did?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Yes.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Tell me, then, what I was intending to ask you- whether 
                    this</p>
                  <p>holds universally? Must the same art have the same subject 
                    of</p>
                  <p>knowledge, and different arts other subjects of knowledge?</p>
                  <p> Ion. That is my opinion, Socrates.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Then he who has no knowledge of a particular art will 
                    have no</p>
                  <p>right judgment of the sayings and doings of that art?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Very true.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Then which will be a better judge of the lines which 
                    you were</p>
                  <p>reciting from Homer, you or the charioteer?</p>
                  <p> Ion. The charioteer.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Why, yes, because you are a rhapsode and not a charioteer.</p>
                  <p> Ion. Yes.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And the art of the rhapsode is different from that 
                    of the</p>
                  <p>charioteer?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Yes.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And if a different knowledge, then a knowledge of different</p>
                  <p>matters?</p>
                  <p> Ion. True.</p>
                  <p> Soc. You know the passage in which Hecamede, the concubine 
                    of</p>
                  <p>Nestor, is described as giving to the wounded Machaon a posset, 
                    as</p>
                  <p>he says, Made with Pramnian wine; and she grated cheese of 
                    goat's </p>
                  <p>milk with a grater of bronze, and at his side placed an onion 
                    which </p>
                  <p>gives a relish to drink.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>Now would you say that the art of the rhapsode or the art 
                    of</p>
                  <p>medicine was better able to judge of the propriety of these 
                    lines?</p>
                  <p> Ion. The art of medicine.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And when Homer says,</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p> And she descended into the deep like a leaden plummet, which, 
                    set in</p>
                  <p>the horn of ox that ranges in the fields, rushes along carrying</p>
                  <p>death among the ravenous fishes,-</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>will the art of the fisherman or of the rhapsode be better 
                    able to</p>
                  <p>judge whether these lines are rightly expressed or not?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Clearly, Socrates, the art of the fisherman.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Come now, suppose that you were to say to me: &quot;Since 
                    you,</p>
                  <p>Socrates, are able to assign different passages in Homer 
                    to their</p>
                  <p>corresponding arts, I wish that you would tell me what are 
                    the</p>
                  <p>passages of which the excellence ought to be judged by the 
                    prophet </p>
                  <p>and prophetic art&quot;; and you will see how readily and 
                    truly I shall</p>
                  <p>answer you. For there are many such passages, particularly 
                    in the</p>
                  <p>Odyssey; as, for example, the passage in which Theoclymenus 
                    the</p>
                  <p>prophet of the house of Melampus says to the suitors:-</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p> Wretched men! what is happening to you? Your heads and your 
                    faces</p>
                  <p>and your limbs underneath are shrouded in night; and the 
                    voice of</p>
                  <p>lamentation bursts forth, and your cheeks are wet with tears. 
                    And</p>
                  <p>the vestibule is full, and the court is full, of ghosts descending</p>
                  <p>into the darkness of Erebus, and the sun has perished out 
                    of heaven,</p>
                  <p>and an evil mist is spread abroad.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p> And there are many such passages in the Iliad also; as for 
                    example</p>
                  <p>in the description of the battle near the rampart, where 
                    he says:-</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p> As they were eager to pass the ditch, there came to them 
                    an omen:</p>
                  <p>a soaring eagle, holding back the people on the left, bore 
                    a huge</p>
                  <p>bloody dragon in his talons, still living and panting; nor 
                    had he</p>
                  <p>yet resigned the strife, for he bent back and smote the bird 
                    which</p>
                  <p>carried him on the breast by the neck, and he in pain let 
                    him fall</p>
                  <p>from him to the ground into the midst of the multitude. And 
                    the eagle,</p>
                  <p>with a cry, was borne afar on the wings of the wind.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p> These are the sort of things which I should say that the 
                    prophet</p>
                  <p>ought to consider and determine.</p>
                  <p> Ion. And you are quite right, Socrates, in saying so.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Yes, Ion, and you are right also. And as I have selected 
                    from</p>
                  <p>the Iliad and Odyssey for you passages which describe the 
                    office of</p>
                  <p>the prophet and the physician and the fisherman, do you, 
                    who know</p>
                  <p>Homer so much better than I do, Ion, select for me passages 
                    which</p>
                  <p>relate to the rhapsode and the rhapsode's art, and which 
                    the</p>
                  <p>rhapsode ought to examine and judge of better than other 
                    men.</p>
                  <p> Ion. All passages, I should say, Socrates.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Not all, Ion, surely. Have you already forgotten what 
                    you</p>
                  <p>were saying? A rhapsode ought to have a better memory.</p>
                  <p> Ion. Why, what am I forgetting?</p>
                  <p> Soc. Do you not remember that you declared the art of the 
                    rhapsode</p>
                  <p>to be different from the art of the charioteer?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Yes, I remember.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And you admitted that being different they would have 
                    different</p>
                  <p>subjects of knowledge?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Yes.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Then upon your own showing the rhapsode, and the art 
                    of the</p>
                  <p>rhapsode, will not know everything?</p>
                  <p> Ion. I should exclude certain things, Socrates.</p>
                  <p> Soc. You mean to say that you would exclude pretty much 
                    the </p>
                  <p>subjects of the other arts. As he does not know all of them, 
                    which of </p>
                  <p>them will he know?</p>
                  <p> Ion. He will know what a man and what a woman ought to say, 
                    and </p>
                  <p>what a freeman and what a slave ought to say, and what a 
                    ruler and </p>
                  <p>what a subject.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Do you mean that a rhapsode will know better than the 
                    pilot</p>
                  <p>what the ruler of a sea-tossed vessel ought to say?</p>
                  <p> Ion. No; the pilot will know best.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Or will the rhapsode know better than the physician 
                    what the</p>
                  <p>ruler of a sick man ought to say?</p>
                  <p> Ion. He will not.</p>
                  <p> Soc. But he will know what a slave ought to say?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Yes.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Suppose the slave to be a cowherd; the rhapsode will 
                    know</p>
                  <p>better than the cowherd what he ought to say in order to 
                    soothe the</p>
                  <p>infuriated cows?</p>
                  <p> Ion. No, he will not.</p>
                  <p> Soc. But he will know what a spinning-woman ought to say 
                    about the</p>
                  <p>working of wool?</p>
                  <p> Ion. No.</p>
                  <p> Soc. At any rate he will know what a general ought to say 
                    when</p>
                  <p>exhorting his soldiers?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Yes, that is the sort of thing which the rhapsode will 
                    be</p>
                  <p>sure to know.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Well, but is the art of the rhapsode the art of the 
                    general?</p>
                  <p> Ion. I am sure that I should know what a general ought to 
                    say.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Why, yes, Ion, because you may possibly have a knowledge 
                    of </p>
                  <p>the art of the general as well as of the rhapsode; and you 
                    may also </p>
                  <p>have a knowledge of horsemanship as well as of the lyre: 
                    and then </p>
                  <p>you would know when horses were well or ill managed. But 
                    suppose </p>
                  <p>I were to ask you: By the help of which art, Ion, do you 
                    know </p>
                  <p>whether horses are well managed, by your skill as a horseman 
                    or as a </p>
                  <p>performer on the lyre- what would you answer?</p>
                  <p> Ion. I should reply, by my skill as a horseman.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And if you judged of performers on the lyre, you would 
                    admit</p>
                  <p>that you judged of them as a performer on the lyre, and not 
                    as a</p>
                  <p>horseman?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Yes.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And in judging of the general's art, do you judge of 
                    it as a</p>
                  <p>general or a rhapsode?</p>
                  <p> Ion. To me there appears to be no difference between them.</p>
                  <p> Soc. What do you mean? Do you mean to say that the art of 
                    the</p>
                  <p>rhapsode and of the general is the same?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Yes, one and the same.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Then he who is a good rhapsode is also a good general?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Certainly, Socrates.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And he who is a good general is also a good rhapsode?</p>
                  <p> Ion. No; I do not say that.</p>
                  <p> Soc. But you do say that he who is a good rhapsode is also 
                    a good</p>
                  <p>general.</p>
                  <p> Ion. Certainly.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And you are the best of Hellenic rhapsodes?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Far the best, Socrates.</p>
                  <p> Soc. And are you the best general, Ion?</p>
                  <p> Ion. To be sure, Socrates; and Homer was my master.</p>
                  <p> Soc. But then, Ion, what in the name of goodness can be 
                    the reason</p>
                  <p>why you, who are the best of generals as well as the best 
                    of </p>
                  <p>rhapsodes in all Hellas, go about as a rhapsode when you 
                    might be a </p>
                  <p>general?</p>
                  <p>Do you think that the Hellenes want a rhapsode with his golden</p>
                  <p>crown, and do not want a general?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Why, Socrates, the reason is, that my countrymen, the</p>
                  <p>Ephesians, are the servants and soldiers of Athens, and do 
                    not need</p>
                  <p>a general; and you and Sparta are not likely to have me, 
                    for you think</p>
                  <p>that you have enough generals of your own.</p>
                  <p> Soc. My good Ion, did you never hear of Apollodorus of Cyzicus?</p>
                  <p> Ion. Who may he be?</p>
                  <p> Soc. One who, though a foreigner, has often been chosen 
                    their</p>
                  <p>general by the Athenians: and there is Phanosthenes of Andros, 
                    and</p>
                  <p>Heraclides of Clazomenae, whom they have also appointed to 
                    the </p>
                  <p>command of their armies and to other offices, although aliens, 
                    after </p>
                  <p>they had shown their merit. And will they not choose Ion 
                    the </p>
                  <p>Ephesian to be their general, and honour him, if he prove 
                    himself </p>
                  <p>worthy? Were not the Ephesians originally Athenians, and 
                    Ephesus is </p>
                  <p>no mean city?</p>
                  <p>But, indeed, Ion, if you are correct in saying that by art 
                    and</p>
                  <p>knowledge you are able to praise Homer, you do not deal fairly 
                    with</p>
                  <p>me, and after all your professions of knowing many, glorious 
                    things</p>
                  <p>about Homer, and promises that you would exhibit them, you 
                    are </p>
                  <p>only a deceiver, and so far from exhibiting the art of which 
                    you are a</p>
                  <p>master, will not, even after my repeated entreaties, explain 
                    to me the</p>
                  <p>nature of it. You have literally as many forms as Proteus; 
                    and now </p>
                  <p>you go all manner of ways, twisting and turning, and, like 
                    Proteus, </p>
                  <p>become all manner of people at once, and at last slip away 
                    from me in </p>
                  <p> the disguise of a general, in order that you may escape 
                    exhibiting your</p>
                  <p>Homeric lore. And if you have art, then, as I was saying, 
                    in</p>
                  <p>falsifying your promise that you would exhibit Homer, you 
                    are not</p>
                  <p>dealing fairly with me. But if, as I believe, you have no 
                    art, but</p>
                  <p>speak all these beautiful words about Homer unconsciously 
                    under his</p>
                  <p>inspiring influence, then I acquit you of dishonesty, and 
                    shall only</p>
                  <p>say that you are inspired. Which do you prefer to be thought,</p>
                  <p>dishonest or inspired?</p>
                  <p> Ion. There is a great difference, Socrates, between the 
                    two</p>
                  <p>alternatives; and inspiration is by far the nobler.</p>
                  <p> Soc. Then, Ion, I shall assume the nobler alternative; and 
                    attribute</p>
                  <p>to you in your praises of Homer inspiration, and not art. 
                  </p>

                    SOCRATES - GLAUCON</p>
                  <p>I WENT down yesterday to the Piraeus with Glaucon the son 
                    ofAriston, that I might offer up my prayers to the goddess; 
                    and alsobecause I wanted to see in what manner they would 
                    celebrate thefestival, which was a new thing. I was delighted 
                    with the processionof the inhabitants; but that of the Thracians 
                    was equally, if notmore, beautiful. When we had finished our 
                    prayers and viewed thespectacle, we turned in the direction 
                    of the city; and at that instantPolemarchus the son of Cephalus 
                    chanced to catch sight of us from adistance as we were starting 
                    on our way home, and told his servantto run and bid us wait 
                    for him. The servant took hold of me by thecloak behind, and 
                    said: Polemarchus desires you to wait.</p>
                  <p>I turned round, and asked him where his master was.</p>
                  <p>There he is, said the youth, coming after you, if you will 
                    onlywait.</p>
                  <p>Certainly we will, said Glaucon; and in a few minutes Polemarchusappeared, 
                    and with him Adeimantus, Glaucon's brother, Niceratus theson 
                    of Nicias, and several others who had been at the procession.</p>
                  <p>SOCRATES - POLEMARCHUS - GLAUCON - ADEIMANTUS</p>
                  <p>Polemarchus said to me: I perceive, Socrates, that you and 
                    ourcompanion are already on your way to the city.</p>
                  <p>You are not far wrong, I said.</p>
                  <p>But do you see, he rejoined, how many we are?</p>
                  <p>Of course.</p>
                  <p>And are you stronger than all these? for if not, you will 
                    have toremain where you are.</p>
                  <p>May there not be the alternative, I said, that we may persuade 
                    youto let us go?</p>
                  <p>But can you persuade us, if we refuse to listen to you? he 
                    said.</p>
                  <p>Certainly not, replied Glaucon.</p>
                  <p>Then we are not going to listen; of that you may be assured.</p>
                  <p>Adeimantus added: Has no one told you of the torch-race on 
                    horsebackin honour of the goddess which will take place in 
                    the evening?</p>
                  <p>With horses! I replied: That is a novelty. Will horsemen 
                    carrytorches and pass them one to another during the race?</p>
                  <p>Yes, said Polemarchus, and not only so, but a festival will 
                    hecelebrated at night, which you certainly ought to see. Let 
                    us risesoon after supper and see this festival; there will 
                    be a gatheringof young men, and we will have a good talk. 
                    Stay then, and do not beperverse.</p>
                  <p>Glaucon said: I suppose, since you insist, that we must.</p>
                  <p>Very good, I replied.</p>
                  <p>GLAUCON - CEPHALUS - SOCRATES</p>
                  <p>Accordingly we went with Polemarchus to his house; and there 
                    wefound his brothers Lysias and Euthydemus, and with them 
                    Thrasymachusthe Chalcedonian, Charmantides the Paeanian, and 
                    Cleitophon the son ofAristonymus. There too was Cephalus the 
                    father of Polemarchus, whomI had not seen for a long time, 
                    and I thought him very much aged. Hewas seated on a cushioned 
                    chair, and had a garland on his head, for hehad been sacrificing 
                    in the court; and there were some other chairs inthe room 
                    arranged in a semicircle, upon which we sat down by him. Hesaluted 
                    me eagerly, and then he said: --</p>
                  <p>You don't come to see me, Socrates, as often as you ought: 
                    If I werestill able to go and see you I would not ask you 
                    to come to me. But atmy age I can hardly get to the city, 
                    and therefore you should comeoftener to the Piraeus. For let 
                    me tell you, that the more thepleasures of the body fade away, 
                    the greater to me is the pleasure andcharm of conversation. 
                    Do not then deny my request, but make our houseyour resort 
                    and keep company with these young men; we are old friends,and 
                    you will be quite at home with us.</p>
                  <p>I replied: There is nothing which for my part I like better,Cephalus, 
                    than conversing with aged men; for I regard them astravellers 
                    who have gone a journey which I too may have to go, andof 
                    whom I ought to enquire, whether the way is smooth and easy, 
                    orrugged and difficult. And this is a question which I should 
                    like toask of you who have arrived at that time which the 
                    poets call the'threshold of old age' --Is life harder towards 
                    the end, or whatreport do you give of it?</p>
                  <p>I will tell you, Socrates, he said, what my own feeling is. 
                    Men ofmy age flock together; we are birds of a feather, as 
                    the old proverbsays; and at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance 
                    commonly is--I cannot eat, I cannot drink; the pleasures of 
                    youth and love arefled away: there was a good time once, but 
                    now that is gone, andlife is no longer life. Some complain 
                    of the slights which are putupon them by relations, and they 
                    will tell you sadly of how many evilstheir old age is the 
                    cause. But to me, Socrates, these complainersseem to blame 
                    that which is not really in fault. For if old age werethe 
                    cause, I too being old, and every other old man, would have 
                    feltas they do. But this is not my own experience, nor that 
                    of others whomI have known. How well I remember the aged poet 
                    Sophocles, when inanswer to the question, How does love suit 
                    with age, Sophocles,--are you still the man you were? Peace, 
                    he replied; most gladlyhave I escaped the thing of which you 
                    speak; I feel as if I hadescaped from a mad and furious master. 
                    His words have often occurredto my mind since, and they seem 
                    as good to me now as at the timewhen he uttered them. For 
                    certainly old age has a great sense ofcalm and freedom; when 
                    the passions relax their hold, then, asSophocles says, we 
                    are freed from the grasp not of one mad masteronly, but of 
                    many. The truth is, Socrates, that these regrets, andalso 
                    the complaints about relations, are to be attributed to thesame 
                    cause, which is not old age, but men's characters and tempers;for 
                    he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the 
                    pressureof age, but to him who is of an opposite disposition 
                    youth and age areequally a burden.</p>
                  <p>I listened in admiration, and wanting to draw him out, that 
                    he mightgo on --Yes, Cephalus, I said: but I rather suspect 
                    that people ingeneral are not convinced by you when you speak 
                    thus; they thinkthat old age sits lightly upon you, not because 
                    of your happydisposition, but because you are rich, and wealth 
                    is well known tobe a great comforter.</p>
                  <p>You are right, he replied; they are not convinced: and there 
                    issomething in what they say; not, however, so much as they 
                    imagine. Imight answer them as Themistocles answered the Seriphian 
                    who wasabusing him and saying that he was famous, not for 
                    his own meritsbut because he was an Athenian: 'If you had 
                    been a native of mycountry or I of yours, neither of us would 
                    have been famous.' And tothose who are not rich and are impatient 
                    of old age, the same replymay be made; for to the good poor 
                    man old age cannot be a lightburden, nor can a bad rich man 
                    ever have peace with himself.</p>
                  <p>May I ask, Cephalus, whether your fortune was for the most 
                    partinherited or acquired by you?</p>
                  <p>Acquired! Socrates; do you want to know how much I acquired? 
                    Inthe art of making money I have been midway between my father 
                    andgrandfather: for my grandfather, whose name I bear, doubled 
                    andtrebled the value of his patrimony, that which he inherited 
                    being muchwhat I possess now; but my father Lysanias reduced 
                    the propertybelow what it is at present: and I shall be satisfied 
                    if I leave tothese my sons not less but a little more than 
                    I received.</p>
                  <p>That was why I asked you the question, I replied, because 
                    I see thatyou are indifferent about money, which is a characteristic 
                    rather ofthose who have inherited their fortunes than of those 
                    who haveacquired them; the makers of fortunes have a second 
                    love of money as acreation of their own, resembling the affection 
                    of authors for theirown poems, or of parents for their children, 
                    besides that natural loveof it for the sake of use and profit 
                    which is common to them and allmen. And hence they are very 
                    bad company, for they can talk aboutnothing but the praises 
                    of wealth. That is true, he said.</p>
                  <p>Yes, that is very true, but may I ask another question? What 
                    doyou consider to be the greatest blessing which you have 
                    reaped fromyour wealth?</p>
                  <p>One, he said, of which I could not expect easily to convince 
                    others.For let me tell you, Socrates, that when a man thinks 
                    himself to benear death, fears and cares enter into his mind 
                    which he never hadbefore; the tales of a world below and the 
                    punishment which is exactedthere of deeds done here were once 
                    a laughing matter to him, but nowhe is tormented with the 
                    thought that they may be true: either fromthe weakness of 
                    age, or because he is now drawing nearer to that otherplace, 
                    he has a clearer view of these things; suspicions and alarmscrowd 
                    thickly upon him, and he begins to reflect and consider whatwrongs 
                    he has done to others. And when he finds that the sum of histransgressions 
                    is great he will many a time like a child start up inhis sleep 
                    for fear, and he is filled with dark forebodings. But to himwho 
                    is conscious of no sin, sweet hope, as Pindar charmingly says,is 
                    the kind nurse of his age:</p>
                  <p>Hope, he says, cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice 
                    andholiness and is the nurse of his age and the companion 
                    of his journey;--hope which is mightiest to sway the restless 
                    soul of man.</p>
                  <p>How admirable are his words! And the great blessing of riches, 
                    Ido not say to every man, but to a good man, is, that he has 
                    had nooccasion to deceive or to defraud others, either intentionally 
                    orunintentionally; and when he departs to the world below 
                    he is not inany apprehension about offerings due to the gods 
                    or debts which heowes to men. Now to this peace of mind the 
                    possession of wealthgreatly contributes; and therefore I say, 
                    that, setting one thingagainst another, of the many advantages 
                    which wealth has to give, to aman of sense this is in my opinion 
                    the greatest.</p>
                  <p>Well said, Cephalus, I replied; but as concerning justice, 
                    what isit? --to speak the truth and to pay your debts --no 
                    more than this?And even to this are there not exceptions? 
                    Suppose that a friendwhen in his right mind has deposited 
                    arms with me and he asks for themwhen he is not in his right 
                    mind, ought I to give them back to him? Noone would say that 
                    I ought or that I should be right in doing so,any more than 
                    they would say that I ought always to speak the truth toone 
                    who is in his condition.</p>
                  <p>You are quite right, he replied.</p>
                  <p>But then, I said, speaking the truth and paying your debts 
                    is nota correct definition of justice.</p>
                  <p>CEPHALUS - SOCRATES - POLEMARCHUS</p>
                  <p>Quite correct, Socrates, if Simonides is to be believed, 
                    saidPolemarchus interposing.</p>
                  <p>I fear, said Cephalus, that I must go now, for I have to 
                    lookafter the sacrifices, and I hand over the argument to 
                    Polemarchusand the company.</p>
                  <p>Is not Polemarchus your heir? I said.</p>
                  <p>To be sure, he answered, and went away laughing to the sacrifices.</p>
                  <p>SOCRATES - POLEMARCHUS</p>
                  <p>Tell me then, O thou heir of the argument, what did Simonides 
                    say,and according to you truly say, about justice?</p>
                  <p>He said that the repayment of a debt is just, and in saying 
                    so heappears to me to be right.</p>
                  <p>I should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired 
                    man,but his meaning, though probably clear to you, is the 
                    reverse of clearto me. For he certainly does not mean, as 
                    we were now saying that Iought to return a return a deposit 
                    of arms or of anything else toone who asks for it when he 
                    is not in his right senses; and yet adeposit cannot be denied 
                    to be a debt.</p>
                  <p>True.</p>
                  <p>Then when the person who asks me is not in his right mind 
                    I am by nomeans to make the return?</p>
                  <p>Certainly not.</p>
                  <p>When Simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice, 
                    he didnot mean to include that case?</p>
                  <p>Certainly not; for he thinks that a friend ought always to 
                    do goodto a friend and never evil.</p>
                  <p>You mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to 
                    the injuryof the receiver, if the two parties are friends, 
                    is not therepayment of a debt, --that is what you would imagine 
                    him to say?</p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>And are enemies also to receive what we owe to them?</p>
                  <p>To be sure, he said, they are to receive what we owe them, 
                    and anenemy, as I take it, owes to an enemy that which is 
                    due or proper tohim --that is to say, evil.</p>
                  <p>Simonides, then, after the manner of poets, would seem to 
                    havespoken darkly of the nature of justice; for he really 
                    meant to saythat justice is the giving to each man what is 
                    proper to him, and thishe termed a debt.</p>
                  <p>That must have been his meaning, he said.</p>
                  <p>By heaven! I replied; and if we asked him what due or proper 
                    thingis given by medicine, and to whom, what answer do you 
                    think that hewould make to us?</p>
                  <p>He would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat 
                    and drinkto human bodies.</p>
                  <p>And what due or proper thing is given by cookery, and to 
                    what?</p>
                  <p>Seasoning to food.</p>
                  <p>And what is that which justice gives, and to whom?</p>
                  <p>If, Socrates, we are to be guided at all by the analogy of 
                    thepreceding instances, then justice is the art which gives 
                    good tofriends and evil to enemies.</p>
                  <p>That is his meaning then?</p>
                  <p>I think so.</p>
                  <p>And who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to 
                    hisenemies in time of sickness?</p>
                  <p>The physician.</p>
                  <p>Or when they are on a voyage, amid the perils of the sea?</p>
                  <p>The pilot.</p>
                  <p>And in what sort of actions or with a view to what result 
                    is thejust man most able to do harm to his enemy and good 
                    to his friends?</p>
                  <p>In going to war against the one and in making alliances with 
                    theother.</p>
                  <p>But when a man is well, my dear Polemarchus, there is no 
                    need of aphysician?</p>
                  <p>No.</p>
                  <p>And he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot?</p>
                  <p>No.</p>
                  <p>Then in time of peace justice will be of no use?</p>
                  <p>I am very far from thinking so.</p>
                  <p>You think that justice may be of use in peace as well as 
                    in war?</p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>Like husbandry for the acquisition of corn?</p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>Or like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes, --that is 
                    whatyou mean?</p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>And what similar use or power of acquisition has justice 
                    in timeof peace?</p>
                  <p>In contracts, Socrates, justice is of use.</p>
                  <p>And by contracts you mean partnerships?</p>
                  <p>Exactly.</p>
                  <p>But is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and 
                    betterpartner at a game of draughts?</p>
                  <p>The skilful player.</p>
                  <p>And in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a 
                    more usefulor better partner than the builder?</p>
                  <p>Quite the reverse.</p>
                  <p>Then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better 
                    partnerthan the harp-player, as in playing the harp the harp-player 
                    iscertainly a better partner than the just man?</p>
                  <p>In a money partnership.</p>
                  <p>Yes, Polemarchus, but surely not in the use of money; for 
                    you do notwant a just man to be your counsellor the purchase 
                    or sale of a horse;a man who is knowing about horses would 
                    be better for that, would henot?</p>
                  <p>Certainly.</p>
                  <p>And when you want to buy a ship, the shipwright or the pilot 
                    wouldbe better?</p>
                  <p>True.</p>
                  <p>Then what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the 
                    justman is to be preferred?</p>
                  <p>When you want a deposit to be kept safely.</p>
                  <p>You mean when money is not wanted, but allowed to lie?</p>
                  <p>Precisely.</p>
                  <p>That is to say, justice is useful when money is useless?</p>
                  <p>That is the inference.</p>
                  <p>And when you want to keep a pruning-hook safe, then justice 
                    isuseful to the individual and to the state; but when you 
                    want to useit, then the art of the vine-dresser?</p>
                  <p>Clearly.</p>
                  <p>And when you want to keep a shield or a lyre, and not to 
                    use them,you would say that justice is useful; but when you 
                    want to use them,then the art of the soldier or of the musician?</p>
                  <p>Certainly.</p>
                  <p>And so of all the other things; --justice is useful when 
                    they areuseless, and useless when they are useful?</p>
                  <p>That is the inference.</p>
                  <p>Then justice is not good for much. But let us consider thisfurther 
                    point: Is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxingmatch 
                    or in any kind of fighting best able to ward off a blow?</p>
                  <p>Certainly.</p>
                  <p>And he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from 
                    adisease is best able to create one?</p>
                  <p>True.</p>
                  <p>And he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to steal 
                    a marchupon the enemy?</p>
                  <p>Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief?</p>
                  <p>That, I suppose, is to be inferred.</p>
                  <p>Then if the just man is good at keeping money, he is good 
                    atstealing it.</p>
                  <p>That is implied in the argument.</p>
                  <p>Then after all the just man has turned out to be a thief. 
                    And thisis a lesson which I suspect you must have learnt out 
                    of Homer; for he,speaking of Autolycus, the maternal grandfather 
                    of Odysseus, who isa favourite of his, affirms that</p>
                  <p>He was excellent above all men in theft and perjury.And so, 
                    you and Homer and Simonides are agreed that justice is anart 
                    of theft; to be practised however 'for the good of friends 
                    and forthe harm of enemies,' --that was what you were saying?</p>
                  <p>No, certainly not that, though I do not now know what I did 
                    say; butI still stand by the latter words.</p>
                  <p>Well, there is another question: By friends and enemies do 
                    we meanthose who are so really, or only in seeming?</p>
                  <p>Surely, he said, a man may be expected to love those whom 
                    hethinks good, and to hate those whom he thinks evil.</p>
                  <p>Yes, but do not persons often err about good and evil: many 
                    whoare not good seem to be so, and conversely?</p>
                  <p>That is true.</p>
                  <p>Then to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be 
                    theirfriends? True.</p>
                  <p>And in that case they will be right in doing good to the 
                    evil andevil to the good?</p>
                  <p>Clearly.</p>
                  <p>But the good are just and would not do an injustice?</p>
                  <p>True.</p>
                  <p>Then according to your argument it is just to injure those 
                    who do nowrong?</p>
                  <p>Nay, Socrates; the doctrine is immoral.</p>
                  <p>Then I suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm 
                    tothe unjust?</p>
                  <p>I like that better.</p>
                  <p>But see the consequence: --Many a man who is ignorant of 
                    humannature has friends who are bad friends, and in that case 
                    he ought todo harm to them; and he has good enemies whom he 
                    ought to benefit;but, if so, we shall be saying the very opposite 
                    of that which weaffirmed to be the meaning of Simonides.</p>
                  <p>Very true, he said: and I think that we had better correct 
                    anerror into which we seem to have fallen in the use of the 
                    words'friend' and 'enemy.'</p>
                  <p>What was the error, Polemarchus? I asked.</p>
                  <p>We assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is 
                    thoughtgood.</p>
                  <p>And how is the error to be corrected?</p>
                  <p>We should rather say that he is a friend who is, as well 
                    as seems,good; and that he who seems only, and is not good, 
                    only seems to beand is not a friend; and of an enemy the same 
                    may be said.</p>
                  <p>You would argue that the good are our friends and the bad 
                    ourenemies?</p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>And instead of saying simply as we did at first, that it 
                    is justto do good to our friends and harm to our enemies, 
                    we should furthersay: It is just to do good to our friends 
                    when they are good andharm to our enemies when they are evil?</p>
                  <p>Yes, that appears to me to be the truth.</p>
                  <p>But ought the just to injure any one at all?</p>
                  <p>Undoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked 
                    and hisenemies.</p>
                  <p>When horses are injured, are they improved or deteriorated?</p>
                  <p>The latter.</p>
                  <p>Deteriorated, that is to say, in the good qualities of horses, 
                    notof dogs?</p>
                  <p>Yes, of horses.</p>
                  <p>And dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs, 
                    and notof horses?</p>
                  <p>Of course.</p>
                  <p>And will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that 
                    which isthe proper virtue of man?</p>
                  <p>Certainly.</p>
                  <p>And that human virtue is justice?</p>
                  <p>To be sure.</p>
                  <p>Then men who are injured are of necessity made unjust?</p>
                  <p>That is the result.</p>
                  <p>But can the musician by his art make men unmusical?</p>
                  <p>Certainly not.</p>
                  <p>Or the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen?</p>
                  <p>Impossible.</p>
                  <p>And can the just by justice make men unjust, or speaking 
                    general canthe good by virtue make them bad?</p>
                  <p>Assuredly not.</p>
                  <p>Any more than heat can produce cold?</p>
                  <p>It cannot.</p>
                  <p>Or drought moisture?</p>
                  <p>Clearly not.</p>
                  <p>Nor can the good harm any one?</p>
                  <p>Impossible.</p>
                  <p>And the just is the good?</p>
                  <p>Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of 
                    a justman, but of the opposite, who is the unjust?</p>
                  <p>I think that what you say is quite true, Socrates.</p>
                  <p>Then if a man says that justice consists in the repayment 
                    ofdebts, and that good is the debt which a man owes to his 
                    friends,and evil the debt which he owes to his enemies, --to 
                    say this is notwise; for it is not true, if, as has been clearly 
                    shown, theinjuring of another can be in no case just.</p>
                  <p>I agree with you, said Polemarchus.</p>
                  <p>Then you and I are prepared to take up arms against any one 
                    whoattributes such a saying to Simonides or Bias or Pittacus, 
                    or anyother wise man or seer?</p>
                  <p>I am quite ready to do battle at your side, he said.</p>
                  <p>Shall I tell you whose I believe the saying to be?</p>
                  <p>Whose?</p>
                  <p>I believe that Periander or Perdiccas or Xerxes or Ismenias 
                    theTheban, or some other rich and mighty man, who had a great 
                    opinionof his own power, was the first to say that justice 
                    is 'doing goodto your friends and harm to your enemies.'</p>
                  <p>Most true, he said.</p>
                  <p>Yes, I said; but if this definition of justice also breaks 
                    down,what other can be offered?</p>
                  <p>Several times in the course of the discussion Thrasymachus 
                    hadmade an attempt to get the argument into his own hands, 
                    and had beenput down by the rest of the company, who wanted 
                    to hear the end. Butwhen Polemarchus and I had done speaking 
                    and there was a pause, hecould no longer hold his peace; and, 
                    gathering himself up, he cameat us like a wild beast, seeking 
                    to devour us. We were quitepanic-stricken at the sight of 
                    him.</p>
                  <p>SOCRATES - POLEMARCHUS - THRASYMACHUS</p>
                  <p>He roared out to the whole company: What folly. Socrates, 
                    hastaken possession of you all? And why, sillybillies, do 
                    you knock underto one another? I say that if you want really 
                    to know what justice is,you should not only ask but answer, 
                    and you should not seek honourto yourself from the refutation 
                    of an opponent, but have your ownanswer; for there is many 
                    a one who can ask and cannot answer. And nowI will not have 
                    you say that justice is duty or advantage or profit orgain 
                    or interest, for this sort of nonsense will not do for me; 
                    I musthave clearness and accuracy.</p>
                  <p>I was panic-stricken at his words, and could not look at 
                    him withouttrembling. Indeed I believe that if I had not fixed 
                    my eye upon him, Ishould have been struck dumb: but when I 
                    saw his fury rising, I lookedat him first, and was therefore 
                    able to reply to him.</p>
                  <p>Thrasymachus, I said, with a quiver, don't be hard upon us.Polemarchus 
                    and I may have been guilty of a little mistake in theargument, 
                    but I can assure you that the error was not intentional.If 
                    we were seeking for a piece of gold, you would not imagine 
                    thatwe were 'knocking under to one another,' and so losing 
                    our chance offinding it. And why, when we are seeking for 
                    justice, a thing moreprecious than many pieces of gold, do 
                    you say that we are weaklyyielding to one another and not 
                    doing our utmost to get at thetruth? Nay, my good friend, 
                    we are most willing and anxious to doso, but the fact is that 
                    we cannot. And if so, you people who know allthings should 
                    pity us and not be angry with us.</p>
                  <p>How characteristic of Socrates! he replied, with a bitter 
                    laugh;--that's your ironical style! Did I not foresee --have 
                    I not alreadytold you, that whatever he was asked he would 
                    refuse to answer, andtry irony or any other shuffle, in order 
                    that he might avoidanswering?</p>
                  <p>You are a philosopher, Thrasymachus, I replied, and well 
                    know thatif you ask a person what numbers make up twelve, 
                    taking care toprohibit him whom you ask from answering twice 
                    six, or three timesfour, or six times two, or four times three, 
                    'for this sort ofnonsense will not do for me,' --then obviously, 
                    that is your way ofputting the question, no one can answer 
                    you. But suppose that hewere to retort, 'Thrasymachus, what 
                    do you mean? If one of thesenumbers which you interdict be 
                    the true answer to the question, am Ifalsely to say some other 
                    number which is not the right one? --is thatyour meaning?' 
                    -How would you answer him?</p>
                  <p>Just as if the two cases were at all alike! he said.</p>
                  <p>Why should they not be? I replied; and even if they are not, 
                    butonly appear to be so to the person who is asked, ought 
                    he not to saywhat he thinks, whether you and I forbid him 
                    or not?</p>
                  <p>I presume then that you are going to make one of the interdictedanswers?</p>
                  <p>I dare say that I may, notwithstanding the danger, if uponreflection 
                    I approve of any of them.</p>
                  <p>But what if I give you an answer about justice other and 
                    better,he said, than any of these? What do you deserve to 
                    have done to you?</p>
                  <p>Done to me! --as becomes the ignorant, I must learn from 
                    the wise--that is what I deserve to have done to me.</p>
                  <p>What, and no payment! a pleasant notion!</p>
                  <p>I will pay when I have the money, I replied.</p>
                  <p>SOCRATES - THRASYMACHUS - GLAUCON</p>
                  <p>But you have, Socrates, said Glaucon: and you, Thrasymachus, 
                    need beunder no anxiety about money, for we will all make 
                    a contributionfor Socrates.</p>
                  <p>Yes, he replied, and then Socrates will do as he always does--refuse 
                    to answer himself, but take and pull to pieces the answerof 
                    some one else.</p>
                  <p>Why, my good friend, I said, how can any one answer who knows, 
                    andsays that he knows, just nothing; and who, even if he has 
                    some faintnotions of his own, is told by a man of authority 
                    not to utter them?The natural thing is, that the speaker should 
                    be some one likeyourself who professes to know and can tell 
                    what he knows. Will youthen kindly answer, for the edification 
                    of the company and of myself ?</p>
                  <p>Glaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request 
                    andThrasymachus, as any one might see, was in reality eager 
                    to speak; forhe thought that he had an excellent answer, and 
                    would distinguishhimself. But at first he to insist on my 
                    answering; at length heconsented to begin. Behold, he said, 
                    the wisdom of Socrates; herefuses to teach himself, and goes 
                    about learning of others, to whomhe never even says thank 
                    you.</p>
                  <p>That I learn of others, I replied, is quite true; but that 
                    I amungrateful I wholly deny. Money I have none, and therefore 
                    I pay inpraise, which is all I have: and how ready I am to 
                    praise any onewho appears to me to speak well you will very 
                    soon find out when youanswer; for I expect that you will answer 
                    well.</p>
                  <p>Listen, then, he said; I proclaim that justice is nothing 
                    elsethan the interest of the stronger. And now why do you 
                    not me? But ofcourse you won't.</p>
                  <p>Let me first understand you, I replied. justice, as you say, 
                    isthe interest of the stronger. What, Thrasymachus, is the 
                    meaning ofthis? You cannot mean to say that because Polydamas, 
                    thepancratiast, is stronger than we are, and finds the eating 
                    of beefconducive to his bodily strength, that to eat beef 
                    is thereforeequally for our good who are weaker than he is, 
                    and right and just forus?</p>
                  <p>That's abominable of you, Socrates; you take the words in 
                    thesense which is most damaging to the argument.</p>
                  <p>Not at all, my good sir, I said; I am trying to understand 
                    them; andI wish that you would be a little clearer.</p>
                  <p>Well, he said, have you never heard that forms of government 
                    differ;there are tyrannies, and there are democracies, and 
                    there arearistocracies?</p>
                  <p>Yes, I know.</p>
                  <p>And the government is the ruling power in each state?</p>
                  <p>Certainly.</p>
                  <p>And the different forms of government make laws democratical,aristocratical, 
                    tyrannical, with a view to their several interests;and these 
                    laws, which are made by them for their own interests, arethe 
                    justice which they deliver to their subjects, and him whotransgresses 
                    them they punish as a breaker of the law, and unjust. Andthat 
                    is what I mean when I say that in all states there is the 
                    sameprinciple of justice, which is the interest of the government; 
                    andas the government must be supposed to have power, the onlyreasonable 
                    conclusion is, that everywhere there is one principle ofjustice, 
                    which is the interest of the stronger.</p>
                  <p>Now I understand you, I said; and whether you are right or 
                    not Iwill try to discover. But let me remark, that in defining 
                    justiceyou have yourself used the word 'interest' which you 
                    forbade me touse. It is true, however, that in your definition 
                    the words 'of thestronger' are added.</p>
                  <p>A small addition, you must allow, he said.</p>
                  <p>Great or small, never mind about that: we must first enquire 
                    whetherwhat you are saying is the truth. Now we are both agreed 
                    thatjustice is interest of some sort, but you go on to say 
                    'of thestronger'; about this addition I am not so sure, and 
                    must thereforeconsider further.</p>
                  <p>Proceed.</p>
                  <p>I will; and first tell me, Do you admit that it is just orsubjects 
                    to obey their rulers?</p>
                  <p>I do.</p>
                  <p>But are the rulers of states absolutely infallible, or are 
                    theysometimes liable to err?</p>
                  <p>To be sure, he replied, they are liable to err.</p>
                  <p>Then in making their laws they may sometimes make them rightly,and 
                    sometimes not?</p>
                  <p>True.</p>
                  <p>When they make them rightly, they make them agreeably to 
                    theirinterest; when they are mistaken, contrary to their interest; 
                    youadmit that?</p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>And the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects, 
                    --andthat is what you call justice?</p>
                  <p>Doubtless.</p>
                  <p>Then justice, according to your argument, is not only obedience 
                    tothe interest of the stronger but the reverse?</p>
                  <p>What is that you are saying? he asked.</p>
                  <p>I am only repeating what you are saying, I believe. But let 
                    usconsider: Have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken 
                    abouttheir own interest in what they command, and also that 
                    to obey them isjustice? Has not that been admitted?</p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>Then you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for 
                    theinterest of the stronger, when the rulers unintentionally 
                    commandthings to be done which are to their own injury. For 
                    if, as you say,justice is the obedience which the subject 
                    renders to theircommands, in that case, O wisest of men, is 
                    there any escape fromthe conclusion that the weaker are commanded 
                    to do, not what is forthe interest, but what is for the injury 
                    of the stronger?</p>
                  <p>Nothing can be clearer, Socrates, said Polemarchus.</p>
                  <p>SOCRATES - CLEITOPHON - POLEMARCHUS - THRASYMACHUS</p>
                  <p>Yes, said Cleitophon, interposing, if you are allowed to 
                    be hiswitness.</p>
                  <p>But there is no need of any witness, said Polemarchus, forThrasymachus 
                    himself acknowledges that rulers may sometimes commandwhat 
                    is not for their own interest, and that for subjects to obey 
                    themis justice.</p>
                  <p>Yes, Polemarchus, --Thrasymachus said that for subjects to 
                    do whatwas commanded by their rulers is just.</p>
                  <p>Yes, Cleitophon, but he also said that justice is the interest 
                    ofthe stronger, and, while admitting both these propositions, 
                    he furtheracknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker 
                    who are hissubjects to do what is not for his own interest; 
                    whence follows thatjustice is the injury quite as much as 
                    the interest of the stronger.</p>
                  <p>But, said Cleitophon, he meant by the interest of the strongerwhat 
                    the stronger thought to be his interest, --this was what theweaker 
                    had to do; and this was affirmed by him to be justice.</p>
                  <p>Those were not his words, rejoined Polemarchus.</p>
                  <p>SOCRATES - THRASYMACHUS</p>
                  <p>Never mind, I replied, if he now says that they are, let 
                    us accepthis statement. Tell me, Thrasymachus, I said, did 
                    you mean byjustice what the stronger thought to be his interest, 
                    whether reallyso or not?</p>
                  <p>Certainly not, he said. Do you suppose that I call him who 
                    ismistaken the stronger at the time when he is mistaken?</p>
                  <p>Yes, I said, my impression was that you did so, when you 
                    admittedthat the ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes 
                    mistaken.</p>
                  <p>You argue like an informer, Socrates. Do you mean, for example, 
                    thathe who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that 
                    he ismistaken? or that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar 
                    is anarithmetician or grammarian at the me when he is making 
                    the mistake,in respect of the mistake? True, we say that the 
                    physician orarithmetician or grammarian has made a mistake, 
                    but this is only a wayof speaking; for the fact is that neither 
                    the grammarian nor any otherperson of skill ever makes a mistake 
                    in so far as he is what hisname implies; they none of them 
                    err unless their skill fails them, andthen they cease to be 
                    skilled artists. No artist or sage or ruler errsat the time 
                    when he is what his name implies; though he is commonlysaid 
                    to err, and I adopted the common mode of speaking. But to 
                    beperfectly accurate, since you are such a lover of accuracy, 
                    weshould say that the ruler, in so far as he is the ruler, 
                    isunerring, and, being unerring, always commands that which 
                    is for hisown interest; and the subject is required to execute 
                    his commands; andtherefore, as I said at first and now repeat, 
                    justice is theinterest of the stronger.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, Thrasymachus, and do I really appear to you to argue 
                    like aninformer?</p>
                  <p>Certainly, he replied.</p>
                  <p>And you suppose that I ask these questions with any design 
                    ofinjuring you in the argument?</p>
                  <p>Nay, he replied, 'suppose' is not the word --I know it; but 
                    you willbe found out, and by sheer force of argument you will 
                    never prevail.</p>
                  <p>I shall not make the attempt, my dear man; but to avoid anymisunderstanding 
                    occurring between us in future, let me ask, in whatsense do 
                    you speak of a ruler or stronger whose interest, as youwere 
                    saying, he being the superior, it is just that the inferiorshould 
                    execute --is he a ruler in the popular or in the strict senseof 
                    the term?</p>
                  <p>In the strictest of all senses, he said. And now cheat and 
                    playthe informer if you can; I ask no quarter at your hands. 
                    But you neverwill be able, never.</p>
                  <p>And do you imagine, I said, that I am such a madman as to 
                    try andcheat, Thrasymachus? I might as well shave a lion.</p>
                  <p>Why, he said, you made the attempt a minute ago, and you 
                    failed.</p>
                  <p>Enough, I said, of these civilities. It will be better that 
                    I shouldask you a question: Is the physician, taken in that 
                    strict sense ofwhich you are speaking, a healer of the sick 
                    or a maker of money?And remember that I am now speaking of 
                    the true physician.</p>
                  <p>A healer of the sick, he replied.</p>
                  <p>And the pilot --that is to say, the true pilot --is he a 
                    captainof sailors or a mere sailor?</p>
                  <p>A captain of sailors.</p>
                  <p>The circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken 
                    intoaccount; neither is he to be called a sailor; the name 
                    pilot bywhich he is distinguished has nothing to do with sailing, 
                    but issignificant of his skill and of his authority over the 
                    sailors.</p>
                  <p>Very true, he said.</p>
                  <p>Now, I said, every art has an interest?</p>
                  <p>Certainly.</p>
                  <p>For which the art has to consider and provide?</p>
                  <p>Yes, that is the aim of art.</p>
                  <p>And the interest of any art is the perfection of it --this 
                    andnothing else?</p>
                  <p>What do you mean?</p>
                  <p>I mean what I may illustrate negatively by the example of 
                    thebody. Suppose you were to ask me whether the body is self-sufficing 
                    orhas wants, I should reply: Certainly the body has wants; 
                    for thebody may be ill and require to be cured, and has therefore 
                    intereststo which the art of medicine ministers; and this 
                    is the origin andintention of medicine, as you will acknowledge. 
                    Am I not right?</p>
                  <p>Quite right, he replied.</p>
                  <p>But is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient 
                    inany quality in the same way that the eye may be deficient 
                    in sightor the ear fail of hearing, and therefore requires 
                    another art toprovide for the interests of seeing and hearing 
                    --has art in itself, Isay, any similar liability to fault 
                    or defect, and does every artrequire another supplementary 
                    art to provide for its interests, andthat another and another 
                    without end? Or have the arts to look onlyafter their own 
                    interests? Or have they no need either of themselvesor of 
                    another? --having no faults or defects, they have no need 
                    tocorrect them, either by the exercise of their own art or 
                    of any other;they have only to consider the interest of their 
                    subject-matter. Forevery art remains pure and faultless while 
                    remaining true --that is tosay, while perfect and unimpaired. 
                    Take the words in your precisesense, and tell me whether I 
                    am not right.&quot;</p>
                  <p>Yes, clearly.</p>
                  <p>Then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine, 
                    but theinterest of the body?</p>
                  <p>True, he said.</p>
                  <p>Nor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of 
                    the artof horsemanship, but the interests of the horse; neither 
                    do anyother arts care for themselves, for they have no needs; 
                    they care onlyfor that which is the subject of their art?</p>
                  <p>True, he said.</p>
                  <p>But surely, Thrasymachus, the arts are the superiors and 
                    rulers oftheir own subjects?</p>
                  <p>To this he assented with a good deal of reluctance.</p>
                  <p>Then, I said, no science or art considers or enjoins the 
                    interest ofthe stronger or superior, but only the interest 
                    of the subject andweaker?</p>
                  <p>He made an attempt to contest this proposition also, but 
                    finallyacquiesced.</p>
                  <p>Then, I continued, no physician, in so far as he is a physician,considers 
                    his own good in what he prescribes, but the good of hispatient; 
                    for the true physician is also a ruler having the humanbody 
                    as a subject, and is not a mere money-maker; that has beenadmitted?</p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>And the pilot likewise, in the strict sense of the term, 
                    is aruler of sailors and not a mere sailor?</p>
                  <p>That has been admitted.</p>
                  <p>And such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for 
                    theinterest of the sailor who is under him, and not for his 
                    own or theruler's interest?</p>
                  <p>He gave a reluctant 'Yes.'</p>
                  <p>Then, I said, Thrasymachus, there is no one in any rule who, 
                    in sofar as he is a ruler, considers or enjoins what is for 
                    his owninterest, but always what is for the interest of his 
                    subject orsuitable to his art; to that he looks, and that 
                    alone he considersin everything which he says and does.</p>
                  <p>When we had got to this point in the argument, and every 
                    one sawthat the definition of justice had been completely 
                    upset,Thrasymachus, instead of replying to me, said: Tell 
                    me, Socrates, haveyou got a nurse?</p>
                  <p>Why do you ask such a question, I said, when you ought rather 
                    tobe answering?</p>
                  <p>Because she leaves you to snivel, and never wipes your nose: 
                    she hasnot even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep.</p>
                  <p>What makes you say that? I replied.</p>
                  <p>Because you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens of 
                    tends thesheep or oxen with a view to their own good and not 
                    to the good ofhimself or his master; and you further imagine 
                    that the rulers ofstates, if they are true rulers, never think 
                    of their subjects assheep, and that they are not studying 
                    their own advantage day andnight. Oh, no; and so entirely 
                    astray are you in your ideas aboutthe just and unjust as not 
                    even to know that justice and the justare in reality another's 
                    good; that is to say, the interest of theruler and stronger, 
                    and the loss of the subject and servant; andinjustice the 
                    opposite; for the unjust is lord over the truly simpleand 
                    just: he is the stronger, and his subjects do what is for 
                    hisinterest, and minister to his happiness, which is very 
                    far frombeing their own. Consider further, most foolish Socrates, 
                    that thejust is always a loser in comparison with the unjust. 
                    First of all, inprivate contracts: wherever the unjust is 
                    the partner of the justyou will find that, when the partnership 
                    is dissolved, the unjustman has always more and the just less. 
                    Secondly, in their dealingswith the State: when there is an 
                    income tax, the just man will paymore and the unjust less 
                    on the same amount of income; and whenthere is anything to 
                    be received the one gains nothing and the othermuch. Observe 
                    also what happens when they take an office; there is thejust 
                    man neglecting his affairs and perhaps suffering other losses,and 
                    getting nothing out of the public, because he is just; moreover 
                    heis hated by his friends and acquaintance for refusing to 
                    serve them inunlawful ways. But all this is reversed in the 
                    case of the unjust man.I am speaking, as before, of injustice 
                    on a large scale in which theadvantage of the unjust is more 
                    apparent; and my meaning will bemost clearly seen if we turn 
                    to that highest form of injustice inwhich the criminal is 
                    the happiest of men, and the sufferers orthose who refuse 
                    to do injustice are the most miserable --that is tosay tyranny, 
                    which by fraud and force takes away the property ofothers, 
                    not little by little but wholesale; comprehending in one,things 
                    sacred as well as profane, private and public; for which actsof 
                    wrong, if he were detected perpetrating any one of them singly,he 
                    would be punished and incur great disgrace --they who do such 
                    wrongin particular cases are called robbers of temples, and 
                    man-stealersand burglars and swindlers and thieves. But when 
                    a man besidestaking away the money of the citizens has made 
                    slaves of them, then,instead of these names of reproach, he 
                    is termed happy and blessed,not only by the citizens but by 
                    all who hear of his having achievedthe consummation of injustice. 
                    For mankind censure injustice,fearing that they may be the 
                    victims of it and not because they shrinkfrom committing it. 
                    And thus, as I have shown, Socrates, injustice,when on a sufficient 
                    scale, has more strength and freedom andmastery than justice; 
                    and, as I said at first, justice is the interestof the stronger, 
                    whereas injustice is a man's own profit and interest.</p>
                  <p>Thrasymachus, when he had thus spoken, having, like a bathman,deluged 
                    our ears with his words, had a mind to go away. But thecompany 
                    would not let him; they insisted that he should remain anddefend 
                    his position; and I myself added my own humble request thathe 
                    would not leave us. Thrasymachus, I said to him, excellent 
                    man, howsuggestive are your remarks! And are you going to 
                    run away beforeyou have fairly taught or learned whether they 
                    are true or not? Is theattempt to determine the way of man's 
                    life so small a matter in youreyes --to determine how life 
                    may be passed by each one of us to thegreatest advantage?</p>
                  <p>And do I differ from you, he said, as to the importance of 
                    theenquiry?</p>
                  <p>You appear rather, I replied, to have no care or thought 
                    about us,Thrasymachus --whether we live better or worse from 
                    not knowing whatyou say you know, is to you a matter of indifference. 
                    Prithee, friend,do not keep your knowledge to yourself; we 
                    are a large party; andany benefit which you confer upon us 
                    will be amply rewarded. For myown part I openly declare that 
                    I am not convinced, and that I do notbelieve injustice to 
                    be more gainful than justice, even ifuncontrolled and allowed 
                    to have free play. For, granting that theremay be an unjust 
                    man who is able to commit injustice either by fraudor force, 
                    still this does not convince me of the superior advantage 
                    ofinjustice, and there may be others who are in the same predicamentwith 
                    myself. Perhaps we may be wrong; if so, you in your wisdom 
                    shouldconvince us that we are mistaken in preferring justice 
                    to injustice.</p>
                  <p>And how am I to convince you, he said, if you are not alreadyconvinced 
                    by what I have just said; what more can I do for you?Would 
                    you have me put the proof bodily into your souls?</p>
                  <p>Heaven forbid! I said; I would only ask you to be consistent; 
                    or, ifyou change, change openly and let there be no deception. 
                    For I mustremark, Thrasymachus, if you will recall what was 
                    previously said,that although you began by defining the true 
                    physician in an exactsense, you did not observe a like exactness 
                    when speaking of theshepherd; you thought that the shepherd 
                    as a shepherd tends thesheep not with a view to their own 
                    good, but like a mere diner orbanqueter with a view to the 
                    pleasures of the table; or, again, as atrader for sale in 
                    the market, and not as a shepherd. Yet surely theart of the 
                    shepherd is concerned only with the good of his subjects;he 
                    has only to provide the best for them, since the perfection 
                    ofthe art is already ensured whenever all the requirements 
                    of it aresatisfied. And that was what I was saying just now 
                    about the ruler.I conceived that the art of the ruler, considered 
                    as ruler, whether ina state or in private life, could only 
                    regard the good of his flock orsubjects; whereas you seem 
                    to think that the rulers in states, that isto say, the true 
                    rulers, like being in authority.</p>
                  <p>Think! Nay, I am sure of it.</p>
                  <p>Then why in the case of lesser offices do men never take 
                    themwillingly without payment, unless under the idea that 
                    they governfor the advantage not of themselves but of others? 
                    Let me ask you aquestion: Are not the several arts different, 
                    by reason of theireach having a separate function? And, my 
                    dear illustrious friend, dosay what you think, that we may 
                    make a little progress.</p>
                  <p>Yes, that is the difference, he replied.</p>
                  <p>And each art gives us a particular good and not merely a 
                    general one--medicine, for example, gives us health; navigation, 
                    safety at sea,and so on?</p>
                  <p>Yes, he said.</p>
                  <p>And the art of payment has the special function of giving 
                    pay: butwe do not confuse this with other arts, any more than 
                    the art of thepilot is to be confused with the art of medicine, 
                    because the healthof the pilot may be improved by a sea voyage. 
                    You would not beinclined to say, would you, that navigation 
                    is the art of medicine, atleast if we are to adopt your exact 
                    use of language?</p>
                  <p>Certainly not.</p>
                  <p>Or because a man is in good health when he receives pay you 
                    wouldnot say that the art of payment is medicine?</p>
                  <p>I should say not.</p>
                  <p>Nor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving paybecause 
                    a man takes fees when he is engaged in healing?</p>
                  <p>Certainly not.</p>
                  <p>And we have admitted, I said, that the good of each art is 
                    speciallyconfined to the art?</p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>Then, if there be any good which all artists have in common, 
                    that isto be attributed to something of which they all have 
                    the common use?</p>
                  <p>True, he replied.</p>
                  <p>And when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage 
                    isgained by an additional use of the art of pay, which is 
                    not the artprofessed by him?</p>
                  <p>He gave a reluctant assent to this.</p>
                  <p>Then the pay is not derived by the several artists from theirrespective 
                    arts. But the truth is, that while the art of medicinegives 
                    health, and the art of the builder builds a house, another 
                    artattends them which is the art of pay. The various arts 
                    may be doingtheir own business and benefiting that over which 
                    they preside, butwould the artist receive any benefit from 
                    his art unless he werepaid as well?</p>
                  <p>I suppose not.</p>
                  <p>But does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for 
                    nothing?</p>
                  <p>Certainly, he confers a benefit.</p>
                  <p>Then now, Thrasymachus, there is no longer any doubt that 
                    neitherarts nor governments provide for their own interests; 
                    but, as wewere before saying, they rule and provide for the 
                    interests of theirsubjects who are the weaker and not the 
                    stronger --to their goodthey attend and not to the good of 
                    the superior.</p>
                  <p>And this is the reason, my dear Thrasymachus, why, as I was 
                    just nowsaying, no one is willing to govern; because no one 
                    likes to take inhand the reformation of evils which are not 
                    his concern withoutremuneration. For, in the execution of 
                    his work, and in giving hisorders to another, the true artist 
                    does not regard his own interest,but always that of his subjects; 
                    and therefore in order that rulersmay be willing to rule, 
                    they must be paid in one of three modes ofpayment: money, 
                    or honour, or a penalty for refusing.</p>
                  <p>SOCRATES - GLAUCON</p>
                  <p>What do you mean, Socrates? said Glaucon. The first two modes 
                    ofpayment are intelligible enough, but what the penalty is 
                    I do notunderstand, or how a penalty can be a payment.</p>
                  <p>You mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment 
                    whichto the best men is the great inducement to rule? Of course 
                    you knowthat ambition and avarice are held to be, as indeed 
                    they are, adisgrace?</p>
                  <p>Very true.</p>
                  <p>And for this reason, I said, money and honour have no attraction 
                    forthem; good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment 
                    forgoverning and so to get the name of hirelings, nor by secretly 
                    helpingthemselves out of the public revenues to get the name 
                    of thieves.And not being ambitious they do not care about 
                    honour. Whereforenecessity must be laid upon them, and they 
                    must be induced to servefrom the fear of punishment. And this, 
                    as I imagine, is the reason whythe forwardness to take office, 
                    instead of waiting to be compelled,has been deemed dishonourable. 
                    Now the worst part of the punishment isthat he who refuses 
                    to rule is liable to be ruled by one who isworse than himself. 
                    And the fear of this, as I conceive, induces thegood to take 
                    office, not because they would, but because they cannothelp 
                    --not under the idea that they are going to have any benefit 
                    orenjoyment themselves, but as a necessity, and because they 
                    are notable to commit the task of ruling to any one who is 
                    better thanthemselves, or indeed as good. For there is reason 
                    to think that ifa city were composed entirely of good men, 
                    then to avoid officewould be as much an object of contention 
                    as to obtain office is atpresent; then we should have plain 
                    proof that the true ruler is notmeant by nature to regard 
                    his own interest, but that of hissubjects; and every one who 
                    knew this would choose rather to receive abenefit from another 
                    than to have the trouble of conferring one. Sofar am I from 
                    agreeing with Thrasymachus that justice is theinterest of 
                    the stronger. This latter question need not be furtherdiscussed 
                    at present; but when Thrasymachus says that the life ofthe 
                    unjust is more advantageous than that of the just, his newstatement 
                    appears to me to be of a far more serious character. Whichof 
                    us has spoken truly? And which sort of life, Glaucon, do youprefer?</p>
                  <p>I for my part deem the life of the just to be the more advantageous,he 
                    answered.</p>
                  <p>Did you hear all the advantages of the unjust which Thrasymachus 
                    wasrehearsing?</p>
                  <p>Yes, I heard him, he replied, but he has not convinced me.</p>
                  <p>Then shall we try to find some way of convincing him, if 
                    we can,that he is saying what is not true?</p>
                  <p>Most certainly, he replied.</p>
                  <p>If, I said, he makes a set speech and we make another recounting 
                    allthe advantages of being just, and he answers and we rejoin, 
                    there mustbe a numbering and measuring of the goods which 
                    are claimed oneither side, and in the end we shall want judges 
                    to decide; but ifwe proceed in our enquiry as we lately did, 
                    by making admissions toone another, we shall unite the offices 
                    of judge and advocate in ourown persons.</p>
                  <p>Very good, he said.</p>
                  <p>And which method do I understand you to prefer? I said.</p>
                  <p>That which you propose.</p>
                  <p>Well, then, Thrasymachus, I said, suppose you begin at the 
                    beginningand answer me. You say that perfect injustice is 
                    more gainful thanperfect justice?</p>
                  <p>SOCRATES - GLAUCON - THRASYMACHUS</p>
                  <p>Yes, that is what I say, and I have given you my reasons.</p>
                  <p>And what is your view about them? Would you call one of themvirtue 
                    and the other vice?</p>
                  <p>Certainly.</p>
                  <p>I suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice 
                    vice?</p>
                  <p>What a charming notion! So likely too, seeing that I affirminjustice 
                    to be profitable and justice not.</p>
                  <p>What else then would you say?</p>
                  <p>The opposite, he replied.</p>
                  <p>And would you call justice vice?</p>
                  <p>No, I would rather say sublime simplicity.</p>
                  <p>Then would you call injustice malignity?</p>
                  <p>No; I would rather say discretion.</p>
                  <p>And do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good?</p>
                  <p>Yes, he said; at any rate those of them who are able to be 
                    perfectlyunjust, and who have the power of subduing states 
                    and nations; butperhaps you imagine me to be talking of cutpurses.</p>
                  <p>Even this profession if undetected has advantages, though 
                    they arenot to be compared with those of which I was just 
                    now speaking.</p>
                  <p>I do not think that I misapprehend your meaning, Thrasymachus, 
                    Ireplied; but still I cannot hear without amazement that you 
                    classinjustice with wisdom and virtue, and justice with the 
                    opposite.</p>
                  <p>Certainly I do so class them.</p>
                  <p>Now, I said, you are on more substantial and almost unanswerableground; 
                    for if the injustice which you were maintaining to beprofitable 
                    had been admitted by you as by others to be vice anddeformity, 
                    an answer might have been given to you on receivedprinciples; 
                    but now I perceive that you will call injustice honourableand 
                    strong, and to the unjust you will attribute all the qualitieswhich 
                    were attributed by us before to the just, seeing that you 
                    do nothesitate to rank injustice with wisdom and virtue.</p>
                  <p>You have guessed most infallibly, he replied.</p>
                  <p>Then I certainly ought not to shrink from going through with 
                    theargument so long as I have reason to think that you, Thrasymachus, 
                    arespeaking your real mind; for I do believe that you are 
                    now inearnest and are not amusing yourself at our expense.</p>
                  <p>I may be in earnest or not, but what is that to you? --to 
                    refute theargument is your business.</p>
                  <p>Very true, I said; that is what I have to do: But will you 
                    be sogood as answer yet one more question? Does the just man 
                    try to gainany advantage over the just?</p>
                  <p>Far otherwise; if he did would not be the simple, amusing 
                    creaturewhich he is.</p>
                  <p>And would he try to go beyond just action?</p>
                  <p>He would not.</p>
                  <p>And how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage 
                    over theunjust; would that be considered by him as just or 
                    unjust?</p>
                  <p>He would think it just, and would try to gain the advantage; 
                    buthe would not be able.</p>
                  <p>Whether he would or would not be able, I said, is not to 
                    thepoint. My question is only whether the just man, while 
                    refusing tohave more than another just man, would wish and 
                    claim to have morethan the unjust?</p>
                  <p>Yes, he would.</p>
                  <p>And what of the unjust --does he claim to have more than 
                    the justman and to do more than is just</p>
                  <p>Of course, he said, for he claims to have more than all men.</p>
                  <p>And the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more 
                    thanthe unjust man or action, in order that he may have more 
                    than all?</p>
                  <p>True.</p>
                  <p>We may put the matter thus, I said --the just does not desire 
                    morethan his like but more than his unlike, whereas the unjust 
                    desiresmore than both his like and his unlike?</p>
                  <p>Nothing, he said, can be better than that statement.</p>
                  <p>And the unjust is good and wise, and the just is neither?</p>
                  <p>Good again, he said.</p>
                  <p>And is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just 
                    unlikethem?</p>
                  <p>Of course, he said, he who is of a certain nature, is like 
                    those whoare of a certain nature; he who is not, not.</p>
                  <p>Each of them, I said, is such as his like is?</p>
                  <p>Certainly, he replied.</p>
                  <p>Very good, Thrasymachus, I said; and now to take the case 
                    of thearts: you would admit that one man is a musician and 
                    another not amusician?</p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>And which is wise and which is foolish?</p>
                  <p>Clearly the musician is wise, and he who is not a musician 
                    isfoolish.</p>
                  <p>And he is good in as far as he is wise, and bad in as far 
                    as he isfoolish?</p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>And you would say the same sort of thing of the physician?</p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>And do you think, my excellent friend, that a musician when 
                    headjusts the lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond 
                    amusician in the tightening and loosening the strings?</p>
                  <p>I do not think that he would.</p>
                  <p>But he would claim to exceed the non-musician?</p>
                  <p>Of course.</p>
                  <p>And what would you say of the physician? In prescribing meats 
                    anddrinks would he wish to go beyond another physician or 
                    beyond thepractice of medicine?</p>
                  <p>He would not.</p>
                  <p>But he would wish to go beyond the non-physician?</p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>And about knowledge and ignorance in general; see whether 
                    youthink that any man who has knowledge ever would wish to 
                    have thechoice of saying or doing more than another man who 
                    has knowledge.Would he not rather say or do the same as his 
                    like in the same case?</p>
                  <p>That, I suppose, can hardly be denied.</p>
                  <p>And what of the ignorant? would he not desire to have more 
                    thaneither the knowing or the ignorant?</p>
                  <p>I dare say.</p>
                  <p>And the knowing is wise?</p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>And the wise is good?</p>
                  <p>True.</p>
                  <p>Then the wise and good will not desire to gain more than 
                    his like,but more than his unlike and opposite?</p>
                  <p>I suppose so.</p>
                  <p>Whereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than 
                    both?</p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>But did we not say, Thrasymachus, that the unjust goes beyond 
                    bothhis like and unlike? Were not these your words? They were.</p>
                  <p>They were.</p>
                  <p>And you also said that the lust will not go beyond his like 
                    buthis unlike?</p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>Then the just is like the wise and good, and the unjust like 
                    theevil and ignorant?</p>
                  <p>That is the inference.</p>
                  <p>And each of them is such as his like is?</p>
                  <p>That was admitted.</p>
                  <p>Then the just has turned out to be wise and good and the 
                    unjust eviland ignorant.</p>
                  <p>Thrasymachus made all these admissions, not fluently, as 
                    I repeatthem, but with extreme reluctance; it was a hot summer's 
                    day, andthe perspiration poured from him in torrents; and 
                    then I saw what Ihad never seen before, Thrasymachus blushing. 
                    As we were now agreedthat justice was virtue and wisdom, and 
                    injustice vice andignorance, I proceeded to another point:</p>
                  <p>Well, I said, Thrasymachus, that matter is now settled; but 
                    werewe not also saying that injustice had strength; do you 
                    remember?</p>
                  <p>Yes, I remember, he said, but do not suppose that I approve 
                    ofwhat you are saying or have no answer; if however I were 
                    to answer,you would be quite certain to accuse me of haranguing; 
                    thereforeeither permit me to have my say out, or if you would 
                    rather ask, doso, and I will answer 'Very good,' as they say 
                    to story-telling oldwomen, and will nod 'Yes' and 'No.'</p>
                  <p>Certainly not, I said, if contrary to your real opinion.</p>
                  <p>Yes, he said, I will, to please you, since you will not let 
                    mespeak. What else would you have?</p>
                  <p>Nothing in the world, I said; and if you are so disposed 
                    I willask and you shall answer.</p>
                  <p>Proceed.</p>
                  <p>Then I will repeat the question which I asked before, in 
                    orderthat our examination of the relative nature of justice 
                    and injusticemay be carried on regularly. A statement was 
                    made that injustice isstronger and more powerful than justice, 
                    but now justice, havingbeen identified with wisdom and virtue, 
                    is easily shown to be strongerthan injustice, if injustice 
                    is ignorance; this can no longer bequestioned by any one. 
                    But I want to view the matter, Thrasymachus, ina different 
                    way: You would not deny that a state may be unjust and maybe 
                    unjustly attempting to enslave other states, or may have alreadyenslaved 
                    them, and may be holding many of them in subjection?</p>
                  <p>True, he replied; and I will add the best and perfectly unjust 
                    statewill be most likely to do so.</p>
                  <p>I know, I said, that such was your position; but what I wouldfurther 
                    consider is, whether this power which is possessed by thesuperior 
                    state can exist or be exercised without justice.</p>
                  <p>If you are right in you view, and justice is wisdom, then 
                    onlywith justice; but if I am right, then without justice.</p>
                  <p>I am delighted, Thrasymachus, to see you not only nodding 
                    assent anddissent, but making answers which are quite excellent.</p>
                  <p>That is out of civility to you, he replied.</p>
                  <p>You are very kind, I said; and would you have the goodness 
                    also toinform me, whether you think that a state, or an army, 
                    or a band ofrobbers and thieves, or any other gang of evil-doers 
                    could act atall if they injured one another?</p>
                  <p>No indeed, he said, they could not.</p>
                  <p>But if they abstained from injuring one another, then they 
                    might acttogether better?</p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>And this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds 
                    andfighting, and justice imparts harmony and friendship; is 
                    not thattrue, Thrasymachus?</p>
                  <p>I agree, he said, because I do not wish to quarrel with you.</p>
                  <p>How good of you, I said; but I should like to know also whetherinjustice, 
                    having this tendency to arouse hatred, wherever existing,among 
                    slaves or among freemen, will not make them hate one another 
                    andset them at variance and render them incapable of common 
                    action?</p>
                  <p>Certainly.</p>
                  <p>And even if injustice be found in two only, will they not 
                    quarreland fight, and become enemies to one another and to 
                    the just</p>
                  <p>They will.</p>
                  <p>And suppose injustice abiding in a single person, would yourwisdom 
                    say that she loses or that she retains her natural power?</p>
                  <p>Let us assume that she retains her power.</p>
                  <p>Yet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a 
                    nature thatwherever she takes up her abode, whether in a city, 
                    in an army, in afamily, or in any other body, that body is, 
                    to begin with, renderedincapable of united action by reason 
                    of sedition and distraction;and does it not become its own 
                    enemy and at variance with all thatopposes it, and with the 
                    just? Is not this the case?</p>
                  <p>Yes, certainly.</p>
                  <p>And is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single 
                    person;in the first place rendering him incapable of action 
                    because he is notat unity with himself, and in the second 
                    place making him an enemyto himself and the just? Is not that 
                    true, Thrasymachus?</p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>And O my friend, I said, surely the gods are just?</p>
                  <p>Granted that they are.</p>
                  <p>But if so, the unjust will be the enemy of the gods, and 
                    the justwill be their friend?</p>
                  <p>Feast away in triumph, and take your fill of the argument; 
                    I willnot oppose you, lest I should displease the company.</p>
                  <p>Well then, proceed with your answers, and let me have theremainder 
                    of my repast. For we have already shown that the just areclearly 
                    wiser and better and abler than the unjust, and that theunjust 
                    are incapable of common action; nay ing at more, that tospeak 
                    as we did of men who are evil acting at any time vigorouslytogether, 
                    is not strictly true, for if they had been perfectly evil,they 
                    would have laid hands upon one another; but it is evident 
                    thatthere must have been some remnant of justice in them, 
                    which enabledthem to combine; if there had not been they would 
                    have injured oneanother as well as their victims; they were 
                    but half --villains intheir enterprises; for had they been 
                    whole villains, and utterlyunjust, they would have been utterly 
                    incapable of action. That, as Ibelieve, is the truth of the 
                    matter, and not what you said at first.But whether the just 
                    have a better and happier life than the unjust isa further 
                    question which we also proposed to consider. I think thatthey 
                    have, and for the reasons which to have given; but still I 
                    shouldlike to examine further, for no light matter is at stake, 
                    nothing lessthan the rule of human life.</p>
                  <p>Proceed.</p>
                  <p>I will proceed by asking a question: Would you not say that 
                    ahorse has some end?</p>
                  <p>I should.</p>
                  <p>And the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that 
                    whichcould not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, 
                    by any otherthing?</p>
                  <p>I do not understand, he said.</p>
                  <p>Let me explain: Can you see, except with the eye?</p>
                  <p>Certainly not.</p>
                  <p>Or hear, except with the ear?</p>
                  <p>No.</p>
                  <p>These then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs?</p>
                  <p>They may.</p>
                  <p>But you can cut off a vine-branch with a dagger or with a 
                    chisel,and in many other ways?</p>
                  <p>Of course.</p>
                  <p>And yet not so well as with a pruning-hook made for the purpose?</p>
                  <p>True.</p>
                  <p>May we not say that this is the end of a pruning-hook?</p>
                  <p>We may.</p>
                  <p>Then now I think you will have no difficulty in understanding 
                    mymeaning when I asked the question whether the end of anything 
                    would bethat which could not be accomplished, or not so well 
                    accomplished,by any other thing?</p>
                  <p>I understand your meaning, he said, and assent.</p>
                  <p>And that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence? 
                    Need Iask again whether the eye has an end?</p>
                  <p>It has.</p>
                  <p>And has not the eye an excellence?</p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>And the ear has an end and an excellence also?</p>
                  <p>True.</p>
                  <p>And the same is true of all other things; they have each 
                    of theman end and a special excellence?</p>
                  <p>That is so.</p>
                  <p>Well, and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting 
                    in theirown proper excellence and have a defect instead?</p>
                  <p>How can they, he said, if they are blind and cannot see?</p>
                  <p>You mean to say, if they have lost their proper excellence, 
                    which issight; but I have not arrived at that point yet. I 
                    would rather askthe question more generally, and only enquire 
                    whether the things whichfulfil their ends fulfil them by their 
                    own proper excellence, and fallof fulfilling them by their 
                    own defect?</p>
                  <p>Certainly, he replied.</p>
                  <p>I might say the same of the ears; when deprived of their 
                    ownproper excellence they cannot fulfil their end?</p>
                  <p>True.</p>
                  <p>And the same observation will apply to all other things?</p>
                  <p>I agree.</p>
                  <p>Well; and has not the soul an end which nothing else can 
                    fulfil? forexample, to superintend and command and deliberate 
                    and the like. Arenot these functions proper to the soul, and 
                    can they rightly beassigned to any other?</p>
                  <p>To no other.</p>
                  <p>And is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul?</p>
                  <p>Assuredly, he said.</p>
                  <p>And has not the soul an excellence also?</p>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
                  <p>And can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived 
                    of thatexcellence?</p>
                  <p>She cannot.</p>
                  <p>Then an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler andsuperintendent, 
                    and the good soul a good ruler?</p>
                  <p>Yes, necessarily.</p>
                  <p>And we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the 
                    soul, andinjustice the defect of the soul?</p>
                  <p>That has been admitted.</p>
                  <p>Then the just soul and the just man will live well, and the 
                    unjustman will live ill?</p>
                  <p>That is what your argument proves.</p>
                  <p>And he who lives well is blessed and happy, and he who lives 
                    ill thereverse of happy?</p>
                  <p>Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Then the just is happy, and the unjust miserable?</p>
                  <p>So be it.</p>
                  <p>But happiness and not misery is profitable.</p>
                  <p>Of course.</p>
                  <p>Then, my blessed Thrasymachus, injustice can never be moreprofitable 
                    than justice.</p>
                  <p>Let this, Socrates, he said, be your entertainment at the 
                    Bendidea.</p>
                  <p>For which I am indebted to you, I said, now that you have 
                    growngentle towards me and have left off scolding. Nevertheless, 
                    I have notbeen well entertained; but that was my own fault 
                    and not yours. Asan epicure snatches a taste of every dish 
                    which is successivelybrought to table, he not having allowed 
                    himself time to enjoy theone before, so have I gone from one 
                    subject to another withouthaving discovered what I sought 
                    at first, the nature of justice. Ileft that enquiry and turned 
                    away to consider whether justice isvirtue and wisdom or evil 
                    and folly; and when there arose a furtherquestion about the 
                    comparative advantages of justice and injustice,I could not 
                    refrain from passing on to that. And the result of thewhole 
                    discussion has been that I know nothing at all. For I know 
                    notwhat justice is, and therefore I am not likely to know 
                    whether it isor is not a virtue, nor can I say whether the 
                    just man is happy or unhappy.</p>

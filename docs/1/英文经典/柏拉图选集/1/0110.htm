                    And now having spoken of assaults, let us sum up all acts 
                    ofviolence under a single law, which shall be as follows:-No 
                    one shalltake or carry away any of his neighbour's goods, 
                    neither shall heuse anything which is his neighbour's without 
                    the consent of theowner; for these are the offences which 
                    are and have been, and willever be, the source of all the 
                    aforesaid evils. The greatest of themare excesses and insolences 
                    of youth, and are offences against thegreatest when they are 
                    done against religion; and especially greatwhen in violation 
                    of public and holy rites, or of the partly-commonrites in 
                    which tribes and phratries share; and in the second degreegreat 
                    when they are committed against private rites and sepulchres,and 
                    in the third degree (not to repeat the acts formerly mentioned),when 
                    insults are offered to parents; the fourth kind of violence 
                    iswhen any one, regardless of the authority of the rulers, 
                    takes orcarries away or makes use of anything which belongs 
                    to them, nothaving their consent; and the fifth kind is when 
                    the violation ofthe civil rights of an individual demands 
                    reparation. There shouldbe a common law embracing all these 
                    cases. For we have already said ingeneral terms what shall 
                    be the punishment of sacrilege, whetherfraudulent or violent, 
                    and now we have to determine what is to bethe punishment of 
                    those who speak or act insolently toward the Gods.But first 
                    we must give them an admonition which may be in thefollowing 
                    terms:-No one who in obedience to the laws believed thatthere 
                    were Gods, ever intentionally did any unholy act, or uttered 
                    anyunlawful word; but he who did must have supposed one of 
                    threethings-either that they did not exist,-which is the first 
                    possibility,or secondly, that, if they did, they took no care 
                    of man, orthirdly, that they were easily appeased and turned 
                    aside from theirpurpose, by sacrifices and prayers.</p>
                  <p>Cleinias. What shall we say or do to these persons?</p>
                  <p>Athenian Stranger. My good friend, let us first hear the 
                    jests whichI suspect that they in their superiority will utter 
                    against us.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What jests?</p>
                  <p>Ath. They will make some irreverent speech of this sort:-&quot;Oinhabitants 
                    of Athens, and Sparta, and Cnosus,&quot; they will reply, 
                    &quot;inthat you speak truly; for some of us deny the very 
                    existence of theGods, while others, as you say, are of opinion 
                    that they do not careabout us; and others that they are turned 
                    from their course bygifts. Now we have a right to claim, as 
                    you yourself allowed, in thematter of laws, that before you 
                    are hard upon us and threaten us,you should argue with us 
                    and convince us-you should first attempt toteach and persuade 
                    us that there are Gods by reasonable evidences, andalso that 
                    they are too good to be unrighteous, or to be propitiated,or 
                    turned from their course by gifts. For when we hear such thingssaid 
                    of them by those who are esteemed to be the best of poets, 
                    andorators, and prophets, and priests, and by innumerable 
                    others, thethoughts of most of us are not set upon abstaining 
                    from unrighteousacts, but upon doing them and atoning for 
                    them. When lawgivers professthat they are gentle and not stern, 
                    we think that they should first ofall use persuasion to us, 
                    and show us the existence of Gods, if not ina better manner 
                    than other men, at any rate in a truer; and whoknows but that 
                    we shall hearken to you? If then our request is afair one, 
                    please to accept our challenge.&quot;</p>
                  <p>Cle. But is there any difficulty in proving the existence 
                    of theGods?</p>
                  <p>Ath. How would you prove it?</p>
                  <p>Cle. How? In the first place, the earth and the sun, and 
                    the starsand the universe, and the fair order of the seasons, 
                    and thedivision of them into years and months, furnish proofs 
                    of theirexistence; and also there is the fact that all Hellenes 
                    and barbariansbelieve in them.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I fear, my sweet friend, though I will not say that 
                    I muchregard, the contempt with which the profane will be 
                    likely to assailus. For you do not understand the nature of 
                    their complaint, and youfancy that they rush into impiety 
                    only from a love of sensualpleasure.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Why, Stranger, what other reason is there?</p>
                  <p>Ath. One which you who live in a different atmosphere would 
                    neverguess.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What is it?</p>
                  <p>Ath. A very grievous sort of ignorance which is imagined 
                    to be thegreatest wisdom.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. At Athens there are tales preserved in writing which 
                    the virtueof your state, as I am informed, refuses to admit. 
                    They speak of theGods in prose as well as verse, and the oldest 
                    of them tell of theorigin of the heavens and of the world, 
                    and not far from the beginningof their story they proceed 
                    to narrate the birth of the Gods, andhow after they were born 
                    they behaved to one another. Whether thesestories have in 
                    other ways a good or a bad influence, I should notlike to 
                    be severe upon them, because they are ancient; but, looking 
                    atthem with reference to the duties of children to their parents, 
                    Icannot praise them, or think that they are useful, or at 
                    all true.Of the words of the ancients I have nothing more 
                    to say; and Ishould wish to say of them only what is pleasing 
                    to the Gods. But asto our younger generation and their wisdom, 
                    I cannot let them off whenthey do mischief. For do but mark 
                    the effect of their words: whenyou and I argue for the existence 
                    of the Gods, and produce the sun,moon, stars, and earth, claiming 
                    for them a divine being, if wewould listen to the aforesaid 
                    philosophers we should say that they areearth and stones only, 
                    which can have no care at all of human affairs,and that all 
                    religion is a cooking up of words and a make-believe.</p>
                  <p>Cle. One such teacher, O Stranger, would be bad enough, and 
                    youimply that there are many of them, which is worse.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Well, then; what shall we say or do?-Shall we assume 
                    thatsome one is accusing us among unholy men, who are trying 
                    to escapefrom the effect of our legislation; and that they 
                    say of us-Howdreadful that you should legislate on the supposition 
                    that there areGods! Shall we make a defence of ourselves? 
                    or shall we leave them andreturn to our laws, lest the prelude 
                    should become longer than thelaw? For the discourse will certainly 
                    extend to great length, if weare to treat the impiously disposed 
                    as they desire, partlydemonstrating to them at some length 
                    the things of which they demandan explanation, partly making 
                    them afraid or dissatisfied, and thenproceed to the requisite 
                    enactments.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes, Stranger; but then how often have we repeated already 
                    thaton the present occasion there is no reason why brevity 
                    should bepreferred to length; who is &quot;at our heels&quot;?-as 
                    the saying goes, and itwould be paltry and ridiculous to prefer 
                    the shorter to the better. Itis a matter of no small consequence, 
                    in some way or other to provethat there are Gods, and that 
                    they are good, and regard justice morethan men do. The demonstration 
                    of this would be the best and noblestprelude of all our laws. 
                    And therefore, without impatience, andwithout hurry, let us 
                    unreservedly consider the whole matter,summoning up all the 
                    power of persuasion which we possess.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Seeing you thus in earnest, I would fain offer up a 
                    prayer thatI may succeed:-but I must proceed at once. Who 
                    can be calm when heis called upon to prove the existence of 
                    the Gods? Who can avoidhating and abhorring the men who are 
                    and have been the cause of thisargument; I speak of those 
                    who will not believe the tales which theyhave heard as babes 
                    and sucklings from their mothers and nurses,repeated by them 
                    both in jest and earnest, like charms, who havealso heard 
                    them in the sacrificial prayers, and seen sightsaccompanying 
                    them-sights and sounds delightful to children-and theirparents 
                    during the sacrifices showing an intense earnestness on behalfof 
                    their children and of themselves, and with eager interest 
                    talkingto the Gods, and beseeching them, as though they were 
                    firmly convincedof their existence; who likewise see and hear 
                    the prostrations andinvocations which are made by Hellenes 
                    and barbarians at the risingand setting of the sun and moon, 
                    in all the vicissitudes of life,not as if they thought that 
                    there were no Gods, but as if therecould be no doubt of their 
                    existence, and no suspicion of theirnon-existence; when men, 
                    knowing all these things, despise them onno real grounds, 
                    as would be admitted by all who have any particleof intelligence, 
                    and when they force us to say what we are now saying,how can 
                    any one in gentle terms remonstrate with the like of them,when 
                    he has to begin by proving to them the very existence of theGods? 
                    Yet the attempt must be made; for it would be unseemly thatone 
                    half of mankind should go mad in their lust of pleasure, and 
                    theother half in their indignation at such persons. Our address 
                    tothese lost and perverted natures should not be spoken in 
                    passion;let us suppose ourselves to select some one of them, 
                    and gently reasonwith him, smothering our anger:-O my son, 
                    we will say to him, youare young, and the advance of time 
                    will make you reverse may of theopinions which you now hold. 
                    Wait awhile, and do not attempt tojudge at present of the 
                    highest things; and that is the highest ofwhich you now think 
                    nothing-to know the Gods rightly and to liveaccordingly. And 
                    in the first place let me indicate to you one pointwhich is 
                    of great importance, and about which I cannot bedeceived:-You 
                    and your friends are not the first who have held thisopinion 
                    about the Gods. There have always been persons more or lessnumerous 
                    who have had the same disorder. I have known many of them,and 
                    can tell you, that no one who had taken up in youth thisopinion, 
                    that the Gods do not exist, ever continued in the sameuntil 
                    he was old; the two other notions certainly do continue insome 
                    cases, but not in many; the notion, I mean, that the Godsexist, 
                    but take no heed of human things, and the other notion thatthey 
                    do take heed of them, but are easily propitiated withsacrifices 
                    and prayers. As to the opinion about the Gods which maysome 
                    day become clear to you, I advise you go wait and consider 
                    ifit be true or not; ask of others, and above all of the legislator.In 
                    the meantime take care that you do not offend against the 
                    Gods. Forthe duty of the legislator is and always will be 
                    to teach you thetruth of these matters.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Our address, Stranger, thus far, is excellent.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Quite true, Megillus and Cleinias, but I am afraid that 
                    we haveunconsciously lighted on a strange doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What doctrine do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. The wisest of all doctrines, in the opinion of many.</p>
                  <p>Cle. I wish that you would speak plainer.</p>
                  <p>Ath. The doctrine that all things do become, have become, 
                    and willbecome, some by nature, some by art, and some by chance.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Is not that true?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Well, philosophers are probably right; at any rate we 
                    may aswell follow in their track, and examine what is the 
                    meaning of themand their disciples.</p>
                  <p>Cle. By all means.</p>
                  <p>Ath. They say that the greatest and fairest things are the 
                    work ofnature and of chance, the lesser of art, which, receiving 
                    fromnature the greater and primeval creations, moulds and 
                    fashions allthose lesser works which are generally termed 
                    artificial.</p>
                  <p>Cle. How is that?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I will explain my meaning still more clearly. They say 
                    thatfire and water, and earth and air, all exist by nature 
                    and chance, andnone of them by art, and that as to the bodies 
                    which come next inorder-earth, and sun, and moon, and stars-they 
                    have been created bymeans of these absolutely inanimate existences. 
                    The elements areseverally moved by chance and some inherent 
                    force according to certainaffinities among them-of hot with 
                    cold, or of dry with moist, or ofsoft with hard, and according 
                    to all the other accidental admixturesof opposites which have 
                    been formed by necessity. After this fashionand in this manner 
                    the whole heaven has been created, and all thatis in the heaven, 
                    as well as animals and all plants, and all theseasons come 
                    from these elements, not by the action of mind, as theysay, 
                    or of any God, or from art, but as I was saying, by nature 
                    andchance only. Art sprang up afterwards and out of these, 
                    mortal andof mortal birth, and produced in play certain images 
                    and verypartial imitations of the truth, having an affinity 
                    to one another,such as music and painting create and their 
                    companion arts. Andthere are other arts which have a serious 
                    purpose, and theseco-operate with nature, such, for example, 
                    as medicine, and husbandry,and gymnastic. And they say that 
                    politics cooperate with nature, butin a less degree, and have 
                    more of art; also that legislation isentirely a work of art, 
                    and is based on assumptions which are nottrue.</p>
                  <p>Cle. How do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. In the first place, my dear friend, these people would 
                    say thatthe Gods exist not by nature, but by art, and by the 
                    laws of states,which are different in different places, according 
                    to the agreement ofthose who make them; and that the honourable 
                    is one thing by natureand another thing by law, and that the 
                    principles of justice have noexistence at all in nature, but 
                    that mankind are always disputingabout them and altering them; 
                    and that the alterations which aremade by art and by law have 
                    no basis in nature, but are of authorityfor the moment and 
                    at the time at which they are made.-These, myfriends, are 
                    the sayings of wise men, poets and prose writers, whichfind 
                    a way into the minds of youth. They are told by them that 
                    thehighest right is might, and in this way the young fall 
                    into impieties,under the idea that the Gods are not such as 
                    the law bids themimagine; and hence arise factions, these 
                    philosophers inviting them tolead a true life according to 
                    nature, that is, to live in realdominion over others, and 
                    not in legal subjection to them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What a dreadful picture, Stranger, have you given, and 
                    howgreat is the injury which is thus inflicted on young men 
                    to the ruinboth of states and families!</p>
                  <p>Ath. True, Cleinias; but then what should the lawgiver do 
                    whenthis evil is of long standing? should he only rise up 
                    in the state andthreaten all mankind, proclaiming that if 
                    they will not say andthink that the Gods are such as the law 
                    ordains (and this may beextended generally to the honourable, 
                    the just, and to all the highestthings, and to all that relates 
                    to virtue and vice), and if theywill not make their actions 
                    conform to the copy which the law givesthem, then he who refuses 
                    to obey the law shall die, or suffer stripesand bonds, or 
                    privation of citizenship, or in some cases be punishedby loss 
                    of property and exile? Should he not rather, when he is makinglaws 
                    for men, at the same time infuse the spirit of persuasion 
                    intohis words, and mitigate the severity of them as far as 
                    he can?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Why, Stranger, if such persuasion be at all possible, 
                    then alegislator who has anything in him ought never to weary 
                    ofpersuading men; he ought to leave nothing unsaid in support 
                    of theancient opinion that there are Gods, and of all those 
                    other truthswhich you were just now mentioning; he ought to 
                    support the law andalso art, and acknowledge that both alike 
                    exist by nature, and no lessthan nature, if they are the creations 
                    of mind in accordance withright reason, you appear to me to 
                    maintain, and I am disposed to agreewith you in thinking.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Yes, my enthusiastic Cleinias; but are not these things 
                    whenspoken to a multitude hard to be understood, not to mention 
                    thatthey take up a dismal length of time?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Why, Stranger, shall we, whose patience failed not whendrinking 
                    or music were the themes of discourse, weary now ofdiscoursing 
                    about the Gods, and about divine things? And thegreatest help 
                    to rational legislation is that the laws when oncewritten 
                    down are always at rest; they can be put to the test at anyfuture 
                    time, and therefore, if on first hearing they seem difficult,there 
                    is no reason for apprehension about them, because any manhowever 
                    dull can go over them and consider them again and again; norif 
                    they are tedious but useful, is there any reason or religion, 
                    as itseems to me, in any man refusing to maintain the principles 
                    of them tothe utmost of his power.</p>
                  <p>Megillus. Stranger, I like what Cleinias is saying.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Yes, Megillus, and we should do as he proposes; for 
                    ifimpious discourses were not scattered, as I may say, throughout 
                    theworld, there would have been no need for any vindication 
                    of theexistence of the Gods-but seeing that they are spread 
                    far and wide,such arguments are needed; and who should come 
                    to the rescue of thegreatest laws, when they are being undermined 
                    by bad men, but thelegislator himself?</p>
                  <p>Meg. There is no more proper champion of them.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Well, then, tell me, Cleinias-for I must ask you to 
                    be mypartner-does not he who talks in this way conceive fire 
                    and waterand earth and air to be the first elements of all 
                    things? These hecalls nature, and out of these he supposes 
                    the soul to be formedafterwards; and this is not a mere conjecture 
                    of ours about hismeaning, but is what he really means.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then, by Heaven, we have discovered the source of this 
                    vainopinion of all those physical investigators; and I would 
                    have youexamine their arguments with the utmost care, for 
                    their impiety is avery serious matter; they not only make 
                    a bad and mistaken use ofargument, but they lead away the 
                    minds of others: that is my opinionof them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. You are right; but I should like to know how this happens.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I fear that the argument may seem singular.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Do not hesitate, Stranger; I see that you are afraid 
                    of sucha discussion carrying you beyond the limits of legislation. 
                    But ifthere be no other way of showing our agreement in the 
                    belief thatthere are Gods, of whom the law is said now to 
                    approve, let us takethis way, my good sir.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then I suppose that I must repeat the singular argument 
                    ofthose who manufacture the soul according to their own impious 
                    notions;they affirm that which is the first cause of the generation 
                    anddestruction of all things, to be not first, but last, and 
                    that whichis last to be first, and hence they have fallen 
                    into error about thetrue nature of the Gods.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Still I do not understand you.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Nearly all of them, my friends, seem to be ignorant 
                    of thenature and power of the soul, especially in what relates 
                    to herorigin: they do not know that she is among the first 
                    of things, andbefore all bodies, and is the chief author of 
                    their changes andtranspositions. And if this is true, and 
                    if the soul is older than thebody, must not the things which 
                    are of the soul's kindred be ofnecessity prior to those which 
                    appertain to the body?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then thought and attention and mind and art and law 
                    will beprior to that which is hard and soft and heavy and 
                    light; and thegreat and primitive works and actions will be 
                    works of art; theywill be the first, and after them will come 
                    nature and works ofnature, which however is a wrong term for 
                    men to apply to them;these will follow, and will be under 
                    the government of art and mind.</p>
                  <p>Cle. But why is the word &quot;nature&quot; wrong?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Because those who use the term mean to say that nature 
                    is thefirst creative power; but if the soul turn out to be 
                    the primevalelement, and not fire or air, then in the truest 
                    sense and beyondother things the soul may be said to exist 
                    by nature; and this wouldbe true if you proved that the soul 
                    is older than the body, but nototherwise.</p>
                  <p>Cle. You are quite right.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Shall we, then, take this as the next point to which 
                    ourattention should be directed?</p>
                  <p>Cle. By all means.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us be on our guard lest this most deceptive argument 
                    withits youthful looks, beguiling us old men, give us the 
                    slip and makea laughing-stock of us. Who knows but we may 
                    be aiming at the greater,and fail of attaining the lesser? 
                    Suppose that we three have to pass arapid river, and I, being 
                    the youngest of the three and experienced inrivers, take upon 
                    me the duty of making the attempt first by myself;leaving 
                    you in safety on the bank, I am to examine whether the riveris 
                    passable by older men like yourselves, and if such appears 
                    to bethe case then I shall invite you to follow, and my experience 
                    willhelp to convey you across; but if the river is impassable 
                    by you, thenthere will have been no danger to anybody but 
                    myself-would not thatseem to be a very fair proposal? I mean 
                    to say that the argument inprospect is likely to be too much 
                    for you, out of your depth andbeyond your strength, and I 
                    should be afraid that the stream of myquestions might create 
                    in you who are not in the habit of answering,giddiness and 
                    confusion of mind, and hence a feeling of unpleasantnessand 
                    unsuitableness might arise. I think therefore that I had betterfirst 
                    ask the questions and then answer them myself while you listenin 
                    safety; in that way I can carry on the argument until I havecompleted 
                    the proof that the soul is prior to the body.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Excellent, Stranger, and I hope that you will do as 
                    youpropose.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Come, then, and if ever we are to call upon the Gods, 
                    let uscall upon them now in all seriousness to come to the 
                    demonstrationof their own existence. And so holding fast to 
                    the rope we willventure upon the depths of the argument. When 
                    questions of this sortare asked of me, my safest answer would 
                    appear to be asfollows:-Some one says to me, &quot;O Stranger, 
                    are all things at restand nothing in motion, or is the exact 
                    opposite of this true, or aresome things in motion and others 
                    at rest?-To this I shall reply thatsome things are in motion 
                    and others at rest. &quot;And do not things whichmove a place, 
                    and are not the things which are at rest at rest in aplace?&quot; 
                    Certainly. &quot;And some move or rest in one place and some 
                    inmore places than one?&quot; You mean to say, we shall rejoin, 
                    that thosethings which rest at the centre move in one place, 
                    just as thecircumference goes round of globes which are said 
                    to be at rest?&quot;Yes.&quot; And we observe that, in the 
                    revolution, the motion whichcarries round the larger and the 
                    lesser circle at the same time isproportionally distributed 
                    to greater and smaller, and is greaterand smaller in a certain 
                    proportion. Here is a wonder which might bethought an impossibility, 
                    that the same motion should impart swiftnessand slowness in 
                    due proportion to larger and lesser circles. &quot;Verytrue.&quot; 
                    And when you speak of bodies moving in many places, you seem 
                    tome to mean those which move from one place to another, and 
                    sometimeshave one centre of motion and sometimes more than 
                    one because theyturn upon their axis; and whenever they meet 
                    anything, if it bestationary, they are divided by it; but 
                    if they get in the midstbetween bodies which are approaching 
                    and moving towards the samespot from opposite directions, 
                    they unite with them. &quot;I admit thetruth of what you are 
                    saying.&quot; Also when they unite they grow, andwhen they 
                    are divided they waste away-that is, supposing theconstitution 
                    of each to remain, or if that fails, then there is asecond 
                    reason of their dissolution. &quot;And when are all things 
                    createdand how?&quot; Clearly, they are created when the first 
                    principlereceives increase and attains to the second dimension, 
                    and from thisarrives at the one which is neighbour to this, 
                    and after reachingthe third becomes perceptible to sense. 
                    Everything which is thuschanging and moving is in process 
                    of generation; only when at rest hasit real existence, but 
                    when passing into another state it is destroyedutterly. Have 
                    we not mentioned all motions that there are, andcomprehended 
                    them under their kinds and numbered them with theexception, 
                    my friends, of two?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Which are they?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Just the two, with which our present enquiry is concerned.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Speak plainer.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I suppose that our enquiry has reference to the soul?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us assume that there is a motion able to move other 
                    things,but not to move itself;-that is one kind; and there 
                    is another kindwhich can move itself as well as other things, 
                    working incomposition and decomposition, by increase and diminution 
                    andgeneration and destruction-that is also one of the many 
                    kinds ofmotion.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Granted.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And we will assume that which moves other, and is changed 
                    byother, to be the ninth, and that which changes itself and 
                    others,and is co-incident with every action and every passion, 
                    and is thetrue principle of change and motion in all that 
                    is-that we shall beinclined to call the tenth.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And which of these ten motions ought we to prefer as 
                    beingthe mightiest and most efficient?</p>
                  <p>Cle. I must say that the motion which is able to move itself 
                    isten thousand times superior to all the others.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Very good; but may I make one or two corrections in 
                    what I havebeen saying?</p>
                  <p>Cle. What are they?</p>
                  <p>Ath. When I spoke of the tenth sort of motion, that was not 
                    quitecorrect.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What was the error?</p>
                  <p>Ath. According to the true order, the tenth was really the 
                    firstin generation and power; then follows the second, which 
                    wasstrangely enough termed the ninth by us.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I mean this: when one thing changes another, and thatanother, 
                    of such will there be any primary changing element? How can 
                    athing which is moved by another ever be the beginning of 
                    change?Impossible. But when the self-moved changes other, 
                    and that againother, and thus thousands upon tens of thousands 
                    of bodies are setin motion, must not the beginning of all 
                    this motion be the changeof the self-moving principle?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true, and I quite agree.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Or, to put the question in another way, making answer 
                    toourselves:-If, as most of these philosophers have the audacity 
                    toaffirm, all things were at rest in one mass, which of theabove-mentioned 
                    principles of motion would first spring up among them?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Clearly the self-moving; for there could be no change 
                    in themarising out of any external cause; the change must 
                    first take place inthemselves.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then we must say that self-motion being the origin of 
                    allmotions, and the first which arises among things at rest 
                    as well asamong things in motion, is the eldest and mightiest 
                    principle ofchange, and that which is changed by another and 
                    yet moves other issecond.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Quite true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. At this stage of the argument let us put a question.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What question?</p>
                  <p>Ath. If we were to see this power existing in any earthy, 
                    watery, orfiery substance, simple or compound-how should we 
                    describe it?</p>
                  <p>Cle. You mean to ask whether we should call such a self-moving 
                    powerlife?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I do.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly we should.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And when we see soul in anything, must we not do thesame-must 
                    we not admit that this is life?</p>
                  <p>Cle. We must.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And now, I beseech you, reflect;-you would admit that 
                    we have athreefold knowledge of things?</p>
                  <p>Cle. What do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I mean that we know the essence, and that we know thedefinition 
                    of the essence, and the name,-these are the three; andthere 
                    are two questions which may be raised about anything.</p>
                  <p>Cle. How two?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Sometimes a person may give the name and ask the definition; 
                    orhe may give the definition and ask the name. I may illustrate 
                    what Imean in this way.</p>
                  <p>Cle. How?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Number like some other things is capable of being dividedinto 
                    equal parts; when thus divided, number is named &quot;even,&quot; 
                    and thedefinition of the name &quot;even&quot; is &quot;number 
                    divisible into two equalparts&quot;?</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I mean, that when we are asked about the definition 
                    and givethe name, or when we are asked about the name and 
                    give thedefinition-in either case, whether we give name or 
                    definition, wespeak of the same thing, calling &quot;even&quot; 
                    the number which is dividedinto two equal parts.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Quite true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And what is the definition of that which is named &quot;soul&quot;? 
                    Canwe conceive of any other than that which has been already 
                    given-themotion which can move itself?</p>
                  <p>Cle. You mean to say that the essence which is defined as 
                    theself-moved is the same with that which has the name soul?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Yes; and if this is true, do we still maintain that 
                    there isanything wanting in the proof that the soul is the 
                    first origin andmoving power of all that is, or has become, 
                    or will be, and theircontraries, when she has been clearly 
                    shown to be the source of changeand motion in all things?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly not; the soul as being the source of motion, 
                    has beenmost satisfactorily shown to be the oldest of all 
                    things.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And is not that motion which is produced in another, 
                    byreason of another, but never has any self-moving power at 
                    all, beingin truth the change of an inanimate body, to be 
                    reckoned second, or byany lower number which you may prefer?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Exactly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then we are right, and speak the most perfect and absolutetruth, 
                    when we say that the soul is prior to the body, and that thebody 
                    is second and comes afterwards, and is born to obey the soul,which 
                    is the ruler?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Nothing can be more true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Do you remember our old admission, that if the soul 
                    was priorto the body the things of the soul were also prior 
                    to those of thebody?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then characters and manners, and wishes and reasonings, 
                    andtrue opinions, and reflections, and recollections are prior 
                    tolength and breadth and depth and strength of bodies, if 
                    the soul isprior to the body.</p>
                  <p>Cle. To be sure.</p>
                  <p>Ath. In the next place, must we not of necessity admit that 
                    the soulis the cause of good and evil, base and honourable, 
                    just and unjust,and of all other opposites, if we suppose 
                    her to be the cause of allthings?</p>
                  <p>Cle. We must.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And as the soul orders and inhabits all things that 
                    move,however moving, must we not say that she orders also 
                    the heavens?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Of course.</p>
                  <p>Ath. One soul or more? More than one-I will answer for you; 
                    at anyrate, we must not suppose that there are less than two-one 
                    theauthor of good, and the other of evil.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Yes, very true; the soul then directs all things in 
                    heaven, andearth, and sea by her movements, and these are 
                    described by theterms-will, consideration, attention, deliberation, 
                    opinion true andfalse, joy and sorrow, confidence, fear, hatred, 
                    love, and otherprimary motions akin to these; which again 
                    receive the secondarymotions of corporeal substances, and 
                    guide all things to growth anddecay, to composition and decomposition, 
                    and to the qualities whichaccompany them, such as heat and 
                    cold, heaviness and lightness,hardness and softness, blackness 
                    and whiteness, bitterness andsweetness, and all those other 
                    qualities which the soul uses,herself a goddess, when truly 
                    receiving the divine mind shedisciplines all things rightly 
                    to their happiness; but when she is thecompanion of folly, 
                    she does the very contrary of all this. Shall weassume so 
                    much, or do we still entertain doubts?</p>
                  <p>Cle. There is no room at all for doubt.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Shall we say then that it is the soul which controls 
                    heaven andearth, and the whole world?-that it is a principle 
                    of wisdom andvirtue, or a principle which has neither wisdom 
                    nor virtue? Supposethat we make answer as follows:-</p>
                  <p>Cle. How would you answer?</p>
                  <p>Ath. If, my friend, we say that the whole path and movement 
                    ofheaven, and of all that is therein, is by nature akin to 
                    themovement and revolution and calculation of mind, and proceeds 
                    bykindred laws, then, as is plain, we must say that the best 
                    soultakes care of the world and guides it along the good path.</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. But if the world moves wildly and irregularly, then 
                    the evilsoul guides it.</p>
                  <p>Cle. True again.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Of what nature is the movement of mind?-To this question 
                    itis not easy to give an intelligent answer; and therefore 
                    I ought toassist you in framing one.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very good.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then let us not answer as if we would look straight 
                    at the sun,making ourselves darkness at midday-I mean as if 
                    we were under theimpression that we could see with mortal 
                    eyes, or know adequatelythe nature of mind;-it will be safer 
                    to look at the image only.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us select of the ten motions the one which mind 
                    chieflyresembles; this I will bring to your recollection, 
                    and will thenmake the answer on behalf of us all.</p>
                  <p>Cle. That will be excellent.</p>
                  <p>Ath. You will surely remember our saying that all things 
                    were eitherat rest or in motion?</p>
                  <p>Cle. I do.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And that of things in motion some were moving in one 
                    place, andothers in more than one?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Of these two kinds of motion, that which moves in one 
                    placemust move about a centre like globes made in a lathe, 
                    and is mostentirely akin and similar to the circular movement 
                    of mind.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. In saying that both mind and the motion which is in 
                    one placemove in the same and like manner, in and about the 
                    same, and inrelation to the same, and according to one proportion 
                    and order, andare like the motion of a globe, we invented 
                    a fair image, which doesno discredit to our ingenuity.</p>
                  <p>Cle. It does us great credit.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And the motion of the other sort which is not after 
                    the samemanner, nor in the same, nor about the same, nor in 
                    relation to thesame, nor in one place, nor in order, nor according 
                    to any rule orproportion, may be said to be akin to senselessness 
                    and folly?</p>
                  <p>Cle. That is most true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then, after what has been said, there is no difficulty 
                    indistinctly stating, that since soul carries all things round, 
                    eitherthe best soul or the contrary must of necessity carry 
                    round andorder and arrange the revolution of the heaven.</p>
                  <p>Cle. And judging from what has been said, Stranger, there 
                    would beimpiety in asserting that any but the most perfect 
                    soul or soulscarries round the heavens.</p>
                  <p>Ath. You have understood my meaning right well, Cleinias, 
                    and nowlet me ask you another question.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What are you going to ask?</p>
                  <p>Ath. If the soul carries round the sun and moon, and the 
                    otherstars, does she not carry round each individual of them?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then of one of them let us speak, and the same argument 
                    willapply to all.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Which will you take?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Every one sees the body of the sun, but no one sees 
                    his soul,nor the soul of any other body living or dead; and 
                    yet there isgreat reason to believe that this nature, unperceived 
                    by any of oursenses, is circumfused around them all, but is 
                    perceived by mind;and therefore by mind and reflection only 
                    let us apprehend thefollowing point.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What is that?</p>
                  <p>Ath. If the soul carries round the sun, we shall not be far 
                    wrong insupposing one of three alternatives.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What are they?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Either the soul which moves the sun this way and that,resides 
                    within the circular and visible body, like the soul whichcarries 
                    us about every way; or the soul provides herself with anexternal 
                    body of fire or air, as some affirm, and violently propelsbody 
                    by body; or thirdly, she is without such abody, but guides 
                    thesun by some extraordinary and wonderful power.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes, certainly; the soul can only order all things in 
                    one ofthese three ways.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And this soul of the sun, which is therefore better 
                    than thesun, whether taking the sun about in a chariot to 
                    give light to men,or acting from without or in whatever way, 
                    ought by every man to bedeemed a God.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes, by every man who has the least particle of sense.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And of the stars too, and of the moon, and of the years 
                    andmonths and seasons, must we not say in like manner, that 
                    since asoul or souls having every sort of excellence are the 
                    causes of all ofthem, those souls are Gods, whether they are 
                    living beings andreside in bodies, and in this way order the 
                    whole heaven, orwhatever be the place and mode of their existence;-and 
                    will any onewho admits all this venture to deny that all things 
                    full of Gods?</p>
                  <p>Cle. No one, Stranger, would be such a madman.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And now, Megillus and Cleinias, let us offer terms to 
                    him whohas hitherto denied the existence of the Gods, and 
                    leave him.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What terms?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Either he shall teach us that we were wrong in saying 
                    thatthe soul is the original of all things, and arguing accordingly; 
                    or,if he be not able to say anything better, then he must 
                    yield to us andlive for the remainder of his life in the belief 
                    that there areGods.-Let us see, then, whether we have said 
                    enough or not enough tothose who deny that there are Gods.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly-quite enough, Stranger.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then to them we will say no more. And now we are to 
                    address himwho, believing that there are Gods, believes also 
                    that they take noheed of human affairs: To him we say-O thou 
                    best of men, inbelieving that there are Gods you are led by 
                    some affinity to them,which attracts you towards your kindred 
                    and makes you honour andbelieve in them. But the fortunes 
                    of evil and unrighteous men inprivate as well as public life, 
                    which, though not really happy, arewrongly counted happy in 
                    the judgment of men, and are celebratedboth by poets and prose 
                    writers-these draw you aside from your naturalpiety. Perhaps 
                    you have seen impious men growing old and leaving theirchildren's 
                    children in high offices, and their prosperity shakesyour 
                    faith-you have known or heard or been yourself an eyewitness 
                    ofmany monstrous impieties, and have beheld men by such criminalmeans 
                    from small beginnings attaining to sovereignty and thepinnacle 
                    of greatness; and considering all these things you do notlike 
                    to accuse the Gods of them, because they are your relatives;and 
                    so from some want of reasoning power, and also from anunwillingness 
                    to find fault with them, you have come to believe thatthey 
                    exist indeed, but have no thought or care of human things. 
                    Now,that your present evil opinion may not grow to still greaterimpiety, 
                    and that we may if possible use arguments which may conjureaway 
                    the evil before it arrives, we will add another argument tothat 
                    originally addressed to him who utterly denied the existence 
                    ofthe Gods. And do you, Megillus and Cleinias, answer for 
                    the youngman as you did before; and if any impediment comes 
                    in our way, Iwill take the word out of your mouths, and carry 
                    you over the river asI did just now.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very good; do as you say, and we will help you as well 
                    as wecan.</p>
                  <p>Ath. There will probably be no difficulty in proving to him 
                    that theGods care about the small as well as about the great. 
                    For he waspresent and heard what was said, that they are perfectly 
                    good, andthat the care of all things is most entirely natural 
                    to them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. No doubt he heard that.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us consider together in the next place what we mean 
                    by thisvirtue which we ascribe to them. Surely we should say 
                    that to betemperate and to possess mind belongs to virtue, 
                    and the contrary tovice?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Yes; and courage is a part of virtue, and cowardice 
                    of vice?</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And the one is honourable, and the other dishonourable?</p>
                  <p>Cle. To be sure.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And the one, like other meaner things, is a human quality,but 
                    the Gods have no part in anything of the sort?</p>
                  <p>Cle. That again is what everybody will admit.</p>
                  <p>Ath. But do we imagine carelessness and idleness and luxury 
                    to bevirtues? What do you think?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Decidedly not.</p>
                  <p>Ath. They rank under the opposite class?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And their opposites, therefore, would fall under the 
                    oppositeclass?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Ath. But are we to suppose that one who possesses all these 
                    goodqualities will be luxurious and heedless and idle, like 
                    those whom thepoet compares to stingless drones?</p>
                  <p>Cle. And the comparison is a most just one.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Surely God must not be supposed to have a nature which 
                    hehimself hates?-he who dares to say this sort of thing must 
                    not betolerated for a moment.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Of course not. How could he have?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Should we not on any principle be entirely mistaken 
                    in praisingany one who has some special business entrusted 
                    to him, if he have amind which takes care of great matters 
                    and no care of small ones?Reflect; he who acts in this way, 
                    whether he be God or man, must actfrom one of two principles.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What are they?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Either he must think that the neglect of the small matters 
                    isof no consequence to the whole, or if he knows that they 
                    are ofconsequence, and he neglects them, his neglect must 
                    be attributed tocarelessness and indolence. Is there any other 
                    way in which hisneglect can be explained? For surely, when 
                    it is impossible for him totake care of all, he is not negligent 
                    if he fails to attend to thesethings great or small, which 
                    a God or some inferior being might bewanting in strength or 
                    capacity to manage?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly not.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Now, then, let us examine the offenders, who both alike 
                    confessthat there are Gods, but with a difference-the one 
                    saying that theymay be appeased, and the other that they have 
                    no care of smallmatters: there are three of us and two of 
                    them, and we will say tothem-In the first place, you both 
                    acknowledge that the Gods hear andsee and know all things, 
                    and that nothing can escape them which ismatter of sense and 
                    knowledge:-do you admit this?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And do you admit also that they have all power which 
                    mortalsand immortals can have?</p>
                  <p>Cle. They will, of course, admit this also.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And surely we three and they two-five in all-haveacknowledged 
                    that they are good and perfect?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Assuredly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. But, if they are such as we conceive them to be, can 
                    wepossibly suppose that they ever act in the spirit of carelessnessand 
                    indolence? For in us inactivity is the child of cowardice, 
                    andcarelessness of inactivity and indolence.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Most true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then not from inactivity and carelessness is any God 
                    evernegligent; for there is no cowardice in them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. That is very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then the alternative which remains is, that if the Gods 
                    neglectthe lighter and lesser concerns of the universe, they 
                    neglect thembecause they know that they ought not to care 
                    about suchmatters-what other alternative is there but the 
                    opposite of theirknowing?</p>
                  <p>Cle. There is none.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And, O most excellent and best of men, do I understand 
                    you tomean that they are careless because they are ignorant, 
                    and do not knowthat they ought to take care, or that they 
                    know, and yet like themeanest sort of men, knowing the better, 
                    choose the worse because theyare overcome by pleasures and 
                    pains?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Impossible.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Do not all human things partake of the nature of soul? 
                    And isnot man the most religious of all animals?</p>
                  <p>Cle. That is not to be denied.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And we acknowledge that all mortal creatures are the 
                    propertyof the Gods, to whom also the whole of heaven belongs?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And, therefore, whether a person says that these things 
                    areto the Gods great or small-in either case it would not 
                    be naturalfor the Gods who own us, and who are the most careful 
                    and the bestof owners to neglect us.-There is also a further 
                    consideration.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What is it?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Sensation and power are in an inverse ratio to each 
                    other inrespect to their case and difficulty.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I mean that there is greater difficulty in seeing and 
                    hearingthe small than the great, but more facility in moving 
                    andcontrolling and taking care of and unimportant things than 
                    of theiropposites.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Far more.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Suppose the case of a physician who is willing and able 
                    to curesome living thing as a whole-how will the whole fare 
                    at his hands ifhe takes care only of the greater and neglects 
                    the parts which arelesser?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Decidedly not well.</p>
                  <p>Ath. No better would be the result with pilots or generals, 
                    orhouseholders or statesmen, or any other such class, if theyneglected 
                    the small and regarded only the great;-as the builderssay, 
                    the larger stones do not lie well without the lesser.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Of course not.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us not, then, deem God inferior to human workmen, 
                    who, inproportion to their skill, finish and perfect their 
                    works, small aswell as great, by one and the same art; or 
                    that God, the wisest ofbeings, who is both willing and able 
                    to take care, is like a lazygood-for-nothing, or a coward, 
                    who turns his back upon labour andgives no thought to smaller 
                    and easier matters, but to the greateronly.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Never, Stranger, let us admit a supposition about the 
                    Godswhich is both impious and false.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I think that we have now argued enough with him who 
                    delights toaccuse the Gods of neglect.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Ath. He has been forced to acknowledge that he is in error, 
                    but hestill seems to me to need some words of consolation.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What consolation will you offer him?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us say to the youth:-The ruler of the universe hasordered 
                    all things with a view to the excellence and preservation 
                    ofthe whole, and each part, as far as may be, has an action 
                    andpassion appropriate to it. Over these, down to the least 
                    fraction ofthem, ministers have been appointed to preside, 
                    who have wrought outtheir perfection with infinitesimal exactness. 
                    And one of theseportions of the universe is thine own, unhappy 
                    man, which, howeverlittle, contributes to the whole; and you 
                    do not seem to be aware thatthis and every other creation 
                    is for the sake of the whole, and inorder that the life of 
                    the whole may be blessed; and that you arecreated for the 
                    sake of the whole, and not the whole for the sake ofyou. For 
                    every physician and every skilled artist does all thingsfor 
                    the sake of the whole, directing his effort towards the commongood, 
                    executing the part for the sake of the whole, and not thewhole 
                    for the sake of the part. And you are annoyed because you 
                    areignorant how what is best for you happens to you and to 
                    theuniverse, as far as the laws of the common creation admit. 
                    Now, as thesoul combining first with one body and then with 
                    another undergoes allsorts of changes, either of herself, 
                    or through the influence ofanother soul, all that remains 
                    to the player of the game is that heshould shift the pieces; 
                    sending the better nature to the betterplace, and the worse 
                    to the worse, and so assigning to them theirproper portion.</p>
                  <p>Cle. In what way do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. In a way which may be supposed to make the care of all 
                    thingseasy to the Gods. If any one were to form or fashion 
                    all thingswithout any regard to the whole-if, for example, 
                    he formed a livingelement of water out of fire, instead of 
                    forming many things out ofone or one out of many in regular 
                    order attaining to a first or secondor third birth, the transmutation 
                    would have been infinite; but nowthe ruler of the world has 
                    a wonderfully easy task.</p>
                  <p>Cle. How so?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I will explain:-When the king saw that our actions had 
                    life,and that there was much virtue in them and much vice, 
                    and that thesoul and body, although not, like the Gods of 
                    popular opinion,eternal, yet having once come into existence, 
                    were indestructible (forif either of them had been destroyed, 
                    there would have been nogeneration of living beings); and 
                    when he observed that the good ofthe soul was ever by nature 
                    designed to profit men, and the evil toharm them-he, seeing 
                    all this, contrived so to place each of the partsthat their 
                    position might in the easiest and best manner procure thevictory 
                    of good and the defeat of evil in the whole. And hecontrived 
                    a general plan by which a thing of a certain nature founda 
                    certain seat and room. But the formation of qualities he left 
                    to thewills of individuals. For every one of us is made pretty 
                    much whathe is by the bent of his desires and the nature of 
                    his soul.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes, that is probably true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then all things which have a soul change, and possess 
                    inthemselves a principle of change, and in changing move according 
                    tolaw and to the order of destiny: natures which have undergone 
                    a lesserchange move less and on the earth's surface, but those 
                    which havesuffered more change and have become more criminal 
                    sink into theabyss, that is to say, into Hades and other places 
                    in the world below,of which the very names terrify men, and 
                    which they picture tothemselves as in a dream, both while 
                    alive and when released fromthe body. And whenever the soul 
                    receives more of good or evil from herown energy and the strong 
                    influence of others-when she has communionwith divine virtue 
                    and becomes divine, she is carried into another andbetter 
                    place, which is perfect in holiness; but when she has communionwith 
                    evil, then she also changes the Place of her life.</p>
                  <p> This is the justice of the Gods who inhabit Olympus.O youth 
                    or young man, who fancy that you are neglected by the Gods,know 
                    that if you become worse you shall go to the worse souls, 
                    or ifbetter to the better, and in every succession of life 
                    and death youwill do and suffer what like may fitly suffer 
                    at the hands of like.This is the justice of heaven, which 
                    neither you nor any otherunfortunate will ever glory in escaping, 
                    and which the ordainingpowers have specially ordained; take 
                    good heed thereof, for it will besure to take heed of you. 
                    If you say:-I am small and will creep intothe depths of the 
                    earth, or I am high and will fly up to heaven, youare not 
                    so small or so high but that you shall pay the fittingpenalty, 
                    either here or in the world below or in some still moresavage 
                    place whither you shall be conveyed. This is also theexplanation 
                    of the fate of those whom you saw, who had done unholy andevil 
                    deeds, and from small beginnings had grown great, and you 
                    fanciedthat from being miserable they had become happy; and 
                    in their actions,as in a mirror, you seemed to see the universal 
                    neglect of the Gods,not knowing how they make all things work 
                    together and contribute tothe great whole. And thinkest thou, 
                    bold man, that thou needest not toknow this?-he who knows 
                    it not can never form any true idea of thehappiness or unhappiness 
                    of life or hold any rational discourserespecting either. If 
                    Cleinias and this our reverend company succeedin bringing 
                    to you that you know not what you say of the Gods, thenwill 
                    God help you; but should you desire to hear more, listen towhat 
                    we say to the third opponent, if you have any understandingwhatsoever. 
                    For I think that we have sufficiently proved the existenceof 
                    the Gods, and that they care for men:-The other notion that 
                    theyare appeased by the wicked, and take gifts, is what we 
                    must notconcede to any one, and what every man should disprove 
                    to the utmostof his power.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very good; let us do as you say.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Well, then, by the Gods themselves I conjure you to 
                    tellme-if they are to be propitiated, how are they to be propitiated?Who 
                    are they, and what is their nature? Must they not be at leastrulers 
                    who have to order unceasingly the whole heaven?</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And to what earthly rulers can they be compared, or 
                    who tothem? How in the less can we find an image of the greater? 
                    Are theycharioteers of contending pairs of steeds, or pilots 
                    of vessels?Perhaps they might be compared to the generals 
                    of armies, or theymight be likened to physicians providing 
                    against the diseases whichmake war upon the body, or to husbandmen 
                    observing anxiously theeffects of the seasons on the growth 
                    of plants; or I perhaps, toshepherds of flocks. For as we 
                    acknowledge the world to be full ofmany goods and also of 
                    evils, and of more evils than goods, thereis, as we affirm, 
                    an immortal conflict going on among us, whichrequires marvellous 
                    watchfulness; and in that conflict the Gods anddemigods are 
                    our allies, and we are their property. Injustice andinsolence 
                    and folly are the destruction of us, and justice andtemperance 
                    and wisdom are our salvation; and the place of these latteris 
                    in the life of the Gods, although some vestige of them mayoccasionally 
                    be discerned among mankind. But upon this earth we knowthat 
                    there dwell souls possessing an unjust spirit, who may becompared 
                    to brute animals, which fawn upon their keepers, whether dogsor 
                    shepherds, or the best and most perfect masters; for they 
                    in likemanner, as the voices of the wicked declare, prevail 
                    by flattery andprayers and incantations, and are allowed to 
                    make their gains withimpunity. And this sin, which is termed 
                    dishonesty, is an evil ofthe same kind as what is termed disease 
                    in living bodies or pestilencein years or seasons of the year, 
                    and in cities and governments hasanother name, which is injustice.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Quite true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. What else can he say who declares that the Gods are 
                    alwayslenient to the doers of unjust acts, if they divide 
                    the spoil withthem? As if wolves were to toss a portion of 
                    their prey to the dogs,and they, mollified by the gift, suffered 
                    them to tear the flocks.Must not he who maintains that the 
                    Gods can be propitiated argue thus?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Precisely so.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And to which of the above-mentioned classes of guardianswould 
                    any man compare the Gods without absurdity? Will he say thatthey 
                    are like pilots, who are themselves turned away from their 
                    dutyby &quot;libations of wine and the savour of fat,&quot; 
                    and at last overturnboth ship and sailors?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Assuredly not.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And surely they are not like charioteers who are bribed 
                    to giveup the victory to other chariots?</p>
                  <p>Cle. That would be a fearful image of the Gods.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Nor are they like generals, or physicians, or husbandmen, 
                    orshepherds; and no one would compare them to dogs who have 
                    silencedby wolves.</p>
                  <p>Cle. A thing not to be spoken of.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And are not all the Gods the chiefest of all guardians, 
                    anddo they not guard our highest interests?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes; the chiefest.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And shall we say that those who guard our noblest interests,and 
                    are the best of guardians, are inferior in virtue to dogs, 
                    andto men even of moderate excellence, who would never betray 
                    justice forthe sake of gifts which unjust men impiously offer 
                    them?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly not: nor is such a notion to be endured, and 
                    he whoholds this opinion may be fairly singled out and characterized 
                    as ofall impious men the wickedest and most impious.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then are the three assertions-that the Gods exist, and 
                    thatthey take care of men, and that they can never be persuaded 
                    to doinjustice, now sufficiently demonstrated? May we say 
                    that they are?</p>
                  <p>Cle. You have our entire assent to your words.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I have spoken with vehemence because I am zealous againstevil 
                    men; and I will tell dear Cleinias, why I am so. I would not 
                    havethe wicked think that, having the superiority in argument, 
                    they may doas they please and act according to their various 
                    imaginations aboutthe Gods; and this zeal has led me to speak 
                    too vehemently; but ifwe have at all succeeded in persuading 
                    the men to hate themselvesand love their opposites, the prelude 
                    of our laws about impiety willnot have been spoken in vain.</p>
                  <p>Cle. So let us hope; and even if we have failed, the style 
                    of ourargument will not discredit the lawgiver.</p>
                  <p>Ath. After the prelude shall follow a discourse, which will 
                    be theinterpreter of the law; this shall proclaim to all impiouspersons:-that 
                    they must depart from their ways and go over to thepious. 
                    And to those who disobey, let the law about impiety be asfollows:-If 
                    a man is guilty of any impiety in word or deed, any onewho 
                    happens to present shall give information to the magistrates, 
                    inaid of the law; and let the magistrates who. first receive 
                    theinformation bring him before the appointed court according 
                    to the law;and if a magistrate, after receiving information, 
                    refuses to act, heshall be tried for impiety at the instance 
                    of any one who is willingto vindicate the laws; and if any 
                    one be cast, the court shallestimate the punishment of each 
                    act of impiety; and let all suchcriminals be imprisoned. There 
                    shall be three prisons in the state:the first of them is to 
                    be the common prison in the neighbourhood ofthe agora for 
                    the safe-keeping of the generality of offenders; anotheris 
                    to be in the neighbourhood of the nocturnal council, and is 
                    to becalled the &quot;House of Reformation&quot;; another, 
                    to be situated in somewild and desolate region in the centre 
                    of the country, shall be calledby some name expressive of 
                    retribution. Now, men fall into impietyfrom three causes, 
                    which have been already mentioned, and from each ofthese causes 
                    arise two sorts of impiety, in all six, which are worthdistinguishing, 
                    and should not all have the same punishment. For hewho does 
                    not believe in Gods, and yet has a righteous nature, hatesthe 
                    wicked and dislikes and refuses to do injustice, and avoidsunrighteous 
                    men, and loves the righteous. But they who besidesbelieving 
                    that the world is devoid of Gods are intemperate, and haveat 
                    the same time good memories and quick wits, are worse; althoughboth 
                    of them are unbelievers, much less injury is done by the one 
                    thanby the other. The one may talk loosely about the Gods 
                    and aboutsacrifices and oaths, and perhaps by laughing at 
                    other men he may makethem like himself, if he be not punished. 
                    But the other who holdsthe same opinions and is called a clever 
                    man, is full of stratagem anddeceit-men of this class deal 
                    in prophecy and jugglery of all kinds,and out of their ranks 
                    sometimes come tyrants and demagogues andgenerals and hierophants 
                    of private mysteries and the Sophists, asthey are termed, 
                    with their ingenious devices. There are many kinds ofunbelievers, 
                    but two only for whom legislation is required; one thehypocritical 
                    sort, whose crime is deserving of death many timesover, while 
                    the other needs only bonds and admonition. In likemanner also 
                    the notion that the Gods take no thought of men producestwo 
                    other sorts of crimes, and the notion that they may be propitiatedproduces 
                    two more. Assuming these divisions, let those who have beenmade 
                    what they are only from want of understanding, and not frommalice 
                    or an evil nature, be placed by the judge in the House ofReformation, 
                    and ordered to suffer imprisonment during a period of notless 
                    than five years. And in the meantime let them have no intercoursewith 
                    the other citizens, except with members of the nocturnal council,and 
                    with them let them converse with a view to the improvement 
                    oftheir soul's health. And when the time of their imprisonment 
                    hasexpired, if any of them be of sound mind let him be restored 
                    to sanecompany, but if not, and if he be condemned a second 
                    time, let himbe punished with death. As to that class of monstrous 
                    natures whonot only believe that there are no Gods, or that 
                    they are negligent,or to be propitiated, but in contempt of 
                    mankind conjure the soulsof the living and say that they can 
                    conjure the dead and promise tocharm the Gods with sacrifices 
                    and prayers, and will utterly overthrowindividuals and whole 
                    houses and states for the sake of money-lethim who is guilty 
                    of any of these things be condemned by the courtto be bound 
                    according to law in the prison which is in the centre ofthe 
                    land, and let no freeman ever approach him, but let him receivethe 
                    rations of food appointed by the guardians of the law from 
                    thehands of the public slaves; and when he is dead let him 
                    be cast beyondthe borders unburied, and if any freeman assist 
                    in burying him, lethim pay the penalty of impiety to any one 
                    who is willing to bring asuit against him. But if he leaves 
                    behind him children who are fitto be citizens, let the guardians 
                    of orphans take care of them, justas they would of any other 
                    orphans, from the day on which their fatheris convicted.</p>
                  <p>In all these cases there should be one law, which will make 
                    men ingeneral less liable to transgress in word or deed, and 
                    less foolish,because they will not be allowed to practise 
                    religious ritescontrary to law. And let this be the simple 
                    form of the law:-No manshall have sacred rites in a private 
                    house. When he would sacrifice,let him go to the temples and 
                    hand over his offerings to the priestsand priestesses, who 
                    see to the sanctity of such things, and let himpray himself, 
                    and let any one who pleases join with him in prayer. Thereason 
                    of this is as follows:-Gods and temples are not easilyinstituted, 
                    and to establish them rightly is the work of a mightyintellect. 
                    And women especially, and men too, when they are sick or indanger, 
                    or in any sort of difficulty, or again on their receivingany 
                    good fortune, have a way of consecrating the occasion, vowingsacrifices, 
                    and promising shrines to Gods, demigods, and sons of Gods;and 
                    when they are awakened by terrible apparitions and dreams 
                    orremember visions, they find in altars and temples the remedies 
                    ofthem, and will fill every house and village with them, placing 
                    them inthe open air, or wherever they may have had such visions; 
                    and with aview to all these cases we should obey the law. 
                    The law has alsoregard to the impious, and would not have 
                    them fancy that by thesecret performance of these actions-by 
                    raising temples and by buildingaltars in private houses, they 
                    can propitiate the God secretly withsacrifices and prayers, 
                    while they are really multiplying their crimesinfinitely, 
                    bringing guilt from heaven upon themselves, and alsoupon those 
                    who permit them, and who are better men than they are;and 
                    the consequence is that the whole state reaps the fruit of 
                    theirimpiety, which, in a certain sense, is deserved. Assuredly 
                    God willnot blame the legislator, who will enact the following 
                    law:-No oneshall possess shrines of the Gods in private houses, 
                    and he who isfound to possess them, and perform any sacred 
                    rites not publiclyauthorized-supposing the offender to be 
                    some man or woman who is notguilty of any other great and 
                    impious crime-shall be informedagainst by him who is acquainted 
                    with the fact, which shall beannounced by him to the guardians 
                    of the law; and let them issueorders that he or she shall 
                    carry away their private rites to thepublic temples, and if 
                    they do not persuade them, let them inflict apenalty on them 
                    until they comply. And if a person be proven guilty ofimpiety, 
                    not merely from childish levity, but such as grown-up men 
                    maybe guilty of, whether he have sacrificed publicly or privately 
                    toany Gods, let him be punished with death, for his sacrifice 
                    is impure.Whether the deed has been done in earnest, or only 
                    from childishlevity, let the guardians of the law determine, 
                    before they bringthe matter into court and prosecute the offender 
                    for impiety.</p>

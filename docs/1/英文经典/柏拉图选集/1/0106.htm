                    Athenian Stranger. And now having made an end of the preliminarieswe 
                    will proceed to the appointment of magistracies.</p>
                  <p>Cleinias. Very good.</p>
                  <p>Ath. In the ordering of a state there are two parts: first, 
                    thenumber of the magistracies, and the mode of establishing 
                    them; and,secondly, when they have been established, laws 
                    again will have tobe provided for each of them, suitable in 
                    nature and number. Butbefore electing the magistrates let 
                    us stop a little and say a word inseason about the election 
                    of them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What have you got to say?</p>
                  <p>Ath. This is what I have to say; every one can see, that 
                    althoughthe work of legislation is a most important matter, 
                    yet if awell-ordered city superadd to good laws unsuitable 
                    offices, not onlywill there be no use in having the good laws-not 
                    only will they beridiculous and useless, but the greatest 
                    political injury and evilwill accrue from them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Of course.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then now, my friend, let us observe what will happen 
                    in theconstitution of out intended state. In the first place, 
                    you willacknowledge that those who are duly appointed to magisterial 
                    power,and their families, should severally have given satisfactory 
                    proofof what they are, from youth upward until the time of 
                    election; in thenext place, those who are to elect should 
                    have been trained inhabits of law, and be well educated, that 
                    they may have a rightjudgment, and may be able to select or 
                    reject men whom they approve ordisapprove, as they are worthy 
                    of either. But how can we imaginethat those who are brought 
                    together for the first time, and arestrangers to one another, 
                    and also uneducated, will avoid makingmistakes in the choice 
                    of magistrates?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Impossible.</p>
                  <p>Ath. The matter is serious, and excuses will not serve the 
                    turn. Iwill tell you, then, what you and I will have to do, 
                    since you, as youtell me, with nine others, have offered to 
                    settle the new state onbehalf of the people of Crete, and 
                    I am to help you by the inventionof the present romance. I 
                    certainly should not like to leave thetale wandering all over 
                    the world without a head;-a headless monsteris such a hideous 
                    thing.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Excellent, Stranger.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Yes; and I will be as good as my word.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Let us by all means do as you propose.</p>
                  <p>Ath. That we will, by the grace of God, if old age will onlypermit 
                    us.</p>
                  <p>Cle. But God will be gracious.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Yes; and under his guidance let us consider further 
                    point.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What is it?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us remember what a courageously mad and daring creationthis 
                    our city is.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What had you in your mind when you said that?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I had in my mind the free and easy manner in which we 
                    areordaining that the inexperienced colonists shall receive 
                    our laws. Nowa man need not be very wise, Cleinias, in order 
                    to see that no one caneasily receive laws at their first imposition. 
                    But if we couldanyhow wait until those who have been imbued 
                    with them from childhood,and have been nurtured in them, and 
                    become habituated to them, taketheir part in the public elections 
                    of the state; I say, if thiscould be accomplished, and rightly 
                    accomplished by any way orcontrivance-then, I think that there 
                    would be very little danger, atthe end of the time, of a state 
                    thus trained not being permanent.</p>
                  <p>Cle. A reasonable supposition.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then let us consider if we can find any way out of thedifficulty; 
                    for I maintain, Cleinias, that the Cnosians, above all theother 
                    Cretans, should not be satisfied with barely discharging theirduty 
                    to the colony, but they ought to take the utmost pains toestablish 
                    the offices which are first created by them in the bestand 
                    surest manner. Above all, this applies to the selection of 
                    theguardians of the law, who must be chosen first of all, 
                    and with thegreatest care; the others are of less importance.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What method can we devise of electing them?</p>
                  <p>Ath. This will be the method:-Sons of the Cretans, I shall 
                    say tothem, inasmuch as the Cnosians have precedence over 
                    the otherstates, they should, in common with those who join 
                    this settlement,choose a body of thirty-seven in all, nineteen 
                    of them being takenfrom the settlers, and the remainder from 
                    the citizens of Cnosus. Ofthose latter the Cnosians shall 
                    make a present to your colony, and youyourself shall be one 
                    of the eighteen, and shall become a citizen ofthe new state; 
                    and if you and they cannot be persuaded to go, theCnosians 
                    may fairly use a little violence in order to make you.</p>
                  <p>Cle. But why, Stranger, do not you and Megillus take a part 
                    in ournew city?</p>
                  <p>Ath. O, Cleinias, Athens is proud, and Sparta too; and they 
                    are botha long way off. But you and likewise the other colonists 
                    areconveniently situated as you describe. I have been speaking 
                    of the wayin which the new citizens may be best managed under 
                    presentcircumstances; but in after-ages, if the city continues 
                    to exist,let the election be on this wise. All who are horse 
                    or footsoldiers, or have seen military service at the proper 
                    ages when theywere severally fitted for it, shall share in 
                    the election ofmagistrates; and the election shall be held 
                    in whatever temple thestate deems most venerable, and every 
                    one shall carry his vote tothe altar of the God, writing down 
                    on a tablet the name of theperson for whom he votes, and his 
                    father's name, and his tribe, andward; and at the side he 
                    shall write his own name in like manner.Any one who pleases 
                    may take away any tablet which he does not thinkproperly filled 
                    up, and exhibit it in the Agara for a period of notless than 
                    thirty days. The tablets which are judged to be first, tothe 
                    number of 300, shall be shown by the magistrates to the wholecity, 
                    and the citizens shall in like manner select from these thecandidates 
                    whom they prefer; and this second selection, to thenumber 
                    of 100, shall be again exhibited to the citizens; in the third,let 
                    any one who pleases select whom pleases out of the 100, walkingthrough 
                    the parts of victims, and let them choose for magistratesand 
                    proclaim the seven and thirty who have the greatest number 
                    ofvotes. But who, Cleinias and Megillus, will order for us 
                    in the colonyall this matter of the magistrates, and the scrutinies 
                    of them? Ifwe reflect, we shall see that cities which are 
                    in process ofconstruction like ours must have some such persons, 
                    who cannotpossibly be elected before there are any magistrates; 
                    and yet theymust be elected in some way, and they are not 
                    to be inferior men,but the best possible. For as the proverb 
                    says, &quot;a good beginning ishalf the business&quot;; and 
                    &quot;to have begun well&quot; is praised by all, and inmy 
                    opinion is a great deal more than half the business, and hasnever 
                    been praised by any one enough.</p>
                  <p>Cle. That is very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then let us recognize the difficulty, and make clear 
                    to our ownminds how the beginning is to be accomplished. There 
                    is only oneproposal which I have to offer, and that is one 
                    which, under ourcircumstances, is both necessary and expedient.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What is it?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I maintain that this colony of ours has a father and 
                    mother,who are no other than the colonizing state. Well I 
                    know that manycolonies have been, and will be, at enmity with 
                    their parents. Butin early days the child, as in a family, 
                    loves and is beloved; even ifthere come a time later when 
                    the tie is broken, still, while he isin want of education, 
                    he naturally loves his parents and is beloved bythem, and 
                    flies to his relatives for protection, and finds in them hisonly 
                    natural allies in time of need; and this parental feeling 
                    alreadyexists in the Cnosians, as is shown by their care of 
                    the new city; andthere is a similar feeling on the part of 
                    the young city towardsCnosus. And I repeat what I was saying-for 
                    there is no harm inrepeating a good thing-that the Cnosians 
                    should take a common interestin all these matters, and choose, 
                    as far as they can, the eldest andbest of the colonists, to 
                    the number of not less than a hundred; andlet there be another 
                    hundred of the Cnosians themselves. These, I say,on their 
                    arrival, should have a joint care that the magistrates shouldbe 
                    appointed according to law, and that when they are appointed 
                    theyshould undergo a scrutiny. When this has been effected, 
                    the Cnosiansshall return home, and the new city do the best 
                    she can for her ownpreservation and happiness. I would have 
                    the seven-and-thirty now, andin all future time, chosen to 
                    fulfil the following duties:-Let them,in the first place, 
                    be the guardians of the law; and, secondly, of theregisters 
                    in which each one registers before the magistrate the amountof 
                    his property, excepting four minae which are allowed to citizens 
                    ofthe first class, three allowed to the second, two to the 
                    third, anda single mina to the fourth. And if any one, despising 
                    the laws forthe sake of gain, be found to possess anything 
                    more which has not beenregistered, let all that he has in 
                    excess be confiscated, and lethim be liable to a suit which 
                    shall be the reverse of honourable orfortunate. And let any 
                    one who will, indict him on the charge ofloving base gains, 
                    and proceed against him before the guardians of thelaw. And 
                    if he be cast, let him lose his share of the publicpossessions, 
                    and when there is any public distribution, let him havenothing 
                    but his original lot; and let him be written down acondemned 
                    man as long as he lives, in some place in which any onewho 
                    pleases can read about his onces. The guardian of the law 
                    shallnot hold office longer than twenty years, and shall not 
                    be less thanfifty years of age when he is elected; or if he 
                    is elected when heis sixty years of age, he shall hold office 
                    for ten years only; andupon the same principle, he must not 
                    imagine that he will be permittedto hold such an important 
                    office as that of guardian of the laws afterhe is seventy 
                    years of age, if he live so long.</p>
                  <p>These are the three first ordinances about the guardians 
                    of the law;as the work of legislation progresses, each law 
                    in turn will assign tothem their further duties. And now we 
                    may proceed in order to speak ofthe election of other officers; 
                    for generals have to be elected, andthese again must have 
                    their ministers, commanders, and colonels ofhorse, and commanders 
                    of brigades of foot, who would be more rightlycalled by their 
                    popular name of brigadiers. The guardians of the lawshall 
                    propose as generals men who are natives of the city, and aselection 
                    from the candidates proposed shall be made by those whoare 
                    or have been of the age for military service. And if one who 
                    isnot proposed is thought by somebody to be better than one 
                    who is,let him name whom he prefers in the place of whom, 
                    and make oaththat he is better, and propose him; and whichever 
                    of them isapproved by vote shall be admitted to the final 
                    selection; and thethree who have the greatest number of votes 
                    shall be appointedgenerals, and superintendents of military 
                    affairs, after previouslyundergoing a scrutiny, like the guardians 
                    of the law. And let thegenerals thus elected propose twelve 
                    brigadiers, one for each tribe;and there shall be a right 
                    of counterproposal as in the case of thegenerals, and the 
                    voting and decision shall take place in the sameway. Until 
                    the prytanes and council are elected, the guardians ofthe 
                    law shall convene the assembly in some holy spot which is 
                    suitableto the purpose, placing the hoplites by themselves, 
                    and the cavalry bythemselves, and in a third division all 
                    the rest of the army. Allare to vote for the generals [and 
                    for the colonels of horse], butthe brigadiers are to be voted 
                    for only by those who carry shields[i.e. the hoplites]. Let 
                    the body of cavalry choose phylarchs forthe generals; but 
                    captains of light troops, or archers, or any otherdivision 
                    of the army, shall be appointed by the generals forthemselves. 
                    There only remains the appointment of officers of cavalry:these 
                    shall be proposed by the same persons who proposed the generals,and 
                    the election and the counter-proposal of other candidates 
                    shall bearranged in the same way as in the case of the generals, 
                    and let thecavalry vote and the infantry look on at the election; 
                    the two whohave the greatest number of votes shall be the 
                    leaders of all thehorse. Disputes about the voting may be 
                    raised once or twice; but ifthe dispute be raised a third 
                    time, the officers who preside at theseveral elections shall 
                    decide.</p>
                  <p>The council shall consist of 30 x 12 members-360 will be 
                    aconvenient number for sub-division. If we divide the whole 
                    number intofour parts of ninety each, we get ninety counsellors 
                    for each class.First, all the citizens shall select candidates 
                    from the firstclass; they shall be compelled to vote, and, 
                    if they do not, shallbe duly fined. When the candidates have 
                    been selected, some oneshall mark them down; this shall be 
                    the business of the first day. Andon the following day, candidates 
                    shall be selected from the secondclass in the same manner 
                    and under the same conditions as on theprevious day; and on 
                    the third day a selection shall be made fromthe third class, 
                    at which every one may, if he likes, vote, and thethree first 
                    classes shall be compelled to vote; but the fourth andlowest 
                    class shall be under no compulsion, and any member of thisclass 
                    who does not vote shall not be punished. On the fourth daycandidates 
                    shall be selected from the fourth and smallest class;they 
                    shall be selected by all, but he who is of the fourth class 
                    shallsuffer no penalty, nor he who is of the third, if he 
                    be not willing tovote; but he who is of the first or second 
                    class, if he does notvote shall be punished;-he who is of 
                    the second class shall pay a fineof triple the amount which 
                    was exacted at first, and he who is ofthe first class quadruple. 
                    On the fifth day the rulers shall bring outthe names noted 
                    down, for all the citizens to see, and every man shallchoose 
                    out of them, under pain, if he do not, of suffering the firstpenalty; 
                    and when they have chosen out of each of the classes, theyshall 
                    choose one-half of them by lot, who shall undergo ascrutiny:-These 
                    are to form the council for the year.</p>
                  <p>The mode of election which has been described is in a mean 
                    betweenmonarchy and democracy, and such a mean the state ought 
                    always toobserve; for servants and masters never can be friends, 
                    nor good andbad, merely because they are declared to have 
                    equal privileges. For tounequals equals become unequal, if 
                    they are not harmonized by measure;and both by reason of equality, 
                    and by reason of inequality, citiesare filled with seditions. 
                    The old saying, that &quot;equality makesfriendship,&quot; 
                    is happy and also true; but there is obscurity andconfusion 
                    as to what sort of equality is meant. For there are twoequalities 
                    which are called by the same name, but are in reality inmany 
                    ways almost the opposite of one another; one of them may beintroduced 
                    without difficulty, by any state or any legislator in thedistribution 
                    of honours: this is the rule of measure, weight, andnumber, 
                    which regulates and apportions them. But there is anotherequality, 
                    of a better and higher kind, which is not so easilyrecognized. 
                    This is the judgment of Zeus; among men it avails butlittle; 
                    that little, however, is the source of the greatest good toindividuals 
                    and states. For it gives to the greater more, and to theinferior 
                    less and in proportion to the nature of each; and, above all,greater 
                    honour always to the greater virtue, and to the less less; 
                    andto either in proportion to their respective measure of 
                    virtue andeducation. And this is justice, and is ever the 
                    true principle ofstates, at which we ought to aim, and according 
                    to this rule order thenew city which is now being founded, 
                    and any other city which may behereafter founded. To this 
                    the legislator should look-not to theinterests of tyrants 
                    one or more, or to the power of the people, butto justice 
                    always; which, as I was saying, the distribution of naturalequality 
                    among unequals in each case. But there are times at whichevery 
                    state is compelled to use the words, &quot;just,&quot; &quot;equal,&quot; 
                    in asecondary sense, in the hope of escaping in some degree 
                    from factions.For equity and indulgence are infractions of 
                    the perfect and strictrule of justice. And this is the reason 
                    why we are obliged to usethe equality of the lot, in order 
                    to avoid the discontent of thepeople; and so we invoke God 
                    and fortune in our prayers, and begthat they themselves will 
                    direct the lot with a view to supremejustice. And therefore, 
                    although we are compelled to use bothequalities, we should 
                    use that into which the element of chance entersas seldom 
                    as possible.</p>
                  <p>Thus, O my friends, and for the reasons given, should a state 
                    actwhich would endure and be saved. But as a ship sailing 
                    on the seahas to be watched night and day, in like manner 
                    a city also is sailingon a sea of politics, and is liable 
                    to all sorts of insidiousassaults; and therefore from morning 
                    to night, and from night tomorning, rulers must join hands 
                    with rulers, and watchers withwatchers, receiving and giving 
                    up their trust in a perpetualsuccession. Now a multitude can 
                    never fulfil a duty of this sortwith anything like energy. 
                    Moreover, the greater number of thesenators will have to be 
                    left during the greater part of the year toorder their concerns 
                    at their own homes. They will therefore have tobe arranged 
                    in twelve portions, answering to the twelve months, andfurnish 
                    guardians of the state, each portion for a single month. Theirbusiness 
                    is to be at hand and receive any foreigner or citizen whocomes 
                    to them, whether to give information, or to put one of thosequestions, 
                    to which, when asked by other cities, a city should give ananswer, 
                    and to which, if she ask them herself, she should receive 
                    ananswer; or again, when there is a likelihood of internal 
                    commotions,which are always liable to happen in some form 
                    or other, they will, ifthey can, prevent their occurring; 
                    or if they have already occurred,will lose time in making 
                    them known to the city, and healing the evil.Wherefore, also, 
                    this which is the presiding body of the state oughtalways 
                    to have the control of their assemblies, and of thedissolutions 
                    of them, ordinary as well as extraordinary. All this isto 
                    be ordered by the twelfth part of the council, which is always 
                    tokeep watch together with the other officers of the state 
                    during oneportion of the year, and to rest during the remaining 
                    eleven portions.</p>
                  <p>Thus will the city be fairly ordered. And now, who is to 
                    have, thesuperintendence of the country, and what shall be 
                    the arrangement?Seeing that the whole city and the entire 
                    country have been both ofthem divided into twelve portions, 
                    ought there not to be appointedsuperintendents of the streets 
                    of the city, and of the houses, andbuildings, and harbours, 
                    and the agora, and fountains, and sacreddomains, and temples, 
                    and the like?</p>
                  <p>Cle. To be sure there ought.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us assume, then, that there ought to be servants 
                    of thetemples, and priests and priestesses. There must also 
                    besuperintendents of roads and buddings, who will have a care 
                    of men,that they may do no harm, and also of beasts, both 
                    within theenclosure and in the suburbs. Three kinds of officers 
                    will thus haveto be appointed, in order that the city may 
                    be suitably providedaccording to her needs. Those who have 
                    the care of the city shall becalled wardens of the city; and 
                    those who have the care of the agorashall be called wardens 
                    of the agora; and those who have the care ofthe temples shall 
                    be called priests. Those who hold hereditary officesas priests 
                    or priestesses, shall not be disturbed; but if there be fewor 
                    none such, as is probable at the foundation of a new city,priests 
                    and priestesses shall be appointed to be servants of theGods 
                    who have no servants. Some of our officers shall be elected,and 
                    others appointed by lot, those who are of the people and those 
                    whoare not of the people mingling in a friendly manner in 
                    every place andcity, that the state may be as far as possible 
                    of one mind. Theofficers of the temples shall be appointed 
                    by lot; in this way theirelection will be committed to God, 
                    that he may do what is agreeable tohim. And he who obtains 
                    a lot shall undergo a scrutiny, first, as towhether he is 
                    sound of body and of legitimate birth; and in the secondplace, 
                    in order to show that he is of a perfectly pure family, notstained 
                    with homicide or any similar impiety in his own person, andalso 
                    that his father and mother have led a similar unstained life. 
                    Nowthe laws about all divine things should be brought from 
                    Delphi, andinterpreters appointed, under whose direction they 
                    should be used. Thetenure of the priesthood should always 
                    be for a year and no longer;and he who will duly execute the 
                    sacred office, according to thelaws of religion, must be not 
                    less than sixty years of age-the lawsshall be the same about 
                    priestesses. As for the interpreters, theyshall be appointed 
                    thus:-Let the twelve tribes be distributed intogroups of four, 
                    and let each group select four, one out of eachtribe within 
                    the group, three times; and let the three who have thegreatest 
                    number of votes [out of the twelve appointed by eachgroup], 
                    after undergoing a scrutiny, nine in all, be sent to Delphi,in 
                    order that the God may return one out of each triad; their 
                    ageshall be the same as that of the priests, and the scrutiny 
                    of themshall be conducted in the same manner; let them be 
                    interpreters forlife, and when any one dies let the four tribes 
                    select another fromthe tribe of the deceased. Moreover, besides 
                    priests and interpreters,there must be treasurers, who will 
                    take charge of the property ofthe several temples, and of 
                    the sacred domains, and shall haveauthority over the produce 
                    and the letting of them; and three ofthem shall be chosen 
                    from the highest classes for the greater temples,and two for 
                    the lesser, and one for the least of all; the manner oftheir 
                    election and the scrutiny of them shall be the same as that 
                    ofthe generals. This shall be the order of the temples.</p>
                  <p>Let everything have a guard as far as possible. Let the defence 
                    ofthe city be commited to the generals, and taxiarchs, and 
                    hipparchs,and phylarchs, and prytanes, and the wardens of 
                    the city, and of theagora, when the election of them has been 
                    completed. The defence ofthe country shall be provided for 
                    as follows:-The entire land has beenalready distributed into 
                    twelve as nearly as possible equal parts, andlet the tribe 
                    allotted to a division provide annually for it fivewardens 
                    of the country and commanders of the watch; and let eachbody 
                    of five have the power of selecting twelve others out of theyouth 
                    of their own tribe-these shall be not less than twenty-fiveyears 
                    of age, and not more than thirty. And let there be allotted 
                    tothem severally every month the various districts, in order 
                    that theymay all acquire knowledge and experience of the whole 
                    country. Theterm of service for commanders and for watchers 
                    shall continueduring two years. After having had their stations 
                    allotted to them,they will go from place to place in regular 
                    order, making theirround from left to right as their commanders 
                    direct them; (when Ispeak of going to the right, I mean that 
                    they are to go to theeast). And at the commencement of the 
                    second year, in order that asmany as possible of the guards 
                    may not only get a knowledge of thecountry at any one season 
                    of the year, but may also have experience ofthe manner in 
                    which different places are affected at different seasonsof 
                    the year, their then commanders shall lead them again towards 
                    theleft, from place to place in succession, until they have 
                    completed thesecond year. In the third year other wardens 
                    of the country shall bechosen and commanders of the watch, 
                    five for each division, who are tobe the superintendents of 
                    the bands of twelve. While on service ateach station, their 
                    attention shall be directed to the followingpoints:-In the 
                    first place, they shall see that the country is wellprotected 
                    against enemies; they shall trench and dig wherever thisis 
                    required, and, as far as they can, they shall by fortificationskeep 
                    off the evil-disposed, in order to prevent them from doing 
                    anyharm to the country or the property; they shall use the 
                    beasts ofburden and the labourers whom they find on the spot: 
                    these will betheir instruments whom they will superintend, 
                    taking them, as far aspossible, at the times when they are 
                    not engaged in their regularbusiness. They shall make every 
                    part of the country inaccessible toenemies, and as accessible 
                    as possible to friends; there shall be waysfor man and beasts 
                    of burden and for cattle, and they shall takecare to have 
                    them always as smooth as they can; and shall provideagainst 
                    the rains doing harm instead of good to the land, when theycome 
                    down from the mountains into the hollow dells; and shall keepin 
                    the overflow by the help of works and ditches, in order that 
                    thevalleys, receiving and drinking up the rain from heaven, 
                    and providingfountains and streams in the fields and regions 
                    which lieunderneath, may furnish even to the dry places plenty 
                    of good water.The fountains of water, whether of rivers or 
                    of springs, shall beornamented with plantations and buildings 
                    for beauty; and let thembring together the streams in subterraneous 
                    channels, and make allthings plenteous; and if there be a 
                    sacred grove or dedicated precinctin the neighbourhood, they 
                    shall conduct the water to the actualtemples of the Gods, 
                    and so beautify them at all seasons of theyear. Everywhere 
                    in such places the youth shall make gymnasia forthemselves, 
                    and warm baths for the aged, placing by them abundanceof dry 
                    wood, for the benefit of those labouring under disease-therethe 
                    weary frame of the rustic, worn with toil, will receive a 
                    kindlywelcome, far better than he would at the hands of a 
                    not over-wisedoctor.</p>
                  <p>The building of these and the like works will be useful andornamental; 
                    they will provide a pleasing amusement, but they will be aserious 
                    employment too; for the sixty wardens will have to guard theirseveral 
                    divisions, not only with a view to enemies, but also with 
                    aneye to professing friends. When a quarrel arises among neighbours 
                    orcitizens, and any one, whether slave or freeman wrongs another, 
                    letthe five wardens decide small matters on their own authority; 
                    butwhere the charge against another relates to greater matters, 
                    theseventeen composed of the fives and twelves, shall determine 
                    anycharges which one man brings against another, not involving 
                    morethan three minae. Every judge and magistrate shall be 
                    liable to givean account of his conduct in office, except 
                    those who, like kings,have the final decision. Moreover, as 
                    regards the aforesaid wardens ofthe country, if they do any 
                    wrong to those of whom they have the care,whether by imposing 
                    upon them unequal tasks, or by taking theproduce of the soil 
                    or implements of husbandry without theirconsent; also if they 
                    receive anything in the way of a bribe, ordecide suits unjustly, 
                    or if they yield to the influences of flattery,let them be 
                    publicly dishonoured; and in regard to any other wrongwhich 
                    they do to the inhabitants of the country, if the question 
                    be ofa mina, let them submit to the decision of the villagers 
                    in theneighbourhood; but in suits of greater amount, or in 
                    case of lesser,if they refuse to submit, trusting that their 
                    monthly removal intoanother part of the country will enable 
                    them to escape-in such casesthe injured party may bring his 
                    suit in the common court, and if heobtain a verdict he may 
                    exact from the defendant, who refused tosubmit, a double penalty.</p>
                  <p>The wardens and the overseers of the country, while on their 
                    twoyears service, shall have common meals at their several 
                    stations,and shall all live together; and he who is absent 
                    from the commonmeal, or sleeps out, if only for one day or 
                    night, unless by orderof his commanders, or by reason of absolute 
                    necessity, if the fivedenounce him and inscribe his name the 
                    agora as not having kept hisguard, let him be deemed to have 
                    betrayed the city, as far as lay inhis power, and let him 
                    be disgraced and beaten with impunity by anyone who meets 
                    him and is willing to punish him. If any of thecommanders 
                    is guilty of such an irregularity, the whole company ofsixty 
                    shall see to it, and he who is cognizant of the offence, anddoes 
                    not bring the offender to trial, shall be amenable to the 
                    samelaws as the younger offender himself, and shall pay a 
                    heavier fine,and be incapable of ever commanding the young. 
                    The guardians of thelaw are to be careful inspectors of these 
                    matters, and shall eitherprevent or punish offenders. Every 
                    man should remember the universalrule, that he who is not 
                    a good servant will not be a good master; aman should pride 
                    himself more upon serving well than upon commandingwell: first 
                    upon serving the laws, which is also the service of theGods; 
                    in the second place, upon having. served ancient andhonourable 
                    men in the days of his youth. Furthermore, during the twoyears 
                    in which any one is a warden of the country, his daily foodought 
                    to be of a simple and humble kind. When the twelve have beenchosen, 
                    let them and the five meet together, and determine that theywill 
                    be their own servants, and, like servants, will not have otherslaves 
                    and servants for their own use, neither will they use thoseof 
                    the villagers and husbandmen for their private advantage, 
                    but forthe public service only; and in general they should 
                    make up theirminds to live independently by themselves, servants 
                    of each otherand of themselves. Further, at all seasons of 
                    the year, summer andwinter alike, let them be under arms and 
                    survey minutely the wholecountry; thus they will at once keep 
                    guard, and at the same timeacquire a perfect knowledge of 
                    every locality. There can be no moreimportant kind of information 
                    than the exact knowledge of a man'sown country; and for this 
                    as well as for more general reasons ofpleasure and advantage, 
                    hunting with dogs and other kinds of sportsshould be pursued 
                    by the young. The service to whom this iscommitted may be 
                    called the secret police, or wardens of thecountry; the name 
                    does not much signify, but every one who has thesafety of 
                    the state at heart will use his utmost diligence in thisservice.</p>
                  <p>After the wardens of the country, we have to speak of the 
                    electionof wardens of the agora and of the city. The wardens 
                    of the countrywere sixty in number, and the wardens of the 
                    city will be three, andwill divide the twelve parts of the 
                    city into three; like theformer, they shall have care of the 
                    ways, and of the different highroads which lead out of the 
                    country into the city, and of thebuildings, that they may 
                    be all made according to law;-also of thewaters, which the 
                    guardians of the supply preserve and convey to them,care being 
                    taken that they may reach the fountains pure andabundant, 
                    and be both an ornament and a benefit to the city. Thesealso 
                    should be men of influence, and at leisure to take care of 
                    thepublic interest. Let every man propose as warden of the 
                    city any onewhom he likes out of the highest class, and when 
                    the vote has beengiven on them, and the number is reduced 
                    to the six who have thegreatest number of votes, let the electing 
                    officers choose by lotthree out of the six, and when they 
                    have undergone a scrutiny let themhold office according to 
                    the laws laid down for them. Next, let thewardens of the agora 
                    be elected in like manner, out of the first andsecond class, 
                    five in number: ten are to be first elected, and outof the 
                    ten five are to be chosen by lot, as in the election of thewardens 
                    of the city:-these when they have undergone a scrutiny areto 
                    be declared magistrates. Every one shall vote for every one, 
                    and hewho will not vote, if he be informed against before 
                    the magistrates,shall be fined fifty drachmae, and shall also 
                    be deemed a bad citizen.Let any one who likes go to the assembly 
                    and to the general council;it shall be compulsory to go on 
                    citizens of the first and secondclass, and they shall pay 
                    a fine of ten drachmae if they be foundnot answering to their 
                    names at the assembly. the third and fourthclass shall be 
                    under no compulsion, and shall be let off without afine, unless 
                    the magistrates have commanded all to be present, inconsequence 
                    of some urgent necessity. The wardens of the agora shallobserve 
                    the order appointed by law for the agora, and shall have thecharge 
                    of the temples and fountains which are in the agora; and theyshall 
                    see that no one injures anything, and punish him who does,with 
                    stripes and bonds, if he be a slave or stranger; but if he 
                    be acitizen who misbehaves in this way, they shall have the 
                    powerthemselves of inflicting a fine upon him to the amount 
                    of a hundreddrachmae, or with the consent of the wardens of 
                    the city up todouble that amount. And let the wardens of the 
                    city have a similarpower of imposing punishments and fines 
                    in their own department; andlet them impose fines by their 
                    own department; and let them imposefines by their own authority, 
                    up to a mina, or up to two minae withthe consent of the wardens 
                    of the agora.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, it will be proper to appoint directors 
                    of musicand gymnastic, two kinds of each-of the one kind the 
                    business willbe education, of the other, the superintendence 
                    of contests. Inspeaking of education, the law means to speak 
                    of those who have thecare of order and instruction in gymnasia 
                    and schools, and of thegoing to school, and of school buildings 
                    for boys and girls; and inspeaking of contests, the law refers 
                    to the judges of gymnastics andof music; these again are divided 
                    into two classes, the one havingto do with music, the other 
                    with gymnastics; and the same who judge ofthe gymnastic contests 
                    of men, shall judge of horses; but in musicthere shall be 
                    one set of judges of solo singing, and of imitation-Imean 
                    of rhapsodists, players on the harp, the flute and the like,and 
                    another who shall judge of choral song. First of all, we mustchoose 
                    directors for the choruses of boys, and men, and maidens,whom 
                    they shall follow in the amusement of the dance, and for ourother 
                    musical arrangements; -one director will be enough for thechoruses, 
                    and he should be not less than forty years of age. Onedirector 
                    will also be enough to introduce the solo singers, and togive 
                    judgment on the competitors, and he ought not to be less thanthirty 
                    years of age. The director and manager of the choruses shall 
                    beelected after the following manner:-Let any persons who 
                    commonlytake an interest in such matters go to the meeting, 
                    and be fined ifthey do not go (the guardians of the law shall 
                    judge of theirfault), but those who have no interest shall 
                    not be compelled. Theelector shall propose as director some 
                    one who understands music,and he in the scrutiny may be challenged 
                    on the one part by thosewho say he has no skill, and defended 
                    on the other hand by those whosay that he has. Ten are to 
                    be elected by vote, and he of the tenwho is chosen by lot 
                    shall undergo a scrutiny, and lead the chorusesfor a year 
                    according to law. And in like manner the competitor whowins 
                    the lot shall be leader of the solo and concert music for 
                    thatyear; and he who is thus elected shall deliver the award 
                    to thejudges. In the next place, we have to choose judges 
                    in the contests ofhorses and of men; these shall be selected 
                    from the third and alsofrom the second class of citizens, 
                    and three first classes shall becompelled to go to the election, 
                    but the lowest may stay away withimpunity; and let there be 
                    three elected by lot out of the twentywho have been chosen 
                    previously, and they must also have the voteand approval of 
                    the examiners. But if any one is rejected in thescrutiny at 
                    any ballot or decision, others shall be chosen in the samemanner, 
                    and undergo a similar scrutiny.</p>
                  <p>There remains the minister of the education of youth, male 
                    andfemale; he too will rule according to law; one such minister 
                    will besufficient, and he must be fifty years old, and have 
                    children lawfullybegotten, both boys and girls by preference, 
                    at any rate, one or theother. He who is elected, and he who 
                    is the elector, should considerthat of all the great offices 
                    of state, this is the greatest; forthe first shoot of any 
                    plant, if it makes a good start towards theattainment of its 
                    natural excellence, has the greatest effect on itsmaturity; 
                    and this is not only true of plants, but of animals wild andtame, 
                    and also of men. Man, as we say, is a tame or civilizedanimal; 
                    nevertheless, he requires proper instruction and a fortunatenature, 
                    and then of all animals he becomes the most divine and mostcivilized; 
                    but if he be insufficiently or ill educated he is themost 
                    savage of earthly creatures. Wherefore the legislator ought 
                    notto allow the education of children to become a secondary 
                    or accidentalmatter. In the first place, he who would be rightly 
                    provident aboutthem, should begin by taking care that he is 
                    elected, who of all thecitizens is in every way best; him 
                    the legislator shall do hisutmost to appoint guardian and 
                    superintendent. To this end all themagistrates, with the exception 
                    of the council and prytanes, shallgo to the temple of Apollo, 
                    and elect by ballot him of the guardiansof the law whom they 
                    severally think will be the best superintendentof education. 
                    And he who has the greatest number of votes, after hehas undergone 
                    a scrutiny at the hands of all the magistrates whohave been 
                    his electors, with the exception of the guardians of thelaw-shall 
                    hold office for five years; and in the sixth year letanother 
                    be chosen in like manner to fill his office.</p>
                  <p>If any one dies while he is holding a public office, and 
                    more thanthirty days before his term of office expires, let 
                    those whosebusiness it is elect another to the office in the 
                    same manner asbefore. And if any one who is entrusted with 
                    orphans dies, let therelations both on the father's and mother's 
                    side, who are residingat home, including cousins, appoint 
                    another guardian within tendays, or be fined a drachma a day 
                    for neglect to do so.</p>
                  <p>A city which has no regular courts of law ceases to be a 
                    city; andagain, if a judge is silent and says no more in preliminaryproceedings 
                    than the litigants, as is the case in arbitrations, hewill 
                    never be able to decide justly; wherefore a multitude of judgeswill 
                    not easily judge well, nor a few if they are bad. The point 
                    indispute between the parties should be made clear; and time, 
                    anddeliberation, and repeated examination, greatly tend to 
                    clear updoubts. For this reason, he who goes to law with another 
                    should gofirst of all to his neighbours and friends who know 
                    best the questionsat issue. And if he be unable to obtain 
                    from them a satisfactorydecision, let him have recourse to 
                    another court; and if the twocourts cannot settle the matter, 
                    let a third put an end to the suit.</p>
                  <p>Now the establishment of courts of justice may be regarded 
                    as achoice of magistrates, for every magistrate must also 
                    be a judge ofsome things; and the judge, though he be not 
                    a magistrate, yet incertain respects is a very important magistrate 
                    on the day on which heis determining a suit. Regarding then 
                    the judges also asmagistrates, let us say who are fit to be 
                    judges, and of what they areto be judges, and how many of 
                    them are to judge in each suit. Let thatbe the supreme tribunal 
                    which the litigants appoint in common forthemselves, choosing 
                    certain persons by agreement. And let there betwo other tribunals: 
                    one for private causes, when a citizen accusesanother of wronging 
                    him and wishes to get a decision; the other forpublic causes, 
                    in which some citizen is of opinion that the public hasbeen 
                    wronged by an individual, and is willing to vindicate thecommon 
                    interests. And we must not forget to mention how the judges 
                    areto be qualified, and who they are to be. In the first place, 
                    let therebe a tribunal open to all private persons who are 
                    trying causes oneagainst another for the third time, and let 
                    this be composed asfollows:-All the officers of state, as 
                    well annual as those holdingoffice for a longer period, when 
                    the new year is about to commence, inthe month following after 
                    the summer solstice, on the last day but oneof the year, shall 
                    meet in some temple, and calling God to witness,shall dedicate 
                    one judge from every magistracy to be theirfirst-fruits, choosing 
                    in each office him who seems to them to bethe best, and whom 
                    they deem likely to decide the causes of hisfellow-citizens 
                    during the ensuing year in the best and holiestmanner. And 
                    when the election is completed, a scrutiny shall be heldin 
                    the presence of the electors themselves, and if any one be 
                    rejectedanother shall be chosen in the same manner. Those 
                    who have undergonethe scrutiny shall judge the causes of those 
                    who have declined theinferior courts, and shall give their 
                    vote openly. The councillors andother magistrates who have 
                    elected them shall be required to behearers and spectators 
                    of the causes; and any one else may bepresent who pleases. 
                    If one man charges another with havingintentionally decided 
                    wrong, let him go to the guardians of the lawand lay his accusation 
                    before them, and he who is found guilty in sucha case shall 
                    pay damages to the injured party equal to half theinjury; 
                    but if he shall appear to deserve a greater penalty, thejudges 
                    shall determine what additional punishment he shall suffer, 
                    andhow much more he ought to pay to the public treasury, and 
                    to the partywho brought the suit.</p>
                  <p>In the judgment of offences against the state, the people 
                    ought toparticipate, for when any one wrongs the state all 
                    are wronged, andmay reasonably complain if they are not allowed 
                    to share in thedecision. Such causes ought to originate with 
                    the people, and theought also to have the final decision of 
                    them, but the trial of themshall take place before three of 
                    the highest magistrates, upon whomthe plaintiff and the defendant 
                    shall agree; and if they are notable to come to an agreement 
                    themselves, the council shall chooseone of the two proposed. 
                    And in private suits, too, as far as ispossible, all should 
                    have a share; for he who has no share in theadministration 
                    of justice, is apt to imagine that he has no share inthe state 
                    at all. And for this reason there shall be a court of law 
                    inevery tribe, and the judges shall be chosen by lot;-they 
                    shall givetheir decisions at once, and shall be inaccessible 
                    to entreaties.The final judgment shall rest with that court 
                    which, as we maintain,has been established in the most incorruptible 
                    form of which humanthings admit: this shall be the court established 
                    for those who areunable to get rid of their suits either in 
                    the courts of neighbours orof the tribes.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the courts of law, which, as I was saying, cannot 
                    beprecisely defined either as being or not being offices; 
                    asuperficial sketch has been given of them, in which some 
                    things havebeen told and others omitted. For the right place 
                    of an exactstatement of the laws respecting suits, under their 
                    several heads,will be at the end of the body of legislation;-let 
                    us then expect themat the end. Hitherto our legislation has 
                    been chiefly occupied withthe appointment of offices. Perfect 
                    unity and exactness, extendingto the whole and every particular 
                    of political administration,cannot be attained to the full, 
                    until the discussion shall have abeginning, middle, and end, 
                    and is complete in every part. Atpresent we have reached the 
                    election of magistrates, and this may beregarded as a sufficient 
                    termination of what preceded. And now thereneed no longer 
                    be any delay or hesitation in beginning the work oflegislation.</p>
                  <p>Cle. I like what you have said, Stranger-and I particularly 
                    likeyour manner of tacking on the beginning of your new discourse 
                    to theend of the former one.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Thus far, then, the old men's rational pastime has gone 
                    offwell.</p>
                  <p>Cle. You mean, I suppose, their serious and noble pursuit?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Perhaps; but I should like to know whether you and I 
                    are agreedabout a certain thing.</p>
                  <p>Cle. About what thing?</p>
                  <p>Ath. You know. the endless labour which painters expend upon 
                    theirpictures-they are always putting in or taking out colours, 
                    or whateverbe the term which artists employ; they seem as 
                    if they would nevercease touching up their works, which are 
                    always being made brighterand more beautiful.</p>
                  <p>Cle. I know something of these matters from report, although 
                    Ihave never had any great acquaintance with the art.</p>
                  <p>Ath. No matter; we may make use of the illustrationnotwithstanding:-Suppose 
                    that some one had a mind to paint a figure inthe most beautiful 
                    manner, in the hope that his work instead of losingwould always 
                    improve as time went on-do you not see that being amortal, 
                    unless he leaves some one to succeed him who will correctthe 
                    flaws which time may introduce, and be able to add what is 
                    leftimperfect through the defect of the artist, and who will 
                    furtherbrighten up and improve the picture, all his great 
                    labour will lastbut a short time?</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And is not the aim of the legislator similar? First, 
                    he desiresthat his laws should be written down with all possible 
                    exactness; inthe second place, as time goes on and he has 
                    made an actual trial ofhis decrees, will he not find omissions? 
                    Do you imagine that thereever was a legislator so foolish 
                    as not to know that many things arenecessarily omitted, which 
                    some one coming after him must correct,if the constitution 
                    and the order of government is not to deteriorate,but to improve 
                    in the state which he has established?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Assuredly, that is the sort of thing which every one 
                    woulddesire.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And if any one possesses any means of accomplishing 
                    this byword or deed, or has any way great or small by which 
                    he can teach aperson to understand how he can maintain and 
                    amend the laws, he shouldfinish what he has to say, and not 
                    leave the work incomplete.</p>
                  <p>Cle. By all means.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And is not this what you and I have to do at the presentmoment?</p>
                  <p>Cle. What have we to do?</p>
                  <p>Ath. As we are about to legislate and have chosen our guardians 
                    ofthe law, and are ourselves in the evening of life, and they 
                    ascompared with us are young men, we ought not only to legislate 
                    forthem, but to endeavour to make them not only guardians 
                    of the lawbut legislators themselves, as far as this is possible.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly; if we can.</p>
                  <p>Ath. At any rate, we must do our best.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Of course.</p>
                  <p>Ath. We will say to them-O friends and saviours of our laws, 
                    inlaying down any law, there are many particulars which we 
                    shall omit,and this cannot be helped; at the same time, we 
                    will do our utmostto describe what is important, and will 
                    give an outline which youshall fill up. And I will explain 
                    on what principle you are to act.Megillus and Cleinias and 
                    I have often spoken to one anothertouching these matters, 
                    and we are of opinion that we have spokenwell. And we hope 
                    that you will be of the same mind with us, andbecome our disciples, 
                    and keep in view the things which in ourunited opinion the 
                    legislator and guardian of the law ought to keep inview. There 
                    was one main point about which we were agreed-that a man'swhole 
                    energies throughout life should be devoted to the acquisition 
                    ofthe virtue proper to a man, whether this was to be gained 
                    by study, orhabit, or some mode of acquisition, or desire, 
                    or opinion, orknowledge-and this applies equally to men and 
                    women, old and young-theaim of all should always be such as 
                    I have described; anything whichmay be an impediment, the 
                    good man ought to show that he utterlydisregards. And if at 
                    last necessity plainly compels him to be anoutlaw from his 
                    native land, rather than bow his neck to the yoke ofslavery 
                    and be ruled by inferiors, and he has to fly, an exile he 
                    mustbe and endure all such trials, rather than accept another 
                    form ofgovernment, which is likely to make men worse. These 
                    are ouroriginal principles; and do you now, fixing your eyes 
                    upon thestandard of what a man and a citizen ought or ought 
                    not to be,praise and blame the laws-blame those which have 
                    not this power ofmaking the citizen better, but embrace those 
                    which have; and withgladness receive and live in them; bidding 
                    a long farewell to otherinstitutions which aim at goods, as 
                    they are termed, of a differentkind.</p>
                  <p>Let us proceed to another class of laws, beginning with theirfoundation 
                    in religion. And we must first return to the number5040-the 
                    entire number had, and has, a great many convenientdivisions, 
                    and the number of the tribes which was a twelfth part ofthe 
                    whole, being correctly formed by 21 X 20 [5040/(21 X 20), 
                    i.e.,5040/420=12], also has them. And not only is the whole 
                    numberdivisible by twelve, but also the number of each tribe 
                    is divisible bytwelve. Now every portion should be regarded 
                    by us as a sacred gift ofHeaven, corresponding to the months 
                    and to the revolution of theuniverse. Every city has a guiding 
                    and sacred principle given bynature, but in some the division 
                    or distribution has been more rightthan in others, and has 
                    been more sacred and fortunate. In ouropinion, nothing can 
                    be more right than the selection of the number5040, which 
                    may be divided by all numbers from one to twelve withthe single 
                    exception of eleven, and that admits of a very easycorrection; 
                    for if, turning to the dividend (5040), we deduct twofamilies, 
                    the defect in the division is cured. And the truth of thismay 
                    be easily proved when we have leisure. But for the present,trusting 
                    to the mere assertion of this principle, let us divide thestate; 
                    and assigning to each portion some God or son of a God, letus 
                    give them altars and sacred rites, and at the altars let us 
                    holdassemblies for sacrifice twice in the month-twelve assemblies 
                    forthe tribes, and twelve for the city, according to their 
                    divisions; thefirst in honour of the Gods and divine things, 
                    and the second topromote friendship and &quot;better acquaintance,&quot; 
                    as the phrase is, andevery sort of good fellowship with one 
                    another. For people must beacquainted with those into whose 
                    families and whom they marry and withthose to whom they give 
                    in marriage; in such matters, as far aspossible, a man should 
                    deem it all important to avoid a mistake, andwith this serious 
                    purpose let games be instituted in which youthsand maidens 
                    shall dance together, seeing one another and being seennaked, 
                    at a proper age, and on a suitable occasion, nottransgressing 
                    the rules of modesty.</p>
                  <p>The directors of choruses will be the superintendents and 
                    regulatorsof these games, and they, together with the guardians 
                    of the law, willlegislate in any matters which we have omitted; 
                    for, as we said, wherethere are numerous and minute details, 
                    the legislator must leave outsomething. And the annual officers 
                    who have experience, and knowwhat is wanted, must make arrangements 
                    and improvements year byyear, until such enactments and provisions 
                    are sufficientlydetermined. A ten years experience of sacrifices 
                    and dances, ifextending to all particulars, will be quite 
                    sufficient; and if thelegislator be alive they shall communicate 
                    with him, but if he be deadthen the several officers shall 
                    refer the omissions which come undertheir notice to the guardians 
                    of the law, and correct them, untilall is perfect; and from 
                    that time there shall be no more change,and they shall establish 
                    and use the new laws with the others whichthe legislator originally 
                    gave them, and of which they are never, ifthey can help, to 
                    change aught; or, if some necessity overtakesthem, the magistrates 
                    must be called into counsel, and the wholepeople, and they 
                    must go to all the oracles of the Gods; and if theyare all 
                    agreed, in that case they may make the change, but if they 
                    arenot agreed, by no manner of means, and any one who dissents 
                    shallprevail, as the law ordains.</p>
                  <p>Whenever any one over twenty-five years of age, having seen 
                    and beenseen by others, believes himself to have found a marriage 
                    connectionwhich is to his mind, and suitable for the procreation 
                    of children,let him marry if he be still under the age of 
                    five-and-thirty years;but let him first hear how he ought 
                    to seek after what is suitable andappropriate. For, as Cleinias 
                    says, every law should have a suitableprelude.</p>
                  <p>Cle. You recollect at the right moment, Stranger, and do 
                    not missthe opportunity which the argument affords of saying 
                    a word in season.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I thank you. We will say to him who is born of good 
                    parents-Omy son, you ought to make such a marriage as wise 
                    men would approve.Now they would advise you neither to avoid 
                    a poor marriage, norspecially to desire a rich one; but if 
                    other things are equal,always to honour inferiors, and with 
                    them to form connections;-thiswill be for the benefit of the 
                    city and of the families which areunited; for the equable 
                    and symmetrical tends infinitely more tovirtue than the unmixed. 
                    And he who is conscious of being tooheadstrong, and carried 
                    away more than is fitting in all hisactions, ought to desire 
                    to become the relation of orderly parents;and he who is of 
                    the opposite temper ought to seek the oppositealliance. Let 
                    there be one word concerning all marriages:-Every manshall 
                    follow, not after the marriage which is most pleasing tohimself, 
                    but after that which is most beneficial to the state. Forsomehow 
                    every one is by nature prone to that which is likest tohimself, 
                    and in this way the whole city becomes unequal in propertyand 
                    in disposition; and hence there arise in most states the veryresults 
                    which we least desire to happen. Now, to add to the law anexpress 
                    provision, not only that the rich man shall not marry into 
                    therich family, nor the powerful into the family of the powerful, 
                    butthat the slower natures shall be compelled to enter into 
                    marriage withthe quicker, and the quicker with the slower, 
                    may awaken anger as wellas laughter in the minds of many; 
                    for there is a difficulty inperceiving that the city ought 
                    to be well mingled like a cup, in whichthe maddening wine 
                    is hot and fiery, but when chastened by a sobererGod, receives 
                    a fair associate and becomes an excellent andtemperate drink. 
                    Yet in marriage no one is able to see that the sameresult 
                    occurs. Wherefore also the law must let alone such matters, 
                    butwe should try to charm the spirits of men into believing 
                    theequability of their children's disposition to be of more 
                    importancethan equality in excessive fortune when they marry; 
                    and him who is toodesirous of making a rich marriage we should 
                    endeavour to turn asideby reproaches, not, however, by any 
                    compulsion of written law.</p>
                  <p>Let this then be our exhortation concerning marriage, and 
                    let usremember what was said before-that a man should cling 
                    toimmortality, and leave behind him children's children to 
                    be theservants of God in his place for ever. All this and 
                    much more may betruly said by way of prelude about the duty 
                    of marriage. But if aman will not listen and remains unsocial 
                    and alien among hisfellow-citizens, and is still unmarried 
                    at thirty-five years of age,let him pay a yearly fine;-he 
                    who of the highest class shall pay afine of a hundred drachmae, 
                    and he who is of the second dass a fine ofseventy drachmae; 
                    the third class shall pay sixty drachmae, and thefourth thirty 
                    drachmae, and let the money be sacred to Here; he whodoes 
                    not pay the fine annually shall owe ten times the sum, whichthe 
                    treasurer of the goddess shall exact; and if he fails in doing 
                    so,let him be answerable and give an account of the. money 
                    at hisaudit. He who refuses to marry shall be thus punished 
                    in money, andalso be deprived of all honour which the younger 
                    show to the elder;let no young man voluntarily obey him, and 
                    if he attempt to punish anyone, let every one come to the 
                    rescue and defend the injured person,and he who is present 
                    and does not come to the rescue, shall bepronounced by the 
                    law to be a coward and a bad citizen. Of themarriage portion 
                    I have already spoken; and again I say for theinstruction 
                    of poor men that he who neither gives nor receives a dowryon 
                    account of poverty, has a compensation; for the citizens of 
                    ourstate are provided with the necessaries of life, and wives 
                    will beless likely to be insolent, and husbands to be mean 
                    and subservient tothem on account of property. And he who 
                    obeys this law will do a nobleaction; but he who will not 
                    obey, and gives or receives more thanfifty drachmae as the 
                    price of the marriage garments if he be of thelowest, or more 
                    than a mina, or a mina and-a-half, if he be of thethird or 
                    second classes, or two minae if he be of the highest class,shall 
                    owe to the public treasury a similar sum, and that which isgiven 
                    or received shall be sacred to Here and Zeus; and let thetreasurers 
                    of these Gods exact the money, as was said before about theunmarried-that 
                    the treasurers of Here were to exact the money, orpay the 
                    fine themselves.</p>
                  <p>The betrothal by a father shall be valid in the first degree, 
                    thatby a grandfather in the second degree, and in the third 
                    degree,betrothal by brothers who have the same father; but 
                    if there arenone of these alive, the betrothal by a mother 
                    shall be valid inlike manner; in cases of unexampled fatality, 
                    the next of kin andthe guardians shall have authority. What 
                    are to be the rites beforemarriages, or any other sacred acts, 
                    relating either to future,present, or past marriages, shall 
                    be referred to the interpreters; andhe who follows their advice 
                    may be satisfied. Touching the marriagefestival, they shall 
                    assemble not more than five male and fivefemale friends of 
                    both families; and a like number of members of thefamily of 
                    either sex, and no man shall spend more than his meanswill 
                    allow; he who is of the richest class may spend a mina-he 
                    whois of the second, half a mina, and in the same proportion 
                    as thecensus of each decreases: all men shall praise him who 
                    is obedientto the law; but he who is disobedient shall be 
                    punished by theguardians of the law as a man wanting in true 
                    taste, anduninstructed in the laws of bridal song. Drunkenness 
                    is alwaysimproper, except at the festivals of the God who 
                    gave wine; andpeculiarly dangerous, when a man is engaged 
                    in the business ofmarriage; at such a crisis of their lives 
                    a bride and bridegroom oughtto have all their wits about them-they 
                    ought to take care that theiroffspring may be born of reasonable 
                    beings; for on what day or nightHeaven will give them increase, 
                    who can say? Moreover, they oughtnot to begetting children 
                    when their bodies are dissipated byintoxication, but their 
                    offspring should be compact and solid, quietand compounded 
                    properly; whereas the drunkard is all abroad in all hisactions, 
                    and beside himself both in body and soul. Wherefore, also,the 
                    drunken man is bad and unsteady in sowing the seed of increase,and 
                    is likely to beget offspring who will be unstable anduntrustworthy, 
                    and cannot be expected to walk straight either inbody or mind. 
                    Hence during the whole year and all his life long, andespecially 
                    while he is begetting children, ought to take care andnot 
                    intentionally do what is injurious to health, or what involvesinsolence 
                    and wrong; for he cannot help leaving the impression ofhimself 
                    on the souls and bodies of his offspring, and he begetschildren 
                    in every way inferior. And especially on the day and night 
                    ofmarriage should a man abstain from such things. For the 
                    beginning,which is also a God dwelling in man, preserves all 
                    things, if itmeet with proper respect from each individual. 
                    He who marries isfurther to consider that one of the two houses 
                    in the lot is thenest and nursery of his young, and there 
                    he is to marry and make ahome for himself and bring up his 
                    children, going away from his fatherand mother. For in friendships 
                    there must be some degree of desire, inorder to cement and 
                    bind together diversities of character; butexcessive intercourse 
                    not having the desire which is created bytime, insensibly 
                    dissolves friendships from a feeling of satiety;wherefore 
                    a man and his wife shall leave to his and her father andmother 
                    their own dwelling-places, and themselves go as to a colony 
                    anddwell there, and visit and be visited by their parents; 
                    and they shallbeget and bring up children, handing on the 
                    torch of life from onegeneration to another, and worshipping 
                    the Gods according to law forever.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, we have to consider what sort of property 
                    will bemost convenient. There is no difficulty either in understanding 
                    oracquiring most kinds of property, but there is great difficulty 
                    inwhat relates to slaves. And the reason is that we speak 
                    about themin a way which is right and which is not right; 
                    for what we sayabout our slaves is consistent and also inconsistent 
                    with our practiceabout them.</p>
                  <p>Megillus. I do not understand, Stranger, what you mean.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I am not surprised, Megillus, for the state of the Helots 
                    amongthe Lacedaemonians is of all Hellenic forms of slavery 
                    the mostcontroverted and disputed about, some approving and 
                    some condemningit; there is less dispute about the slavery 
                    which exists among theHeracleots, who have subjugated the 
                    Mariandynians, and about theThessalian Penestae. Looking at 
                    these and the like examples, whatought we to do concerning 
                    property in slaves? I made a remark, inpassing, which naturally 
                    elicited a question about my meaning fromyou. It was this:-We 
                    know that all would agree that we should have thebest and 
                    most attached slaves whom we can get. For many a man hasfound 
                    his slaves better in every way than brethren or sons, and 
                    manytimes they have saved the lives and property of their 
                    masters andtheir whole house-such tales are well known.</p>
                  <p>Meg. To be sure.</p>
                  <p>Ath. But may we not also say that the soul of the slave is 
                    utterlycorrupt, and that no man of sense ought to trust them? 
                    And thewisest of our poets, speaking of Zeus, says:</p>
                  <p>Far-seeing Zeus takes away half the understanding of men 
                    whom theday of slavery subdues.Different persons have got 
                    these two different notions of slaves intheir minds-some of 
                    them utterly distrust their servants, and, as ifthey were 
                    wild beasts, chastise them with goads and whips, and maketheir 
                    souls three times, or rather many times, as slavish as they 
                    werebefore;-and others do just the opposite.</p>
                  <p>Meg. True.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Then what are we to do in our own country, Stranger, 
                    seeingthat there are, such differences in the treatment of 
                    slaves by theirowners?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Well, Cleinias, there can be no doubt that man is a 
                    troublesomeanimal, and therefore he is not very manageable, 
                    nor likely tobecome so, when you attempt to introduce the 
                    necessary division,slave, and freeman, and master.</p>
                  <p>Cle. That is obvious.</p>
                  <p>Ath. He is a troublesome piece of goods, as has been often 
                    shownby the frequent revolts of the Messenians, and the great 
                    mischiefswhich happen in states having many slaves who speak 
                    the same language,and the numerous robberies and lawless life 
                    of the Italian banditti,as they are called. A man who considers 
                    all this is fairly at aloss. Two remedies alone remain to 
                    us-not to have the slaves of thesame country, nor if possible, 
                    speaking the same language; in this waythey will more easily 
                    be held in subjection: secondly, we shouldtend them carefully, 
                    not only out of regard to them, but yet moreout of respect 
                    to ourselves. And the right treatment of slaves is tobehave 
                    properly to them, and to do to them, if possible, even morejustice 
                    than to those who are our equals; for he who naturally andgenuinely 
                    reverences justice, and hates injustice, is discovered inhis 
                    dealings with any class of men to whom he can easily be unjust.And 
                    he who in regard to the natures and actions of his slaves 
                    isundefiled by impiety and injustice, will best sow the seeds 
                    ofvirtue in them; and this may be truly said of every master, 
                    andtyrant, and of every other having authority in relation 
                    to hisinferiors. Slaves ought to be punished as they deserve, 
                    and notadmonished as if they were freemen, which will only 
                    make themconceited. The language used to a servant ought always 
                    to be that of acommand, and we ought not to jest with them, 
                    whether they are males orfemales-this is a foolish way which 
                    many people have of setting uptheir slaves, and making the 
                    life of servitude more disagreeableboth for them and for their 
                    masters.</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Now that each of the citizens is provided, as far aspossible, 
                    with a sufficient number of suitable slaves who can help himin 
                    what he has to do, we may next proceed to describe their dwellings.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very good.</p>
                  <p>Ath. The city being new and hitherto uninhabited, care ought 
                    to betaken of all the buildings, and the manner of building 
                    each of them,and also of the temples and walls. These, Cleinias, 
                    were matters whichproperly came before the marriages; but, 
                    as we are only talking, thereis no objection to changing the 
                    order. If, however, our plan oflegislation is ever to take 
                    effect, then the house shall precede themarriage if God so 
                    will, and afterwards we will come to theregulations about 
                    marriage; but at present we are only describingthese matters 
                    in a general outline.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Quite true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. The temples are to be placed all round the agora, and 
                    the wholecity built on the heights in a circle, for the sake 
                    of defence and forthe sake of purity. Near the temples are 
                    to be placed buildings forthe magistrates and the courts of 
                    law; in these plaintiff anddefendant will receive their due, 
                    and the places will be regarded asmost holy, partly because 
                    they have to do with the holy things: andpartly because they 
                    are the dwelling-places of holy Gods: and inthem will be held 
                    the courts in which cases of homicide and othertrials of capital 
                    offenses may fitly take place. As to the walls,Megillus, I 
                    agree with Sparta in thinking that they should beallowed to 
                    sleep in the earth, and that we should not attempt todisinter 
                    them; there is a poetical saying, which is finelyexpressed, 
                    that &quot;walls ought to be of steel and iron, and not ofearth; 
                    besides, how ridiculous of us to be sending out our young 
                    menannually into the country to dig and to trench, and to 
                    keep off theenemy by fortifications, under the idea that they 
                    are not to beallowed to set foot in our territory, and then, 
                    that we shouldsurround ourselves with a wall, which, in the 
                    first place, is by nomeans conducive to the health of cities, 
                    and is also apt to producea certain effeminacy in the minds 
                    of the inhabitants, inviting mento run thither instead of 
                    repelling their enemies, and leading them toimagine that their 
                    safety is due not to their keeping guard day andnight, but 
                    that when they are protected by walls and gates, thenthey 
                    may sleep in safety; as if they were not meant to labour, 
                    and didnot know that true repose comes from labour, and that 
                    disgracefulindolence and a careless temper of mind is only 
                    the renewal oftrouble. But if men must have walls, the private 
                    houses ought to be soarranged from the first that the whole 
                    city may be one wall, havingall the houses capable of defence 
                    by reason of their uniformity andequality towards the streets. 
                    The form of the city being that of asingle dwelling will have 
                    an agreeable aspect, and being easilyguarded will be infinitely 
                    better for security. Until the originalbuilding is completed, 
                    these should be the principal objects of theinhabitants; and 
                    the wardens of the city should superintend thework, and should 
                    impose a fine on him who is negligent; and in allthat relates 
                    to the city they should have a care of cleanliness, andnot 
                    allow a private person to encroach upon any public property 
                    eitherby buildings or excavations. Further, they ought to 
                    take care that therains from heaven flow off easily, and of 
                    any other matters whichmay have to be administered either 
                    within or without the city. Theguardians of the law shall 
                    pass any further enactments which theirexperience may show 
                    to be necessary, and supply any other points inwhich the law 
                    may be deficient. And now that these matters, and thebuildings 
                    about the agora, and the gymnasia, and places ofinstruction, 
                    and theatres, are all ready and waiting for scholarsand spectators, 
                    let us proceed to the subjects which follow marriagein the 
                    order of legislation.</p>
                  <p>Cle. By all means.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Assuming that marriages exist already, Cleinias, the 
                    mode oflife during the year after marriage, before children 
                    are born, willfollow next in order. In what way bride and 
                    bridegroom ought to livein a city which is to be superior 
                    to other cities, is a matter notat all easy for us to determine. 
                    There have been many difficultiesalready, but this will be 
                    the greatest of them, and the mostdisagreeable to the many. 
                    Still I cannot but say what appears to me tobe right and true, 
                    Cleinias.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. He who imagines that he can give laws for the public 
                    conduct ofstates, while he leaves the private life of citizens 
                    wholly to takecare of itself; who thinks that individuals 
                    may pass the day as theyplease, and that there is no necessity 
                    of order in all things; he, Isay, who gives up the control 
                    of their private lives, and supposesthat they will conform 
                    to law in their common and public life, ismaking a great mistake. 
                    Why have I made this remark? Why, because I amgoing to enact 
                    that the bridegrooms should live at the commontables, just 
                    as they did before marriage. This was a singularitywhen first 
                    enacted by the legislator in your parts of the world,Megillus 
                    and Cleinias, as I should suppose, on the occasion of somewar 
                    or other similar danger, which caused the passing of the law,and 
                    which would be likely to occur in thinly-peopled places, and 
                    intimes of pressure. But when men had once tried and been 
                    accustomedto a common table, experience showed that the institution 
                    greatlyconduced to security; and in some such manner the custom 
                    of havingcommon tables arose among you.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Likely enough.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I said that there may have been singularity and danger 
                    inimposing such a custom at first, but that now there is not 
                    the samedifficulty. There is, however, another institution 
                    which is thenatural sequel to this, and would be excellent, 
                    if it existedanywhere, but at present it does not. The institution 
                    of which I amabout to speak is not easily described or executed; 
                    and would belike the legislator &quot;combing wool into the 
                    fire,&quot; as people say, orperforming any other impossible 
                    and useless feat.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What is the cause, Stranger, of this extreme hesitation?</p>
                  <p>Ath. You shall hear without any fruitless loss of time. That 
                    whichhas law and order in a state is the cause of every good, 
                    but thatwhich is disordered or ill-ordered is often the ruin 
                    of that whichis well-ordered; and at this point the argument 
                    is now waiting. Forwith you, Cleinias and Megillus, the common 
                    tables of men are, as Isaid, a heaven-born and admirable institution, 
                    but you are mistaken inleaving the women unregulated by law. 
                    They have no similar institutionof public tables in the light 
                    of day, and just that part of thehuman race which is by nature 
                    prone to secrecy and stealth onaccount of their weakness-I 
                    mean the female sex-has been leftwithout regulation by the 
                    legislator, which is a great mistake. And,in consequence of 
                    this neglect, many things have grown lax amongyou, which might 
                    have been far better, if they had been only regulatedby law; 
                    for the neglect of regulations about women may not only beregarded 
                    as a neglect of half the entire matter, but in proportionas 
                    woman's nature is inferior to that of men in capacity for 
                    virtue,in that degree the consequence of such neglect is more 
                    than twice asimportant. The careful consideration of this 
                    matter, and the arrangingand ordering on a common principle 
                    of all our institutions relatingboth to men and women, greatly 
                    conduces to the happiness of the state.But at present, such 
                    is the unfortunate condition of mankind, thatno man of sense 
                    will even venture to speak of common tables inplaces and cities 
                    in which they have never been established at all;and how can 
                    any one avoid being utterly ridiculous, who attempts tocompel 
                    women to show in public how much they eat and drink? There 
                    isnothing at which the sex is more likely to take offence. 
                    For women areaccustomed to creep into dark places, and when 
                    dragged out into thelight they will exert their utmost powers 
                    of resistance, and be fartoo much for the legislator. And 
                    therefore, as I said before, inmost places they will not endure 
                    to have the truth spoken withoutraising a tremendous outcry, 
                    but in this state perhaps they may. Andif we may assume that 
                    our whole discussion about the state has notbeen mere idle 
                    talk, I should like to prove to you, if you willconsent to 
                    listen, that this institution is good and proper; but ifyou 
                    had rather not, I will refrain.</p>
                  <p>Cle. There is nothing which we should both of us like better,Stranger, 
                    than to hear what you have to say.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Very good; and you must not be surprised if I go back 
                    a little,for we have plenty of leisure, and there is nothing 
                    to prevent us fromconsidering in every point of view the subject 
                    of law.</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then let us return once more to what we were saying 
                    at first.Every man should understand that the human race either 
                    had nobeginning at all, and will never have an end, but always 
                    will be andhas been; or that it began an immense while ago.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Well, and have there not been constitutions and destructions 
                    ofstates, and all sorts of pursuits both orderly and disorderly, 
                    anddiverse desires of meats and drinks always, and in all 
                    the world,and all sorts of changes of the seasons in which 
                    animals may beexpected to have undergone innumerable transformations 
                    of themselves?</p>
                  <p>Cle. No doubt.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And may we not suppose that vines appeared, which hadpreviously 
                    no existence, and also olives, and the gifts of Demeter andher 
                    daughter, of which one Triptolemus was the minister, and that,before 
                    these existed, animals took to devouring each other as theydo 
                    still?</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Again, the practice of men sacrificing one another still 
                    existsamong many nations; while, on the other hand, we hear 
                    of other humanbeings who did not even venture to taste the 
                    flesh of a cow and had noanimal sacrifices, but only cakes 
                    and fruits dipped in honey, andsimilar pure offerings, but 
                    no flesh of animals; from these theyabstained under the idea 
                    that they ought not to eat them, and mightnot stain the altars 
                    of the Gods with blood. For in those days men aresaid to have 
                    lived a sort of Orphic life, having the use of alllifeless 
                    things, but abstaining from all living things.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Such has been the constant tradition, and is very likely 
                    true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Some one might say to us, What is the drift of all this?</p>
                  <p>Cle. A very pertinent question, Stranger.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And therefore I will endeavour, Cleinias, if I can, 
                    to draw thenatural inference.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Proceed.</p>
                  <p> Ath. I see that among men all things depend upon three wants 
                    anddesires, of which the end is virtue, if they are rightly 
                    led bythem, or the opposite if wrongly. Now these are eating 
                    and drinking,which begin at birth-every animal has a natural 
                    desire for them, andis violently excited, and rebels against 
                    him who says that he must notsatisfy all his pleasures and 
                    appetites, and get rid of all thecorresponding pains-and the 
                    third and greatest and sharpest want anddesire breaks out 
                    last, and is the fire of sexual lust, whichkindles in men 
                    every species of wantonness and madness. And thesethree disorders 
                    we must endeavour to master by the three greatprinciples of 
                    fear and law and right reason; turning them away fromthat 
                    which is called pleasantest to the best, using the Muses andthe 
                    Gods who preside over contests to extinguish their increase 
                    andinflux.</p>
                  <p>But to return:-After marriage let us speak of the birth of 
                    children,and after their birth of their nurture and education. 
                    In the course ofdiscussion the several laws will be perfected, 
                    and we shall at lastarrive at the common tables. Whether such 
                    associations are to beconfined to men, or extended to women 
                    also, we shall see better whenwe approach and take a nearer 
                    view of them; and we may thendetermine what previous institutions 
                    are required and will have toprecede them. As I said before 
                    we shall see them more in detail, andshall be better able 
                    to lay down the laws which are proper or suitedto them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us keep in mind the words which have now been spoken; 
                    forhereafter there may be need of them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What do you bid us keep in mind?</p>
                  <p>Ath. That which we comprehended under the three words-first, 
                    eating,secondly, drinking, thirdly, the excitement of love.</p>
                  <p>Cle. We shall be sure to remember, Stranger.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Very good. Then let us now proceed to marriage, and 
                    teachpersons in what way they shall beget children, threatening 
                    them, ifthey disobey, with the terrors of the law.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. The bride and bridegroom should consider that they are 
                    toproduce for the state the best and fairest specimens of 
                    children whichthey can. Now all men who are associated any 
                    action always succeedwhen they attend and give their mind 
                    to what they are doing, butwhen they do not give their mind 
                    or have no mind, they fail; whereforelet the bridegroom give 
                    his mind to the bride and to the begettingof children, and 
                    the bride in like manner give her mind to thebridegroom, and 
                    particularly at the time when their children are notyet born. 
                    And let the women whom we have chosen be the overseers ofsuch 
                    matters, and let them in whatever number, large or small, 
                    andat whatever time the magistrates may command, assemble 
                    every day inthe temple of Eileithyia during a third part of 
                    the day, and beingthere assembled, let them inform one another 
                    of any one whom they see,whether man or woman, of those who 
                    are begetting children,disregarding the ordinances given at 
                    the time when the nuptialsacrifices and ceremonies were performed. 
                    Let the begetting ofchildren and the supervision of those 
                    who are begetting themcontinue ten years and no longer, during 
                    the time when marriage isfruitful. But if any continue without 
                    children up to this time, letthem take counsel with their 
                    kindred and with the women holding theoffice of overseer and 
                    be divorced for their mutual benefit. If,however, any dispute 
                    arises about what is proper and for theinterest of either 
                    party, they shall choose ten of the guardians ofthe law and 
                    abide by their permission and appointment. The women whopreside 
                    over these matters shall enter into the houses of the young,and 
                    partly by admonitions and partly by threats make them give 
                    overtheir folly and error: if they persist, let the women 
                    go and tellthe guardians of the law, and the guardians shall 
                    prevent them. But ifthey too cannot prevent them, they shall 
                    bring the matter before thepeople; and let them write up their 
                    names and make oath that theycannot reform such and such an 
                    one; and let him who is thus writtenup, if he cannot in a 
                    court of law convict those who have inscribedhis name, be 
                    deprived of the privileges of a citizen in thefollowing respects:-let 
                    him not go to weddings nor to thethanksgivings after the birth 
                    of children; and if he go, let any onewho pleases strike him 
                    with impunity; and let the same regulationshold about women: 
                    let not a woman be allowed to appear abroad, orreceive honour, 
                    or go to nuptial and birthday festivals, if she inlike manner 
                    be written up as acting disorderly and cannot obtain averdict. 
                    And if, when they themselves have done begetting childrenaccording 
                    to the law, a man or woman have connection with anotherman 
                    or woman who are still begetting children, let the samepenalties 
                    be inflicted upon them as upon those who are still havinga 
                    family; and when the time for procreation has passed let the 
                    manor woman who refrains in such matters be held in esteem, 
                    and let thosewho do not refrain be held in the contrary of 
                    esteem-that is to say,disesteem. Now, if the greater part 
                    of mankind behave modestly, theenactments of law may be left 
                    to slumber; but, if they are disorderly,the enactments having 
                    been passed, let them be carried into execution.To every man 
                    the first year is the beginning of life, and the timeof birth 
                    ought to be written down in the temples of their fathers asthe 
                    beginning of existence to every child, whether boy or girl. 
                    Letevery phratria have inscribed on a whited wall the names 
                    of thesuccessive archons by whom the years are reckoned. And 
                    near to themlet the living members of the phratria be inscribed, 
                    and when theydepart life let them be erased. The limit of 
                    marriageable ages for awoman shall be from sixteen to twenty 
                    years at the longest-for aman, from thirty to thirty-five 
                    years; and let a woman hold officeat forty, and a man at thirty 
                    years. Let a man go out to war fromtwenty to sixty years, 
                    and for a woman, if there appear any need tomake use of her 
                    in military service, let the time of service beafter she shall 
                    have brought forth children up to fifty years ofage; and let 
                    regard be had to what is possible and suitable to each.</p>

                    In the next place, dealings between man and man require to 
                    besuitably regulated. The principle of them is very simple:-Thou 
                    shaltnot, if thou canst help, touch that which is mine, or 
                    remove the leastthing which belongs to me without my consent; 
                    and may I be of asound mind, and do to others as I would that 
                    they should do to me.First, let us speak of treasure trove:-May 
                    I never pray the Gods tofind the hidden treasure, which another 
                    has laid up for himself andhis family, he not being one of 
                    my ancestors, nor lift, if I shouldfind, such a treasure. 
                    And may I never have any dealings with thosewho are called 
                    diviners, and who in any way or manner counsel me totake up 
                    the deposit entrusted to the earth, for I should not gain 
                    somuch in the increase of my possessions, if I take up the 
                    prize, as Ishould grow in justice and virtue of soul, if I 
                    abstain; and this willbe a better possession to me than the 
                    other in a better part ofmyself; for the possession of justice 
                    in the soul is preferable to thepossession of wealth. And 
                    of many things it is well said-&quot;Move not theimmovables,&quot; 
                    and this may be regarded as one of them. And we shalldo well 
                    to believe the common tradition which says that such deedsprevent 
                    a man from having a family. Now as to him who is carelessabout 
                    having children and regardless of the legislator, taking up 
                    thatwhich neither he deposited, nor any ancestor of his, without 
                    theconsent of the depositor, violating the simplest and noblest 
                    of lawswhich was the enactment of no mean man:-&quot;Take 
                    not up that which wasnot laid down by thee&quot;-of him, I 
                    say, who despises these twolegislators, and takes up, not 
                    small matter which he has notdeposited, but perhaps a great 
                    heap of treasure, what he ought tosuffer at the hands of the 
                    Gods, God only knows; but I would havethe first person who 
                    sees him go and tell the wardens of the city,if the occurrence 
                    has taken place in the city, or if the occurrencehas taken 
                    place in the agora he shall tell the wardens of the agora,or 
                    if in the country he shall tell the wardens of the country 
                    andtheir commanders. When information has been received the 
                    city shallsend to Delphi, and, whatever the God answers about 
                    the money andthe remover of the money, that the city shall 
                    do in obedience to theoracle; the informer, if he be a freeman, 
                    shall have the honour ofdoing rightly, and he who informs 
                    not, the dishonour of doing wrongly;and if he be a slave who 
                    gives information, let him be freed, as heought to be, by 
                    the state, which shall give his master the price ofhim; but 
                    if he do not inform he shall be punished with death. Nextin 
                    order shall follow a similar law, which shall apply equally 
                    tomatters great and small:-If a man happens to leave behind 
                    him somepart of his property, whether intentionally or unintentionally, 
                    lethim who may come upon the left property suffer it to remain,reflecting 
                    that such things are under the protection of the Goddess ofways, 
                    and are dedicated to her by the law. But if any one defies 
                    thelaw, and takes the property home with him, let him, if 
                    the thing is oflittle worth, and the man who takes it a slave, 
                    be beaten with manystripes by him, being a person of not less 
                    than thirty years of age.Or if he be a freeman, in addition 
                    to being thought a mean personand a despiser of the laws, 
                    let him pay ten times the value of thetreasure which he has 
                    moved to the leaver. And if some one accusesanother of having 
                    anything which belongs to him, whether little ormuch, and 
                    the other admits that he has this thing, but denies that theproperty 
                    in dispute belongs to other, if the property be registeredwith 
                    the magistrates according to law, the claimant shall summon 
                    thepossessor, who shall bring it before the magistrates; and 
                    when it isbrought into court, if it be registered in the public 
                    registers, towhich of the litigants it belonged, let him take 
                    it and go his way. Orif the property be registered as belonging 
                    to some one who is notpresent, whoever will offer sufficient 
                    surety on behalf of theabsent person that he will give it 
                    up to him, shall take it away asthe representative of the 
                    other. But if the property which isdeposited be not registered 
                    with the magistrates, let it remainuntil the time of trial 
                    with three of the eldest of the magistrates;and if it be an 
                    animal which is deposited, then he who loses thesuit shall 
                    pay the magistrates for its keep, and they shalldetermine 
                    the cause within three days.</p>
                  <p>Any one who is of sound mind may arrest his own slave, and 
                    do withhim whatever he will of such things as are lawful; 
                    and he may arrestthe runaway slave of any of his friends or 
                    kindred with a view tohis safe-keeping. And if any one takes 
                    away him who is being carriedoff as a slave, intending to 
                    liberate him, he who is carrying himoff shall let him go; 
                    but he who takes him away shall give threesufficient sureties; 
                    and if he give them, and not without giving them,he may take 
                    him away, but if he take him away after any other mannerhe 
                    shall be deemed guilty of violence, and being convicted shall 
                    payas a penalty double the amount of the damages claimed to 
                    him who hasbeen deprived of the slave. Any man may also carry 
                    off a freedman,if he do not pay respect or sufficient respect 
                    to him who freed him.Now the respect shall be, that the freedman 
                    go three times in themonth to the hearth of the person who 
                    freed him and offer to dowhatever he ought, so far as he can; 
                    and he shall agree to make such amarriage as his former master 
                    approves. He shall not be permitted tohave more property than 
                    he who gave him liberty, and what more hehas shall belong 
                    to his master. The freedman shall not remain in thestate more 
                    than twenty years, but like other foreigners shall go away,taking 
                    his entire property with him, unless he has the consent ofthe 
                    magistrates and of his former master to remain. If a freedman 
                    orany other stranger has a property greater than the census 
                    of the thirdclass, at the expiration. of thirty days from 
                    the day on which thiscomes to pass, he shall take that which 
                    is his and go his way, andin this case he shall not be allowed 
                    to remain any longer by themagistrates. And if any one disobeys 
                    this regulation, and is broughtinto court and convicted, he 
                    shall be punished with death, hisproperty shall be confiscated. 
                    Suits about these matters shall takeplace before the tribes, 
                    unless the plaintiff and defendant have gotrid of the accusation 
                    either before their neighbours or beforejudges chosen by them. 
                    If a man lay claim to any animal or anythingelse which he 
                    declares to be his, let the possessor refer to theseller or 
                    to some honest and trustworthy person, who has given, orin 
                    some legitimate way made over the property to him; if he be 
                    acitizen or a metic, sojourning in the city, within thirty 
                    days, or, ifthe property have been delivered to him by a stranger, 
                    within fivemonths, of which the middle month shall include 
                    the summer solstice.When goods are exchanged by selling and 
                    buying, a man shall deliverthem, and receive the price of 
                    them, at a fixed place in the agora,and have done with the 
                    matter; but he shall not buy or sell anywhereelse, nor give 
                    credit. And if in any other manner or in any otherplace there 
                    be an exchange of one thing for another, and the sellergive 
                    credit to the man who buys fram him, he must do this on theunderstanding 
                    that the law gives no protection in cases of things soldnot 
                    in accordance with these regulations. Again, as tocontributions, 
                    any man who likes may go about collecting contributionsas 
                    a friend among friends, but if any difference arises about 
                    thecollection, he is to act on the understanding that the 
                    law gives noprotection in such cases. He who sells anything 
                    above the value offifty drachmas shall be required to remain 
                    in the city for ten days,and the purchaser shall be informed 
                    of the house of the seller, with aview to the sort of charges 
                    which are apt to arise in such cases,and the restitutions 
                    which the law allows. And let legal restitutionbe on this 
                    wise:-If a man sells a slave who is in a consumption, orwho 
                    has the disease of the stone, or of strangury, or epilepsy, 
                    orsome other tedious and incurable disorder of body or mind, 
                    which isnot discernible to the ordinary man, if the purchaser 
                    be a physicianor trainer, he shall have no right of restitution; 
                    nor shall therebe any right of restitution if the seller has 
                    told the truthbeforehand to the buyer. But if a skilled person 
                    sells to anotherwho is not skilled, let the buyer appeal for 
                    restitution within sixmonths, except in the case of epilepsy, 
                    and then the appeal may bemade within a year. The cause shall 
                    be determined by such physiciansas the parties may agree to 
                    choose; and the defendant, if he losethe suit, shall pay double 
                    the price at which he sold. If a privateperson sell to another 
                    private person, he shall have the right ofrestitution, and 
                    the decision shall be given as before, but thedefendant, if 
                    he be cast, shall only pay back the price of theslave. If 
                    a person sells a homicide to another, and they both knowof 
                    the fact, let there be no restitution in such a case, but 
                    if hedo not know of the fact, there shall be a right of restitution,whenever 
                    the buyer makes the discovery; and the decision shall restwith 
                    the five youngest guardians of the law, and if the decision 
                    bethat the seller was cognisant the fact, he shall purify 
                    the house ofthe purchaser, according to the law of the interpreters, 
                    and shall payback three times the purchase-money.</p>
                  <p>If man exchanges either money for money, or anything whatever 
                    foranything else, either with or without life, let him give 
                    and receivethem genuine and unadulterated, in accordance with 
                    the law. And let ushave a prelude about all this sort of roguery, 
                    like the preludes ofour other laws. Every man should regard 
                    adulteration as of one and thesame class with falsehood and 
                    deceit, concerning which the many aretoo fond of saying that 
                    at proper times and places the practice mayoften be right. 
                    But they leave the occasion, and the when, and thewhere, undefined 
                    and unsettled, and from this want of definitenessin their 
                    language they do a great deal of harm to themselves and toothers. 
                    Now a legislator ought not to leave the matter undetermined;he 
                    ought to prescribe some limit, either greater or less. Let 
                    thisbe the rule prescribed:-No one shall call the Gods to 
                    witness, when hesays or does anything false or deceitful or 
                    dishonest, unless he wouldbe the most hateful of mankind to 
                    them. And he is most hateful to themtakes a false oath, and 
                    pays no heed to the Gods; and in the nextdegree, he who tells 
                    a falsehood in the presence of his superiors. Nowbetter men 
                    are the superiors of worse men, and in general elders arethe 
                    superiors of the young; wherefore also parents are the superiorsof 
                    their off spring, and men of women and children, and rulers 
                    oftheir subjects; for all men ought to reverence any one who 
                    is in anyposition of authority, and especially those who are 
                    in stateoffices. And this is the reason why I have spoken 
                    of these matters.For every one who is guilty of adulteration 
                    in the agora tells afalsehood, and deceives, and when he invokes 
                    the Gods, according tothe customs and cautions of the wardens 
                    of the agora, he does butswear without any respect for God 
                    or man. Certainly, it is anexcellent rule not lightly to defile 
                    the names of the Gods, afterthe fashion of men in general, 
                    who care little about piety andpurity in their religious actions. 
                    But if a man will not conform tothis rule, let the law be 
                    as follows:-He who sells anything in theagora shall not ask 
                    two prices for that which he sells, but he shallask one price, 
                    and if he do not obtain this, he shall take away hisgoods; 
                    and on that day he shall not value them either at more or 
                    less;and there shall be no praising of any goods, or oath 
                    taken about them.If a person disobeys this command, any citizen 
                    who is present, notbeing less than thirty years of age, may 
                    with impunity chastise andbeat the swearer, but if instead 
                    of obeying the laws he takes no heed,he shall be liable to 
                    the charge of having betrayed them. If a mansells any adulterated 
                    goods and will not obey these regulations, hewho knows and 
                    can prove the fact, and does prove it in the presence ofthe 
                    magistrates, if he be a slave or a metic, shall have theadulterated 
                    goods; but if he be a citizen, and do not pursue thecharge, 
                    he shall be called a rogue, and deemed to have robbed the 
                    Godsof the agora; or if he proves the charge, he shall dedicate 
                    thegoods to the Gods of the agora. He who is proved to have 
                    sold anyadulterated goods, in addition to losing the goods 
                    themselves, shallbe beaten with stripes-a stripe for a drachma, 
                    according to theprice of the goods; and the herald shall proclaim 
                    in the agora theoffence for which he is going to be beaten. 
                    The warden of the agoraand the guardians of the law shall 
                    obtain information from experiencedpersons about the rogueries 
                    and adulterations of the sellers, andshall write up what the 
                    seller ought and ought not to do in each case;and let them 
                    inscribe their laws on a column in front of the courtof the 
                    wardens of the agora, that they may be clear instructors ofthose 
                    who have business in the agora. Enough has been said in what 
                    haspreceded about the wardens of the city, and if anything 
                    seems to bewanting, let them communicate with the guardians 
                    of the law, and writedown the omission, and place on a column 
                    in the court of the wardensof the city the primary and secondary 
                    regulations which are laiddown for them about their office.</p>
                  <p>After the practices of adulteration naturally follow the 
                    practicesof retail trade. Concerning these, we will first 
                    of all give a word ofcounsel and reason, and the law shall 
                    come afterwards. Retail trade ina city is not by nature intended 
                    to do any harm, but quite thecontrary; for is not he a benefactor 
                    who reduces the inequalitiesand incommensurabilities of goods 
                    to equality and common measure?And this is what the power 
                    of money accomplishes, and the merchant maybe said to be appointed 
                    for this purpose. The hireling and thetavern-keeper, and many 
                    other occupations, some of them more andothers less seemly-alike 
                    have this object;-they seek to satisfy ourneeds and equalize 
                    our possessions. Let us then endeavour to seewhat has brought 
                    retail trade into ill-odour, and wherein, lies thedishonour 
                    and unseemliness of it, in order that if not entirely, wemay 
                    yet partially, cure the evil by legislation. To effect this 
                    isno easy matter, and requires a great deal of virtue.</p>
                  <p>Cleinias. What do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Athenian Stranger. Dear Cleinias, the class of men is small-theymust 
                    have been rarely gifted by nature, and trained byeducation-who, 
                    when assailed by wants and desires, are able to holdout and 
                    observe moderation, and when they might make a great deal 
                    ofmoney are sober in their wishes, and prefer a moderate to 
                    a largegain. But the mass of mankind are the very opposite: 
                    their desires areunbounded, and when they might gain in moderation 
                    they prefer gainswithout limit; wherefore all that relates 
                    to retail trade, andmerchandise, and the keeping of taverns, 
                    is denounced and numberedamong dishonourable things. For if 
                    what I trust may never be andwill not be, we were to compel, 
                    if I may venture to say a ridiculousthing, the best men everywhere 
                    to keep taverns for a time, or carry onretail trade, or do 
                    anything of that sort; or if, in consequence ofsome fate or 
                    necessity, the best women were compelled to followsimilar 
                    callings, then we should know how agreeable and pleasant allthese 
                    things are; and if all such occupations were managed onincorrupt 
                    principles, they would be honoured as we honour a motheror 
                    a nurse. But now that a man goes to desert places and builds 
                    bouseswhich can only be reached be long journeys, for the 
                    sake of retailtrade, and receives strangers who are in need 
                    at the welcomeresting-place, and gives them peace and calm 
                    when they are tossed bythe storm, or cool shade in the heat; 
                    and then instead of behavingto them as friends, and showing 
                    the duties of hospitality to hisguests, treats them as enemies 
                    and captives who are at his mercy,and will not release them 
                    until they have paid the most unjust,abominable, and extortionate 
                    ransom-these are the sort of practices,and foul evils they 
                    are, which cast a reproach upon the succour ofadversity. And 
                    the legislator ought always to be devising a remedy forevils 
                    of this nature. There is an ancient saying, which is also 
                    a trueone-&quot;To fight against two opponents is a difficult 
                    thing,&quot; as isseen in diseases and in many other cases. 
                    And in this case also thewar is against two enemies-wealth 
                    and poverty; one of whom corruptsthe soul of man with luxury, 
                    while the other drives him by pain intoutter shamelessness. 
                    What remedy can a city of sense find against thisdisease? 
                    In the first place, they must have as few retail traders aspossible; 
                    and in the second place, they must assign the occupationto 
                    that class of men whose corruption will be the least injury 
                    tothe state; and in the third place, they must devise some 
                    way wherebythe followers of these occupations themselves will 
                    not readily fallinto habits of unbridled shamelessness and 
                    meanness.</p>
                  <p>After this preface let our law run as follows, and may fortunefavour 
                    us:-No landowner among the Magnetes, whose city the God isrestoring 
                    and resettling-no one, that is, of the 5040 families,shall 
                    become a retail trader either voluntarily or involuntarily;neither 
                    shall he be a merchant, or do any service for privatepersons 
                    unless they equally serve him, except for his father or hismother, 
                    and their fathers and mothers; and in general for his elderswho 
                    are freemen, and whom he serves as a freeman. Now it isdifficult 
                    to determine accurately the things which are worthy orunworthy 
                    of a freeman, but let those who have obtained the prize ofvirtue 
                    give judgment about them in accordance with their feelings 
                    ofright and wrong. He who in any way shares in the illiberality 
                    ofretail trades may be indicted for dishonouring his race 
                    by any one wholikes, before those who have been judged to 
                    be the first in virtue;and if he appear to throw dirt upon 
                    his father's house by anunworthy occupation, let him be imprisoned 
                    for a year and abstain fromthat sort of thing; and if he repeat 
                    the offence, for two years; andevery time that he is convicted 
                    let the length of his imprisonmentbe doubled. This shall be 
                    the second law:-He who engages in retailtrade must be either 
                    a metic or a stranger. And a third law shallbe:-In order that 
                    the retail trader who dwells in our city may be asgood or 
                    as little bad as possible, the guardians of the law shallremember 
                    that they are not only guardians of those who may be easilywatched 
                    and prevented from becoming lawless or bad, because they arewellborn 
                    and bred; but still more should they have a watch overthose 
                    who are of another sort, and follow pursuits which have a 
                    verystrong tendency to make men bad. And, therefore, in respect 
                    of themultifarious occupations of retail trade, that is to 
                    say, in respectof such of them as are allowed to remain, because 
                    they seem to bequite necessary in a state-about these the 
                    guardians of the law shouldmeet and take counsel with those 
                    who have experience of the severalkinds of retail trade, as 
                    we before commanded, concerning adulteration(which is a matter 
                    akin to this), and when they meet they shallconsider what 
                    amount of receipts, after deducting expenses, willproduce 
                    a moderate gain to the retail trades, and they shall fix inwriting 
                    and strictly maintain what they find to be the rightpercentage 
                    of profit; this shall be seen to by the wardens of theagora, 
                    and by the wardens of the city, and by the wardens of thecountry. 
                    And so retail trade will benefit every one, and do theleast 
                    possible injury to those in the state who practise it.</p>
                  <p>When a man makes an agreement which he does not fulfil, unless 
                    theagreement be of a nature which the law or a vote of the 
                    assemblydoes not allow, or which he has made under the influence 
                    of someunjust compulsion, or which he is prevented from fulfilling 
                    againsthis will by some unexpected chance, the other party 
                    may go to law withhim in the courts of the tribes, for not 
                    having completed hisagreement, if the parties are not able 
                    previously to come to termsbefore arbiters or before their 
                    neighbours. The class of craftsmen whohave furnished human 
                    life with the arts is dedicated to Hephaestus andAthene; and 
                    there is a class of craftsmen who preserve the works ofall 
                    craftsmen by arts of defence, the votaries of Ares and Athene,to 
                    which divinities they too are rightly dedicated. All these 
                    continuethrough life serving the country and the people; some 
                    of them areleaders in battle; others make for hire implements 
                    and works, and theyought not to deceive in such matters, out 
                    of respect to the Gods whoare their ancestors. If any craftsman 
                    through indolence omit toexecute his work in a given time, 
                    not reverencing the God who giveshim the means of life, but 
                    considering, foolish fellow, that he is hisown God and will 
                    let him off easily, in the first place, he shallsuffer at 
                    the hands of the God, and in the second place, the law shallfollow 
                    in a similar spirit. He shall owe to him who contracted withhim 
                    the price of the works which he has failed in performing, 
                    and heshall begin again and execute them gratis in the given 
                    time. When aman undertakes a work, the law gives him the same 
                    advice which wasgiven to the seller, that he should not attempt 
                    to raise the price,but simply ask the value; this the law 
                    enjoins also on the contractor;for the craftsman assuredly 
                    knows the value of his work. Wherefore, infree states the 
                    man of art ought not to attempt to impose upon privateindividuals 
                    by the help of his art, which is by nature a true thing;and 
                    he who is wronged in a matter of this sort, shall have a rightof 
                    action against the party who has wronged him. And if any one 
                    letsout work to a craftsman, and does not pay him duly according 
                    to thelawful agreement, disregarding Zeus the guardian of 
                    the city andAthene, who are the partners of the state, and 
                    overthrows thefoundations of society for the sake of a little 
                    gain, in his caselet the law and the Gods maintain the common 
                    bonds of the state. Andlet him who, having already received 
                    the work in exchange, does notpay the price in the time agreed, 
                    pay double the price; and if ayear has elapsed, although interest 
                    is not to be taken on loans, yetfor every drachma which he 
                    owes to the contractor let him pay amonthly interest of an 
                    obol. Suits about these matters are to bedecided by the courts 
                    of the tribes; and by the way, since we havementioned craftsmen 
                    at all, we must not forget the other craft of war,in which 
                    generals and tacticians are the craftsmen, who undertakevoluntarily 
                    the work of our safety, as other craftsmen undertake otherpublic 
                    works;-if they execute their work well the law will nevertire 
                    of praising him who gives them those honours which are the 
                    justrewards of the soldier; but if any one, having already 
                    received thebenefit of any noble service in war, does not 
                    make the due return ofhonour, the law will blame him. Let 
                    this then be the law, having aningredient of praise, not compelling 
                    but advising the great body ofthe citizens to honour the brave 
                    men who are the saviours of the wholestate, whether by their 
                    courage or by their military skill;-theyshould honour them, 
                    I say, in the second place; for the first andhighest tribute 
                    of respect is to be given to those who are ableabove other 
                    men to honour the words of good legislators.</p>
                  <p>The greater part of the dealings between man and man have 
                    been nowregulated by us with the exception of those that relate 
                    to orphans andthe supervision of orphans by their guardians. 
                    These follow next inorder, and must be regulated in some way. 
                    But to arrive at them wemust begin with the testamentary wishes 
                    of the dying and the case ofthose who may have happened to 
                    die intestate. When I said, Cleinias,that we must regulate 
                    them, I had in my mind the difficulty andperplexity in which 
                    all such matters are involved. You cannot leavethem unregulated, 
                    for individuals would make regulations at variancewith one 
                    another, and repugnant to the laws and habits of the livingand 
                    to their own previous habits, if a person were simply allowed 
                    tomake any will which he pleased, and this were to take effect 
                    inwhatever state he may have been at the end of his life; 
                    for most of uslose our senses in a manner, and feel crushed 
                    when we think that weare about to die.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What do you mean, Stranger?</p>
                  <p>Ath. O Cleinias, a man when he is about to die is an intractablecreature, 
                    and is apt to use language which causes a great deal ofanxiety 
                    and trouble to the legislator.</p>
                  <p>Cle. In what way?</p>
                  <p>Ath. He wants to have the entire control of all his property, 
                    andwill use angry words.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Such as what?</p>
                  <p>Ath. O ye Gods, he will say, how monstrous that I am not 
                    allowedto give, or not to give my own to whom I will-less 
                    to him who has beenbad to me, and more to him who has been 
                    good to me, and whosebadness and goodness have been tested 
                    by me in time of sickness orin old age and in every other 
                    sort of fortune!</p>
                  <p>Cle. Well Stranger, and may he not very fairly say so?</p>
                  <p>Ath. In my opinion, Cleinias, the ancient legislators were 
                    toogood-natured, and made laws without sufficient observation 
                    orconsideration of human things.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I mean, my friend that they were afraid of the testator'sreproaches, 
                    and so they passed a law to the effect that a man shouldbe 
                    allowed to dispose of his property in all respects as he liked; 
                    butyou and I, if I am not mistaken, will have something better 
                    to sayto our departing citizens.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What?</p>
                  <p>Ath. O my friends, we will say to them, hard is it for you, 
                    whoare creatures of a day, to know what is yours-hard too, 
                    as the Delphicoracle says, to know yourselves at this hour. 
                    Now I, as thelegislator, regard you and your possessions, 
                    not as belonging toyourselves, but as belonging to your whole 
                    family, both past andfuture, and yet more do regard both family 
                    and possessions asbelonging to the state; wherefore, if some 
                    one steals upon you withflattery, when you are tossed on the 
                    sea of disease or old age, andpersuades you to dispose of 
                    your property in a way that is not for thebest, I will not, 
                    if I can help, allow this; but I will legislate witha view 
                    to the whole, considering what is best both for the state 
                    andfor the family, esteeming as I ought the feelings of an 
                    individualat a lower rate; and I hope that you will depart 
                    in peace and kindnesstowards us, as you are going the way 
                    of all mankind; and we willimpartially take care of all your 
                    concerns, not neglecting any ofthem, if we can possibly help. 
                    Let this be our prelude and consolationto the living and dying, 
                    Cleinias, and let the law be as follows:</p>
                  <p>He who makes a disposition in a testament, if he be the father 
                    ofa family, shall first of all inscribe as his heir any one 
                    of hissons whom he may think fit; and if he gives any of his 
                    children tobe adopted by another citizen, let the adoption 
                    be inscribed. And ifhe has a son remaining over and above 
                    who has not been adopted uponany lot, and who may be expected 
                    to be sent out to a colonyaccording to law, to him his father 
                    may give as much as he pleasesof the rest of his property, 
                    with the exception of the paternal lotand the fixtures on 
                    the lot. And if there are other sons, let himdistribute among 
                    them what there is more than the lot in such portionsas he 
                    pleases. And if one of the sons has already a house of hisown, 
                    he shall not give him of the money, nor shall he give money 
                    toa daughter who has been betrothed, but if she is not betrothed 
                    hemay give her money. And if any of the sons or daughters 
                    shall be foundto have another lot of land in the country, 
                    which has accrued afterthe testament has been made, they shall 
                    leave the lot which theyhave inherited to the heir of the 
                    man who has made the will. If thetestator has no sons, but 
                    only daughters, let him choose the husbandof any one of his 
                    daughters whom he pleases, and leave and inscribehim as his 
                    son and heir. And if a man have lost his son, when he was 
                    achild, and before he could be reckoned among grown-up men, 
                    whether hisown or an adopted son, let the testator make mention 
                    of thecircumstance and inscribe whom he will to be his second 
                    son in hope ofbetter fortune. If the testator has no children 
                    at all, he mayselect and give to any one whom he pleases the 
                    tenth part of theproperty which he has acquired; but let him 
                    not be blamed if hegives all the rest to his adopted son, 
                    and makes a friend of himaccording to the law. If the sons 
                    of a man require guardians, and: thefather when he dies leaves 
                    a will appointing guardians, those havebeen named by him, 
                    whoever they are and whatever their number be, ifthey are 
                    able and willing to take charge of the children, shall berecognized 
                    according to the provisions of the will. But if he dies andhas 
                    made no will, or a will in which he has appointed no guardians,then 
                    the next of kin, two on the father's and two on the mother'sside, 
                    and one of the friends of the deceased, shall have the authorityof 
                    guardians, whom the guardians of the law shall appoint when 
                    theorphans require guardians. And the fifteen eldest guardians 
                    of the lawshall have the whole care and charge of the orphans, 
                    divided intothrees according to seniority-a body of three 
                    for one year, and thenanother body of three for the next year, 
                    until the cycle of the fiveperiods is complete; and this, 
                    as far as possible, is to continuealways. If a man dies, having 
                    made no will at all, and leaves sons whorequire the care of 
                    guardians, they shall share in the protectionwhich is afforded 
                    by these laws.</p>
                  <p>And if a man dying by some unexpected fate leaves daughters 
                    behindhim, let him pardon the legislator if he gives them 
                    in marriage, hehave a regard only to two out of three conditions-nearness 
                    of kinand the preservation of the lot, and omits the third 
                    condition,which a father would naturally consider, for he 
                    would choose out ofall the citizens a son for himself, and 
                    a husband for his daughter,with a view to his character and 
                    disposition-the father, say, shallforgive the legislator if 
                    he disregards this, which to him is animpossible consideration. 
                    Let the law about these matters wherepracticable be as follows:-If 
                    a man dies without making a will, andleaves behind him daughters, 
                    let his brother, being the son of thesame father or of the 
                    same mother, having no lot, marry the daughterand have the 
                    lot of the dead man. And if he have no brother, butonly a 
                    brother's son, in like manner let them marry, if they be of 
                    asuitable age; and if there be not even a brother's son, but 
                    only theson of a sister, let them do likewise, and so in the 
                    fourth degree, ifthere be only the testator's father's brother, 
                    or in the fifth degree,his father's brother's son, or in the 
                    sixth degree, the child of hisfather's sister. Let kindred 
                    be always reckoned in this way: if aperson leaves daughters 
                    the relationship shall proceed upwards throughbrothers and 
                    sisters, and brothers' and sisters' children, and firstthe 
                    males shall come, and after them the females in the same family.The 
                    judge shall consider and determine the suitableness orunsuitableness 
                    of age in marriage; he shall make an inspection ofthe males 
                    naked, and of the women naked down to the navel. And ifthere 
                    be a lack of kinsmen in a family extending to grandchildren 
                    of abrother, or to the grandchildren of a grandfather's children, 
                    themaiden may choose with the consent of her guardians any 
                    one of thecitizens who is willing and whom she wills, and 
                    he shall be the heirof the dead man, and the husband of his 
                    daughter. Circumstancesvary, and there may sometimes be a 
                    still greater lack of relationswithin the limits of the state; 
                    and if any maiden has no kindredliving in the city, and there 
                    is some one who has been sent out to acolony, and she is disposed 
                    to make him the heir of her father'spossessions, if he be 
                    indeed of her kindred, let him proceed to takethe lot according 
                    to the regulation of the law; but if he be not ofher kindred, 
                    she having no kinsmen within the city, and he be chosenby 
                    the daughter of the dead man, and empowered to marry by theguardians, 
                    let him return home and take the lot of him who diedintestate. 
                    And if a man has no children, either male or female, anddies 
                    without making a will, let the previous law in general hold;and 
                    let a man and a woman go forth from the family and share thedeserted 
                    house, and let the lot belong absolutely to them; and let 
                    theheiress in the first degree be a sister, and in a second 
                    degree adaughter of a brother, and in the third, a daughter 
                    of a sister, inthe fourth degree the sister of a father, and 
                    in the fifth degreethe daughter of a father's brother, and 
                    in a sixth degree of afather's sister; and these shall dwell 
                    with their male kinsmen,according to the degree of relationship 
                    and right, as we enactedbefore. Now we must not conceal from 
                    ourselves that such laws areapt to be oppressive and that 
                    there may sometimes be a hardship in thelawgiver commanding 
                    the kinsman of the dead man to marry his relation;be may be 
                    thought not to have considered the innumerable hindranceswhich 
                    may arise among men in the execution of such ordinances; forthere 
                    may be cases in which the parties refuse to obey, and areready 
                    to do anything rather than marry, when there is some bodily 
                    ormental malady or defect among those who are bidden to marry 
                    or bemarried. Persons may fancy that the legislator never 
                    thought ofthis, but they are mistaken; wherefore let us make 
                    a common prelude onbehalf of the lawgiver and of his subjects, 
                    the law begging the latterto forgive the legislator, in that 
                    he, having to take care of thecommon weal, cannot order at 
                    the same time the various circumstancesof individuals, and 
                    begging him to pardon them if naturally they aresometimes 
                    unable to fulfil the act which he in his ignorance imposesupon 
                    them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. And how, Stranger, can we act most fairly under thecircumstances?</p>
                  <p>Ath. There must be arbiters chosen to deal with such laws 
                    and thesubjects of them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I mean to say, that a case may occur in which the nephew,having 
                    a rich father, will be unwilling to marry the daughter of 
                    hisuncle; he will have a feeling of pride, and he will wish 
                    to lookhigher. And there are cases in which the legislator 
                    will be imposingupon him the greatest calamity, and he will 
                    be compelled to disobeythe law, if he is required, for example, 
                    to take a wife who is mad, orhas some other terrible malady 
                    of soul or body, such as makes lifeintolerable to the sufferer. 
                    Then let what we are saying concerningthese cases be embodied 
                    in a law:-If any one finds fault with theestablished laws 
                    respecting testaments, both as to other matters andespecially 
                    in what relates to marriage, and asserts that thelegislator, 
                    if he were alive and present, would not compel him toobey-that 
                    is to say, would not compel those who are by our lawrequired 
                    to marry or be given in marriage, to do either-and somekinsman 
                    or guardian dispute this, the reply is that the legislatorleft 
                    fifteen of the guardians of the law to be arbiters and fathers 
                    oforphans, male or female, and to them let the disputants 
                    have recourse,and by their aid determine any matters of the 
                    kind, admitting theirdecision to be final. But if any one 
                    thinks that too great power isthus given to the guardians 
                    of the law, let him bring hisadversaries into the court of 
                    the select judges, and there have thepoints in dispute determined. 
                    And he who loses the cause shall havecensure and blame from 
                    the legislator, which, by a man of sense, isfelt to be a penalty 
                    far heavier than a great loss of money.</p>
                  <p>Thus will orphan children have a second birth. After their 
                    firstbirth we spoke of their nurture and education, and after 
                    theirsecond birth, when they have lost their parents, we ought 
                    to takemeasures that the misfortune of orphanhood may be as 
                    little sad tothem as possible. In the first place, we say 
                    that the guardians of thelaw are lawgivers and fathers to 
                    them, not inferior to their naturalfathers. Moreover, they 
                    shall take charge of them year by year as oftheir own kindred; 
                    and we have given both to them and to thechildren's own guardians 
                    a suitable admonition concerning thenurture of orphans. And 
                    we seem to have spoken opportunely in ourformer discourse, 
                    when we said that the souls of the dead have thepower after 
                    death of taking an interest in human affairs, aboutwhich there 
                    are many tales and traditions, long indeed, but true;and seeing 
                    that they are so many and so ancient, we must believe them,and 
                    we must also believe the lawgivers, who tell us that thesethings 
                    are true, if they are not to be regarded as utter fools. But 
                    ifthese things are really so, in the first place men should 
                    have afear of the Gods above, who regard the loneliness of 
                    the orphans;and in the second place of the souls of the departed, 
                    who by natureincline to take an especial care of their own 
                    children, and arefriendly to those who honour, and unfriendly 
                    to those who dishonourthem. Men should also fear the souls 
                    of the living who are aged andhigh in honour; wherever a city 
                    is well ordered and prosperous,their descendants cherish them, 
                    and so live happily; old persons arequick to see and hear 
                    all that relates to them, and are propitiousto those who are 
                    just in the fulfilment of such duties, and theypunish those 
                    who wrong the orphan and the desolate, considering thatthey 
                    are the greatest and most sacred of trusts. To all whichmatters 
                    the guardian and magistrate ought to apply his mind, if he 
                    hasany, and take heed of the nurture and education of the 
                    orphans,seeking in every possible way to do them good, for 
                    he is making acontribution to his own good and that of his 
                    children. He who obeysthe tale which precedes the law, and 
                    does no wrong to an orphan,will never experience the wrath 
                    of the legislator. But he who isdisobedient, and wrongs any 
                    one who is bereft of father or mother,shall pay twice the 
                    penalty which he would have paid if he had wrongedone whose 
                    parents had been alive. As touching other legislationconcerning 
                    guardians in their relation to orphans, or concerningmagistrates 
                    and their superintendence of the guardians, if they didnot 
                    possess examples of the manner in which children of freemen 
                    shouldbe brought up in the bringing up of their own children, 
                    and of thecare of their property in the care of their own, 
                    or if they had notjust laws fairly stated about these very 
                    things-there would havebeen reason in making laws for them, 
                    under the idea that they were apeculiar-class, and we might 
                    distinguish and make separate rules forthe life of those who 
                    are orphans and of those who are not orphans.But as the case 
                    stands, the condition of orphans with us not differentfrom 
                    the case of those who have father, though in regard to honour 
                    anddishonour, and the attention given to them, the two are 
                    not usuallyplaced upon a level. Wherefore, touching the legislation 
                    aboutorphans, the law speaks in serious accents, both of persuasion 
                    andthreatening, and such a threat as the following will be 
                    by no meansout of place:-He who is the guardian of an orphan 
                    of either sex, andhe among the guardians of the law to whom 
                    the superintendence ofthis guardian has been assigned, shall 
                    love the unfortunate orphanas though he were his own child, 
                    and he shall be as careful anddiligent in the management of 
                    his possessions as he would be if theywere his own, or even 
                    more careful and dilligent. Let every one whohas the care 
                    of an orphan observe this law. But any one who actscontrary 
                    to the law on these matters, if he be a guardian of thechild, 
                    may be fined by a magistrate, or, if he be himself amagistrate, 
                    the guardian may bring him before the court of selectjudges, 
                    and punish him, if convicted, by exacting a fine of double 
                    theamount of that inflicted by the court. And if a guardian 
                    appears tothe relations of the orphan, or to any other citizen, 
                    to actnegligently or dishonestly, let them bring him before 
                    the samecourt, and whatever damages are given against him, 
                    let him payfourfold, and let half belong to the orphan and 
                    half to him whoprocured the conviction. If any orphan arrives 
                    at years of discretion,and thinks that he has been ill-used 
                    by his guardians, let himwithin five years of the expiration 
                    of the guardianship be allowedto bring them to trial; and 
                    if any of them be convicted, the courtshall determine what 
                    he shall pay or suffer. And if magistrate shallappear to have 
                    wronged the orphan by neglect, and he be convicted, letthe 
                    court determine what he shall suffer or pay to the orphan, 
                    andif there be dishonesty in addition to neglect, besides 
                    paying thefine, let him be deposed from his office of guardian 
                    of the law, andlet the state appoint another guardian of the 
                    law for the city and forthe country in his room.</p>
                  <p>Greater differences than there ought to be sometimes arise 
                    betweenfathers and sons, on the part either of fathers who 
                    will be of opinionthat the legislator should enact that they 
                    may, if they wish, lawfullyrenounce their son by the proclamation 
                    of a herald in the face ofthe world, or of sons who think 
                    that they should be allowed toindict their fathers on the 
                    charge of imbecility when they aredisabled by disease or old 
                    age. These things only happen, as amatter of fact, where the 
                    natures of men are utterly bad; for whereonly half is bad, 
                    as, for example, if the father be not bad, but theson be bad, 
                    or conversely, no great calamity is the result of suchan amount 
                    of hatred as this. In another state, a son disowned by hisfather 
                    would not of necessity cease to be a citizen, but in our state,of 
                    which these are to be the laws, the disinherited must necessarilyemigrate 
                    into another country, for no addition can be made even of 
                    asingle family to the 5040 households; and, therefore, he 
                    whodeserves to suffer these things must be renounced not only 
                    by hisfather, who is a single person, but by the whole family, 
                    and what isdone in these cases must be regulated by some such 
                    law as thefollowing:-He who in the sad disorder of his soul 
                    has a mind, justlyor unjustly, to expel from his family a 
                    son whom he has begotten andbrought up, shall not lightly 
                    or at once execute his purpose; butfirst of all he shall collect 
                    together his own kinsmen extending tocousins, and in like 
                    manner his son's kinsmen by the mother's side,and in their 
                    presence he shall accuse his son, setting forth that hedeserves 
                    at the hands of them all to be dismissed from the family; 
                    andthe son shall be allowed to address them in a similar manner, 
                    and showthat he does not deserve to suffer any of these things. 
                    And if thefather persuades them, and obtains the suffrages 
                    of more than halfof his kindred, exclusive of the father and 
                    mother and the offenderhimself-I say, if he obtains more than 
                    half the suffrages of all theother grown-up members of the 
                    family, of both sexes, the fathershall be permitted to put 
                    away his son, but not otherwise. And ifany other citizen is 
                    willing to adopt the son who is put away, nolaw shall hinder 
                    him; for the characters of young men are subject tomany changes 
                    in the course of their lives. And if he has been putaway, 
                    and in a period of ten years no one is willing to adopt him, 
                    letthose who have the care of the superabundant population 
                    which issent out into colonies, see to him, in order that 
                    he may be suitablyprovided for in the colony. And if disease 
                    or age or harshness oftemper, or all these together, makes 
                    a man to be more out of hismind than the rest of the world 
                    are-but this is not observable, exceptto those who live with 
                    him-and he, being master of his property, isthe ruin of the 
                    house, and his son doubts and hesitates aboutindicting his 
                    father for insanity, let the law in that case or, thathe shall 
                    first of all go to the eldest guardians of the law and tellthem 
                    of his father's misfortune, and they shall duly look into 
                    thematter, and take counsel as to whether he shall indict 
                    him or not. Andif they advise him to proceed, they shall be 
                    both his witnesses andhis advocates; and if the father is 
                    cast, he shall henceforth beincapable of ordering the least 
                    particular of his life; let him beas a child dwelling in the 
                    house for the remainder of his days. And ifa man and his wife 
                    have an unfortunate incompatibility of temper,ten of the guardians 
                    of the law, who are impartial, and ten of thewomen who regulate 
                    marriages, shall look to the matter, and if theyare able to 
                    reconcile them they shall be formally reconciled; but iftheir 
                    souls are too much tossed with passion, they shall endeavourto 
                    find other partners. Now they are not likely to have very 
                    gentletempers; and, therefore, we must endeavour to associate 
                    with themdeeper and softer natures. Those who have no children, 
                    or only afew, at the time of their separation, should choose 
                    their new partnerswith a view to the procreation of children; 
                    but those who have asufficient number of children should separate 
                    and marry again in orderthat they may have some one to grow 
                    old with and that the pair maytake care of one another in 
                    age. If a woman dies, leaving children,male or female, the 
                    law will advise rather than compel the husbandto bring up 
                    the children without introducing into the house astepmother. 
                    But if he have no children, then he shall be compelledto marry 
                    until he has begotten a sufficient number of sons to hisfamily 
                    and to the state. And if a man dies leaving a sufficient numberof 
                    children, the mother of his children shall remain with them 
                    andbring, them up. But if she appears to be too young to livevirtuously 
                    without a husband, let her relations communicate with thewomen 
                    who superintend marriage, and let both together do what theythink 
                    best in these matters; if there is a lack of children, let 
                    thechoice be made with a view to having them; two children, 
                    one of eithersex, shall be deemed sufficient in the eye of 
                    the law. When a child isadmitted to be the offspring of certain 
                    parents and is acknowledged bythem, but there is need of a 
                    decision as to which parent the childis to follow-in case 
                    a female slave have intercourse with a maleslave, or with 
                    a freeman or freedman, the offspring shall alwaysbelong to 
                    the master of the female slave. Again, if a free womanhave 
                    intercourse with a male slave, the offspring shall belong 
                    tothe master of the slave; but if a child be born either of 
                    a slave byher master, or of his mistress by a slave-and this 
                    be provenceoffspring of the woman and its father shall be 
                    sent away by thewomen who superintend marriage into another 
                    country, and the guardiansof the law shall send away the offspring 
                    of the man and its mother.</p>
                  <p>Neither God, nor a man who has understanding, will ever advise 
                    anyone to neglect his parents. To a discourse concerning the 
                    honour anddishonour of parents, a prelude such as the following, 
                    about theservice of the Gods, will be a suitable introduction:-There 
                    areancient customs about the Gods which are universal, and 
                    they are oftwo kinds: some of the Gods we see with our eyes 
                    and we honour them,of others we honour the images, raising 
                    statues of them which weadore; and though they are lifeless, 
                    yet we imagine that the livingGods have a good will and gratitude 
                    to us on this account. Now, if aman has a father or mother, 
                    or their fathers or mothers treasured upin his house stricken 
                    in years, let him consider that no statue can bemore potent 
                    to grant his requests than they are, who are sitting athis 
                    hearth if only he knows how to show true service to them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. And what do you call the true mode of service?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I will tell you, O my friend, for such things are worthlistening 
                    to.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Proceed.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Oedipus, as tradition says, when dishonoured by his 
                    sons,invoked on them curses which every one declares to have 
                    been heard andratified by the Gods, and Amyntor in his wrath 
                    invoked curses on hisson Phoenix, and Theseus upon Hippolytus, 
                    and innumerable othershave also called down wrath upon their 
                    children, whence it is clearthat the Gods listen to the imprecations 
                    of parents; for the curses ofparents are, as they ought to 
                    be, mighty against their children asno others are. And shall 
                    we suppose that the prayers of a father ormother who is specially 
                    dishonoured by his or her children, areheard by the Gods in 
                    accordance with nature; and that if a parent ishonoured by 
                    them, and in the gladness of his heart earnestlyentreats the 
                    Gods in his prayers to do them good, he is not equallyheard, 
                    and that they do not minister to his request? If not, theywould 
                    be very unjust ministers of good, and that we affirm to becontrary 
                    to their nature.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. May we not think, as I was saying just now, that we 
                    can possessno image which is more honoured by the Gods, than 
                    that of a fatheror grandfather, or of a mother stricken in 
                    years? whom when a manhonours, the heart of the God rejoices, 
                    and he is ready to answertheir prayers. And, truly, the figure 
                    of an ancestor is a wonderfulthing, far higher than that of 
                    a lifeless image. For the living,when they are honoured by 
                    us, join in our prayers, and when they aredishonoured, they 
                    utter imprecations against us; but lifelessobjects do neither. 
                    And therefore, if a man makes a right use of hisfather and 
                    grandfather and other aged relations, he will have imageswhich 
                    above all others will win him the favour of the Gods.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Excellent.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Every man of any understanding fears and respects the 
                    prayersof parents, knowing well that many times and to many 
                    persons they havebeen accomplished. Now these things being 
                    thus ordered by nature, goodmen think it a blessing from heaven 
                    if their parents live to old ageand reach the utmost limit 
                    of human life, or if taken away beforetheir time they are 
                    deeply regretted by them; but to bad men parentsare always 
                    a cause of terror. Wherefore let every man honour withevery 
                    sort of lawful honour his own parents, agreeably to what has 
                    nowbeen said. But if this prelude be an unmeaning sound in 
                    the cars ofany one, let the law follow, which may be rightly 
                    imposed in theseterms:-If any one in this city be not sufficiently 
                    careful of hisparents, and do not regard and gratify in every 
                    respect their wishesmore than those of his sons and of his 
                    other offspring or ofhimself-let him who experiences this 
                    sort of treatment either comehimself, or send some one to 
                    inform the three eldest guardians ofthe law, and three of 
                    the women who have the care of marriages; andlet them look 
                    to the matter and punish youthful evil-doers withstripes and 
                    bonds if they are under thirty years of age, that is tosay, 
                    if they be men, or if they be women, let them undergo the 
                    samepunishment up to forty years of age. But if, when they 
                    are stillmore advanced in years, they continue the same neglect 
                    of theirparents, and do any hurt to any of them, let them 
                    be brought beforea court in which every single one of the 
                    eldest citizens shall bethe judges, and if the offender be 
                    convicted, let the courtdetermine what he ought to pay or 
                    suffer, and any penalty may beimposed on him which a man can 
                    pay or suffer. If the person who hasbeen wronged be unable 
                    to inform the magistrates, let any freemanwho hears of his 
                    case inform, and if he do not, he shall be deemedbase, and 
                    shall be liable to have a suit for damage brought againsthim 
                    by any one who likes. And if a slave inform, he shall receivefreedom; 
                    and if he be the slave of the injurer or injured party, heshall 
                    be set free by the magistrates, or if he belong to any othercitizen, 
                    the public shall pay a price on his behalf to the owner;and 
                    let the magistrates take heed that no one wrongs him out ofrevenge, 
                    because he has given information.</p>
                  <p>Cases in which one man injures another by poisons, and which 
                    provefatal, have been already discussed; but about other cases 
                    in which aperson intentionally and of malice harms another 
                    with meats, ordrinks, or ointments, nothing has as yet been 
                    determined. For thereare two kinds of poisons used among men, 
                    which cannot clearly bedistinguished. There is the kind just 
                    now explicitly mentioned,which injures bodies by the use of 
                    other bodies according to a naturallaw; there is also another 
                    kind which persuades the more daringclass that they can do 
                    injury by sorceries, and incantations, andmagic knots, as 
                    they are termed, and makes others believe that theyabove all 
                    persons are injured by the powers of the magician. Now it 
                    isnot easy to know the nature of all these things; nor if 
                    a man doknow can he readily persuade others to believe him. 
                    And when men aredisturbed in their minds at the sight of waxen 
                    images fixed eitherat their doors, or in a place where three 
                    ways meet, or on thesepulchres of parents, there is no use 
                    in trying to persuade them thatthey should despise all such 
                    things because they have no certainknowledge about them. But 
                    we must have a law in two parts,concerning poisoning, in whichever 
                    of the two ways the attempt ismade, and we must entreat, and 
                    exhort, and advise men not to haverecourse to such practices, 
                    by which they scare the multitude out oftheir wits, as if 
                    they were children, compelling the legislator andthe judge 
                    to heal the fears which the sorcerer arouses, and to tellthem 
                    in the first place, that he who attempts to poison or enchantothers 
                    knows not what he is doing, either as regards the body(unless 
                    he has a knowledge of medicine), or as regards hisenchantments 
                    (unless he happens to be a prophet or diviner). Let thelaw, 
                    then, run as follows about poisoning or witchcraft:-He whoemploys 
                    poison to do any injury, not fatal, to a man himself, or tohis 
                    servants, or any injury, whether fatal or not, to his cattle 
                    orhis bees, if he be a physician, and be convicted of poisoning, 
                    shallbe punished with death; or if he be a private person, 
                    the courtshall determine what he is to pay or suffer. But 
                    he who seems to bethe sort of man injures others by magic 
                    knots, or enchantments, orincantations, or any of the like 
                    practices, if he be a prophet ordiviner, let him die; and 
                    if, not being a prophet, he be convictedof witchcraft, as 
                    in the previous case, let the court fix what heought to pay 
                    or suffer.</p>
                  <p>When a man does another any injury by theft or violence, 
                    for thegreater injury let him pay greater damages to the injured 
                    man, andless for the smaller injury; but in all cases, whatever 
                    the injury mayhave been, as much as will compensate the loss. 
                    And besides thecompensation of the wrong, let a man pay a 
                    further penalty for thechastisement of his offence: he who 
                    has done the wrong instigated bythe folly of another, through 
                    the lightheartedness of youth or thelike, shall pay a lighter 
                    penalty; but he who has injured anotherthrough his own folly, 
                    when overcome by pleasure or pain, incowardly fear, or lust, 
                    or envy, or implacable anger, shall endure aheavier punishment. 
                    Not that he is punished because he did wrong,for that which 
                    is done can never be undone, but in order that infuture times, 
                    he, and those who see him corrected, may utterly hateinjustice, 
                    or at any rate abate much of their evil-doing. Having aneye 
                    to all these things, the law, like a good archer, should aim 
                    atthe right measure of punishment, and in all cases at the 
                    deservedpunishment. In the attainment of this the judge shall 
                    be afellow-worker with the legislator, whenever the law leaves 
                    to him todetermine what the offender shall suffer or pay; 
                    and the legislator,like a painter, shall give a rough sketch 
                    of the cases in which thelaw is to be applied. This is what 
                    we must do, Megillus andCleinias, in the best and fairest 
                    manner that we can, saying whatthe punishments are to be of 
                    all actions of theft and violence, andgiving laws of such 
                    a kind as the Gods and sons of Gods would haveus give.</p>
                  <p>If a man is mad he shall not be at large in the city, but 
                    hisrelations shall keep him at home in any way which they 
                    can; or if not,let them pay a penalty-he who is of the highest 
                    class shall pay apenalty of one hundred drachmae, whether 
                    he be a slave or a freemanwhom he neglects; and he of the 
                    second class shall pay four-fifthsof a mina; and he of the 
                    third class three-fifths; and he of thefourth class two-fifths. 
                    Now there are many sorts of madness, somearising out of disease, 
                    which we have already mentioned; and there areother kinds, 
                    which originate in an evil and passionate temperament,and 
                    are increased by bad education; out of a slight quarrel this 
                    classof madmen will often raise a storm of abuse against one 
                    another, andnothing of that sort ought to be allowed to occur 
                    in a well-orderedstate. Let this, then, be the law about abuse, 
                    which shall relate toall cases:-No one shall speak evil of 
                    another; and when a man disputeswith another he shall teach 
                    and learn of the disputant and thecompany, but he shall abstain 
                    from evilspeaking; for out of theimprecations which men utter 
                    against one another, and the femininehabit of casting aspersions 
                    on one another, and using foul names,out of words light as 
                    air, in very deed the greatest enmities andhatreds spring 
                    up. For the speaker gratifies his anger, which is anungracious 
                    element of his nature; and nursing up his wrath by theentertainment 
                    of evil thoughts, and exacerbating that part of his soulwhich 
                    was formerly civilized by education, he lives in a state ofsavageness 
                    and moroseness, and pays a bitter penalty for his anger.And 
                    in such cases almost all men take to saying something ridiculousabout 
                    their opponent, and there is no man who is in the habit oflaughing 
                    at another who does not miss virtue and earnestnessaltogether, 
                    or lose the better half of greatness. Wherefore let no oneutter 
                    any taunting word at a temple, or at the public sacrifices, 
                    orat games, or in the agora, or in a court of justice, or 
                    in anypublic assembly. And let the magistrate who presides 
                    on theseoccasions chastise an offender, and he shall be blameless; 
                    but if hefails in doing so, he shall not claim the prize of 
                    virtue; for he isone who heeds not the laws, and does not 
                    do what the legislatorcommands. And if in any other place 
                    any one indulges in these sortof revilings, whether he has 
                    begun the quarrel or is only retaliating,let any elder who 
                    is present support the law, and control with blowsthose who 
                    indulge in passion, which is another great evil; and if hedo 
                    not, let him be liable to pay the appointed penalty. And we 
                    saynow, that he who deals in reproaches against others cannot 
                    reproachthem without attempting to ridicule them; and this, 
                    when done in amoment of anger, is what we make matter of reproach 
                    against him. Butthen, do we admit into our state the comic 
                    writers who are so fondof making mankind ridiculous, if they 
                    attempt in a good-natured mannerto turn the laugh against 
                    our citizens? or do we draw thedistinction of jest and earnest, 
                    and allow a man to make use ofridicule in jest and without 
                    anger about any thing or person; thoughas we were saying, 
                    not if he be angry have a set purpose? We forbidearnest-that 
                    is unalterably fixed; but we have still to say who are tobe 
                    sanctioned or not to be sanctioned by the law in the employmentof 
                    innocent humour. A comic poet, or maker of iambic or satiricallyric 
                    verse, shall not be permitted to ridicule any of the citizens,either 
                    by word or likeness, either in anger or without anger. And 
                    ifany one is disobedient, the judges shall either at once 
                    expel him fromthe country, or he shall pay a fine of three 
                    minae, which shall bededicated to the God who presides over 
                    the contests. Those only whohave received permission shall 
                    be allowed to write verses at oneanother, but they shall be 
                    without anger and in jest; in anger andin serious earnest 
                    they shall not be allowed. The decision of thismatter shall 
                    be left to the superintendent of the general education ofthe 
                    young, and whatever he may license, the writer shall be allowed 
                    toproduce, and whatever he rejects let not the poet himself 
                    exhibit,or ever teach anybody else, slave or freeman, under 
                    the penalty ofbeing dishonoured, and held disobedient to the 
                    laws.</p>
                  <p>Now he is not to be pitied who is hungry, or who suffers 
                    anybodily pain, but he who is temperate, or has some other 
                    virtue, orpart of a virtue, and at the same time suffers from 
                    misfortune; itwould be an extraordinary thing if such an one, 
                    whether slave orfreeman, were utterly forsaken and fell into 
                    the extremes of povertyin any tolerably well-ordered city 
                    or government. Wherefore thelegislator may safely make a law 
                    applicable to such cases in thefollowing terms:-Let there 
                    be no beggars in our state; and ifanybody begs, seeking to 
                    pick up a livelihood by unavailing prayers,let the wardens 
                    of the agora turn him out of the agora, and thewardens of 
                    the city out of the city, and the wardens of the countrysend 
                    him out of any other parts of the land across the border, 
                    inorder that the land may be cleared of this sort of animal.</p>
                  <p>If a slave of either sex injure anything, which is not his 
                    or herown, through inexperience, or some improper practice, 
                    and the personwho suffers damage be not himself in part to 
                    blame, the master ofthe slave who has done the harm shall 
                    either make full satisfaction,or give up the the slave who 
                    has done has done the injury. But ifmaster argue that the 
                    charge has arisen by collusion between theinjured party and 
                    the injurer, with the view of obtaining the slave,let him 
                    sue the person, who says that he has been injured, formalpractices. 
                    And if he gain a conviction, let him receive doublethe value 
                    which the court fixes as the price of the slave; and if helose 
                    his suit, let him make amends for the injury, and give up 
                    theslave. And if a beast of burden, or horse, or dog, or any 
                    otheranimal, injure the property of a neighbour, the owner 
                    shall in likemanner pay for the injury.</p>
                  <p>If any man refuses to be a witness, he who wants him shall 
                    summonhim, and he who is summoned shall come to the trial; 
                    and if he knowsand is willing to bear witness, let him bear 
                    witness, but if he sayshe does not know let him swear by the 
                    three divinities Zeus, andApollo, and Themis, that he does 
                    not, and have no more to do withthe cause. And he who is summoned 
                    to give witness and does notanswer to his summoner, shall 
                    be liable for the harm which ensuesaccording to law. And if 
                    a person calls up as a witness any one who isacting as a judge, 
                    let him give his witness, but he shall notafterwards vote 
                    in the cause. A free woman may give her witness andplead, 
                    if she be more than forty years of age, and may bring an actionif 
                    she have no husband; but if her husband be alive she shall 
                    onlybe allowed to bear witness. A slave of either sex and 
                    a child shall beallowed to give evidence and to plead, but 
                    only in cases of murder;and they must produce sufficient sureties 
                    that they will certainlyremain until the trial, in case they 
                    should be charged with falsewitness. And either of the parties 
                    in a cause may bring anaccusation of perjury against witnesses, 
                    touching their evidence inwhole or in part, if he asserts 
                    that such evidence has been given; butthe accusation must 
                    be brought previous to the final decision of thecause. The 
                    magistrates shall preserve the accusations of falsewitness, 
                    and have them kept under the seal of both parties, andproduce 
                    them on the day when the trial for false witness takesplace. 
                    If a man be twice convicted of false witness, he shall not 
                    berequired, and if thrice, he shall not be allowed to bear 
                    witness;and if he dare to witness after he has been convicted 
                    three times, letany one who pleases inform against him to 
                    the magistrates, and let themagistrates hand him over to the 
                    court, and if he be convicted heshall be punished with death. 
                    And in any case in which the evidence isrightly found to be 
                    false, and yet to have given the victory to himwho wins the 
                    suit, and more than half the witnesses are condemned, thedecision 
                    which was gained by these means shall be a discussion and 
                    adecision as to whether the suit was determined by that falseevidence 
                    or and in whichever way the decision may be given, theprevious 
                    suit shall be determined accordingly.</p>
                  <p>There are many noble things in human life, but to most of 
                    themattach evils which are fated to corrupt and spoil them. 
                    Is not justicenoble, which has been the civilizer of humanity? 
                    How then can theadvocate of justice be other than noble? And 
                    yet upon thisprofession which is presented to us under the 
                    fair name of art hascome an evil reputation. In the first 
                    place; we are told that byingenious pleas and the help of 
                    an advocate the law enables a man towin a particular cause, 
                    whether just or unjust; and the power ofspeech which is thereby 
                    imparted, are at the service of him sho iswilling to pay for 
                    them. Now in our state this so-called art,whether really an 
                    art or only an experience and practice destituteof any art, 
                    ought if possible never to come into existence, or ifexisting 
                    among us should litten to the request of the legislator andgo 
                    away into another land, and not speak contrary to justice. 
                    If theoffenders obey we say no more; but those who disobey, 
                    the voice of thelaw is as follows:-If anyone thinks that he 
                    will pervert the powerof justice in the minds of the judges, 
                    and unseasonably litigate oradvocate, let any one who likes 
                    indict him for malpractices of law anddishonest advocacy, 
                    and let him be judged in the court of selectjudges; and if 
                    he be convicted, let the court determine whether he maybe 
                    supposed to act from a love of money or from contentiousness. 
                    Andif he is supposed to act from contentiousness, the court 
                    shall fix atime during which he shall not be allowed to institute 
                    or plead acause; and if he is supposed to act as be does from 
                    love of money,in case he be a stranger, he shall leave the 
                    country, and never returnunder penalty of death; but if he 
                    be a citizen, he shall die,because he is a lover of money, 
                    in whatever manner gained; andequally, if he be judged to 
                    have acted more than once fromcontentiousness, he shall die.</p>

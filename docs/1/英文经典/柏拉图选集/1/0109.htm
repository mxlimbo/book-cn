                    Next to all the matters which have preceded in the natural 
                    orderof legislation will come suits of law. Of suits those 
                    which relateto agriculture have been already described, but 
                    the more importanthave not been described. Having mentioned 
                    them severally under theirusual names, we will proceed to 
                    say what punishments are to beinflicted for each offence, 
                    and who are to be the judges of them.</p>
                  <p>Cleinias. Very good.</p>
                  <p>Athenian Stranger. There is a sense of disgrace in legislating, 
                    aswe are about to do, for all the details of crime in a state 
                    which,as we say, is to be well regulated and will be perfectly 
                    adapted tothe practice of virtue. To assume that in such a 
                    state there willarise some one who will be guilty of crimes 
                    as heinous as any whichare ever perpetrated in other states, 
                    and that we must legislate forhim by anticipation, and threaten 
                    and make laws against him if heshould arise, in order to deter 
                    him, and punish his acts, under theidea that he will arise-this, 
                    as I was saying, is in a mannerdisgraceful. Yet seeing that 
                    we are not like the ancientlegislators, who gave laws to heroes 
                    and sons of gods, being,according to the popular belief, themselves 
                    the offspring of the gods,and legislating for others, who 
                    were also the children of divineparents, but that we are only 
                    men who are legislating for the sonsof men, there is no uncharitableness 
                    in apprehending that some oneof our citizens may be like a 
                    seed which has touched the ox's horn,having a heart so hard 
                    that it cannot be softened any more thanthose seeds can be 
                    softened by fire. Among our citizens there may bethose who 
                    cannot be subdued by all the strength of the laws; and fortheir 
                    sake, though an ungracious task, I will proclaim my first 
                    lawabout the robbing of temples, in case any one should dare 
                    to commitsuch a crime. I do not expect or imagine that any 
                    well-brought-upcitizen will ever take the infection, but their 
                    servants, andstrangers, and strangers' servants may be guilty 
                    of many impieties.And with a view to them especially, and 
                    yet not without a providenteye to the weakness of human nature 
                    generally, I will proclaim the lawabout robbers of temples 
                    and similar incurable, or almost incurable,criminals. Having 
                    already agreed that such enactments ought alwaysto have a 
                    short prelude, we may speak to the criminal, whom sometormenting 
                    desire by night and by day tempts to go and rob a temple,the 
                    fewest possible words of admonition and exhortation:-O sir, 
                    wewill say to him, the impulse which moves you to rob temples 
                    is notan ordinary human malady, nor yet a visitation of heaven, 
                    but amadness which is begotten in a man from ancient and unexpiatedcrimes 
                    of his race, an ever-recurring curse;-against this you mustguard 
                    with all your might, and how you are to guard we will explain 
                    toyou. When any such thought comes into your mind, go and 
                    performexpiations, go as a suppliant to the temples of the 
                    Gods who avertevils, go to the society of those who are called 
                    good men among you;hear them tell and yourself try to repeat 
                    after them, that every manshould honour the noble and the 
                    just. Fly from the company of thewicked-fly and turn not back; 
                    and if your disorder is lightened bythese remedies, well and 
                    good, but if not, then acknowledge death tobe nobler than 
                    life, and depart hence.</p>
                  <p>Such are the preludes which we sing to all who have thoughts 
                    ofunholy and treasonable actions, and to him who hearkens 
                    to them thelaw has nothing to say. But to him who is disobedient 
                    when the preludeis over, cry with a loud voice,-He who is 
                    taken in the act ofrobbing temples, if he be a slave or stranger, 
                    shall have his evildeed engraven on his face and hands, and 
                    shall be beaten with asmany stripes as may seem good to the 
                    judges, and be cast nakedbeyond the borders of the land. And 
                    if he suffers this punishment hewill probably return to his 
                    right mind and be improved; for no penaltywhich the law inflicts 
                    is designed for evil, but always makes himwho suffers either 
                    better or not so much worse as he would havebeen. But if any 
                    citizen be found guilty of any great or unmentionablewrong, 
                    either in relation to the gods, or his parents, or the state,let 
                    the judge deem him to be incurable, remembering that afterreceiving 
                    such an excellent education and training from youthupward, 
                    he has not abstained from the greatest of crimes. Hispunishment 
                    shall be death, which to him will be the least of evils;and 
                    his example will benefit others, if he perish ingloriously, 
                    and becast beyond the borders of the land. But let his children 
                    andfamily, if they avoid the ways of their father, have glory, 
                    and lethonourable mention be made of them, as having nobly 
                    and manfullyescaped out of evil into good. None of them should 
                    have their goodsconfiscated to the state, for the lots of 
                    the citizens ought always tocontinue the same and equal.</p>
                  <p>Touching the exaction of penalties, when a man appears to 
                    havedone anything which deserves a fine, he shall pay the 
                    fine, if he haveanything in excess of the lot which is assigned 
                    to him; but morethan that he shall not pay. And to secure 
                    exactness, let the guardiansof the law refer to the registers, 
                    and inform the judges of theprecise truth, in order that none 
                    of the lots may go uncultivatedfor want of money. But if any 
                    one seems to deserve a greaterpenalty, let him undergo a long 
                    and public imprisonment and bedishonoured, unless some of 
                    his friends are willing to be surety forhim, and liberate 
                    him by assisting him to pay the fine. No criminalshall go 
                    unpunished, not even for a single offence, nor if he havefled 
                    the country; but let the penalty be according to hisdeserts-death, 
                    or bonds, or blows, or degrading places of sitting orstanding, 
                    or removal to some temple on the borders of the land; or lethim 
                    pay fines, as we said before. In cases of death, let the judges 
                    bethe guardians of the law, and a court selected by merit 
                    from thelast year's magistrates. But how the causes are to 
                    be brought intoto court, how the summonses are to be served, 
                    the like, these thingsmay be left to the younger generation 
                    of legislators to determine; themanner of voting we must determine 
                    ourselves.</p>
                  <p>Let the vote be given openly; but before they come to the 
                    vote letthe judges sit in order of seniority over against 
                    plaintiff anddefendant, and let all the citizens who can spare 
                    time hear and take aserious interest in listening to such 
                    causes. First of all theplaintiff shall make one speech, and 
                    then the defendant shall makeanother; and after the speeches 
                    have been made the eldest judgeshall begin to examine the 
                    parties, and proceed to make an adequateenquiry into what 
                    has been said; and after the oldest has spoken,the rest shall 
                    proceed in order to examine either party as to whathe finds 
                    defective in the evidence, whether of statement oromission; 
                    and he who has nothing to ask shall hand over theexamination 
                    to another. And on so much of what has been said as isto the 
                    purpose all the judges shall set their seals, and place thewritings 
                    on the altar of Hestia. On the next day they shall meetagain, 
                    and in like manner put their questions and go through thecause, 
                    and again set their seals upon the evidence; and when they 
                    havethree times done this, and have had witnesses and evidence 
                    enough,they shall each of them give a holy vote, after promising 
                    by Hestiathat they will decide justly and truly to the utmost 
                    of their power;and so they shall put an end to the suit.</p>
                  <p>Next, after what relates to the Gods, follows what relates 
                    to thedissolution of the state:-Whoever by promoting a man 
                    to power enslavesthe laws, and subjects the city to factions, 
                    using violence andstirring up sedition contrary to law, him 
                    we will deem the greatestenemy of the whole state. But he 
                    who takes no part in suchproceedings, and, being one of the 
                    chief magistrates of the state, hasno knowledge of the treason, 
                    or, having knowledge of it, by reasonof cowardice does not 
                    interfere on behalf of his country, such anone we must consider 
                    nearly as bad. Every man who is worth anythingwill inform 
                    the magistrates, and bring the conspirator to trial formaking 
                    a violent and illegal attempt to change the government. Thejudges 
                    of such cases shall be the same as of the robbers of temples;and 
                    let the whole proceeding be carried on in the same way, and 
                    thevote of the majority condemn to death. But let there be 
                    a generalrule, that the disgrace and punishment of the father 
                    is not to bevisited on the children, except in the case of 
                    some one whosefather, grandfather, and great-grandfather have 
                    successively undergonethe penalty of death. Such persons the 
                    city shall send away with alltheir possessions to the city 
                    and country of their ancestors,retaining only and wholly their 
                    appointed lot. And out of the citizenswho have more than one 
                    son of not less than ten years of age, theyshall select ten 
                    whom their father or grandfather by the mother's orfather's 
                    side shall appoint, and let them send to Delphi the namesof 
                    those who are selected, and him whom the God chooses they 
                    shallestablish as heir of the house which has failed; and 
                    may he havebetter fortune than his predecessors!</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very good.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Once more let there be a third general law respecting 
                    thejudges who are to give judgment, and the manner of conducting 
                    suitsagainst those who are tried on an accusation of treason; 
                    and asconcerning the remaining or departure of their descendants-there 
                    shallbe one law for all three, for the traitor, and the robber 
                    oftemples, and the subverter by violence of the laws of the 
                    state. For athief, whether he steal much or little, let there 
                    be one law, andone punishment for all alike: in the first 
                    place, let him pay doublethe amount of the theft if he be 
                    convicted, and if he have so muchover and above the allotment;-if 
                    he have not, he shall be bounduntil he pay the penalty, or 
                    persuade him has obtained the sentenceagainst him to forgive 
                    him. But if a person be convicted of a theftagainst the state, 
                    then if he can persuade the city, or if he will payback twice 
                    the amount of the theft, he shall be set free from hisbonds.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What makes you say, Stranger, that a theft is all one,whether 
                    the thief may have taken much or little, and either fromsacred 
                    or secular places-and these are not the only differences inthefts:-seeing, 
                    then, that they are of many kinds, ought not thelegislator 
                    to adapt himself to them, and impose upon them entirelydifferent 
                    penalties?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Excellent. I was running on too fast, Cleinias, and 
                    youimpinged upon me, and brought me to my senses, reminding 
                    me of what,indeed, had occurred to mind already, that legislation 
                    was never yetrightly worked out, as I may say in passing.-Do 
                    you remember the imagein which I likened the men for whom 
                    laws are now made to slaves whoare doctored by slaves? For 
                    of this you may be very sure, that ifone of those empirical 
                    physicians, who practise medicine withoutscience, were to 
                    come upon the gentleman physician talking to hisgentleman 
                    patient, and using the language almost of philosophy,beginning 
                    at the beginning of the disease and discoursing about thewhole 
                    nature of the body, he would burst into a hearty laugh-hewould 
                    say what most of those who are called doctors always have 
                    attheir tongue's end:-Foolish fellow, he would say, you are 
                    nothealing the sick man, but you are educating him; and he 
                    does notwant to be made a doctor, but to get well.</p>
                  <p>Cle. And would he not be right?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Perhaps he would; and he might remark upon us that he 
                    whodiscourses about laws, as we are now doing, is giving the 
                    citizenseducation and not laws; that would be rather a telling 
                    observation.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. But we are fortunate.</p>
                  <p>Cle. In what way?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Inasmuch as we are not compelled to give laws, but we 
                    maytake into consideration every form of government, and ascertain 
                    whatis best and what is most needful, and how they may both 
                    be carriedinto execution; and we may also, if we please, at 
                    this very momentchoose what is best, or, if we prefer, what 
                    is most necessary-whichshall we do?</p>
                  <p> Cle. There is something ridiculous, Stranger, in our proposing 
                    suchan alternative as if we were legislators, simply bound 
                    under somegreat necessity which cannot be deferred to the 
                    morrow. But we, as Imay by grace of Heaven affirm, like, gatherers 
                    of stones orbeginners of some composite work, may gather a 
                    heap of materials,and out of this, at our leisure, select 
                    what is suitable for ourprojected construction. Let us then 
                    suppose ourselves to be atleisure, not of necessity building, 
                    but rather like men who are partlyproviding materials, and 
                    partly putting them together. And we maytruly say that some 
                    of our laws, like stones, are already fixed intheir places, 
                    and others lie at hand.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Certainly, in that case, Cleinias, our view of law will 
                    be morein accordance with nature. For there is another matter 
                    affectinglegislators, which I must earnestly entreat you to 
                    consider.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What is it?</p>
                  <p>Ath. There are many writings to be found in cities, and among 
                    themthere, are composed by legislators as well as by other 
                    persons.</p>
                  <p>Cle. To be sure.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Shall we give heed rather to the writings of those others-poetsand 
                    the like, who either in metre or out of metre have recordedtheir 
                    advice about the conduct of life, and not to the writings 
                    oflegislators? or shall we give heed to them above all?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes; to them far above all others.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And ought the legislator alone among writers to withhold 
                    hisopinion about the beautiful, the good, and the just, and 
                    not toteach what they are, and how they are to be pursued 
                    by those whointend to be happy?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly not.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And is it disgraceful for Homer and Tyrtaeus and other 
                    poets tolay down evil precepts in their writings respecting 
                    life and thepursuits of men, but not so disgraceful for Lycurgus 
                    and Solon andothers who were legislators as well as writers? 
                    Is it not true that ofall the writings to be found in cities, 
                    those which relate to laws,when you unfold and read them, 
                    ought to be by far the noblest andthe best? and should not 
                    other writings either agree with them, orif they disagree, 
                    be deemed ridiculous? We should consider whether thelaws of 
                    states ought not to have the character of loving and wiseparents, 
                    rather than of tyrants and masters, who command and threaten,and, 
                    after writing their decrees on walls, go their ways; and whether,in 
                    discoursing of laws, we should not take the gentler view of 
                    themwhich may or may not be attainable-at any rate, we will 
                    show ourreadiness to entertain such a view, and be prepared 
                    to undergowhatever may be the result. And may the result be 
                    good, and if Godbe gracious, it will be good!</p>
                  <p>Cle. Excellent; let us do as you say.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then we will now consider accurately, as we proposed, 
                    whatrelates to robbers of temples, and all kinds of thefts, 
                    and offencesin general; and we must not be annoyed if, in 
                    the course oflegislation, we have enacted some things, and 
                    have not made up ourminds about some others; for as yet we 
                    are not legislators, but we maysoon be. Let us, if you please, 
                    consider these matters.</p>
                  <p>Cle. By all means.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Concerning all things honourable and just, let us thenendeavour 
                    to ascertain how far we are consistent with ourselves, andhow 
                    far we are inconsistent, and how far the many, from whom at 
                    anyrate we should profess a desire to differ, agree and disagree 
                    amongthemselves.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What are the inconsistencies which you observe in us?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I will endeavour to explain. If I am not mistaken, we 
                    are allagreed that justice, and just men and things and actions, 
                    are allfair, and, if a person were to maintain that just men, 
                    even whenthey are deformed in body, are still perfectly beautiful 
                    in respect ofthe excellent justice of their minds, no one 
                    would say that therewas any inconsistency in this.</p>
                  <p>Cle. They would be quite right.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Perhaps; but let us consider further, that if all thingswhich 
                    are just are fair and honourable, in the term &quot;all&quot; 
                    we mustinclude just sufferings which are the correlatives 
                    of just actions.</p>
                  <p>Cle. And what is the inference?</p>
                  <p>Ath. The inference is, that a just action in partaking of 
                    the justpartakes also in the same degree of the fair and honourable.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And must not a suffering which partakes of the just 
                    principlebe admitted to be in the same degree fair and honourable, 
                    if theargument is consistently carried out?</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. But then if we admit suffering to be just and yetdishonourable, 
                    and the term &quot;dishonourable&quot; is applied to justice,will 
                    not the just and the honourable disagree?</p>
                  <p>Cle. What do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. A thing not difficult to understand; the laws which 
                    have beenalready enacted would seem to announce principles 
                    directly opposedto what we are saying.</p>
                  <p>Cle. To what?</p>
                  <p>Ath. We had enacted, if I am not mistaken, that the robber 
                    oftemples, and he who was the enemy of law and order, might 
                    justly beput to death, and we were proceeding to make divers 
                    other enactmentsof a similar nature. But we stopped short, 
                    because we saw that thesesufferings are infinite in number 
                    and degree, and that they are, atonce, the most just and also 
                    the most dishonourable of all sufferings.And if this be true, 
                    are not the just and the honourable at one timeall the same, 
                    and at another time in the most diametrical opposition?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Such appears to be the case.</p>
                  <p>Ath. In this discordant and inconsistent fashion does the 
                    languageof the many rend asunder the honourable and just.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true, Stranger.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then now, Cleinias, let us see how far we ourselves 
                    areconsistent about these matters.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Consistent in what?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I think that I have clearly stated in the former part 
                    of thediscussion, but if I did not, let me now state-</p>
                  <p>Cle. What?</p>
                  <p>Ath. That all bad men are always involuntarily bad; and from 
                    thismust proceed to draw a further inference.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What is it?</p>
                  <p>Ath. That the unjust man may be bad, but that he is bad againsthis 
                    will. Now that an action which is voluntary should be doneinvoluntarily 
                    is a contradiction; wherefore he who maintains thatinjustice 
                    is involuntary will deem that the unjust does injusticeinvoluntarily. 
                    I too admit that all men do injustice involuntarily,and if 
                    any contentious or disputatious person says that men are unjustagainst 
                    their will, and yet that many do injustice willingly, I do 
                    notagree with him. But, then, how can I avoid being inconsistent 
                    withmyself, if you, Cleinias, and you, Megillus, say to me-Well, 
                    Stranger,if all this be as you say, how about legislating 
                    for the city of theMagnetes-shall we legislate or not-what 
                    do you advise? Certainly wewill, I should reply. Then will 
                    you determine for them what arevoluntary and what are involuntary 
                    crimes, and shall we make thepunishments greater of voluntary 
                    errors and crimes and less for theinvoluntary? or shall we 
                    make the punishment of all to be alike, underthe idea that 
                    there is no such thing as voluntary crime?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very good, Stranger; and what shall we say in answer 
                    to theseobjections?</p>
                  <p>Ath. That is a very fair question. In the first place, let 
                    us-</p>
                  <p>Cle. Do what?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us remember what has been well said by us already, 
                    that ourideas of justice are in the highest degree confused 
                    and contradictory.Bearing this in mind, let us proceed to 
                    ask ourselves once morewhether we have discovered a way out 
                    of the difficulty. Have we everdetermined in what respect 
                    these two classes of actions differ fromone another? For in 
                    all states and by all legislators whatsoever,two kinds of 
                    actions have been distinguished-the one, voluntary, theother, 
                    involuntary; and they have legislated about them accordingly.But 
                    shall this new word of ours, like an oracle of God, be onlyspoken, 
                    and get away without giving any explanation or verification 
                    ofitself? How can a word not understood be the basis of legislation?Impossible. 
                    Before proceeding to legislate, then, we must prove thatthey 
                    are two, and what is the difference between them, that when 
                    weimpose the penalty upon either, every one may understand 
                    our proposal,and be able in some way to judge whether the 
                    penalty is fitly orunfitly inflicted.</p>
                  <p>Cle. I agree with you, Stranger; for one of two things is 
                    certain:either we must not say that all unjust acts are involuntary, 
                    or wemust show the meaning and truth of this statement.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Of these two alternatives, the one is quite intolerable-notto 
                    speak what I believe to be the truth would be to me unlawful 
                    andunholy. But if acts of injustice cannot be divided into 
                    voluntaryand involuntary, I must endeavour to find some other 
                    distinctionbetween them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true, Stranger; there cannot be two opinions among 
                    us uponthat point.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Reflect, then; there are hurts of various kinds done 
                    by thecitizens to one another in the intercourse of life, 
                    affordingplentiful examples both of the voluntary and involuntary.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I would not have any one suppose that all these hurts 
                    areinjuries, and that these injuries are of two kinds-one, 
                    voluntary, andthe other, involuntary; for the involuntary 
                    hurts of all men are quiteas many and as great as the voluntary? 
                    And please to considerwhether I am right or quite wrong in 
                    what I am going to say; for Ideny, Cleinias and Megillus, 
                    that he who harms another involuntarilydoes him an injury 
                    involuntarily, nor should I legislate about such anact under 
                    the idea that I am legislating for an involuntary injury.But 
                    I should rather say that such a hurt, whether great or small, 
                    isnot an injury at all; and, on the other hand, if I am right, 
                    when abenefit is wrongly conferred, the author of the benefit 
                    may often besaid to injure. For I maintain, O my friends, 
                    that the mere givingor taking away of anything is not to be 
                    described either as just orunjust; but the legislator has 
                    to consider whether mankind do goodor harm to one another 
                    out of a just principle and intention. On thedistinction between 
                    injustice and hurt he must fix his eye; and whenthere is hurt, 
                    he must, as far as he can, make the hurt good by law,and save 
                    that which is ruined, and raise up that which is fallen,and 
                    make that which is dead or wounded whole. And when compensationhas 
                    been given for injustice, the law must always seek to win 
                    over thedoers and sufferers of the several hurts from feelings 
                    of enmity tothose of friendship.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very good.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then as to unjust hurts (and gains also, supposing theinjustice 
                    to bring gain), of these we may heal as many as arecapable 
                    of being healed, regarding them as diseases of the soul; andthe 
                    cure of injustice will take the following direction.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What direction?</p>
                  <p>Ath. When any one commits any injustice, small or great, 
                    the lawwill admonish and compel him either never at all to 
                    do the like again,or never voluntarily, or at any rate in 
                    a far less degree; and he mustin addition pay for the hurt. 
                    Whether the end is to be attained byword or action, with pleasure 
                    or pain, by giving or taking awayprivileges, by means of fines 
                    or gifts, or in whatsoever way the lawshall proceed to make 
                    a man hate injustice, and love or not hate thenature of the 
                    just-this is quite the noblest work of law. But if thelegislator 
                    sees any one who is incurable, for him he will appoint alaw 
                    and a penalty. He knows quite well that to such men themselvesthere 
                    is no profit in the continuance of their lives, and that theywould 
                    do a double good to the rest of mankind if they would take 
                    theirdeparture, inasmuch as they would be an example to other 
                    men not tooffend, and they would relieve the city of bad citizens. 
                    In suchcases, and in such cases only, the legislator ought 
                    to inflict deathas the punishment of offences.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What you have said appears to me to be very reasonable, 
                    butwill you favour me by stating a little more clearly the 
                    differencebetween hurt and injustice, and the various complications 
                    of thevoluntary and involuntary which enter into them?</p>
                  <p> Ath. I will endeavour to do as you wish:-Concerning the 
                    soul,thus much would be generally said and allowed, that one 
                    element in hernature is passion, which may be described either 
                    as a state or apart of her, and is hard to be striven against 
                    and contended with, andby irrational force overturns many 
                    things.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And pleasure is not the same with passion, but has anopposite 
                    power, working her will by persuasion and by the force ofdeceit 
                    in all things.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Quite true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. A man may truly say that ignorance is a third cause 
                    ofcrimes. Ignorance, however, may be conveniently divided 
                    by thelegislator into two sorts: there is simple ignorance, 
                    which is thesource of lighter offences, and double ignorance, 
                    which is accompaniedby a conceit of wisdom; and he who is 
                    under the influence of thelatter fancies that he knows all 
                    about matters of which he knowsnothing. This second kind of 
                    ignorance, when possessed of power andstrength, will be held 
                    by the legislator to be the source of great andmonstrous times, 
                    but when attended with weakness, will only resultin the errors 
                    of children and old men; and these he will treat aserrors, 
                    and will make laws accordingly for those who commit them,which 
                    will be the mildest and most merciful of all laws.</p>
                  <p>Cle. You are perfectly right.</p>
                  <p>Ath. We all of us remark of one man that he is superior topleasure 
                    and passion, and of another that he is inferior to them;and 
                    this is true.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. But no one was ever yet heard to say that one of us 
                    is superiorand another inferior to ignorance.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. We are speaking of motives which incite men to the fulfilmentof 
                    their will; although an individual may be often drawn by them 
                    inopposite directions at the same time.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes, often.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And now I can define to you clearly, and without ambiguity,what 
                    I mean by the just and unjust, according to my notion ofthem:-When 
                    anger and fear, and pleasure and pain, and jealousies anddesires, 
                    tyrannize over the soul, whether they do any harm or not-Icall 
                    all this injustice. But when the opinion of the best, in whateverpart 
                    of human nature states or individuals may suppose that todwell, 
                    has dominion in the soul and orders the life of every man, 
                    evenif it be sometimes mistaken, yet what is done in accordance 
                    therewith,the principle in individuals which obeys this rule, 
                    and is best forthe whole life of man, is to be called just; 
                    although the hurt done bymistake is thought by many to be 
                    involuntary injustice. Leaving thequestion of names, about 
                    which we are not going to quarrel, and havingalready delineated 
                    three sources of error, we may begin by recallingthem somewhat 
                    more vividly to our memory:-One of them was of thepainful 
                    sort, which we denominate anger and fear.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Quite right.</p>
                  <p>Ath. There was a second consisting of pleasures and desires, 
                    and athird of hopes, which aimed at true opinion about the 
                    best. The latterbeing subdivided into three, we now get five 
                    sources of actions; andfor these five we will make laws of 
                    two kinds.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What are the two kinds?</p>
                  <p>Ath. There is one kind of actions done by violence and in 
                    thelight of day, and another kind of actions which are done 
                    in darknessand with secret deceit, or sometimes both with 
                    violence and deceit;the laws concerning these last ought to 
                    have a character of severity.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Naturally.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And now let us return from this digression and complete 
                    thework of legislation. Laws have been already enacted by 
                    us concerningthe robbers of the Gods, and concerning traitors, 
                    and alsoconcerning those who corrupt the laws for the purpose 
                    of subvertingthe government. A man may very likely commit 
                    some of these crimes,either in a state of madness or when 
                    affected by disease, or under theinfluence of extreme old 
                    age, or in a fit of childish wantonness,himself no better 
                    than a child. And if this be made evident to thejudges elected 
                    to try the cause, on the appeal of the criminal orhis advocate, 
                    and he be judged to have been in this state when hecommitted 
                    the offence, he shall simply pay for the hurt which he mayhave 
                    done to another; but he shall be exempt from other penalties,unless 
                    he have slain some one, and have on his hands the stain ofblood. 
                    And in that case he shall go to another land and country, 
                    andthere dwell for a year; and if he return before the expiration 
                    ofthe time which the law appoints, or even set his foot at 
                    all on hisnative land, he shall be bound by the guardians 
                    of the law in thepublic prison for two years, and then go 
                    free.</p>
                  <p>Having begun to speak of homicide, let us endeavour to lay 
                    down lawsconcerning every different kind of homicides, and, 
                    first of all,concerning violent and involuntary homicides. 
                    If any one in anathletic contest, and at the public games, 
                    involuntarily kills afriend, and he dies either at the time 
                    or afterwards of the blowswhich he has received; or if the 
                    like misfortune happens to any one inwar, or military exercises, 
                    or mimic contests. of which themagistrates enjoin the practice, 
                    whether with or without arms, when hehas been purified according 
                    to the law brought from Delphi relating tothese matters, he 
                    shall be innocent. And so in the case of physicians:if their 
                    patient dies against their will, they shall be held guiltlessby 
                    the law. And if one slay another with his own hand, butunintentionally, 
                    whether he be unarmed or have some instrument or dartin his 
                    hand; or if he kill him by administering food or drink or 
                    bythe application of fire or cold, or by suffocating him, 
                    whether hedo the deed by his own hand, or by the agency of 
                    others, he shall bedeemed the agent, and shall suffer one 
                    of the followingpenalties:-If he kill the slave of another 
                    in the belief that he ishis own, he shall bear the master 
                    of the dead man harmless fromloss, or shall pay a penalty 
                    of twice the value of the dead man, whichthe judges shall 
                    assess; but purifications must be used greater andmore numerous 
                    than for those who committed homicide at the games;-whatthey 
                    are to be, the interpreters whom the God appoints shall beauthorized 
                    to declare. And if a man kills his own slave, when he hasbeen 
                    purified according to laws he shall be quit of the homicide.And 
                    if a man kills a freeman unintentionally, he shall undergo 
                    thesame purification as he did who killed the slave. But let 
                    him notforget also a tale of olden time, which is to this 
                    effect:-He whohas suffered a violent end, when newly dead, 
                    if he has had the soul ofa freeman in life, is angry with 
                    the author of his death; and beinghimself full of fear and 
                    panic by reason of his violent end, when hesees his murderer 
                    walking about in his own accustomed haunts, he isstricken 
                    with terror and becomes disordered, and this disorder of his,aided 
                    by the guilty recollection of is communicated by him withoverwhelming 
                    force to the murderer and his deeds. Wherefore also themurderer 
                    must go out of the way of his victim for the entire period 
                    ofa year, and not himself be found in any spot which was familiar 
                    to himthroughout the country. And if the dead man be a stranger, 
                    thehomicide shall be kept from the country of the stranger 
                    during alike period. If any one voluntarily obeys this law, 
                    the next of kin tothe deceased, seeing all that has happened, 
                    shall take pity on him,and make peace with him, and show him 
                    all gentleness. But if any oneis disobedient, either ventures 
                    to go to any of the temples andsacrifice unpurified, or will 
                    not continue in exile during theappointed time, the next of 
                    kin to the deceased shall proceedagainst him for murder; and 
                    if he be convicted, every part of hispunishment shall be doubled.</p>
                  <p>And if the next of kin do not proceed against the perpetrator 
                    of thecrime, then the pollution shall be deemed to fall upon 
                    his ownhead;-the murdered man will fix the guilt upon his 
                    kinsman, and he whohas a mind to proceed against him may compel 
                    him to be absent from hiscountry during five years, according 
                    to law. If a strangerunintentionally kill a stranger who is 
                    dwelling in the city, he wholikes shall prosecute the cause 
                    according to the same rules. If hebe a metic, let him be absent 
                    for a year, or if he be an entirestranger, in addition to 
                    the purification, whether he have slain astranger, or a metic, 
                    or a citizen, he shall be banished for life fromthe country 
                    which is in possession of our laws. And if he returncontrary 
                    to law, let the guardians of the law punish him with death;and 
                    let them hand over his property, if he have any, to him who 
                    isnext of kin to the sufferer. And if he be wrecked, and driven 
                    on thecoast against his will, he shall take up his abode on 
                    the seashore,wetting his feet in the sea, and watching for 
                    an opportunity ofsailing; but if he be brought by land, and 
                    is not his own master,let the magistrate whom he first comes 
                    across in the city, release himand send him unharmed over 
                    the border.</p>
                  <p>If any one slays a freeman with his own hand and the deed 
                    be done inpassion, in the case of such actions we must begin 
                    by making adistinction. For a deed is done from passion either 
                    when men suddenly,and without intention to kill, cause the 
                    death of another by blows andthe like on a momentary impulse, 
                    and are sorry for the deedimmediately afterwards; or again, 
                    when after having been insulted indeed or word, men pursue 
                    revenge, and kill a person intentionally, andare not sorry 
                    for the act. And, therefore, we must assume that thesehomicides 
                    are of two kinds, both of them arising from passion, whichmay 
                    be justly said to be in a mean between the voluntary andinvoluntary; 
                    at the same time, they are neither of them anythingmore than 
                    a likeness or shadow of either. He who treasures up hisanger, 
                    and avenges himself, not immediately and at the moment, butwith 
                    insidious design, and after an interval, is like the voluntary;but 
                    he who does not treasure up his anger, and takes vengeance 
                    onthe instant, and without malice prepense, approaches to 
                    theinvoluntary; and yet even he is not altogether involuntary, 
                    but onlythe image or shadow of the involuntary; wherefore 
                    about homicidescommitted in hot blood, there is a difficulty 
                    in determining whetherin legislating we shall reckon them 
                    as voluntary or as partlyinvoluntary. The best and truest 
                    view is to regard them respectivelyas likenesses only of the 
                    voluntary and involuntary, and todistinguish them accordingly 
                    as they are done with or withoutpremeditation. And we should 
                    make the penalties heavier for thosewho commit homicide with 
                    angry premeditation, and lighter for thosewho do not premeditate, 
                    but smite upon the instant; for that whichis like a greater 
                    evil should be punished more severely, and thatwhich is like 
                    a less evil should be punished less severely: this shallbe 
                    the rule of our laws.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us proceed:-If any one slays a free man with his 
                    ownhand, and the deed be done in a moment of anger, and withoutpremeditation, 
                    let the offender suffer in other respects as theinvoluntary 
                    homicide would have suffered, and also undergo an exile oftwo 
                    years, that he may learn to school his passions. But he whoslays 
                    another from passion, yet with premeditation, shall in otherrespects 
                    suffer as the former; and to this shall be added an exileof 
                    three instead of two years-his punishment is to be longer 
                    becausehis passion is greater. The manner of their return 
                    shall be on thiswise: (and here the law has difficulty in 
                    determining exactly; forin some cases the murderer who is 
                    judged by the law to be the worsemay really be the less cruel, 
                    and he who is judged the less cruelmay be really the worse, 
                    and may have executed the murder in a moresavage manner, whereas 
                    the other may have been gentler. But in generalthe degrees 
                    of guilt will be such as we have described them. Of allthese 
                    things the guardians of the law must take cognisance):-When 
                    ahomicide of either kind has completed his term of exile, 
                    the guardiansshall send twelve judges to the borders of the 
                    land; these duringthe interval shall have informed themselves 
                    of the actions of thecriminals, and they shall judge respecting 
                    their pardon and reception;and the homicides shall abide by 
                    their judgment. But if after theyhave returned home, any one 
                    of them in a moment of anger repeats thedeed, let him be an 
                    exile, and return no more; or if he returns, lethim suffer 
                    as the stranger was to suffer in a similar case. He whokills 
                    his own slave shall undergo a purification, but if he killsthe 
                    slave of another in anger, he shall pay twice the amount of 
                    theloss to his owner. And if any homicide is disobedient to 
                    the law,and without purification pollutes the agora, or the 
                    games, or thetemples, he who pleases may bring to trial the 
                    next of kin to the deadman for permitting him, and the murderer 
                    with him, and may compelthe one to exact and the other to 
                    suffer a double amount of finesand purifications; and the 
                    accuser shall himself receive the fine inaccordance with the 
                    law. If a slave in a fit of passion kills hismaster, the kindred 
                    of the deceased man may do with the murderer(provided only 
                    they do not spare his life) whatever they please, andthey 
                    will be pure; or if he kills a freeman, who is not his master,the 
                    owner shall give up the slave to the relatives of the deceased,and 
                    they shall be under an obligation to put him to death, but 
                    thismay be done in any manner which they please.</p>
                  <p>And if (which is a rare occurrence, but does sometimes happen) 
                    afather or a mother in a moment of passion slays a son or 
                    daughter byblows, or some other violence, the slayer shall 
                    undergo the samepurification as in other cases, and be exiled 
                    during three years;but when the exile returns the wife shall 
                    separate from the husband,and the husband from the wife, and 
                    they shall never afterwards begetchildren together, or live 
                    under the same roof, or partake of the samesacred rites with 
                    those whom they have deprived of a child or of abrother. And 
                    he who is impious and disobedient in such a case shall bebrought 
                    to trial for impiety by any one who pleases. If in a fit ofanger 
                    a husband kills his wedded wife, or the wife her husband, 
                    theslayer shall undergo the same purification, and the term 
                    of exileshall be three years. And when he who has committed 
                    any such crimereturns, let him have no communication in sacred 
                    rites with hischildren, neither let him sit at the same table 
                    with them, and thefather or son who disobeys shall be liable 
                    to be brought to trialfor impiety by any one who pleases. 
                    If a brother or a sister in afit of passion kills a brother 
                    or a sister, they shall undergopurification and exile, as 
                    was the case with parents who killedtheir offspring: they 
                    shall not come under the same roof, or sharein the sacred 
                    rites of those whom they have deprived of theirbrethren, or 
                    of their children.</p>
                  <p>And he who is disobedient shall be justly liable to the lawconcerning 
                    impiety, which relates to these matters. If any one is soviolent 
                    in his passion against his parents, that in the madness of 
                    hisanger he dares to kill one of them, if the murdered person 
                    beforedying freely forgives the murderer, let him undergo 
                    the purificationwhich is assigned to those who have been guilty 
                    of involuntaryhomicide, and do as they do, and he shall be 
                    pure. But if he be notacquitted, the perpetrator of such a 
                    deed shall be amenable to manylaws;-he shall be amenable to 
                    the extreme punishments for assault, andimpiety, and robbing 
                    of temples, for he has robbed his parent of life;and if a 
                    man could be slain more than once, most justly would he whoin 
                    a fit of passion has slain father or mother, undergo many 
                    deaths.How can he, whom, alone of all men, even in defence 
                    of his life, andwhen about to suffer death at the hands of 
                    his parents, no law willallow to kill his father or his mother 
                    who are the authors of hisbeing, and whom the legislator will 
                    command to endure any extremityrather than do this-how can 
                    he, I say, lawfully receive any otherpunishment? Let death 
                    then be the appointed punishment of him who in afit of passion 
                    slays his father or his mother. But if brother killsbrother 
                    in a civil broil, or under other like circumstances, if theother 
                    has begun, and he only defends himself, let him be free fromguilt, 
                    as he would be if he had slain an enemy; and the same rule 
                    willapply if a citizen kill a citizen, or a stranger a stranger. 
                    Or if astranger kill a citizen or a citizen a stranger in 
                    self-defence, lethim be free from guilt in like manner; and 
                    so in the case of a slavewho has killed a slave; but if a 
                    slave have killed a freeman inself-defence, let him be subject 
                    to the same law as he who haskilled a father; and let the 
                    law about the remission of penalties inthe case of parricide 
                    apply equally to every other remission. Wheneverany sufferer 
                    of his own accord remits the guilt of homicide toanother, 
                    under the idea that his act was involuntary, let theperpetrator 
                    of the deed undergo a purification and remain in exile fora 
                    year, according to law.</p>
                  <p>Enough has been said of murders violent and involuntary andcommitted 
                    in passion: we have now to speak of voluntary crimes donewith 
                    injustice of every kind and with premeditation, through theinfluence 
                    of pleasures, and desires, and jealousies.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very good.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us first speak, as far as we are able, of their 
                    variouskinds. The greatest cause of them is lust, which gets 
                    the mastery ofthe soul maddened by desire; and this is most 
                    commonly found toexist where the passion reigns which is strongest 
                    and most prevalentamong mass of mankind: I mean where the 
                    power of wealth breeds endlessdesires of never-to-be-satisfied 
                    acquisition, originating in naturaldisposition, and a miserable 
                    want of education. Of this want ofeducation, the false praise 
                    of wealth which is bruited about bothamong Hellenes and barbarians 
                    is the cause; they deem that to be thefirst of goods which 
                    in reality is only the third. And in this waythey wrong both 
                    posterity and themselves, for nothing can be noblerand better 
                    than that the truth about wealth should be spoken in allstates-namely, 
                    that riches are for the sake of the body, as the bodyis for 
                    the sake of the soul. They are good, and wealth is intendedby 
                    nature to be for the sake of them, and is therefore inferior 
                    tothem both, and third in order of excellence. This argument 
                    teachesus that he who would be happy ought not to seek to 
                    be rich, orrather he should seek to be rich justly and temperately, 
                    and thenthere would be no murders in states requiring to be 
                    purged away byother murders. But now, as I said at first, 
                    avarice is the chiefestcause and source of the worst trials 
                    for voluntary homicide. Asecond cause is ambition: this creates 
                    jealousies, which aretroublesome companions, above all to 
                    the jealous man himself, and in aless degree to the chiefs 
                    of the state. And a third cause iscowardly and unjust fear, 
                    which has been the occasion of many murders.When a man is 
                    doing or has done something which he desires that no oneshould 
                    know him to be doing or to have done, he will take the lifeof 
                    those who are likely to inform of such things, if he have 
                    noother means of getting rid of them. Let this be said as 
                    a preludeconcerning crimes of violence in general; and I must 
                    not omit tomention a tradition which is firmly believed by 
                    many, and has beenreceived by them from those who are learned 
                    in the mysteries: they saythat such deeds will be punished 
                    in the world below, and also thatwhen the perpetrators return 
                    to this world they will pay the naturalpenalty which is due 
                    to the sufferer, and end their lives in likemanner by the 
                    hand of another. If he who is about to commit murderbelieves 
                    this, and is made by the mere prelude to dread such apenalty, 
                    there is no need to proceed with the proclamation of the law.But 
                    if he will not listen, let the following law be declared andregistered 
                    against him:</p>
                  <p>Whoever shall wrongfully and of design slay with his own 
                    hand any ofhis kinsmen, shall in the first place be deprived 
                    of legal privileges;and he shall not pollute the temples, 
                    or the agora, or the harbours,or any other place of meeting, 
                    whether he is forbidden of men ornot; for the law, which represents 
                    the whole state, forbids him, andalways is and will be in 
                    the attitude of forbidding him. And if acousin or nearer relative 
                    of the deceased, whether on the male orfemale side, does not 
                    prosecute the homicide when he ought, and havehim proclaimed 
                    an outlaw, he shall in the first place be involved inthe pollution, 
                    and incur the hatred of the Gods, even as the curseof the 
                    law stirs up the voices of men against him; and in the secondplace 
                    he shall be liable to be prosecuted by any one who is willing 
                    toinflict retribution on behalf of the dead. And he who would 
                    avenge amurder shall observe all the precautionary ceremonies 
                    of lavation, andany others which the God commands in cases 
                    of this kind. Let himhave proclamation made, and then go forth 
                    and compel the perpetratorto suffer the execution of justice 
                    according to the law. Now thelegislator may easily show that 
                    these things must be accomplished byprayers and sacrifices 
                    to certain Gods, who are concerned with theprevention of murders 
                    in states. But who these Gods are, and whatshould be the true 
                    manner of instituting such trials with due regardto religion, 
                    the guardians of the law, aided by the interpreters,and the 
                    prophets, and the God, shall determine, and when they havedetermined 
                    let them carry on the prosecution at law. The cause shallhave 
                    the same judges who are appointed to decide in the case ofthose 
                    who plunder temples. Let him who is convicted be punished 
                    withdeath, and let him not be buried in the country of the 
                    murdered man,for this would be shameless as well as impious. 
                    But if he fly and willnot stand his trial, let him fly for 
                    ever; or, if he set foot anywhereon any part of the murdered 
                    man's country, let any relation of thedeceased, or any other 
                    citizen who may first happen to meet withhim, kill him with 
                    impunity, or bind and deliver him to those amongthe judges 
                    of the case who are magistrates, that they may put him todeath. 
                    And let the prosecutor demand surety of him whom he prosecutes;three 
                    sureties sufficient in the opinion of the magistrates who 
                    trythe cause shall be provided by him, and they shall undertake 
                    toproduce him at the trial. But if he be unwilling or unable 
                    toprovide sureties, then the magistrates shall take him and 
                    keep himin bonds, and produce him at the day of trial.</p>
                  <p>If a man do not commit a murder with his own hand, but contrives 
                    thedeath of another, and is the author of the deed in intention 
                    anddesign, and he continues to dwell in the city, having his 
                    soul notpure of the guilt of murder, let him be tried in the 
                    same way,except in what relates to the sureties; and also, 
                    if he be foundguilty, his body after execution may have burial 
                    in his native land,but in all other respects his case shall 
                    be as the former; and whethera stranger shall kill a citizen, 
                    or a citizen a stranger, or a slave aslave, there shall be 
                    no difference as touching murder by one's ownhand or by contrivance, 
                    except in the matter of sureties; and these,as has been said, 
                    shall be required of the actual murderer only, andhe who brings 
                    the accusation shall bind them over at the time. If aslave 
                    be convicted of slaying a freeman voluntarily, either by his 
                    ownhand or by contrivance, let the public executioner take 
                    him in thedirection of the sepulchre, to a place whence he 
                    can see the tomb ofthe dead man, and inflict upon him as many 
                    stripes as the person whocaught him orders, and if he survive, 
                    let him put him to death. And ifany one kills a slave who 
                    has done no wrong, because he is afraid thathe may inform 
                    of some base and evil deeds of his own, or for anysimilar 
                    reason, in such a case let him pay the penalty of murder, 
                    ashe would have done if he had slain a citizen. There are 
                    things aboutwhich it is terrible and unpleasant to legislate, 
                    but impossible notto legislate. If, for example, there should 
                    be murders of kinsmen,either perpetrated by the hands of kinsmen, 
                    or by their contrivance,voluntary and purely malicious, which 
                    most often happen inill-regulated and ill-educated states, 
                    and may perhaps occur even in acountry where a man would not 
                    expect to find them, we must repeat oncemore the tale which 
                    we narrated a little while ago, in the hope thathe who hears 
                    us will be the more disposed to abstain voluntarily onthese 
                    grounds from murders which are utterly abominable. For the 
                    myth,or saying, or whatever we ought to call it, has been 
                    plainly set forthby priests of old; they have pronounced that 
                    the justice whichguards and avenges the blood of kindred, 
                    follows the law ofretaliation, and ordains that he who has 
                    done any murderous act shouldof necessity suffer that which 
                    he has done. He who has slain afather shall himself be slain 
                    at some time or other by his children-ifa mother, he shall 
                    of necessity take a woman's nature, and lose hislife at the 
                    hands of his offspring in after ages; for where theblood of 
                    a family has been polluted there is no other purification,nor 
                    can the pollution be washed out until the homicidal soul which 
                    thedeed has given life for life, and has propitiated and laid 
                    to sleepthe wrath of the whole family. These are the retributions 
                    of Heaven,and by such punishments men should be deterred. 
                    But if they are notdeterred, and any one should be incited 
                    by some fatality to deprivehis father or mother, or brethren, 
                    or children, of life voluntarilyand of purpose, for him the 
                    earthly lawgiver legislates asfollows:-There shall be the 
                    same proclamations about outlawry, andthere shall be the same 
                    sureties which have been enacted in the formercases. But in 
                    his case, if he be convicted, the servants of the judgesand 
                    the magistrates shall slay him at an appointed place without 
                    thecity where three ways meet, and there expose his body naked, 
                    andeach of the magistrates on behalf of the whole city shall 
                    take a stoneand cast it upon the head of the dead man, and 
                    so deliver the cityfrom pollution; after that, they shall 
                    bear him to the borders ofthe land, and cast him forth unburied, 
                    according to law. And whatshall he suffer who slays him who 
                    of all men, as they say, is hisown best friend? I mean the 
                    suicide, who deprives himself byviolence of his appointed 
                    share of life, not because the law of thestate requires him, 
                    nor yet under the compulsion of some painful andinevitable 
                    misfortune which has come upon him, nor because he hashad 
                    to suffer from irremediable and intolerable shame, but who 
                    fromsloth or want of manliness imposes upon himself an unjust 
                    penalty. Forhim, what ceremonies there are to be of purification 
                    and burial Godknows, and about these the next of kin should 
                    enquire of theinterpreters and of the laws thereto relating, 
                    and do according totheir injunctions. They who meet their 
                    death in this way shall beburied alone, and none shall be 
                    laid by their side; they shall beburied ingloriously in the 
                    borders of the twelve portions the land, insuch places as 
                    are uncultivated and nameless, and no column orinscription 
                    shall mark the place of their interment. And if a beast ofburden 
                    or other animal cause the death of any one, except in thecase 
                    of anything of that kind happening to a competitor in thepublic 
                    contests, the kinsmen of the deceased shall prosecute theslayer 
                    for murder, and the wardens of the country, such, and so manyas 
                    the kinsmen appoint, shall try the cause, and let the beast 
                    whencondemned be slain by them, and let them cast it beyond 
                    the borders.And if any lifeless thing deprive a man of life, 
                    except in the case ofa thunderbolt or other fatal dart sent 
                    from the Gods-whether a manis killed by lifeless objects, 
                    falling upon him, or by his fallingupon them, the nearest 
                    of kin shall appoint the nearest neighbour tobe a judge, and 
                    thereby acquit himself and the whole family ofguilt. And he 
                    shall cast forth the guilty thing beyond the border,as has 
                    been said about the animals.</p>
                  <p>If a man is found dead, and his murderer be unknown, and 
                    after adiligent search cannot be detected, there shall be 
                    the sameproclamation as in the previous cases, and the same 
                    interdict on themurderer; and having proceeded against him, 
                    they shall proclaim in theagora by a herald, that he who has 
                    slain such and such a person, andhas been convicted of murder, 
                    shall not set his foot in the temples,nor at all in the country 
                    of the murdered man, and if he appears andis discovered, he 
                    shall die, and be cast forth unburied beyond theborder. Let 
                    this one law then be laid down by us about murder; and letcases 
                    of this sort be so regarded.</p>
                  <p>And now let us say in what cases and under what circumstances 
                    themurderer is rightly free from guilt:-If a man catch a thief 
                    coming,into his house by night to steal, and he take and kill 
                    him, or if heslay a footpad in self-defence, he shall be guiltless. 
                    And any one whodoes violence to a free woman or a youth, shall 
                    be slain with impunityby the injured person, or by his or 
                    her father or brothers or sons. Ifa man find his wife suffering 
                    violence, he may kill the violator,and be guiltless in the 
                    eye of the law; or if a person kill another inwarding off 
                    death from his father or mother or children or brethren orwife 
                    who are doing no wrong, he shall assuredly be guiltless.</p>
                  <p>Thus much as to the nurture and education of the living soul 
                    of man,having which, he can, and without which, if he unfortunately 
                    bewithout them, he cannot live; and also concerning thepunishments:-which 
                    are to be inflicted for violent deaths, let thusmuch be enacted. 
                    Of the nurture and education of the body we havespoken before, 
                    and next in order we have to speak of deeds ofviolence, voluntary 
                    and involuntary, which men do to one another;these we will 
                    now distinguish, as far as we are able, according totheir 
                    nature and number, and determine what will be the suitablepenalties 
                    of each, and so assign to them their proper place in theseries 
                    of our enactments. The poorest legislator will have nodifficulty 
                    in determining that wounds and mutilations arising out ofwounds 
                    should follow next in order after deaths. Let wounds be dividedas 
                    homicides were divided-into those which are involuntary, andwhich 
                    are given in passion or from fear, and those inflictedvoluntarily 
                    and with premeditation. Concerning all this, we mustmake some 
                    such proclamation as the following:-Mankind must havelaws, 
                    and conform to them, or their life would be as bad as that 
                    ofthe most savage beast. And the reason of this is that no 
                    man'snature is able to know what is best for human society; 
                    or knowing,always able and willing to do what is best. In 
                    the first place,there is a difficulty in apprehending that 
                    the true art or politics isconcerned, not with private but 
                    with public good (for public goodbinds together states, but 
                    private only distracts them); and that boththe public and 
                    private good as well of individuals as of states isgreater 
                    when the state and not the individual is first considered.In 
                    the second place, although a person knows in the abstract 
                    that thisis true, yet if he be possessed of absolute and irresponsible 
                    power,he will never remain firm in his principles or persist 
                    in regardingthe public good as primary in the state, and the 
                    private good assecondary. Human nature will be always drawing 
                    him into avarice andselfishness, avoiding pain and pursuing 
                    Pleasure without any reason,and will bring these to the front, 
                    obscuring the juster and better;and so working darkness in 
                    his soul will at last fill with evilsboth him and the whole 
                    city. For if a man were born so divinely giftedthat he could 
                    naturally apprehend the truth, he would have no needof laws 
                    to rule over him; for there is no law or order which isabove 
                    knowledge, nor can mind, without impiety, be deemed thesubject 
                    or slave of any man, but rather the lord of all. I speak ofmind, 
                    true and free, and in harmony with nature. But then there 
                    isno such mind anywhere, or at least not much; and therefore 
                    we mustchoose law and order, which are second best. These 
                    look at things asthey exist for the most part only, and are 
                    unable to survey thewhole of them. And therefore I have spoken 
                    as I have.</p>
                  <p>And now we will determine what penalty he ought to pay or 
                    suffer whohas hurt or wounded another. Any one may easily 
                    imagine thequestions which have to be asked in all such cases:-What 
                    did he wound,or whom, or how, or when? for there are innumerable 
                    particulars ofthis sort which greatly vary from one another. 
                    And to allow courtsof law to determine all these things, or 
                    not to determine any of them,is alike impossible. There is 
                    one particular which they must determinein all cases-the question 
                    of fact. And then, again, that thelegislator should not permit 
                    them to determine what punishment is tobe inflicted in any 
                    of these cases, but should himself decide about,of them, small 
                    or great, is next to impossible.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Then what is to be the inference?</p>
                  <p>Ath. The inference is, that some things should be left to 
                    courtsof law; others the legislator must decide for himself.</p>
                  <p>Cle. And what ought the legislator to decide, and what ought 
                    he toleave to courts of law?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I may reply, that in a state in which the courts are 
                    bad andmute, because the judges conceal their opinions and 
                    decide causesclandestinely; or what is worse, when they are 
                    disorderly and noisy,as in a theatre, clapping or hooting 
                    in turn this or that orator-I saythat then there is a very 
                    serious evil, which affects the whole state.Unfortunate is 
                    the necessity of having to legislate for such courts,but where 
                    the necessity exists, the legislator should only allowthem 
                    to ordain the penalties for the smallest offences; if the 
                    statefor which he is legislating be of this character, he 
                    must take mostmatters into his own hands and speak distinctly. 
                    But when a statehas good courts, and the judges are well trained 
                    and scrupulouslytested, the determination of the penalties 
                    or punishments whichshall be inflicted on the guilty may fairly 
                    and with advantage be leftto them. And we are not to be blamed 
                    for not legislating concerningall that large class of matters 
                    which judges far worse educated thanours would be able to 
                    determine, assigning to each offence what is dueboth to the 
                    perpetrator and to the sufferer. We believe those for whomwe 
                    are legislating to be best able to judge, and therefore to 
                    them thegreater part may be left. At the same time, as I have 
                    often said, weshould exhibit to the judges, as we have done, 
                    the outline and form ofthe punishments to be inflicted, and 
                    then they will not transgress thejust rule. That was an excellent 
                    practice, which we observed before,and which now that we are 
                    resuming the work of legislation, may withadvantage be repeated 
                    by us.</p>
                  <p>Let the enactment about wounding be in the following terms:-Ifanyone 
                    has a purpose and intention to slay another who is not hisenemy, 
                    and whom the law does not permit him to slay, and he woundshim, 
                    but is unable to kill him, he who had the intent and haswounded 
                    him is not to be pitied-he deserves no consideration, butshould 
                    be regarded as a murderer and be tried for murder. Still havingrespect 
                    to the fortune which has in a manner favoured him, and tothe 
                    providence which in pity to him and to the wounded man saved 
                    theone from a fatal blow, and the other from an accursed fate 
                    andcalamity-as a thank-offering to this deity, and in order 
                    not to opposehis will-in such a case the law will remit the 
                    punishment of death,and only compel the offender to emigrate 
                    to a neighbouring city forthe rest of his life, where he shall 
                    remain in the enjoyment of allhis possessions. But if he have 
                    injured the wounded man, he shall makesuch compensation for 
                    the injury as the court deciding the cause shallassess, and 
                    the same judges shall decide who would have decided if theman 
                    had died of his wounds. And if a child intentionally wound 
                    hisparents, or a servant his master, death shall be the penalty. 
                    And if abrother ora sister intentionally wound a brother or 
                    a sister, and isfound guilty, death shall be the penalty. 
                    And if a husband wound awife, or a wife a husband, with intent 
                    to kill, let him or her undergoperpetual exile; if they have 
                    sons or daughters who are still young,the guardians shall 
                    take care of their property, and have charge ofthe children 
                    as orphans. If their sons are grown up, they shall beunder 
                    no obligation to support the exiled parent, but they shallpossess 
                    the property themselves. And if he who meets with such amisfortune 
                    has no children, the kindred of the exiled man to thedegree 
                    of sons of cousins, both on the male and female side, shallmeet 
                    together, and after taking counsel with the guardians of theand 
                    the priests, shall appoint a 5040th citizen to be the heir 
                    ofthe house, considering and reasoning that no house of all 
                    the 5040belongs to the inhabitant or to the whole family, 
                    but is the publicand private property of the state. Now the 
                    state should seek to haveits houses as holy and happy as possible. 
                    And if any one of the housesbe unfortunate, and stained with 
                    impiety, and the owner leave noposterity, but dies unmarried, 
                    or married and childless, havingsuffered death as the penalty 
                    of murder or some other crimecommitted against the Gods or 
                    against his fellow-citizens, of whichdeath is the penalty 
                    distinctly laid down in the law; or if any of thecitizens 
                    be in perpetual exile, and also childless, that house shallfirst 
                    of all be purified and undergo expiation according to law; 
                    andthen let the kinsmen of the house, as we were just now 
                    saying, and theguardians of the law, meet and consider what 
                    family there is in thestate which is of the highest repute 
                    for virtue and also for goodfortune, in which there are a 
                    number of sons; from that family letthem take one and introduce 
                    him to the father and forefathers of thedead man as their 
                    son, and, for the sake of the omen, let him becalled so, that 
                    he may be the continuer of their family, the keeper oftheir 
                    hearth, and the minister of their sacred rites with betterfortune 
                    than his father had; and when they have made thissupplication, 
                    they shall make him heir according to law, and theoffending 
                    person they shall leave nameless and childless andportionless 
                    when calamities such as these overtake him.</p>
                  <p>Now the boundaries of some things do not touch one another, 
                    butthere is a borderland which comes in between, preventing 
                    them fromtouching. And we were saying that actions done from 
                    passion are ofthis nature, and come in between the voluntary 
                    and involuntary. If aperson be convicted of having inflicted 
                    wounds in a passion, in thefirst place he shall pay twice 
                    the amount of the injury, if thewound be curable, or, if incurable, 
                    four times the amount of theinjury; or if the wound be curable, 
                    and at the same time cause greatand notable disgrace to the 
                    wounded person, he shall pay fourfold. Andwhenever any one 
                    in wounding another injures not only the sufferer,but also 
                    the city, and makes him incapable of defending his countryagainst 
                    the enemy, he, besides the other penalties, shall pay apenalty 
                    for the loss which the state has incurred. And the penaltyshall 
                    be, that in addition to his own times of service, he shall 
                    serveon behalf of the disabled person, and shall take his 
                    place in war; or,if he refuse, he shall be liable to be convicted 
                    by law of refusalto serve. The compensation for the injury, 
                    whether to be twofold orthreefold or fourfold, shall be fixed 
                    by the judges who convict him.And if, in like manner, a brother 
                    wounds a brother, the parents andkindred of either sex, including 
                    the children of cousins, whether onthe male or female side, 
                    shall meet, and when they have judged thecause, they shall 
                    entrust the assessment of damages to the parents, asis natural; 
                    and if the estimate be disputed, then the kinsmen on themale 
                    side shall make the estimate, or if they cannot, they shallcommit 
                    the matter to the guardians of the law. And when similarcharges 
                    of wounding are brought by children against their parents,those 
                    who are more than sixty years of age, having children of theirown, 
                    not adopted, shall be required to decide; and if any one isconvicted, 
                    they shall determine whether he or she ought to die, orsuffer 
                    some other punishment either greater than death, or, at anyrate, 
                    not much less. A kinsman of the offender shall not be allowed 
                    tojudge the cause, not even if he be of the age which is prescribed 
                    bythe law. If a slave in a fit of anger wound a freeman, the 
                    owner ofthe slave shall give him up to the wounded man, who 
                    may do as hepleases with him, and if be not give him up he 
                    shall himself make goodthe injury. And if any one says that 
                    the slave and the wounded man areconspiring together, let 
                    him argue the point, and if he is cast, heshall pay for the 
                    wrong three times over, but if he gains his case,the freeman 
                    who conspired with the slave shall reliable to an actionfor 
                    kidnapping. And if any one unintentionally wounds another 
                    he shallsimply pay for the harm, for no legislator is able 
                    to controlchance. In such a case the judges shall be the same 
                    as those who areappointed in the case of children suing their 
                    parents; and theyshall estimate the amount of the injury.</p>
                  <p>All the preceding injuries and every kind of assault are 
                    deeds ofviolence; and every man, woman, or child ought to 
                    consider that theelder has the precedence of the younger in 
                    honour, both among the Godsand also among men who would live 
                    in security and happiness. Whereforeit is a foul thing and 
                    hateful to the Gods to see an elder manassaulted by a younger 
                    in the city; and it is reasonable that ayoung man when struck 
                    by an elder should lightly endure his anger,laying up in store 
                    for himself a like honour when he is old. Letthis be the law:-Every 
                    one shall reverence his elder in word and deed;he shall respect 
                    any one who is twenty years older than himself,whether male 
                    or female, regarding him or her as his father ormother; and 
                    he shall abstain from laying hands on any one who is of anage 
                    to have been his father or his mother, out of reverence to 
                    theGods who preside over birth; similarly he shall keep his 
                    hands froma stranger, whether he be an old inhabitant or newly 
                    arrived; he shallnot venture to correct such an one by blows, 
                    either as the aggressoror in self-defence. If he thinks that 
                    some stranger has struck him outof wantonness or insolence, 
                    and ought to be punished, he shall takehim to the wardens 
                    of the city, but let him not strike him, that thestranger 
                    may be kept far away from the possibility of lifting up hishand 
                    against a citizen, and let the wardens of the city take theoffender 
                    and examine him, not forgetting their duty to the God ofStrangers, 
                    and in case the stranger appears to have struck the citizenunjustly, 
                    let them inflict upon him as many blows with the scourgeas 
                    he has himself inflicted, and quell his presumption. But if 
                    he beinnocent, they shall threaten and rebuke the man who 
                    arrested him, andlet them both go. If a person strikes another 
                    of the same age orsomewhat older than himself, who has no 
                    children, whether he be an oldman who strikes an old man or 
                    a young man who strikes a young man, letthe person struck 
                    defend himself in the natural way without a weaponand with 
                    his hands only. He who, being more than forty years of age,dares 
                    to fight with another, whether he be the aggressor or in selfdefence, 
                    shall be regarded as rude and ill-mannered andslavish;-this 
                    will be a disgraceful punishment, and therefore suitableto 
                    him. The obedient nature will readily yield to such exhortations,but 
                    the disobedient, who heeds not the prelude, shall have the 
                    lawready for him:-If any man smite another who is older than 
                    himself,either by twenty or by more years, in the first place, 
                    he who is athand, not being younger than the combatants, nor 
                    their equal in age,shall separate them, or be disgraced according 
                    to law; but if he bethe equal in age of the person who is 
                    struck or younger, he shalldefend the person injured as he 
                    would a brother or father or stillolder relative. Further, 
                    let him who dares to smite an elder betried for assault, as 
                    I have said, and if he be found guilty, lethim be imprisoned 
                    for a period of not less than a year, or if thejudges approve 
                    of a longer period, their decision shall be final.But if a 
                    stranger or metic smite one who is older by twenty years ormore, 
                    the same law shall hold about the bystanders assisting, and 
                    hewho is found guilty in such a suit, if he be a stranger 
                    but notresident, shall be imprisoned during a period of two 
                    years; and ametic who disobeys the laws shall be imprisoned 
                    for three years,unless the court assign him a longer term. 
                    And let him who was presentin any of these cases and did not 
                    assist according to law be punished,if he be of the highest 
                    dass, by paying a fine of a mina; or if hebe of the second 
                    class, of fifty drachmas; or if of the third class,by a fine 
                    of thirty drachmas; or if he be of the fourth class, by afine 
                    of twenty drachmas; and the generals and taxiarchs andphylarchs 
                    and hipparchs shall form the court in such cases.</p>
                  <p>Laws are partly framed for the sake of good men, in order 
                    toinstruct them how they thay live on friendly terms with 
                    one another,and partly for the sake of those who refuse to 
                    be instructed, whosespirit cannot be subdued, or softened, 
                    or hindered from plunginginto evil. These are the persons 
                    who cause the word to be spoken whichI am about to utter; 
                    for them the legislator legislates ofnecessity, and in the 
                    hope that there may be no need of his laws. Hewho shall dare 
                    to lay violent hands upon his father or mother, orany still 
                    older relative, having no fear either of the wrath of theGods 
                    above, or of the punishments that are spoken of in the worldbelow, 
                    but transgresses in contempt of ancient and universaltraditions 
                    as though he were too wise to believe in them, requiressome 
                    extreme measure of prevention. Now death is not the worst 
                    thatcan happen to men; far worse are the punishments which 
                    are said topursue them in the world below. But although they 
                    are most true tales,they work on such souls no prevention; 
                    for if they had any effectthere would be no slayers of mothers, 
                    or impious hands lifted upagainst parents; and therefore the 
                    punishments of this world which areinflicted during life ought 
                    not in such cases to fall short, ifpossible, of the terrors 
                    of the world below. Let our enactment then beas follows:-If 
                    a man dare to strike his father or his mother, or theirfathers 
                    or mothers, he being at the time of sound mind, then let anyone 
                    who is at hand come to the rescue as has been already said, 
                    andthe metic or stranger who comes to the rescue shall be 
                    called to thefirst place in the games; but if he do not come 
                    he shall suffer thepunishment of perpetual exile. He who is 
                    not a metic, if he comes tothe rescue, shall have praise, 
                    and if he do not come, blame. And ifa slave come to the rescue, 
                    let him be made free, but if he do notcome the rescue, let 
                    him receive 100 strokes of the whip, by orderof the wardens 
                    of the agora, if the occurrence take place in theagora; or 
                    if somewhere in the city beyond the limits of the agora, anywarden 
                    of the city is in residence shall punish him; or if in thecountry, 
                    then the commanders of the wardens of the country. If thosewho 
                    are near at the time be inhabitants of the same place, whetherthey 
                    be youths, or men, or women, let them come to the rescue anddenounce 
                    him as the impious one; and he who does not come to therescue 
                    shall fall under the curse of Zeus, the God of kindred and 
                    ofancestors, according to law. And if any one is found guilty 
                    ofassaulting a parent, let him in the first place be for ever 
                    banishedfrom the city into the country, and let him abstain 
                    from thetemples; and if he do not abstain, the wardens of 
                    the country shallpunish him with blows, or in any way which 
                    they please, and if hereturn he shall be put to death. And 
                    if any freeman eat or drink, orhave any other sort of intercourse 
                    with him, or only meeting himhave voluntarily touched him, 
                    he shall not enter into any temple,nor into the agora, nor 
                    into the city, until he is purified; for heshould consider 
                    that he has become tainted by a curse. And if hedisobeys the 
                    law, and pollutes the city and the temples contrary tolaw, 
                    and one of the magistrates sees him and does not indict him, 
                    whenhe gives in his account this omission shall be a most 
                    serious charge.</p>
                  <p>If a slave strike a freeman, whether a stranger or a citizen, 
                    letany one who is present come to the rescue, or pay the penaltyalready 
                    mentioned; and let the bystanders bind him, and deliver him 
                    upto the injured person, and he receiving him shall put him 
                    in chains,and inflict on him as many stripes as he pleases; 
                    but havingpunished him he must surrender him to his master 
                    according to law, andnot deprive him of his property. Let 
                    the law be as follows:-Theslave who strikes a freeman, not 
                    at the command of the magistrates,his owner shall receive 
                    bound from the man whom he has stricken, andnot release him 
                    until the slave has persuaded the man whom he hasstricken 
                    that he ought to be released. And let there be the samelaws 
                    about women in relation to women, about men and women in relationto 
                    one another.</p>

                    If a herald or an ambassador carry a false message from our 
                    cityto any other, or bring back a false message from the city 
                    to whichhe is sent, or be proved to have brought back, whether 
                    from friends orenemies, in his capacity of herald or ambassador, 
                    what they have neversaid, let him be indicted for having violated, 
                    contrary to the law,the commands and duties imposed upon him 
                    by Hermes and Zeus, and letthere be a penalty fixed, which 
                    he shall suffer or pay if he beconvicted.</p>
                  <p>Theft is a mean, and robbery a shameless thing; and none 
                    of the sonsof Zeus delight in fraud and violence, or ever 
                    practised, either.Wherefore let no one be deluded by poets 
                    or mythologers into amistaken belief of such such things, 
                    nor let him suppose, when hethieves or is guilty of violence, 
                    that he is doing nothing base, butonly what the Gods themselves 
                    do. For such tales are untrue andimprobable; and he who steals 
                    or robs contrary to the law, is nevereither a God or the son 
                    of a God; of this the legislator ought to bebetter informed 
                    than all the, poets put together. Happy is he andmay he be 
                    forever happy, who is persuaded and listens to our words;but 
                    he who disobeys shall have to contend against the followinglaw:-If 
                    a man steal anything belonging to the public, whether thatwhich 
                    he steals be much or little, he shall have the samepunishment. 
                    For he who steals a little steals with the same wish as hewho 
                    steals much, but with less power, and he who takes up a greateramount; 
                    not having deposited it, is wholly unjust. Wherefore the lawis 
                    not disposed to inflict a less penalty on the one than on 
                    the otherbecause his theft, is less, but on the ground that 
                    the thief maypossibly be in one case still curable, and may 
                    in another case beincurable. If any one convict in a court 
                    of law a stranger or aslave of a theft of public property, 
                    let the court determine whatpunishment he shall suffer, or 
                    what penalty he shall pay, bearing inmind that he is probably 
                    not incurable. But the citizen who has beenbrought up as our 
                    citizens will have been, if he be found guilty ofrobbing his 
                    country by fraud or violence, whether he be caught inthe act 
                    or not, shall be punished with death; for he is incurable.</p>
                  <p>Now for expeditions of war much consideration and many laws 
                    arerequired; the great principle of all is that no one of 
                    either sexshould be without a commander; nor should the mind 
                    of any one beaccustomed to do anything, either in jest or 
                    earnest, of his ownmotion, but in war and in peace he should 
                    look to and follow hisleader, even in the least things being 
                    under his guidance; forexample, he should stand or move, or 
                    exercise, or wash, or take hismeals, or get up in the night 
                    to keep guard and deliver messageswhen he is bidden; and in 
                    the hour of danger he should not pursueand not retreat except 
                    by order of his superior; and in a word, notteach the soul 
                    or accustom her to know or understand how to doanything apart 
                    from others. Of all soldiers the life should bealways and 
                    in all things as far as possible in common and together;there 
                    neither is nor ever will be a higher, or better, or morescientific 
                    principle than this for the attainment of salvation andvictory 
                    in war. And we ought in time of peace from youth upwards topractise 
                    this habit of commanding others, and of being commanded byothers; 
                    anarchy should have no place in the life of man or of thebeasts 
                    who are subject to man. I may add that all dances ought to 
                    beperformed with view to military excellence; and agility 
                    and easeshould be cultivated for the same object, and also 
                    endurance of thewant of meats and drinks, and of winter cold 
                    and summer heat, and ofhard couches; and, above all, care 
                    should be taken not to destroythe peculiar qualities of the 
                    head and the feet by surrounding themwith extraneous coverings, 
                    and so hindering their natural growth ofhair and soles. For 
                    these are the extremities, and of all the parts ofthe body, 
                    whether they are preserved or not is of the greatestconsequence; 
                    the one is the servant of the whole body, and the otherthe 
                    master, in whom all the ruling senses are by nature set. Let 
                    theyoung man imagine that he hears in what has preceded the 
                    praises ofthe military life; the law shall be as follows:-He 
                    shall serve inwar who is on the roll or appointed to some 
                    special service, and ifany one is absent from cowardice, and 
                    without the leave of thegenerals; he shall be indicted before 
                    the military commanders forfailure of service when the army 
                    comes home; and the soldiers shall behis judges; the heavy 
                    armed, and the cavalry, and the other arms ofthe service shall 
                    form separate courts; and they shall bring theheavy-armed 
                    before the heavy-armed, and the horsemen before thehorsemen, 
                    and the others in like manner before their peers; and he whois 
                    found guilty shall never be allowed to compete for any prize 
                    ofvalour, or indict another for not serving on an expedition, 
                    or be anaccuser at all in any military matters. Moreover, 
                    the court shallfurther determine what punishment he shall 
                    suffer, or what penaltyhe shall pay. When the suits for failure 
                    of service are completed, theleaders of the several kinds 
                    of troops shall again hold an assembly,and they shall adjudge 
                    the prizes of valour; and he who likes shallgive judgment 
                    in his own branch of the service, saying nothing aboutany 
                    former expedition, nor producing any proof or witnesses to 
                    confirmhis statement, but speaking only of the present occasion. 
                    The crown ofvictory shall be an olive wreath which the victor 
                    shall offer up thetemple of any war-god whom he likes, adding 
                    an inscription for atestimony to last during life, that such 
                    an one has received thefirst, the second, or prize. If any 
                    one goes on an expedition, andreturns home before the appointed 
                    time, when the generals. have notwithdrawn the army, be shall 
                    be indicted for desertion before the samepersons who took 
                    cognisance of failure of service, and if he befound guilty, 
                    the same punishment shall be inflicted on him.</p>
                  <p>Now every man who is engaged in any suit ought to be very 
                    careful ofbringing false witness against any one, either intentionally 
                    orunintentionally, if he can help; for justice is truly said 
                    to be anhonourable maiden, and falsehood is naturally repugnant 
                    to honourand justice. A witness ought to be very careful not 
                    to sift againstjustice, as for example in what relates to 
                    the throwing away ofarms-he must distinguish the throwing 
                    them away when necessary, andnot make that a reproach, or 
                    bring in action against some innocentperson on that account. 
                    To make the distinction maybe difficult; butstill the law 
                    must attempt to define the different kinds in someway. Let 
                    me endeavour to explain my meaning by an ancient tale:-IfPatroclus 
                    had been brought to the tent still alive but without hisarms 
                    (and this has happened to innumerable persons), the originalarms, 
                    which the poet says were presented to Peleus by the Gods as 
                    anuptial gift when he married. Thetis, remaining in the hands 
                    ofHector, then the base spirits of that day might have reproached 
                    theson of Menoetius with having cast away his arms. Again, 
                    there is thecase of those who have been thrown down precipices 
                    and lost theirarms; and of those who at sea, and in stormy 
                    places, have beensuddenly overwhelmed by floods of water; 
                    and there are numberlessthings of this kind which one might 
                    adduce by way of extenuation,and with the view of justifying 
                    a misfortune which is easilymisrepresented. We must, therefore, 
                    endeavour to divide to the best ofour power the greater and 
                    more serious evil from the lesser. And adistinction may be 
                    drawn in the use of terms of reproach. A man doesnot always 
                    deserve to be called the thrower away of his shield; he maybe 
                    only the loser of his arms. For there is a great or rather 
                    absolutedifference between him who is deprived of his arms 
                    by a sufficientforce, and him who voluntarily lets his shield 
                    go. Let the law then beas follows:-If a person having arms 
                    is overtaken by the enemy and doesnot turn round and defend 
                    himself, but lets them go voluntarily orthrows them away, 
                    choosing a base life and a swift escape ratherthan a courageous 
                    and noble and blessed death-in such a case of thethrowing 
                    away of arms let justice be done, but the judge need takeno 
                    note of the case just now mentioned; for the bad man ought 
                    alwaysto be punished, in the hope that he may be improved, 
                    but not theunfortunate, for there is no advantage in that. 
                    And what shall bethe punishment suited to him who has thrown 
                    away his weapons ofdefence? Tradition says that Caeneus, the 
                    Thessalian, was changed by aGod from a woman into a man; but 
                    the converse miracle cannot now bewrought, or no punishment 
                    would be more proper than that the man whothrows away his 
                    shield should be changed into a woman. This however isimpossible, 
                    and therefore let us make a law as nearly like this aswe can-that 
                    he who loves his life too well shall be in no danger forthe 
                    remainder of his days, but shall live for ever under the stigma 
                    ofcowardice. And let the law be in the following terms:-When 
                    a man isfound guilty of disgracefully throwing away his arms 
                    in war, nogeneral or military officer shall allow him to serve 
                    as a soldier,or give him any place at all in the ranks of 
                    soldiers; and the officerwho gives the coward any place, shall 
                    suffer a penalty which thepublic examiner shall exact of him; 
                    and if he be of the highestdass, he shall pay a thousand drachmae; 
                    or if he be of the secondclass, five minae; or if he be of 
                    the third, three minae; or if hebe of the fourth class, one 
                    mina. And he who is found guilty ofcowardice, shall not only 
                    be dismissed from manly dangers, which isa disgrace appropriate 
                    to his nature, but he shall pay a thousanddrachmae, if he 
                    be of the highest class, and five minae if he be ofthe second 
                    class, and three if he be of the third class, and a mina,like 
                    the preceding, if he be of the fourth class.</p>
                  <p>What regulations will be proper about examiners, seeing that 
                    some ofour magistrates are elected by lot, and for a year, 
                    and some for alonger time and from selected persons? Of such 
                    magistrates, who willbe a sufficient censor or examiner, if 
                    any of them, weighed down bythe pressure of office or his 
                    own inability to support the dignityof his office, be guilty 
                    of any crooked practice? It is by no meanseasy to find a magistrate 
                    who excels other magistrates in virtue,but still we must endeavour 
                    to discover some censor or examiner who ismore than man. For 
                    the truth is, that there are many elements ofdissolution in 
                    a state, as there are also in a ship, or in ananimal; they 
                    all have their cords, and girders, and sinews-onenature diffused 
                    in many places, and called by many names; and theoffice of 
                    examiner is a most important element in the preservation anddissolution 
                    of states. For if the examiners are better than themagistrates, 
                    and their duty is fulfilled justly and without blame,then 
                    the whole state and country flourishes and is happy; but if 
                    theexamination of the magistrates is carried on in a wrong 
                    way, then,by the relaxation of that justice which is the uniting 
                    principle ofall constitutions, every power in the state is 
                    rent asunder from everyother; they no longer incline in the 
                    same direction, but fill the citywith faction, and make many 
                    cities out of one, and soon bring all todestruction. Wherefore 
                    the examiners ought to be admirable in everysort of virtue. 
                    Let us invent a mode of creating them, which shallbe as follows:-Every 
                    year, after the summer solstice, the whole cityshall meet 
                    in the common precincts of Helios and Apollo, and shallpresent 
                    to the God three men out of their own number in the mannerfollowing:-Each 
                    citizen shall select, not himself, but some othercitizen whom 
                    he deems in every way the best, and who is not lessthan fifty 
                    years of age. And out of the selected persons who havethe 
                    greatest number of votes, they shall make a further selectionuntil 
                    they reduce them to one-half, if they are an even number; 
                    but ifthey are not an even number, they shall subtract the 
                    one who has thesmallest number of votes, and make them an 
                    even number, and then leavethe half which have the great number 
                    of votes. And if two persons havean equal number of votes, 
                    and thus increase the number beyondone-half, they shall withdraw 
                    the younger of the two and do awaywith the excess; and then 
                    including all the rest they shall againvote, until there are 
                    left three having an unequal number of votes.But if all the 
                    three, or two out of the three, have equal votes, letthem 
                    commit the election to good fate and fortune, and separate 
                    off bylot the first, and the second, and the third; these 
                    they shall crownwith an olive wreath and give them the prize 
                    of excellence, at thesame time proclaiming to all the world 
                    that the city of theMagnetes, by providence of the Gods, is 
                    again preserved, andpresents to the Sun and to Apollo her 
                    three best men asfirst-fruits, to be a common offering to 
                    them, according to theancient law, as long as their lives 
                    answer to the judgment formed ofthem. And these shall appoint 
                    in their first year twelve examiners, tocontinue until each 
                    has completed seventy-five years, to whom threeshall afterwards 
                    be added yearly; and let these divide all themagistracies 
                    into twelve parts, and prove the holders of them by everysort 
                    of test to which a freeman may be subjected; and let them 
                    livewhile they hold office in the precinct of Helios and Apollo, 
                    inwhich they were chosen, and let each one form a judgment 
                    of somethings individually, and of others in company with 
                    his colleagues; andlet him place a writing in the agora about 
                    each magistracy, and whatthe magistrate ought to suffer or 
                    pay, according to the decision ofthe examiners. And if a magistrate 
                    does not admit that he has beenjustly judged, let him bring 
                    the examiners before the select judges,and if he be acquitted 
                    by their decision, let him, if he will,accuse the examiners 
                    themselves; if, however, he be convicted, andhave been condemned 
                    to death by the examiners, let him die (and ofcourse he can 
                    only die once):-but any other penalties which admit ofbeing 
                    doubled let him suffer twice over.</p>
                  <p>And now let us pass under review the examiners themselves; 
                    what willtheir examination be, and how conducted? During the 
                    life of these men,whom the whole state counts worthy of the 
                    rewards of virtue, theyshall have the first seat at all public 
                    assemblies, and at allHellenic sacrifices and sacred missions, 
                    and other public and holyceremonies in which they share. The 
                    chiefs of each sacred missionshall be selected from them, 
                    and they only of all the citizens shallbe adorned with a crown 
                    of laurel; they shall all be priests of Apolloand Helios; 
                    and one of them, who is judged first of the priestscreated 
                    in that year, shall be high priest; and they shall write uphis 
                    name in each year to be a measure of time as long as the citylasts; 
                    and after their death they shall be laid out and carried to 
                    thegrave and entombed in a manner different from the other 
                    citizens. Theyshall be decked in a robe all of white, and 
                    there shall be no cryingor lamentation over them; but a chorus 
                    of fifteen maidens, and anotherof boys, shall stand around 
                    the bier on either side, hymning thepraises of the departed 
                    priests in alternate responses, declaringtheir blessedness 
                    in song all day long; and at dawn a hundred of theyouths who 
                    practise gymnastic and whom the relations of the departedshall 
                    choose, shall carry the bier to the sepulchre, the young menmarching 
                    first, dressed in the garb of warriors-the cavalry with theirhorses, 
                    the heavy-armed with their arms, and the others in likemanner. 
                    And boys neat the bier and in front of it shall sing theirnational 
                    hymn, and maidens shall follow behind, and with them thewomen 
                    who have passed the age of childbearing; next, although they 
                    areinterdicted from other burials, let priests and priestesses 
                    follow,unless the Pythian oracle forbid them; for this burial 
                    is free frompollution. The place of burial shall be an oblong 
                    vaulted chamberunderground, constructed of tufa, which will 
                    last for ever, havingstone couches placed side by side. And 
                    here they will lay theblessed person, and cover the sepulchre 
                    with a circular mound of earthand plant a grove of trees around 
                    on every side but one; and on thatside the sepulchre shall 
                    be allowed to extend for ever, and a newmound will not be 
                    required. Every year they shall have contests inmusic and 
                    gymnastics, and in horsemanship, in honour of the dead.These 
                    are the honours which shall be given to those who at theexamination 
                    are found blameless; but if any of them, trusting to thescrutiny 
                    being over, should, after the judgment has been given,manifest 
                    the wickedness of human nature, let the law ordain that hewho 
                    pleases shall indict him, and let the cause be tried in thefollowing 
                    manner. In the first place, the court shall be composed ofthe 
                    guardians of the law, and to them the surviving examiners 
                    shall beadded, as well as the court of select judges; and 
                    let the pursuerlay his indictment in this form-he shall say 
                    that so-and-so isunworthy of the prize of virtue and of his 
                    office; and if thedefendant be convicted let him be deprived 
                    of his office, and of theburial, and of the other honours 
                    given him. But if the prosecutor donot obtain the fifth part 
                    of the votes, let him, if he be of the firstdass, pay twelve 
                    minae, and eight if he be of the second class, andsix if he 
                    be of the third dass, and two minae if he be of the fourthclass.</p>
                  <p>The so-called decision of Rhadamanthus is worthy of alladmiration. 
                    He knew that the men of his own time believed and had nodoubt 
                    that there were Gods, which was a reasonable belief in thosedays, 
                    because most men were the sons of Gods, and according totradition 
                    he was one himself. He appears to have thought that he oughtto 
                    commit judgment to no man, but to the Gods only, and in this 
                    waysuits were simply and speedily decided by him. For he made 
                    the twoparties take an oath respecting the points in dispute, 
                    and so gotrid of the matter speedily and safely. But now that 
                    a certainportion of mankind do not believe at all in the existence 
                    of the Gods,and others imagine that they have no care of us, 
                    and the opinion ofmost men, and of the men, is that in return 
                    for small sacrifice anda few flattering words they will be 
                    their accomplices in purloininglarge sums and save them from 
                    many terrible punishments, the way ofRhadamanthus is no longer 
                    suited to the needs of justice; for as theneeds of men about 
                    the Gods are changed, the laws should also bechanged;-in the 
                    granting of suits a rational legislation ought to doaway with 
                    the oaths of the parties on either side-he who obtains leaveto 
                    bring an action should write, down the charges, but should 
                    notadd an oath; and the defendant in like manner should give 
                    his denialto the magistrates in writing, and not swear; for 
                    it is a dreadfulthing to know, when many lawsuits are going 
                    on in a state thatalmost half the people who meet one another 
                    quite unconcernedly at thepublic meals and in other companies 
                    and relations of private lifeare perjured. Let the law, then, 
                    be as follows:-A judge who is aboutto give judgment shall 
                    take an oath, and he who is choosingmagistrates for the state 
                    shall either vote on oath or with a votingtablet which he 
                    brings from a temple; so too the judge of dances andof all 
                    music, and the superintendents and umpires of gymnastic andequestrian 
                    contests, and any matters in which, as far as men canjudge, 
                    there is nothing to be gained by a false oath; but all cases 
                    inwhich a denial confirmed by an oath clearly results in a 
                    greatadvantage to the taker of the oath, shall be decided 
                    without theoath of the parties to the suit, and the presiding 
                    judges shall notpermit either of them. to use an oath for 
                    the sake of persuading,nor to call down curses on himself 
                    and his race, nor to use unseemlysupplications or womanish 
                    laments. But they shall ever be teaching andlearning what 
                    is just in auspicious words; and he who does otherwiseshall 
                    be supposed to speak beside the point, and the judges shallagain 
                    bring him back to the question at issue. On the other hand,strangers 
                    in their dealings with strangers shall as at present havepower 
                    to give and receive oaths, for they will not often grow old 
                    inthe city or leave a fry of young ones like themselves to 
                    be the sonsand heirs of the land.</p>
                  <p>As to the initiation of private suits, let the manner of 
                    decidingcauses between all citizens be the same as in cases 
                    in which anyfreeman is disobedient to the state in minor matters, 
                    of which thepenalty is not stripes, imprisonment, or death. 
                    But as regardsattendance at choruses or processions or other 
                    shows, and as regardspublic services, whether the celebration 
                    of sacrifice in peace, or thepayment of contributions in war-in 
                    all these cases, first comes thenecessity of providing remedy 
                    for the loss; and by those who willnot obey, there shall be 
                    security given to the officers whom thecity and the law empower 
                    to exact the sum due; and if they forfeittheir security, let 
                    the goods which they have pledged be, and themoney given to 
                    the city; but if they ought to pay a larger sum, theseveral 
                    magistrates shall impose upon the disobedient a suitablepenalty, 
                    and bring them before the court, until they are willing to 
                    dowhat they are ordered.</p>
                  <p>Now a state which makes money from the cultivation of the 
                    soil only,and has no foreign trade, must consider what it 
                    will do about theemigration of its own people to other countries, 
                    and the receptionof strangers from elsewhere. About these 
                    matters the legislator has toconsider, and he will begin by 
                    trying to persuade men as far as hecan. The intercourse of 
                    cities with one another is apt to create aconfusion of manners; 
                    strangers, are always suggesting novelties tostrangers. When 
                    states are well governed by good laws the mixturecauses the 
                    greatest possible injury; but seeing that most cities arethe 
                    reverse of well-ordered, the confusion which arises in them 
                    fromthe reception of strangers, and from the citizens themselves 
                    rushingoff into other cities, when any one either young or 
                    old desires totravel anywhere abroad at whatever time, is 
                    of no consequence. Onthe other hand, the refusal of states 
                    to receive others, and for theirown citizens never to go to 
                    other places, is an utter impossibility,and to the rest of 
                    the world is likely to appear ruthless anduncivilized; it 
                    is a practise adopted by people who use harsh words,such as 
                    xenelasia or banishment of strangers, and who have harsh andmorose 
                    ways, as men think. And to be thought or not to be thought 
                    wellof by the rest of the world is no light matter; for the 
                    many are notso far wrong in their judgment of who are bad 
                    and who are good, asthey are removed from the nature of virtue 
                    in themselves. Even bad menhave a divine instinct which guesses 
                    rightly, and very many who areutterly depraved form correct 
                    notions and judgments of the differencesbetween the good and 
                    bad. And the generality of cities are quite rightin exhorting 
                    us to value a good reputation in the world, for thereis no 
                    truth greater and more important than this-that he who is 
                    reallygood (I am speaking of the man who would be perfect) 
                    seeks forreputation with, but not without, the reality of 
                    goodness. And ourCretan colony ought also to acquire the fairest 
                    and noblest reputationfor virtue from other men; and there 
                    is every reason to expect that,if the reality answers to the 
                    idea, she will before of the fewwell-ordered cities which 
                    the sun and the other Gods behold.Wherefore, in the matter 
                    of journeys to other countries and thereception of strangers, 
                    we enact as follows:-In the first place, letno one be allowed 
                    to go anywhere at all into a foreign country whois less than 
                    forty years of age; and no one shall go in a privatecapacity, 
                    but only in some public one, as a herald, or on anembassy; 
                    or on a sacred mission. Going abroad on an expedition or inwar, 
                    not to be included among travels of the class authorized by 
                    thestate. To Apollo at Delphi and to Zeus at Olympia and to 
                    Nemea andto the Isthmus,-citizens should be sent to take part 
                    in the sacrificesand games there dedicated to the Gods; and 
                    they should send as many aspossible, and the best and fairest 
                    that can be found, and they willmake the city renowned at 
                    holy meetings in time of peace, procuringa glory which shall 
                    be the converse of that which is gained in war;and when they 
                    come home they shall teach the young that theinstitutions 
                    of other states are inferior to their own. And they shallsend 
                    spectators of another sort, if they have the consent of theguardians, 
                    being such citizens as desire to look a little more atleisure 
                    at the doings of other men; and these no law shall hinder. 
                    Fora city which has no experience of good and bad men or intercourse 
                    withthem, can never be thoroughly, and perfectly civilized, 
                    nor, again,can the citizens of a city properly observe the 
                    laws by habit only,and without an intelligent understanding 
                    of them. And there always arein the world a few inspired men 
                    whose acquaintance is beyond price,and who spring up quite 
                    as much in ill-ordered as in well-orderedcities. These are 
                    they whom the citizens of a well ordered city shouldbe ever 
                    seeking out, going forth over sea and over land to find himwho 
                    is incorruptible-that he may establish more firmly institutions 
                    inhis own state which are good already; and amend what is 
                    deficient; forwithout this examination and enquiry a city 
                    will never continueperfect any more than if the examination 
                    is ill-conducted.</p>
                  <p>Cleinias. How can we have an examination and also a good 
                    one?</p>
                  <p>Athenian Stranger. In this way: In the first place, our spectatorshall 
                    be of not less than fifty years of age; he must be a man ofreputation, 
                    especially in war, if he is to exhibit to other cities amodel 
                    of the guardians of the law, but when he is more than sixtyyears 
                    of age he shall no longer continue in his office of spectator,And 
                    when he has carried on his inspection during as many out of 
                    theten years of his office as he pleases, on his return home 
                    let him goto the assembly of those who review the laws. This 
                    shall be a mixedbody of young and old men, who shall be required 
                    to meet daily betweenthe hour of dawn and the rising of the 
                    sun. They shall consist, in thefirst place, of the priests 
                    who have obtained the rewards of virtue;and in the second 
                    place, of guardians of the law, the ten eldest beingchosen; 
                    the general superintendent of education shall also bemember, 
                    as well the last appointed as those who have been releasedfrom 
                    the office; and each of them shall take with him as his companionyoung 
                    man, whomsoever he chooses, between the ages of thirty andforty. 
                    These shall be always holding conversation and discourseabout 
                    the laws of their own city or about any specially good oneswhich 
                    they may hear to be existing elsewhere; also about kinds ofknowledge 
                    which may appear to be of use and will throw light uponthe 
                    examination, or of which the want will make the subject of 
                    lawsdark and uncertain to them. Any knowledge of this sort 
                    which theelders approve, the younger men shall learn with 
                    all diligence; and ifany one of those who have been invited 
                    appear to be unworthy, thewhole assembly shall blame him who 
                    invited him. The rest of the cityshall watch over those among 
                    the young men who distinguish themselves,having an eye upon 
                    them, and especially honouring them if theysucceed, but dishonouring 
                    them above the rest if they turn out to beinferior. This is 
                    the assembly to which he who has visited theinstitutions of 
                    other men, on his return home shall straightway go,and if 
                    he have discovered any one who has anything to say about theenactment 
                    of laws or education or nurture, or if he have himselfmade 
                    any observations, let him communicate his discoveries to thewhole 
                    assembly. And if he be seen to have come home neither better 
                    norworse, let him be praised at any rate for his enthusiasm; 
                    and if he bemuch better, let him be praised so much the more; 
                    and not only whilehe lives but after his death let the assembly 
                    honour him withfitting honours. But if on his return home 
                    he appear to have beencorrupted, pretending to be wise when 
                    he is not, let him hold nocommunication with any one, whether 
                    young or old; and if he willhearken to the rulers, then he 
                    shall be permitted to live as a privateindividual; but if 
                    he will not, let him die, if he be convicted in acourt of 
                    law of interfering about education and the laws, And if hedeserve 
                    to be indicted, and none of the magistrates indict him, letthat 
                    be counted as a disgrace to them when the rewards of virtue 
                    aredecided.</p>
                  <p>Let such be the character of the person who goes abroad, 
                    and let himgo abroad under these conditions. In the next place, 
                    the strangerwho comes from abroad should be received in a 
                    friendly spirit. Nowthere are four kinds of strangers, of 
                    whom we must make somemention-the first is he who comes and 
                    stays throughout the summer;this class are like birds of passage, 
                    taking wing in pursuit ofcommerce, and flying over the sea 
                    to other cities, while the seasonlasts; he shall be received 
                    in market-places and harbours and publicbuildings, near the 
                    city but outside, by those magistrates who areappointed to 
                    superintend these matters; and they shall take carethat a 
                    stranger, whoever he be, duly receives justice; but he shallnot 
                    be allowed to make any innovation. They shall hold the intercoursewith 
                    him which is necessary, and this shall be as little aspossible. 
                    The second kind is just a spectator who comes to see withhis 
                    eyes and hear with his ears the festivals of the Muses; such 
                    oughtto have entertainment provided them at the temples by 
                    hospitablepersons, and the priests and ministers of the temples 
                    should see andattend to them. But they should not remain more 
                    than a reasonabletime; let them see and hear that for the 
                    sake of which they came,and then go away, neither having suffered 
                    nor done any harm. Thepriests shall be their judges, if any 
                    of them receive or do anywrong up to the sum of fifty drachmae, 
                    but if any greater charge bebrought, in such cases the suit 
                    shall come before the wardens of theagora. The third kind 
                    of stranger is he who comes on some publicbusiness from another 
                    land, and is to be received with public honours.He is to be 
                    received only by the generals and commanders of horseand foot, 
                    and the host by whom he is entertained, in conjunctionwith 
                    the Prytanes, shall have the sole charge of what concerns 
                    him.There is a fourth dass of persons answering to our spectators, 
                    whocome from another land to look at ours. In the first place, 
                    suchvisits will be rare, and the visitor should be at least 
                    fifty years ofage; he may possibly be wanting to see something 
                    that is rich and rarein other states, or himself to show something 
                    in like manner toanother city. Let such an one, then, go unbidden 
                    to the doors of thewise and rich, being one of them himself: 
                    let him go, for example,to the house of the superintendent 
                    of education, confident that heis a fitting guest of such 
                    a host, or let him go to the house ofsome of those who have 
                    gained the prize of virtue and hold discoursewith them, both 
                    learning from them, and also teaching them; and whenhe has 
                    seen and heard all, he shall depart, as a friend taking leaveof 
                    friends, and be honoured by them with gifts and suitable tributesof 
                    respect. These are the customs, according to which our cityshould 
                    receive all strangers of either sex who come from othercountries, 
                    and should send forth her own citizens, showing respectto 
                    Zeus, the God of hospitality, not forbidding strangers at 
                    meals andsacrifices, as is the manner which prevails among 
                    the children ofthe Nile, nor driving them away by savage proclamations.</p>
                  <p>When a man becomes surety, let him give the security in a 
                    distinctform, acknowledging the whole transaction in a written 
                    document, andin the presence of not less than three witnesses 
                    if the sum be under athousand drachmae, and of not less than 
                    five witnesses if the sum beabove a thousand drachmae. The 
                    agent of a dishonest or untrustworthyseller shall himself 
                    be responsible; both the agent and theprincipal shall be equally 
                    liable. If a person wishes to find anythingin the house of 
                    another, he shall enter naked, or wearing only a shorttunic 
                    and without a girdle, having first taken an oath by thecustomary 
                    Gods that he expects to find it there; he shall then makehis 
                    search, and the other shall throw open his house and allow 
                    himto search things both sealed and unsealed. And if a person 
                    will notallow the searcher to make his search, he who is prevented 
                    shall go tolaw with him, estimating the value of the goods 
                    after which he issearching, and if the other be convicted 
                    he shall pay twice thevalue of the article. If the master 
                    be absent from home, thedwellers in the house shall let him 
                    search the unsealed property,and on the sealed property the 
                    searcher shall set another seal, andshall appoint any one 
                    whom he likes to guard them during five days;and if the master 
                    of the house be absent during a longer time, heshall take 
                    with him the wardens of the city, and so make his search,opening 
                    the sealed property as well as the unsealed, and then,together 
                    with the members of the family and the wardens of the city,he 
                    shall seal them up again as they were before. There shall 
                    be alimit of time in the case of disputed things, and he who 
                    has hadpossession of them during a certain time shall no longer 
                    be liableto be disturbed. As to houses and lands there can 
                    be no dispute inthis state of ours; but if a man has any other 
                    possessions which hehas used and openly shown in the city 
                    and in the agora and in thetemples, and no one has put in 
                    a claim to them, and some one says thathe was looking for 
                    them during this time, and the possessor isproved to have 
                    made no concealment, if they have continued for a year,the 
                    one having the goods and the other looking for them, the claimof 
                    the seeker shall not be allowed after the expiration of the 
                    year;or if he does not use or show the lost property in the 
                    market or inthe city, but only in the country, and no one 
                    offers himself as theowner during five years, at the expiration 
                    of the five years the claimshall be barred for ever after; 
                    or if he uses them in the city butwithin the house, then the 
                    appointed time of claiming the goodsshall be three years, 
                    or ten years if he has them in the country inprivate. And 
                    if he has them in another land, there shall be no limitof 
                    time or prescription, but whenever the owner finds them he 
                    mayclaim them.</p>
                  <p>If any one prevents another by force from being present at 
                    atrial, whether a principal party or his witnesses; if the 
                    personprevented be a slave, whether his own or belonging to 
                    another, thesuit shall be incomplete and invalid; but if he 
                    who is prevented bea freeman, besides the suit being incomplete, 
                    the other who hasprevented him shall be imprisoned for a year, 
                    and shall beprosecuted for kidnapping by any one who pleases. 
                    And if any onehinders by force a rival competitor in gymnastic 
                    or music, or anyother sort of contest, from being present 
                    at the contest, let himwho has a mind inform the presiding 
                    judges, and they shall liberatehim who is desirous of competing; 
                    and if they are not able, and he whohinders the other from 
                    competing wins the prize, then they shallgive the prize of 
                    victory to him who is prevented, and inscribe him asthe conqueror 
                    in any temples which he pleases; and he who hindersthe other 
                    shall not be permitted to make any offering or inscriptionhaving 
                    reference to that contest, and in any case he shall be liablefor 
                    damages, whether he be defeated or whether he conquer.</p>
                  <p>If any one knowingly receives anything which has been stolen, 
                    heshall undergo the same punishment as the thief, and if a 
                    manreceives an exile he shall be punished with death. Every 
                    man shouldregard the friend and enemy of the state as his 
                    own friend andenemy; and if any one makes peace or war with 
                    another on his ownaccount, and without the authority of the 
                    state, he, like the receiverof the exile, shall undergo the 
                    penalty of death. And if anyfraction of the City declare war 
                    or peace against any, the generalsshall indict the authors 
                    of this proceeding, and if they are convicteddeath shall be 
                    the penalty. Those who serve their country ought toserve without 
                    receiving gifts, and there ought to be no excusing orapproving 
                    the saying, &quot;Men should receive gifts as the reward of 
                    good,but not of evil deeds&quot;; for to know which we are 
                    doing, and to standfast by our knowledge, is no easy matter. 
                    The safest course is to obeythe law which says, &quot;Do no 
                    service for a bribe,&quot; and let him whodisobeys, if he 
                    be convicted, simply die. With a view to taxation, forvarious 
                    reasons, every man ought to have had his property valued:and 
                    the tribesmen should likewise bring a register of the yearlyproduce 
                    to the wardens of the country, that in this way there may 
                    betwo valuations; and the public officers may use annuary 
                    whichever onconsideration they deem the best, whether they 
                    prefer to take acertain portion of the whole value, or of 
                    the annual revenue, aftersubtracting what is paid to the common 
                    tables.</p>
                  <p>Touching offerings to the Gods, a moderate man should observemoderation 
                    in what he offers. Now the land and the hearth of the houseof 
                    all men is sacred to all Gods; wherefore let no man dedicate 
                    them asecond time to the Gods. Gold and silver, whether possessed 
                    by privatepersons or in temples, are in other cities provocative 
                    of envy, andivory, the product of a dead body, is not a proper 
                    offering; brass andiron, again, are instruments of war; but 
                    of wood let a man bringwhat offerings he likes, provided it 
                    be a single block, and in likemanner of stone, to the public 
                    temples; of woven work let him notoffer more than one woman 
                    can execute in a month. White is a coloursuitable to the Gods, 
                    especially in woven works, but dyes shouldonly be used for 
                    the adornments of war. The most divine of gifts arebirds and 
                    images, and they should be such as one painter can executein 
                    a single day. And let all other offerings follow a similar 
                    rule.</p>
                  <p>Now that the whole city has been divided into parts of which 
                    thenature and number have been described, and laws have been 
                    givenabout all the most important contracts as far as this 
                    was possible,the next thing will be to have justice done. 
                    The first of the courtsshall consist of elected judges, who 
                    shall be chosen by theplaintiff and the defendant in common: 
                    these shall be calledarbiters rather than judges. And in the 
                    second court there shall bejudges of the villages and tribes 
                    corresponding to the twelvefolddivision of the land, and before 
                    these the litigants shall go tocontend for greater damages, 
                    if the suit be not decided before thefirst judges; the defendant, 
                    if he be defeated the second time,shall pay a fifth more than 
                    the damages mentioned in the indictment;and if he find fault 
                    with his judges and would try a third time, lethim carry the 
                    suit before the select judges, and if he be againdefeated, 
                    let him pay the whole of the damages and half as much again.And 
                    the plaintiff, if when defeated before the first judges he 
                    persistin going on to the second, shall if he wins receive 
                    in addition to thedamages a fifth part more, and if defeated 
                    he shall pay a like sum;but if he is not satisfied with the 
                    previous decision, and will insiston proceeding to a third 
                    court, then if he win he shall receive fromthe defendant the 
                    amount of the damages and, as I said before, half asmuch again, 
                    and the plaintiff, if he lose, shall pay half of thedamages 
                    claimed, Now the assignment by lot of judges to courts and 
                    thecompletion of the number of them, and the appointment of 
                    servants tothe different magistrates, and the times at which 
                    the several causesshould be heard, and the votings and delays, 
                    and all the things thatnecessarily concern suits, and the 
                    order of causes, and the time inwhich answers have to be put 
                    in and parties are to appear-of these andother things akin 
                    to these we have indeed already spoken, but there isno harm 
                    in repeating what is right twice or thrice:-All lesser andeasier 
                    matters which the elder legislator has omitted may besupplied 
                    by the younger one. Private courts will be sufficientlyregulated 
                    in this way, and the public and state courts, and thosewhich 
                    the magistrates must use in the administration of theirseveral 
                    offices, exist in many other states. Many very respectableinstitutions 
                    of this sort have been framed by good men, and fromthem the 
                    guardians of the law may by reflection derive what isnecessary, 
                    for the order of our new state, considering andcorrecting 
                    them, and bringing them to the test of experience, untilevery 
                    detail appears to be satisfactorily determined; and then puttingthe 
                    final seal upon them, and making them irreversible, they shall 
                    usethem for ever afterwards. As to what relates to the silence 
                    ofjudges and the abstinence from words of evil omen and the 
                    reverse, andthe different notions of the just and good and 
                    honourable whichexist in our: own as compared with other states, 
                    they have been partlymentioned already, and another part of 
                    them will be mentionedhereafter as we draw near the end. To 
                    all these matters he who wouldbe an equal judge, shall justly 
                    look, and he shall possess writingsabout them that he may 
                    learn them. For of all kinds of knowledge theknowledge of 
                    good laws has the greatest power of improving thelearner; 
                    otherwise there would be no meaning the divine andadmirable 
                    law possessing a name akin to mind (nous, nomos). And of allother 
                    words, such as the praises and censures of individuals whichoccur 
                    in poetry and also in prose, whether written down or utteredin 
                    daily conversation, whether men dispute about them in the 
                    spirit ofcontention or weakly assent to them, as is often 
                    the case-of all thesethe one sure test is the writings of 
                    the legislator, which therighteous judge ought to have in 
                    his mind as the antidote of all otherwords, and thus make 
                    himself and the city stand upright, procuring forthe good 
                    the continuance and increase of justice, and for the bad,on 
                    the other hand, a conversion from ignorance and intemperance, 
                    andin general from all unrighteousness, as far as their evil 
                    minds can behealed, but to those whose web of life is in reality 
                    finished,giving death, which is the only remedy for souls 
                    in their condition,as I may say truly again and again. And 
                    such judges and chiefs ofjudges will be worthy of receiving 
                    praise from the whole city.</p>
                  <p>When the suits of the year are completed the following laws 
                    shallregulate their execution:-In the first place, the judge 
                    shall assignto the party who wins the suit the whole property 
                    of him who loses,with the exception of mere necessaries, and 
                    the assignment shall bemade through the herald immediately 
                    after each decision in the hearingof the judges; and when 
                    the month arrives following the month in whichthe courts are 
                    sitting (unless the gainer of the suit has beenpreviously 
                    satisfied), the court shall follow up the case, and handover 
                    to the winner the goods of the loser; but if they find that 
                    hehas not the means of paying, and the sum deficient is not 
                    less thana drachma, the insolvent person shall not have any 
                    right of going tolaw with any other man until he have satisfied 
                    the debt of the winningparty; but other persons shall still 
                    have the right of bringingsuits against him. And if any one 
                    after he is condemned refuses toacknowledge the authority 
                    which condemned him, let the magistrates whoare thus deprived 
                    of their authority bring him before the court of theguardians 
                    of the law, and if he be cast, let him be punished withdeath, 
                    as a subverter of the whole state and of the laws.</p>
                  <p>Thus a man is born and brought up, and after this manner 
                    he begetsand brings up his own children, and has his share 
                    of dealings withother men, and suffers if he has done wrong 
                    to any one, and receivessatisfaction if he has been wronged, 
                    and so at length in due time hegrows old under the protection 
                    of the laws, and his end comes in theorder of nature. Concerning 
                    the dead of either sex, the religiousceremonies which may 
                    fittingly be performed, whether appertaining tothe Gods of 
                    the underworld or of this, shall be decided by theinterpreters 
                    with absolute authority. Their sepulchres are not to bein 
                    places which are fit for cultivation, and there shall be nomonuments 
                    in such spots, either large or small, but they shalloccupy 
                    that part of the country which is naturally adapted forreceiving 
                    and concealing the bodies of the dead with as little hurt 
                    aspossible to the living. No man, living or dead, shall deprive 
                    theliving of the sustenance which the earth, their foster-parent, 
                    isnaturally inclined to provide for them. And let not the 
                    mound be piledhigher than would be the work of five men completed 
                    in five days;nor shall the stone which is placed over the 
                    spot be larger than wouldbe sufficient to receive the praises 
                    of the dead included in fourheroic lines. Nor shall the laying 
                    out of the dead in the housecontinue for a longer time than 
                    is sufficient to distinguish betweenhim who is in a trance 
                    only and him who is really dead, and speakinggenerally, the 
                    third day after death will be a fair time forcarrying out 
                    the body to the sepulchre. Now we must believe thelegislator 
                    when he tells us that the soul is in all respectssuperior 
                    to the body, and that even in life what makes each one usto 
                    be what we are is only the soul; and that the body follows 
                    us aboutin the likeness of each of us, and therefore, when 
                    we are dead, thebodies of the dead are quite rightly said 
                    to be our shades orimages; for the true and immortal being 
                    of each one of us which iscalled the soul goes on her way 
                    to other Gods, before them to givean account-which is an inspiring 
                    hope to the good, but very terribleto the bad, as the laws 
                    of our fathers tell us; and they also saythat not much can 
                    be done in the way of helping a man after he isdead. But the 
                    living-he should be helped by all his kindred, thatwhile in 
                    life he may be the holiest and justest of men, and afterdeath 
                    may have no great sins to be punished in the world below. 
                    Ifthis be true, a man ought not to waste his substance under 
                    the ideathat all this lifeless mass of flesh which is in process 
                    of burialis connected with him; he should consider that the 
                    son, or brother, orthe beloved one, whoever he may be, whom 
                    he thinks he is laying in theearth, has gone away to complete 
                    and fulfil his own destiny, andthat his duty is rightly to 
                    order the present, and to spend moderatelyon the lifeless 
                    altar of the Gods below. But the legislator does notintend 
                    moderation to be take, in the sense of meanness. Let the law,then, 
                    be as follows:-The expenditure on the entire funeral of himwho 
                    is of the highest class shall not exceed five minae; and for 
                    himwho is of the second class, three minae, and for him who 
                    is of thethird class, two minae, and for him, who is of the 
                    fourth class, onemina, will be a fair limit of expense. The 
                    guardians of the lawought to take especial care of the different 
                    ages of life, whetherchildhood, or manhood, or any other age. 
                    And at the end of all, letthere be some one guardian of the 
                    law presiding, who shall be chosenby the friends of the deceased 
                    to superintend, and let it be gloryto him to manage with fairness 
                    and moderation what relates to thedead, and a discredit to 
                    him if they are not well managed. Let thelaying out and other 
                    ceremonies be in accordance with custom, but tothe statesman 
                    who adopts custom as his law we must give way in certainparticulars. 
                    It would be monstrous for example that he shouldcommand any 
                    man to weep or abstain from weeping over the dead; buthe may 
                    forbid cries of lamentation, and not allow the voice of themourner 
                    to be heard outside the house; also, he may forbid thebringing 
                    of the dead body into the open streets, or the processions 
                    ofmourners in the streets, and may require that before daybreak 
                    theyshould be outside the city. Let these, then, be our laws 
                    relating tosuch matters, and let him who obeys be free from 
                    penalty; but he whodisobeys even a single guardian of the 
                    law shall be punished by themall with a fitting penalty. Other 
                    modes of burial, or again the denialof burial, which is to 
                    be refused in the case of robbers of templesand parricides 
                    and the like, have been devised and are embodied in thepreceding 
                    laws, so that now our work of legislation is pretty nearlyat 
                    an end; but in all cases the end does not consist in doingsomething 
                    or acquiring something or establishing something-the endwill 
                    be attained and finally accomplished, when we have provided 
                    forthe perfect and lasting continuance of our institutions 
                    until then ourcreation is incomplete.</p>
                  <p>Cle. That is very good Stranger; but I wish you would tell 
                    me moreclearly what you mean.</p>
                  <p>Ath. O Cleinias, many things of old time were well said and 
                    sung;and the saying about the Fates was one of them.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What is it?</p>
                  <p>Ath. The saying that Lachesis or the giver of the lots is 
                    thefirst of them, and that Clotho or the spinster is the second 
                    ofthem, and that Atropos or the unchanging one is the third 
                    of them; andthat she is the preserver of the things which 
                    we have spoken, andwhich have been compared in a figure to 
                    things woven by fire, theyboth (i.e., Atropos and the fire) 
                    producing the quality ofunchangeableness. I am speaking of 
                    the things which in a state andgovernment give not only health 
                    and salvation to the body, but law, orrather preservation 
                    of the law, in the soul; and, if I am notmistaken, this seems 
                    to be still wanting in our laws: we have still tosee how we 
                    can implant in them this irreversible nature.</p>
                  <p>Cle. It will be no small matter if we can only discover how 
                    such anature can be implanted in anything.</p>
                  <p>Ath. But it certainly can be; so much I clearly see.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Then let us not think of desisting until we have impartedthis 
                    quality to our laws; for it is ridiculous, after a great dealof 
                    labour has been spent, to place a thing at last on an insecurefoundation.</p>
                  <p>Megillus. I approve of your suggestion, and am quite of the 
                    samemind with you.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very good: And now what, according to you, is to be 
                    thesalvation of our government and of our laws, and how is 
                    it to beeffected?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Were we not saying that there must be in our city a 
                    councilwhich was to be of this sort:-The ten oldest guardians 
                    of the law, andall those who have obtained prizes of virtue, 
                    were to meet in the sameassembly, and the council was also 
                    to include those who had visitedforeign countries in the hope 
                    of hearing something that might be ofuse in the preservation 
                    of the laws, and who, having come safely home,and having been 
                    tested in these same matters, had proved themselves tobe worthy 
                    to take part in the assembly;-each of the members was toselect 
                    some young man of not less than thirty years of age, he himselfjudging 
                    in the, first instance whether the young man was worthy bynature 
                    and education, and then suggesting him to the others, and 
                    if heseemed to them also to be worthy they were to adopt him; 
                    but if not,the decision at which they arrived was to be kept 
                    a secret from thecitizens at large; and, more especially, 
                    from the rejectedcandidate. The meeting of the council was 
                    to be held early in themorning, when everybody was most at 
                    leisure from all other business,whether public or private-was 
                    not something of this sort said by usbefore?</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then, returning to the council, I would say further, 
                    that if welet it down to be the anchor of the state, our city, 
                    having everythingwhich is suitable to her, will preserve all 
                    that we wish to preserve.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Now is the time for me to speak the truth in all earnestness.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Well said, and I hope that you will fulfil your intention.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Know, Cleinias, that everything, in all that it does, 
                    has anatural saviour, as of an animal the soul and the head 
                    are the chiefsaviours.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Once more, what do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. The well-being of those two is obviously the preservation 
                    ofevery living thing.</p>
                  <p>Cle. How is that?</p>
                  <p>Ath. The soul, besides other things, contains mind, and the 
                    head,besides other things, contains sight and hearing; and 
                    the mind,mingling with the noblest of the senses, and becoming 
                    one with them,may be truly called the salvation of all.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Yes, Quite so.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Yes, indeed; but with what is that intellect concerned 
                    which,mingling with the senses, is the salvation of ships 
                    in storms aswell as in fair weather? In a ship, when the pilot 
                    and the sailorsunite their perceptions with the piloting mind, 
                    do they not saveboth themselves and their craft?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. We do not want many illustrations about such matters:-Whataim 
                    would the general of an army, or what aim would a physicianpropose 
                    to himself, if he were seeking to attain salvation?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very good.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Does not the general aim at victory and superiority 
                    in war, anddo not the physician and his assistants aim at 
                    producing health in thebody?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And a physician who is ignorant about the body, that 
                    is to say,who knows not that which we just now called health, 
                    or a general whoknows not victory, or any others who are ignorant 
                    of the particularsof the arts which we mentioned, cannot be 
                    said to have understandingabout any of these matters.</p>
                  <p>Cle. They cannot.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And what would you say of the state? If a person proves 
                    to beignorant of the aim to which the statesman should look, 
                    ought he, inthe first place, to be called a ruler at all; 
                    further, will he ever beable to preserve that of which he 
                    does not even know the aim?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Impossible.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And therefore, if our settlement of the country is to 
                    beperfect, we ought to have some institution, which, as I 
                    was saying,will tell what is the aim of the state, and will 
                    inform us how weare to attain this, and what law or what man 
                    will advise us to thatend. Any state which has no such institution 
                    is likely to be devoid ofmind and sense, and in all her actions 
                    will proceed by mere chance.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. In which, then, of the parts or institutions of the 
                    state isany such guardian power to be found? Can we say?</p>
                  <p>Cle. I am not quite certain, Stranger; but I have a suspicion 
                    thatyou are referring to the assembly which you just now said 
                    was tomeet at night.</p>
                  <p>Ath. You understand me perfectly, Cleinias; and we must assume, 
                    asthe argument iniplies, that this council possesses all virtue; 
                    and thebeginning of virtue is not to make mistakes by guessing 
                    many things,but to look steadily at one thing, and on this 
                    to fix all our aims.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Quite true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then now we shall see why there is nothing wonderful 
                    instates going astray-the reason is that their legislators 
                    have suchdifferent aims; nor is there anything wonderful in 
                    some laying down astheir rule of justice, that certain individuals 
                    should bear rule inthe state, whether they be good or bad, 
                    and others that the citizensshould be rich, not caring whether 
                    they are the slaves of other men ornot. The tendency of others, 
                    again, is towards freedom; and somelegislate with a view to 
                    two things at once-they want to be at thesame time free and 
                    the lords of other states; but the wisest men, asthey deem 
                    themselves to be, look to all these and similar aims, andthere 
                    is no one of them which they exclusively honour, and to whichthey 
                    would have all things look.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Then, Stranger, our former assertion will hold, for 
                    we weresaying that laws generally should look to one thing 
                    only; and this, aswe admitted, was rightly said to be virtue.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Yes.</p>
                  <p>Cle. And we said that virtue was of four kinds?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Quite true.</p>
                  <p>Cle. And that mind was the leader of the four, and that to 
                    her thethree other virtues and all other things ought to have 
                    regard?</p>
                  <p>Ath. You follow me capitally, Cleinias, and I would ask you 
                    tofollow me to the end, for we have already said that the 
                    mind of thepilot, the mind of the physician and of the general 
                    look to that onething to which they ought to look; and now 
                    we may turn to mindpolitical, of which, as of a human creature, 
                    we will ask a question:-Owonderful being, and to what are 
                    you looking? The physician is able totell his single aim in 
                    life, but you, the superior, as you declareyourself to be, 
                    of all intelligent beings, when you are asked arenot able 
                    to tell. Can you, Megillus, and you, Cleinias, say distinctlywhat 
                    is the aim of mind political, in return for the many explanationsof 
                    things which I have given you?</p>
                  <p>Cle. We cannot, Stranger.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Well, but ought we not to desire to see it, and to see 
                    whereit is to be found?</p>
                  <p>Cle. For example, where?</p>
                  <p>Ath. For example, we were saying that there are four kinds 
                    ofvirtue, and as there are four of them, each of them must 
                    be one.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And further, all four of them we call one; for we say 
                    thatcourage is virtue, and that prudence is virtue, and the 
                    same of thetwo others, as if they were in reality not many 
                    but one, that is,virtue.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Quite so.</p>
                  <p>Ath. There is no difficulty in seeing in what way the two 
                    differfrom one another, and have received two names, and so 
                    of the rest. Butthere is more difficulty in explaining why 
                    we call these two and therest of them by the single name of 
                    virtue.</p>
                  <p>Cle. How do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. I have no difficulty in explaining what I mean. Let 
                    usdistribute the subject questions and answers.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Once more, what do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Ask me what is that one thing which call virtue, and 
                    then againspeak of as two, one part being courage and the 
                    other wisdom. I willtell you how that occurs:-One of them 
                    has to do with fear; in this thebeasts also participate, and 
                    quite young children-I mean courage;for a courageous temper 
                    is a gift of nature and not of reason. Butwithout reason there 
                    never has been, or is, or will be a wise andunderstanding 
                    soul; it is of a different nature.</p>
                  <p>Cle. That is true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. I have now told you in what way the two are different, 
                    and doyou in return tell me in what way they are one and the 
                    same. Supposethat I ask you in what way the four are one, 
                    and when you haveanswered me, you will have a right to ask 
                    of me in return in whatway they are four; and then let us 
                    proceed to enquire whether in thecase of things which have 
                    a name and also a definition to them, trueknowledge consists 
                    in knowing the name only and not the definition.Can he who 
                    is good for anything be ignorant of all this withoutdiscredit 
                    where great and glorious truths are concerned?</p>
                  <p>Cle. I suppose not.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And is there anything greater to the legislator and 
                    theguardian of the law, and to him who thinks that he excels 
                    all othermen in virtue, and has won the palm of excellence, 
                    that these veryqualities of which we are now speaking-courage, 
                    temperance, wisdom,justice?</p>
                  <p>Cle. How can there be anything greater?</p>
                  <p>Ath. And ought not the interpreters, the teachers the lawgivers, 
                    theguardians of the other citizens, to excel the rest of mankind, 
                    andperfectly to show him who desires to learn and know or 
                    whose evilactions require to be punished and reproved, what 
                    is the nature ofvirtue and vice? Or shall some poet who has 
                    found his way into thecity, or some chance person who pretends 
                    to be an instructor of youth,show himself to be better than 
                    him who has won the prize for everyvirtue? And can we wonder 
                    that when the guardians are not adequatein speech or action, 
                    and have no adequate knowledge of virtue, thecity being unguarded 
                    should experience the common fate of cities inour day?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Wonder! no.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Well, then, must we do as we said? Or can we give our 
                    guardiansa more precise knowledge of virtue in speech and 
                    action than themany have? or is there any way in which our 
                    city can be made toresemble the head and senses of rational 
                    beings because possessingsuch a guardian power?</p>
                  <p>Cle. What, Stranger, is the drift of your comparison?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Do we not see that the city is the trunk, and are not 
                    theyounger guardians, who are chosen for their natural gifts, 
                    placed inthe head of the state, having their souls all full 
                    of eyes, with whichthey look about the whole city? They keep 
                    watch and hand over theirperceptions to the memory, and inform 
                    the elders of all that happensin the city; and those whom 
                    we compared to the mind, because they havemany wise thoughts-that 
                    is to say, the old men-take counsel and makinguse of the younger 
                    men as their ministers, and advising with them-inthis way 
                    both together truly preserve the whole state:-Shall this orsome 
                    other be the order of our state? Are all our citizens to be 
                    equalin acquirements, or shall there be special persons among 
                    them who havereceived a more careful training and education?</p>
                  <p>Cle. That they should be equal, my; good, sir, is impossible.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then we ought to proceed to some more exact training 
                    than anywhich has preceded.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And must not that of which we are in need be the one 
                    to whichwe were just now alluding?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Did we not say that the workman or guardian, if he be 
                    perfectin every respect, ought not only to be able to see 
                    the many aims,but he should press onward to the one? this 
                    he should know, andknowing, order all things with a view to 
                    it.</p>
                  <p>Cle. True.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And can any one have a more exact way of considering 
                    orcontemplating. anything, than the being able to look at 
                    one ideagathered from many different things?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Perhaps not.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Not &quot;Perhaps not,&quot; but &quot;Certainly not,&quot; 
                    my good sir, is theright answer. There never has been a truer 
                    method than this discoveredby any man.</p>
                  <p>Cle. I bow to your authority, Stranger; let us proceed in 
                    the waywhich you propose.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Then, as would appear, we must compel the guardians 
                    of ourdivine state to perceive, in the first place, what that 
                    principle iswhich is the same in all the four-the same, as 
                    we affirm, in courageand in temperance, and in justice and 
                    in prudence, and which, beingone, we call as we ought, by 
                    the single name of virtue. To this, myfriends, we will, if 
                    you please, hold fast, and not let go until wehave sufficiently 
                    explained what that is to which we are to look,whether to 
                    be regarded as one, or as a whole, or as both, or inwhatever 
                    way. Are we likely ever to be in a virtuous condition, ifwe 
                    cannot tell whether virtue is many, or four, or one? Certainly,if 
                    we take counsel among ourselves, we shall in some way contrive 
                    thatthis principle has a place amongst us; but if you have 
                    made up yourmind that we should let the matter alone, we will.</p>
                  <p>Cle. We must not, Stranger, by the God of strangers I swear 
                    thatwe must not, for in our opinion you speak most truly; 
                    but we shouldlike to know how you will accomplish your purpose.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Wait a little before you ask; and let us, first of all, 
                    bequite agreed with one another that the purpose has to be 
                    accomplished.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly, it ought to be, if it can be.</p>
                  <p>Ast. Well, and about the good and the honourable, are we 
                    to take thesame view? Are our guardians only to know that 
                    each of them is many,or, also how and in what way they are 
                    one?</p>
                  <p>Cle. They must consider also in what sense they are one.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And are they to consider only, and to be unable to set 
                    forthwhat they think?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly not; that would be the state of a slave.</p>
                  <p>Ath. And may not the same be said of all good things-that 
                    the trueguardians of the laws ought to know the truth about 
                    them, and to beable to interpret them in words, and carry 
                    them out in action, judgingof what is and what is not well, 
                    according to nature?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Is not the knowledge of the Gods which we have set forth 
                    withso much zeal one of the noblest sorts of knowledge;-to 
                    know thatthey are, and know how great is their power, as far 
                    as in man lies? doindeed excuse the mass of the citizens, 
                    who only follow the voice ofthe laws, but we refuse to admit 
                    as guardians any who do not labour toobtain every possible 
                    evidence that there is respecting the Gods;our city is forbidden 
                    and not allowed to choose as a guardian of thelaw, or to place 
                    in the select order of virtue, him who is not aninspired man, 
                    and has not laboured at these things.</p>
                  <p>Cle. It is certainly just, as you say, that he who is indolent 
                    aboutsuch matters or incapable should be rejected, and that 
                    thingshonourable should be put away from him.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Are we assured that there are two things which lead 
                    men tobelieve in the Gods, as we have already stated?</p>
                  <p>Cle. What are they?</p>
                  <p>Ath. One is the argument about the soul, which has been alreadymentioned-that 
                    it is the eldest, and most divine of all things, towhich motion 
                    attaining generation gives perpetual existence; the otherwas 
                    an argument from the order of the motion of the stars, and 
                    ofall things under the dominion of the mind which ordered 
                    theuniverse. If a man look upon the world not lightly or ignorantly,there 
                    was never any one so godless who did not experience an effectopposite 
                    to that which the many imagine. For they think that those 
                    whohandle these matters by the help of astronomy, and the 
                    accompanyingarts of demonstration, may become godless, because 
                    they see, as far asthey can see, things happening by necessity, 
                    and not by an intelligentwill accomplishing good.</p>
                  <p>Cle. But what is the fact?</p>
                  <p>Ath. Just the opposite, as I said, of the opinion which onceprevailed 
                    among men, that the sun and stars are without soul. Evenin 
                    those days men wondered about them, and that which is nowascertained 
                    was then conjectured by some who had a more exactknowledge 
                    of them-that if they had been things without soul, and hadno 
                    mind, they could never have moved with numerical exactness 
                    sowonderful; and even at that time some ventured to hazard 
                    theconjecture that mind was the orderer of the universe. But 
                    these samepersons again mistaking the nature of the soul, 
                    which they conceivedto be younger and not older than the body, 
                    once more overturned theworld, or rather, I should say, themselves; 
                    for the bodies whichthey saw moving in heaven all appeared 
                    to be full of stones, andearth, and many other lifeless substances, 
                    and to these theyassigned the causes of all things. Such studies 
                    gave rise to muchatheism and perplexity, and the poets took 
                    occasion to beabusive-comparing the philosophers to she-dogs 
                    uttering vain howlings,and talking other nonsense of the same 
                    sort. But now, as I said, thecase is reversed.</p>
                  <p>Cle. How so?</p>
                  <p>Ath. No man can be a true worshipper of the Gods who does 
                    not knowthese two principles-that the soul is the eldest of 
                    all things whichare born, and is immortal and rules over all 
                    bodies; moreover, as Ihave now said several times, he who 
                    has not contemplated the mind ofnature which is said to exist 
                    in the stars, and gone through theprevious training, and seen 
                    the connection of music with these things,and harmonized them 
                    all with laws and institutions, is not able togive a reason 
                    of such things as have a reason. And he who is unable toacquire 
                    this in addition to the ordinary virtues of a citizen, canhardly 
                    be a good ruler of a whole state; but he should be thesubordinate 
                    of other rulers. Wherefore, Cleinias and Megillus, letus consider 
                    whether we may not add to all the other laws which we havediscussed 
                    this further one-that the nocturnal assembly of themagistrates, 
                    which has also shared in the whole scheme of educationproposed 
                    by us, shall be a guard set according to law for thesalvation 
                    of the state. Shall we propose this?</p>
                  <p>Cle. Certainly, my good friend, we will if the thing is in 
                    anydegree possible.</p>
                  <p>Ath. Let us make a common effort to gain such an object; 
                    for I toowill gladly share in the attempt. Of these matters 
                    I have had muchexperience, and have often considered them, 
                    and I dare say that Ishall be able to find others who will 
                    also help.</p>
                  <p>Cle. I agree, Stranger, that we should proceed along the 
                    road inwhich God is guiding us; and how we can proceed rightly 
                    has now tobe investigated and explained.</p>
                  <p>Ath. O Megillus and Cleinias, about these matters we cannotlegislate 
                    further until the council is constituted; when that is done,then 
                    we will determine what authority they shall have of their 
                    own;but the explanation of how this is all to be ordered would 
                    only begiven rightly in a long discourse.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What do you mean, and what new thing is this?</p>
                  <p>Ath. In the first place, a list would have to be made out 
                    of thosewho by their ages and studies and dispositions and 
                    habits are wellfitted for the duty of a guardian. In the next 
                    place, it will not beeasy for them to discover themselves 
                    what they ought to learn, orbecome the disciple of one who 
                    has already made the discovery.Furthermore, to write down 
                    the times at which, and during which,they ought to receive 
                    the several kinds of instruction, would be avain thing; for 
                    the learners themselves do not know what is learned toadvantage 
                    until the knowledge which is the result of learning hasfound 
                    a place in the soul of each. And so these details, although 
                    theycould not be truly said to be secret, might be said to 
                    be incapable ofbeing stated beforehand, because when stated 
                    they would have nomeaning.</p>
                  <p>Cle. What then are we to do, Stranger, under these circumstances?</p>
                  <p>Ath. As the proverb says, the answer is no secret, but open 
                    to allof us:-We must risk the whole on the chance of throwing, 
                    as theysay, thrice six or thrice ace, and I am willing to 
                    share with youthe danger by stating and explaining to you 
                    my views about educationand nurture, which is the question 
                    coming to the surface again. Thedanger is not a slight or 
                    ordinary one, and I would advise you,Cleinias, in particular, 
                    to see to the matter; for if you orderrightly the city of 
                    the Magnetes, or whatever name God may give it,you will obtain 
                    the greatest glory; or at any rate you will be thoughtthe 
                    most courageous of men in the estimation of posterity. Dearcompanions, 
                    if this our divine assembly can only be established, tothem 
                    we will hand over the city; none of the present company oflegislators, 
                    as I may call them, would hesitate about that. And thestate 
                    will be perfected and become a waking reality, which a littlewhile 
                    ago we attempted to create as a dream and in idea only, minglingtogether 
                    reason and mind in one image, in the hope that our citizensmight 
                    be duly mingled and rightly educated; and being educated, 
                    anddwelling in the citadel of the land, might become perfect 
                    guardians,such as we have never seen in all our previous life, 
                    by reason ofthe saving virtue which is in them.</p>
                  <p>Meg. Dear Cleinias, after all that has been said, either 
                    we mustdetain the Stranger, and by supplications and in all 
                    manner of waysmake him share in the foundation of the city, 
                    or we must give up theundertaking.</p>
                  <p>Cle. Very true, Megillus; and you must join with me in detaininghim.</p>
                  <p>Meg. I will.</p>

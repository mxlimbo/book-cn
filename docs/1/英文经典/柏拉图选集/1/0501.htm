                    PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: THEODORUS; THEAETETUS; SOCRATES; 
                    <br>
                    An ELEATIC STRANGER, whom Theodorus and Theaetetus bring <br>
                    with them; The younger SOCRATES, who is a silent auditor</p>
                  <p><br>
                    Theodorus. Here we are, Socrates, true to our agreement of<br>
                    yesterday; and we bring with us a stranger from Elea, who 
                    is a<br>
                    disciple of Parmenides and Zeno, and a true philosopher.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Socrates. Is he not rather a god, Theodorus, who comes to 
                    us in<br>
                    the disguise of a stranger? For Homer says that all the gods, 
                    and<br>
                    especially the god of strangers, are companions of the meek 
                    and<br>
                    just, and visit the good and evil among men. And may not your<br>
                    companion be one of those higher powers, a cross-examining 
                    deity,<br>
                    who has come to spy out our weakness in argument, and to <br>
                    cross-examine us?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theod. Nay, Socrates, he is not one of the disputatious sort-he 
                    is<br>
                    too good for that. And, in my opinion, he is not a god at 
                    all; but<br>
                    divine he certainly is, for this is a title which I should 
                    <br>
                    give to all philosophers.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Soc. Capital, my friend! and I may add that they are almost 
                    as<br>
                    hard to be discerned as the gods. For the true philosophers, 
                    and<br>
                    such as are not merely made up for the occasion, appear in 
                    various<br>
                    forms unrecognized by the ignorance of men, and they &quot;hover 
                    about<br>
                    cities,&quot; as Homer declares, looking from above upon human 
                    life; and<br>
                    some think nothing of them, and others can never think enough; 
                    and<br>
                    sometimes they appear as statesmen, and sometimes as sophists; 
                    and<br>
                    then, again, to many they seem to be no better than madmen. 
                    I should<br>
                    like to ask our Eleatic friend, if he would tell us, what 
                    is thought<br>
                    about them in Italy, and to whom the terms are applied.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theod. What terms?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Soc. Sophist, statesman, philosopher.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theod. What is your difficulty about them, and what made 
                    you ask?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Soc. I want to know whether by his countrymen they are regarded 
                    as<br>
                    one or two; or do they, as the names are three, distinguish 
                    <br>
                    also three kinds, and assign one to each name?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theod. I dare say that the Stranger will not object to discuss 
                    the<br>
                    question. What do you say, Stranger?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Stranger. I am far from objecting, Theodorus, nor have I 
                    any<br>
                    difficulty in replying that by us they are regarded as three. 
                    But to<br>
                    define precisely the nature of each of them is by no means 
                    a <br>
                    slight or easy task.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theod. You have happened to light, Socrates, almost on the 
                    very<br>
                    question which we were asking our friend before we came <br>
                    hither, and he excused himself to us, as he does now you; 
                    although he admitted that the matter had been fully discussed, 
                    and that he remembered the answer.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Soc. Then do not, Stranger, deny us the first favour which 
                    <br>
                    we ask of you: I am sure that you will not, and therefore 
                    I shall only beg of you to say whether you like and are accustomed 
                    to make a long oration on a subject which you want to explain 
                    to another, or to<br>
                    proceed by the method of question and answer. I remember hearing 
                    a<br>
                    very noble discussion in which Parmenides employed the latter 
                    of the<br>
                    two methods, when I was a young man, and he was far advanced 
                    <br>
                    in years.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I prefer to talk with another when he responds pleasantly,<br>
                    and is light in hand; if not, I would rather have my own say.<br>
                    Soc. Any one of the present company will respond kindly to 
                    you,<br>
                    and you can choose whom you like of them; I should recommend 
                    you to take a young person-Theaetetus, for example-unless 
                    you have a preference for some one else.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I feel ashamed, Socrates, being a new comer into your<br>
                    society, instead of talking a little and hearing others talk, 
                    to be<br>
                    spinning out a long soliloquy or address, as if I wanted to 
                    show<br>
                    off. For the true answer will certainly be a very long one, 
                    a great<br>
                    deal longer than might be expected from such a short and simple<br>
                    question. At the same time, I fear that I may seem rude and 
                    <br>
                    ungracious if I refuse your courteous request, especially 
                    after what you have said. For I certainly cannot object to 
                    your proposal, that<br>
                    Theaetetus should respond, having already conversed with him 
                    myself, and being recommended by you to take him.<br>
                    Theaetetus. But are you sure, Stranger, that this will be 
                    quite so<br>
                    acceptable to the rest of the company as Socrates imagines?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. You hear them applauding, Theaetetus; after that, there 
                    is<br>
                    nothing more to be said. Well then, I am to argue with you, 
                    <br>
                    and if you tire of the argument, you may complain of your 
                    friends and not of me<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I do not think that I shall tire, and if I do, I 
                    shall get<br>
                    my friend here, young Socrates, the namesake of the elder 
                    <br>
                    Socrates, to help; he is about my own age, and my partner 
                    at the gymnasium, and is constantly accustomed to work with 
                    me.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Very good; you can decide about that for yourself as 
                    we<br>
                    proceed. Meanwhile you and I will begin together and enquire 
                    into<br>
                    the nature of the Sophist, first of the three: I should like 
                    you to<br>
                    make out what he is and bring him to light in a discussion; 
                    for at<br>
                    present we are only agreed about the name, but of the thing 
                    to which<br>
                    we both apply the name possibly you have one notion and I 
                    another;<br>
                    whereas we ought always to come to an understanding about 
                    the thing<br>
                    itself in terms of a definition, and not merely about the 
                    name minus<br>
                    the definition. Now the tribe of Sophists which we are investigating<br>
                    is not easily caught or defined; and the world has long ago 
                    agreed,<br>
                    that if great subjects are to be adequately treated, they 
                    must be<br>
                    studied in the lesser and easier instances of them before 
                    we proceed<br>
                    to the greatest of all. And as I know that the tribe of Sophists 
                    is<br>
                    troublesome and hard to be caught, I should recommend that 
                    <br>
                    we practise beforehand the method which is to be applied to 
                    him on some simple and smaller thing, unless you can suggest 
                    a better way.<br>
                    Theaet. Indeed I cannot.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then suppose that we work out some lesser example <br>
                    which will be a pattern of the greater?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Good.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. What is there which is well known and not great, and 
                    is yet<br>
                    as susceptible of definition as any larger thing? Shall I 
                    say an<br>
                    angler? He is familiar to all of us, and not a very interesting 
                    or<br>
                    important person.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. He is not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Yet I suspect that he will furnish us with the sort 
                    of<br>
                    definition and line of enquiry which we want.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Very good.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let us begin by asking whether he is a man having art 
                    or not<br>
                    having art, but some other power.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. He is clearly a man of art.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And of arts there are two kinds?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What are they?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There is agriculture, and the tending of mortal creatures,<br>
                    and the art of constructing or moulding vessels, and there 
                    is the<br>
                    art of imitation-all these may be appropriately called by 
                    a single<br>
                    name.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What do you mean? And what is the name?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. He who brings into existence something that did not 
                    exist<br>
                    before is said to be a producer, and that which is brought 
                    into<br>
                    existence is said to be produced.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And all the arts which were just now mentioned are<br>
                    characterized by this power of producing?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. They are.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then let us sum them up under the name of productive 
                    or<br>
                    creative art.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Very good.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Next follows the whole class of learning and cognition; 
                    then<br>
                    comes trade, fighting, hunting. And since none of these produces<br>
                    anything, but is only engaged in conquering by word or deed, 
                    or in<br>
                    preventing others from conquering, things which exist and 
                    have been<br>
                    already produced-in each and all of these branches there <br>
                    appears to be an art which may be called acquisitive.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes, that is the proper name.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Seeing, then, that all arts are either acquisitive or 
                    <br>
                    creative, in which class shall we place the art of the angler?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Clearly in the acquisitive class.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And the acquisitive may be subdivided into two parts: 
                    there<br>
                    is exchange, which is voluntary and is effected by gifts, 
                    hire,<br>
                    purchase; and the other part of acquisitive, which takes by 
                    force of<br>
                    word or deed, may be termed conquest?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. That is implied in what has been said.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And may not conquest be again subdivided?<br>
                    Theaet. How?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Open force may; be called fighting, and secret force 
                    may have<br>
                    the general name of hunting?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And there is no reason why the art of hunting should 
                    not be<br>
                    further divided.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. How would you make the division?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Into the hunting of living and of lifeless prey.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes, if both kinds exist.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Of course they exist; but the hunting after lifeless 
                    things<br>
                    having no special name, except some sorts of diving, and other 
                    small<br>
                    matters, may be omitted; the hunting after living things may 
                    <br>
                    be called animal hunting.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And animal hunting may be truly said to have two divisions,<br>
                    land-animal hunting, which has many kinds and names, and <br>
                    water-animals<br>
                    hunting, or the hunting after animals who swim?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And of swimming animals, one class lives on the wing 
                    and the<br>

                    of all<br>
                    birds is included.<br>
                  </p>

                    general<br>
                    name of fishing.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And this sort of hunting may be further divided also 
                    into two<br>
                    principal kinds?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What are they?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There is one kind which takes them in nets, another 
                    <br>
                    which takes them by a blow.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What do you mean, and how do you distinguish them?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. As to the first kind-all that surrounds and encloses 
                    anything<br>
                    to prevent egress, may be rightly called an enclosure.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Very true.<br>
                    Str. For which reason twig baskets, casting nets, nooses, 
                    creels,<br>
                    and the like may all be termed &quot;enclosures&quot;?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And therefore this first kind of capture may be called 
                    by us<br>
                    capture with enclosures, or something of that sort?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The other kind, which is practised by a blow with hooks 
                    and<br>
                    three pronged spears, when summed up under one name, may be 
                    called striking, unless you, Theaetetus, can find some better 
                    name?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Never mind the name-what you suggest will do very 
                    well.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There is one mode of striking, which is done at night, 
                    and by<br>
                    the light of a fire, and is by the hunters themselves called 
                    firing,<br>
                    or spearing by firelight.<br>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And the fishing by day is called by the general name 
                    <br>
                    of barbing because the spears, too, are barbed at the point.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes, that is the term.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Of this barb-fishing, that which strikes the fish Who 
                    is<br>
                    below from above is called spearing, because this is the way 
                    in<br>
                    which the three-pronged spears are mostly used.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes, it is often called so.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then now there is only one kind remaining.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What is that?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. When a hook is used, and the fish is not struck in any 
                    chance<br>
                    part of his body-he as be is with the spear, but only about 
                    the head<br>
                    and mouth, and is then drawn out from below upwards with reeds 
                    and rods:-What is the right name of that mode of fish, Theaetetus?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I suspect that we have now discovered the object 
                    of our<br>
                    search.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then now you and I have come to an understanding not 
                    <br>
                    only about the name of the angler's art, but about the definition 
                    of the thing itself. One half of all art was acquisitive-half 
                    of all the art<br>
                    acquisitive art was conquest or taking by force, half of this 
                    was<br>
                    hunting, and half of hunting was hunting animals, half of 
                    this was<br>
                    hunting water animals-of this again, the under half was fishing,<br>
                    half of fishing was striking; a part of striking was fishing 
                    with a<br>
                    barb, and one half of this again, being the kind which strikes 
                    with<br>
                    a hook and draws the fish from below upwards, is the art <br>
                    which we have been seeking, and which from the nature of the 
                    operation is denoted angling or drawing up (aspalienutike, 
                    anaspasthai).<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. The result has been quite satisfactorily brought 
                    out.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And now, following this pattern, let us endeavour to 
                    find out<br>
                    what a Sophist is.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. By all means.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The first question about the angler was, whether he 
                    was a<br>
                    skilled artist or unskilled?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>

                  <p>Str. And shall we call our new friend unskilled, or a thorough<br>
                    master of his craft?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly not unskilled, for his name, as, indeed, 
                    you<br>
                    imply, must surely express his nature.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then he must be supposed to have some art.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What art?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. By heaven, they are cousins! it never occurred to us.<br>

                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. In what way are they related?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. They both appear to me to be hunters.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. How the Sophist? Of the other we have spoken.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. You remember our division of hunting, into hunting after<br>
                    swimming animals and land animals?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And you remember that we subdivided the swimming and 
                    left the<br>
                    land animals, saying that there were many kinds of them?<br>

                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Thus far, then, the Sophist and the angler, starting 
                    from the<br>
                    art of acquiring, take the same road?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. So it would appear.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Their paths diverge when they reach the art of animal<br>
                    hunting; the one going to the seashore, and to the rivers 
                    and to the<br>
                    lakes, and angling for the animals which are in them.<br>

                    of wealth and broad meadow-lands of generous youth; and he 
                    also is<br>

                    if there are, man is not among them; or you may say that man 
                    is a tame animal <br>
                    but is not hunted-you shall decide which of these alternatives

                  <p>Theaet. I should say, Stranger, that man is a tame animal, 
                    and I<br>
                    admit that he is hunted.<br>

                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. To what do you refer?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I mean that they lavish gifts on those whom they hunt 
                    in<br>
                    addition to other inducements.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Most true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let us admit this, then, to be the amatory art.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But that sort of hireling whose conversation is pleasing 
                    and<br>
                    who baits his hook only with pleasure and exacts nothing but 
                    his<br>
                    maintenance in return, we should all, if I am not mistaken, 
                    describe<br>
                    as possessing flattery or an art of making things pleasant.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And that sort, which professes to form acquaintances 
                    only for<br>
                    the sake of virtue, and demands a reward in the shape of <br>
                    money, may be fairly called by another name?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. To be sure.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And what is the name? Will you tell me?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. It is obvious enough; for I believe that we have<br>
                    discovered the Sophist: which is, as I conceive, the proper 
                    name for<br>
                    the class described.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then now, Theaetetus, his art may be traced as a branch 
                    of<br>
                    the appropriative, acquisitive family-which hunts<br>
                    animals,-living-land-tame animals; which hunts man,-privately-for<br>
                    hire,-taking money in exchange-having the semblance of education;<br>
                    and this is termed Sophistry, and is a hunt after young men 
                    of<br>
                    wealth and rank-such is the conclusion.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Just so.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let us take another branch of his genealogy; for he 
                    is a<br>
                    professor of a great and many sided art; and if we look back 
                    at what<br>
                    has preceded we see that he presents another aspect, besides 
                    that of<br>
                    which we are speaking.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. In what respect?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There were two sorts of acquisitive art; the one <br>
                    concerned with hunting, the other with exchange.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. There were.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And of the art of exchange there are two divisions, 
                    the one<br>
                    of giving, and the other of selling.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Let us assume that.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Next, will suppose the art of selling to be divided 
                    into two<br>
                    parts.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. How?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There is one part which is distinguished as the sale 
                    <br>
                    of a man's own productions; another, which is the exchange 
                    of the works of others.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And is not that part of exchange which takes place in 
                    <br>
                    the city,being about half of the whole, termed retailing?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And that which exchanges the goods of one city for those 
                    of<br>
                    another by selling and buying is the exchange of the merchant?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. To be sure.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And you are aware that this exchange of the merchant 
                    is of<br>
                    two kinds: it is partly concerned with food for the use of 
                    the body,<br>
                    and partly with the food of the soul which is bartered and 
                    <br>
                    received in exchange for money.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What do you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. You want to know what is the meaning of food for the 
                    soul;<br>
                    the other kind you surely understand.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Take music in general and painting and marionette playing 
                    and<br>
                    many other things, which are purchased in one city, and carried 
                    away<br>
                    and sold in another-wares of the soul which are hawked about 
                    either<br>
                    for the sake of instruction or amusement;-may not he who takes 
                    them<br>
                    about and sells them be quite as truly called a merchant as 
                    he who<br>
                    sells meats and drinks?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. To be sure he may.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And would you not call by the same name him who buys 
                    up<br>
                    knowledge and goes about from city to city exchanging his 
                    wares for<br>
                    money?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly I should.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Of this merchandise of the soul, may not one part be 
                    fairly<br>
                    termed the art of display? And there is another part which 
                    is<br>
                    certainly not less ridiculous, but being a trade in learning 
                    must be<br>
                    called by some name germane to the matter?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The latter should have two names,-one descriptive of 
                    the sale<br>
                    of the knowledge of virtue, and the other of the sale of other 
                    kinds<br>
                    of knowledge.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Of course.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The name of art-seller corresponds well enough to the 
                    latter;<br>
                    but you must try and tell me the name of the other.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. He must be the Sophist, whom we are seeking; no other 
                    name<br>
                    can possibly be right.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. No other; and so this trader in virtue again turns out 
                    to be<br>
                    our friend the Sophist, whose art may now be traced from the 
                    art of<br>
                    acquisition through exchange, trade, merchandise, to a merchandise<br>
                    of the soul which is concerned with speech and the knowledge 
                    of<br>
                    virtue.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And there may be a third reappearance of him;-for he 
                    may have<br>
                    settled down in a city, and may fabricate as well as buy these 
                    same<br>
                    wares, intending to live by selling them, and he would still 
                    <br>
                    be called a Sophist?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then that part of acquisitive art which exchanges, and 
                    of<br>
                    exchange which either sells a man's own productions or retails 
                    those<br>
                    of others; as the case may be, and in either way sells the 
                    knowledge<br>
                    of virtue, you would again term Sophistry?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I must, if I am to keep pace with the argument.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let us consider once more whether there may not be yet<br>
                    another aspect of sophistry.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What is it?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. In the acquisitive there was a subdivision of the combative<br>
                    or fighting art.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. There was.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Perhaps we had better divide it.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What shall be the divisions?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There shall be one division of the competitive, and 
                    another<br>
                    of the pugnacious.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Very good.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. That part of the pugnacious which is contest of <br>
                    bodily strength may be properly called by some such name as 
                    violent.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And when the war is one of words, it may be termed <br>
                    controversy?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And controversy may be of two kinds.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What are they?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. When long speeches are answered by long speeches, and 
                    there<br>
                    is public discussion about the just and unjust, that is forensic<br>
                    controversy.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And there is a private sort of controversy, which is 
                    cut up<br>
                    into questions and answers, and this is commonly called disputation?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes, that is the name.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And of disputation, that sort which is only a discussion<br>
                    about contracts, and is carried on at random, and without 
                    rules-art,<br>
                    is recognized by the reasoning faculty to be a distinct <br>
                    class, but has hitherto had no distinctive name, and does 
                    not deserve to receive one from us.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. No; for the different sorts of it are too minute 
                    and<br>
                    heterogeneous.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But that which proceeds by rules of art to dispute about<br>
                    justice and injustice in their own nature, and about things 
                    in<br>
                    general, we have been accustomed to call argumentation (Eristic)?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And of argumentation, one sort wastes money, and the 
                    other<br>
                    makes money.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Suppose we try and give to each of these two classes 
                    a name.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Let us do so.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I should say that the habit which leads a man to neglect 
                    his<br>
                    own affairs for the pleasure of conversation, of which the 
                    style is<br>
                    far from being agreeable to the majority of his hearers, may 
                    <br>
                    be fairly termed loquacity: such is my opinion.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. That is the common name for it.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But now who the other is, who makes money out of private<br>
                    disputation, it is your turn to say.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. There is only one true answer: he is the wonderful<br>
                    Sophist, of whom we are in pursuit, and who reappears again 
                    for the<br>
                    fourth time.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Yes, and with a fresh pedigree, for he is the money-making<br>
                    species of the Eristic, disputatious, controversial. pugnacious,<br>
                    combative, acquisitive family, as the argument has already 
                    proven.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. How true was the observation that he was a many-sided 
                    animal,<br>
                    and not to be caught with one hand, as they say!<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Then you must catch him with two.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Yes, we must, if we can. And therefore let us try, another<br>
                    track in our pursuit of him: You are aware that there are 
                    certain<br>
                    menial occupations which have names among servants?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes, there are many such; which of them do you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I mean such as sifting, straining, winnowing, threshing.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And besides these there are a great many more, such 
                    <br>
                    as carding, spinning, adjusting the warp and the woof; and 
                    thousands of similar expressions are used in the arts.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Of what are they to be patterns, and what are we 
                    <br>
                    going to do with them all?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I think that in all of these there is implied a notion 
                    of<br>
                    division.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then if, as I was saying, there is one art which includes 
                    all<br>
                    of them, ought not that art to have one name?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaes. And what is the name of the art?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The art of discerning or discriminating.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Very good.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Think whether you cannot divide this.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I should have to think a long while.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. In all the previously named processes either like has 
                    been<br>
                    separated from like or the better from the worse.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I see now what you mean.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str, There is no name for the first kind of separation; of 
                    the<br>
                    second, which throws away the worse and preserves the better, 
                    I do<br>
                    know a name.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What is it?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Every discernment or discrimination of that kind, as 
                    I have<br>
                    observed, is called a purification.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes, that is the usual expression.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And any one may see that purification is of two kinds.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Perhaps so, if he were allowed time to think; but 
                    I do not<br>
                    see at this moment.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There are many purifications of bodies which may with 
                    <br>
                    propriety be comprehended under a single name.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What are they, and what is their name?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There is the purification of living bodies in their 
                    inward<br>
                    and in their outward parts, of which the former is duly effected 
                    by<br>
                    medicine and gymnastic, the latter by the not very dignified 
                    art of<br>
                    the bath-man; and there is the purification of inanimate <br>
                    substances-to this the arts of fulling and of furbishing in 
                    general attend in a number of minute particulars, having a 
                    variety of names which are thought ridiculous.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There can be no doubt that they are thought ridiculous,<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaetetus; but then the dialectical art never considers 
                    whether the<br>
                    benefit to be derived from the purge is greater or less than 
                    that to<br>
                    be derived from the sponge, and has not more interest in the 
                    one<br>
                    than in the other; her endeavour is to know what is and is 
                    <br>
                    not kindred in all arts, with a view to the acquisition of 
                    intelligence; and having this in view, she honours them all 
                    alike, and when she makes comparisons, she counts one of them 
                    not a whit more ridiculous than another; nor does she esteem 
                    him who adduces as his example of hunting, the general's art, 
                    at all more decorous than another who cites that of the vermin-destroyer, 
                    but only as the greater<br>
                    pretender of the two. And as to your question concerning the 
                    name<br>
                    which was to comprehend all these arts of purification, whether 
                    of<br>
                    animate or inanimate bodies, the art of dialectic is in no 
                    wise<br>
                    particular about fine words, if she maybe only allowed to 
                    have a<br>
                    general name for all other purifications, binding them up 
                    <br>
                    together and separating them off from the purification of 
                    the soul or intellect. For this is the purification at which 
                    she wants to arrive, <br>
                    and this we should understand to be her aim.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes, I understand; and I agree that there are two 
                    sorts of<br>
                    purification and that one of them is concerned with the <br>
                    soul, and that there is another which is concerned with the 
                    body.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Excellent; and now listen to what I am going to say, 
                    <br>
                    and try to divide further the first of the two.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Whatever line of division you suggest, I will endeavour 
                    to<br>
                    assist you.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Do we admit that virtue is distinct from vice in the 
                    soul?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And purification was to leave the good and to cast <br>
                    out whatever is bad?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then any taking away of evil from the soul may be properly<br>
                    called purification?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And in the soul there are two kinds of evil.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What are they?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The one may be compared to disease in the body, the 
                    other to<br>
                    deformity.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I do not understand.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Perhaps you have never reflected that disease and discord 
                    are<br>
                    the same.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. To this, again, I know not what I should reply.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Do you not conceive discord to be a dissolution of kindred<br>
                    clements, originating in some disagreement?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Just that.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And is deformity anything but the want of measure, which 
                    is<br>
                    always unsightly?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Exactly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And do we not see that opinion is opposed to desire, 
                    pleasure<br>
                    to anger, reason to pain, and that all these elements are 
                    opposed to<br>
                    one another in the souls of bad men?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And yet they must all be akin?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Of course.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then we shall be right in calling vice a discord and 
                    <br>
                    disease of the soul?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Most true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And when things having motion, an aiming at an appointed<br>
                    mark, continually miss their aim and glance aside, shall we 
                    say that<br>
                    this is the effect of symmetry among them, or of the want 
                    of <br>
                    symmetry?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Clearly of the want of symmetry.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But surely we know that no soul is voluntarily ignorant 
                    of<br>
                    anything?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And what is ignorance but the aberration of a mind which 
                    is<br>
                    bent on truth, and in which the process of understanding is 
                    <br>
                    perverted?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then we are to regard an unintelligent soul as deformed 
                    and<br>
                    devoid of symmetry?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then there are these two kinds of evil in the soul-the 
                    one<br>
                    which is generally called vice, and is obviously a disease 
                    of the<br>
                    soul...<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And there is the other, which they call ignorance, and 
                    which,<br>
                    because existing only in the soul, they will not allow to 
                    be vice.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I certainly admit what I at first disputed-that there 
                    are<br>
                    two kinds of vice in the soul, and that we ought to consider<br>
                    cowardice, intemperance, and injustice to be alike forms of 
                    <br>
                    disease in the soul, and ignorance, of which there are all 
                    sorts of <br>
                    varieties, to be deformity.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And in the case of the body are there not two arts, 
                    which<br>
                    have to do with the two bodily states?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What are they?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There is gymnastic, which has to do with deformity, 
                    and<br>
                    medicine, which has to do with disease.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And where there is insolence and injustice and cowardice, 
                    is<br>
                    not chastisement the art which is most required?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. That certainly appears to be the opinion of mankind.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Again, of the various kinds of ignorance, may not instruction<br>
                    be rightly said to be the remedy?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And of the art of instruction, shall we say that there 
                    is one<br>
                    or many kinds? At any rate there are two principal ones. Think.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I will.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I believe that I can see how we shall soonest arrive 
                    at the<br>
                    answer to this question.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. How?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. If we can discover a line which divides ignorance into 
                    two<br>
                    halves. For a division of ignorance into two parts will certainly<br>
                    imply that the art of instruction is also twofold, answering 
                    to the<br>
                    two divisions of ignorance.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Well, and do you see what you are looking for?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I do seem to myself to see one very large and bad sort 
                    of<br>
                    ignorance which is quite separate, and may be weighed in the 
                    scale<br>
                    against all other sorts of ignorance put together.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What is it?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. When a person supposes that he knows, and does not know 
                    this<br>
                    appears to be the great source of all the errors of the intellect.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And this, if I am not mistaken, is the kind of ignorance<br>
                    which specially earns the title of stupidity.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. What name, then, shall be given to the sort of instruction<br>
                    which gets rid of this?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. The instruction which you mean, Stranger, is, I should<br>
                    imagine, not the teaching of handicraft arts, but what, thanks 
                    to<br>
                    us, has been termed education in this part the world.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Yes, Theaetetus, and by nearly all Hellenes. But we 
                    have<br>
                    still to consider whether education admits of any further 
                    division.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. We have.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I think that there is a point at which such a division 
                    is<br>
                    possible.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Where?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Of education, one method appears to be rougher, and 
                    another<br>
                    smoother.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. How are we to distinguish the two?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There is the time-honoured mode which our fathers commonly<br>
                    practised towards their sons, and which is still adopted by<br>
                    many-either of roughly reproving their errors, or of gently 
                    advising<br>
                    them; which varieties may be correctly included under the 
                    <br>
                    general term of admonition.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But whereas some appear to have arrived at the conclusion<br>
                    that all ignorance is involuntary, and that no one who thinks<br>
                    himself wise is willing to learn any of those things in which 
                    he is<br>
                    conscious of his own cleverness, and that the admonitory sort 
                    of<br>
                    instruction gives much trouble and does little good-<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. There they are quite right.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Accordingly, they set to work to eradicate the spirit 
                    of<br>
                    conceit in another way.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. In what way?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. They cross-examine a man's words, when he thinks that 
                    he is<br>
                    saying something and is really saying nothing, and easily 
                    convict<br>
                    him of inconsistencies in his opinions; these they then <br>
                    collect by the dialectical process, and placing them side 
                    by side, show that they contradict one another about the same 
                    things, in relation to the same things, and in the same respect. 
                    He, seeing this, is angry with himself, and grows gentle towards 
                    others, and thus is entirely delivered from great prejudices 
                    and harsh notions, in a way which is most amusing to the hearer, 
                    and produces the most lasting good effect on the person who 
                    is the subject of the operation. For as the physician considers 
                    that the body will receive no benefit from<br>
                    taking food until the internal obstacles have been removed, 
                    so the<br>
                    purifier of the soul is conscious that his patient will receive 
                    no<br>
                    benefit from the application of knowledge until he is refuted, 
                    and<br>
                    from refutation learns modesty; he must be purged of his prejudices<br>
                    first and made to think that he knows only what he knows, 
                    <br>
                    and no more.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. That is certainly the best and wisest state of mind.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. For all these reasons, Theaetetus, we must admit that<br>
                    refutation is the greatest and chiefest of purifications, 
                    and he who<br>
                    has not been refuted, though he be the Great King himself, 
                    is in an<br>
                    awful state of impurity; he is uninstructed and deformed in 
                    those<br>
                    things in which he who would be truly blessed ought to be 
                    fairest<br>
                    and purest.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And who are the ministers of this art?<br>
                    I am afraid to say the Sophists.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Why?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Lest we should assign to them too high a prerogative.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yet the Sophist has a certain likeness to our minister 
                    of<br>
                    purification.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Yes, the same sort of likeness which a wolf, who is 
                    the<br>
                    fiercest of animals, has to a dog, who is the gentlest. But 
                    he who<br>
                    would not be found tripping, ought to be very careful in this 
                    matter<br>
                    of comparisons, for they are most slippery things. Nevertheless, 
                    let<br>
                    us assume that the Sophists are the men. I say this <br>
                    provisionally, for I think that the line which divides them 
                    will be marked enough if proper care is taken.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Likely enough.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let us grant, then, that from the discerning art comes<br>
                    purification, and from purification let there be separated 
                    off a<br>
                    part which is concerned with the soul; of this mental purification<br>
                    instruction is a portion, and of instruction education, and 
                    of<br>
                    education, that refutation of vain conceit which has been 
                    discovered<br>
                    in the present argument; and let this be called by you and 
                    me the<br>
                    nobly-descended art of Sophistry.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Very well; and yet, considering the number of <br>
                    forms in which he has presented himself, I begin to doubt 
                    how I can with any truth or confidence describe the real nature 
                    of the Sophist.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. You naturally feel perplexed; and yet I think that he 
                    must be<br>
                    still more perplexed in his attempt to escape us, for as the 
                    proverb<br>
                    says, when every way is blocked, there is no escape; now, 
                    <br>
                    then, is the time of all others to set upon him.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. First let us wait a moment and recover breath, and <br>
                    while we are resting, we may reckon up in how many forms he 
                    has appeared. In the first place, he was discovered to be 
                    a paid hunter after wealth and youth.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. In the second place, he was a merchant in the goods 
                    of the<br>
                    soul.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. In the third place, he has turned out to be a retailer 
                    of the<br>
                    same sort of wares.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes; and in the fourth place, he himself manufactured 
                    the<br>
                    learned wares which he sold.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Quite right; I will try and remember the fifth myself. 
                    He<br>
                    belonged to the fighting class, and was further distinguished 
                    as a<br>
                    hero of debate, who professed the eristic art.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The sixth point was doubtful, and yet we at last <br>
                    agreed that he was a purger of souls, who cleared away notions 
                    obstructive to knowledge.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Very true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Do you not see that when the professor of any art has 
                    one<br>
                    name and many kinds of knowledge, there must be something 
                    wrong? The multiplicity of names which is applied to him shows 
                    that the common principle to which all these branches of knowledge 
                    are <br>
                    tending, is not understood.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I should imagine this to be the case.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. At any rate we will understand him, and no indolence 
                    shall<br>
                    prevent us. Let us begin again, then, and re-examine some 
                    of our<br>
                    statements concerning the Sophist; there was one thing which<br>
                    appeared to me especially characteristic of him.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. To what are you referring?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. We were saying of him, if I am not mistaken, that he 
                    was a<br>
                    disputer?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. We were.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And does he not also teach others the art of disputation?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly he does.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And about what does he profess that he teaches men to<br>
                    dispute? To begin at the beginning-Does he make them able 
                    to dispute about divine things, which are invisible to men 
                    in general?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. At any rate, he is said to do so.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And what do you say of the visible things in heaven 
                    and<br>
                    earth, and the like?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly he disputes, and teaches to dispute about 
                    them.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then, again, in private conversation, when any universal<br>
                    assertion is made about generation and essence, we know that 
                    such<br>
                    persons are tremendous argufiers, and are able to impart their 
                    own<br>
                    skill to others.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Undoubtedly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And do they not profess to make men able to dispute 
                    about law<br>
                    and about politics in general?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Why, no one would have anything to say to them, if 
                    they<br>
                    did not make these professions.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. In all and every art, what the craftsman ought to say 
                    <br>
                    in answer to any question is written down in a popular form, 
                    and he who likes may learn.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I suppose that you are referring to the precepts 
                    of<br>
                    Protagoras about wrestling and the other arts?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Yes, my friend, and about a good many other things. 
                    In a<br>
                    word, is not the art of disputation a power of disputing about 
                    all<br>
                    things?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly; there does not seem to be much which is 
                    <br>
                    left out.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But oh! my dear youth, do you suppose this possible? 
                    for<br>
                    perhaps your young eyes may see things which to our duller 
                    sight do<br>
                    not appear.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. To what are you alluding? I do not think that I understand<br>
                    your present question.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I ask whether anybody can understand all things.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Happy would mankind be if such a thing were possible!<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Soc. But how can any one who is ignorant dispute in a rational<br>
                    manner against him who knows?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. He cannot.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then why has the sophistical art such a mysterious power?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. To what do you refer?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. How do the Sophists make young men believe in their 
                    <br>
                    supreme and universal wisdom? For if they neither disputed 
                    nor were thought to dispute rightly, or being thought to do 
                    so were deemed no wiser for their controversial skill, then, 
                    to quote your own <br>
                    observation, no one would give them money or be willing to 
                    learn their art.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. They certainly would not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But they are willing.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes, they are.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Yes, and the reason, as I should imagine, is that they 
                    are<br>
                    supposed to have knowledge of those things about which they 
                    dispute?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And they dispute about all things?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And therefore, to their disciples, they appear to be 
                    all-wise?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But they are not; for that was shown to be impossible.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Impossible, of course.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then the Sophist has been shown to have a sort of conjectural<br>
                    or apparent knowledge only of all things, which is not the 
                    truth?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Exactly; no better description of him could be given.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let us now take an illustration, which will still more<br>
                    clearly explain his nature.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What is it?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I will tell you, and you shall answer me, giving your 
                    very<br>
                    closest attention. Suppose that a person were to profess, 
                    not that<br>
                    he could speak or dispute, but that he knew how to make and 
                    do all<br>
                    things, by a single art.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. All things?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I see that you do not understand the first word that 
                    I utter,<br>
                    for you do not understand the meaning of &quot;all.&quot;<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. No, I do not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Under all things, I include you and me, and also animals 
                    and<br>
                    trees.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What do you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Suppose a person to say that he will make you and me, 
                    and all<br>
                    creatures.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What would he mean by &quot;making&quot;? He cannot 
                    be a<br>
                    husbandman;-for you said that he is a maker of animals.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Yes; and I say that he is also the maker of the sea, 
                    and the<br>
                    earth, and the heavens, and the gods, and of all other things; 
                    and,<br>
                    further, that he can make them in no time, and sell them for 
                    a few<br>
                    pence.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. That must be a jest.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And when a man says that he knows all things, and can 
                    teach<br>
                    them to another at a small cost, and in a short time, is not 
                    that a<br>
                    jest?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And is there any more artistic or graceful form of jest 
                    than<br>
                    imitation?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly not; and imitation is a very comprehensive 
                    term,<br>
                    which includes under one class the most diverse sorts of things.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. We know, of course, that he who professes by one art 
                    to make<br>
                    all things is really a painter, and by the painter's art makes<br>
                    resemblances of real things which have the same name with 
                    <br>
                    them; and he can deceive the less intelligent sort of young 
                    children, to whom he shows his pictures at a distance, into 
                    the belief that he has the absolute power of making whatever 
                    he likes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And may there not be supposed to be an imitative art 
                    of<br>
                    reasoning? Is it not possible to enchant the hearts of young 
                    men by<br>
                    words poured through their ears, when they are still at a 
                    distance<br>
                    from the truth of facts, by exhibiting to them fictitious 
                    arguments,<br>
                    and making them think that they are true, and that the speaker 
                    is<br>
                    the wisest of men in all things?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes; why should there not be another such art?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But as time goes on, and their hearers advance in years, 
                    and<br>
                    come into closer contact with realities, and have learnt by 
                    sad<br>
                    experience to see and feel the truth of things, are not the 
                    greater<br>
                    part of them compelled to change many opinions which they 
                    formerly<br>
                    entertained, so that the great appears small to them, and 
                    the easy<br>
                    difficult, and all their dreamy speculations are overturned 
                    by the<br>
                    facts of life?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. That is my view, as far as I can judge, although, 
                    <br>
                    at my age, I may be one of those who see things at a distance 
                    only.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And the wish of all of us, who are your friends, is 
                    and<br>
                    always will be to bring you as near to the truth as we can 
                    <br>
                    without the sad reality. And now I should like you to tell 
                    me, whether <br>
                    the Sophist is not visibly a magician and imitator of true 
                    being; or are we still disposed to think that he may have 
                    a true knowledge of the<br>
                    various matters about which he disputes?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. But how can he, Stranger? Is there any doubt, <br>
                    after what has been said, that he is to be located in one 
                    of the divisions of children's play?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then we must place him in the class of magicians and 
                    mimics.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly we must.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And now our business is not to let the animal out, for 
                    we<br>
                    have got him in a sort of dialectical net, and there is one 
                    thing<br>
                    which he decidedly will not escape.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What is that?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The inference that he is a juggler.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Precisely my own opinion of him.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then, clearly, we ought as soon as possible to divide 
                    the<br>
                    image-making art, and go down into the net, and, if the Sophist 
                    does<br>
                    not run away from us, to seize him according to orders and 
                    <br>
                    deliver him over to reason, who is the lord of the hunt, and 
                    proclaim the capture of him; and if he creeps into the recesses 
                    of the imitative<br>
                    art, and secretes himself in one of them, to divide again 
                    and follow<br>
                    him up until in some sub-section of imitation he is caught. 
                    For our<br>
                    method of tackling each and all is one which neither he nor 
                    any<br>
                    other creature will ever escape in triumph.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Well said; and let us do as you propose.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Well, then, pursuing the same analytic method as before, 
                    I<br>
                    think that I can discern two divisions of the imitative art, 
                    but I<br>
                    am not as yet able to see in which of them the desired form 
                    is to be<br>
                    found.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Will you tell me first what are two divisions of 
                    which you<br>
                    are speaking?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. One is the art of likeness-making;-generally a likeness 
                    of<br>
                    anything is made by producing a copy which is executed according 
                    to the proportions of the original, similar in length and 
                    breadth and<br>
                    depth, each thing receiving also its appropriate colour.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Is not this always the aim of imitation?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Not always; in works either of sculpture or of painting,<br>
                    which are of any magnitude, there is a certain degree of deception;<br>
                    -for artists were to give the true proportions of their fair 
                    works,<br>
                    the upper part, which is farther off, would appear to be out 
                    of<br>
                    proportion in comparison with the lower, which is nearer; 
                    and so<br>
                    they give up the truth in their images and make only the proportions<br>
                    which appear to be beautiful, disregarding the real ones.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And that which being other is also like, may we not 
                    <br>
                    fairly call a likeness or image?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And may we not, as I did just now, call that part of 
                    the<br>
                    imitative art which is concerned with making such images the 
                    art of<br>
                    likeness making?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Let that be the name.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And what shall we call those resemblances of the beautiful,<br>
                    which appear such owing to the unfavourable position of the 
                    <br>
                    spectator, whereas if a person had the power of getting a 
                    correct view of works of such magnitude, they would appear 
                    not even like that to which they profess to be like? May we 
                    not call these &quot;appearances,&quot; since they appear 
                    only and are not really like?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There is a great deal of this kind of thing in <br>
                    painting, and in all imitation.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Of course.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And may we not fairly call the sort of art, which produces 
                    an<br>
                    appearance and not an image, phantastic art?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Most fairly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. These then are the two kinds of image making-the art 
                    of<br>
                    making likenesses, and phantastic or the art of making appearances?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I was doubtful before in which of them I should place 
                    the<br>
                    Sophist, nor am I even now able to see clearly; verily he 
                    is a<br>
                    wonderful and inscrutable creature. And now in the cleverest 
                    <br>
                    manner he has got into an impossible place.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes, he has.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Do you speak advisedly, or are you carried away at the 
                    moment<br>
                    by the habit of assenting into giving a hasty answer?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. May I ask to what you are referring?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. My dear friend, we are engaged in a very difficult<br>
                    speculation-there can be no doubt of that; for how a thing 
                    can<br>
                    appear and seem, and not be, or how a man can say a thing 
                    <br>
                    which is not true, has always been and still remains a very 
                    perplexing question. Can any one say or think that falsehood 
                    really exists, and <br>
                    avoid being caught in a contradiction? Indeed, Theaetetus, 
                    the task is a difficult one.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Why?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. He who says that falsehood exists has the audacity to 
                    assert<br>
                    the being of not-being; for this is implied in the possibility 
                    of<br>
                    falsehood. But, my boy, in the days when I was a boy, the 
                    great<br>
                    Parmenides protested against this doctrine, and to the end 
                    <br>
                    of his life he continued to inculcate the same lesson-always 
                    repeating both in verse and out of verse:Keep your mind from 
                    this way of enquiry, for never will you show that not-being 
                    is</p>
                  <p>Such is his testimony, which is confirmed by the very expression<br>
                    when sifted a little. Would you object to begin with the <br>
                    consideration of the words themselves?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Never mind about me; I am only desirous that you 
                    should<br>
                    carry on the argument in the best way, and that you should 
                    take me<br>
                    with you.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Very good; and now say, do we venture to utter the forbidden<br>
                    word &quot;not-being&quot;?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly we do.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Let us be serious then, and consider the question neither 
                    in<br>
                    strife nor play: suppose that one of the hearers of Parmenides 
                    was<br>
                    asked, &quot;To is the term 'not-being' to be applied?&quot;-do 
                    you know what<br>
                    sort of object he would single out in reply, and what answer 
                    he<br>
                    would make to the enquirer?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. That is a difficult question, and one not to be answered<br>
                    at all by a person like myself.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There is at any rate no difficulty in seeing that the 
                    <br>
                    predicate &quot;not-being&quot; is not applicable to any being.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. None, certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And if not to being, then not to something.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Of course not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. It is also plain, that in speaking of something we speak 
                    of<br>
                    being, for to speak of an abstract something naked and isolated 
                    from<br>
                    all being is impossible.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Impossible.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. You mean by assenting to imply that he who says something<br>
                    must say some one thing?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Some in the singular (ti) you would say is the sign 
                    of one,<br>
                    some in the dual (tine) of two, some in the plural (tines) 
                    of many?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Exactly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then he who says &quot;not something&quot; must say 
                    absolutely nothing.<br>
                    Theaet. Most assuredly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And as we cannot admit that a man speaks and says nothing, 
                    he<br>
                    who says &quot;not-being&quot; does not speak at all.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. The difficulty of the argument can no further go.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Not yet, my friend, is the time for such a word; for 
                    there<br>
                    still remains of all perplexities the first and greatest, 
                    <br>
                    touching the very foundation of the matter.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What do you mean? Do not be afraid to speak.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. To that which is, may be attributed some other thing 
                    which is?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But can anything which is, be attributed to that which 
                    is not?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Impossible.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And all number is to be reckoned among things which 
                    are?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes, surely number, if anything, has a real existence.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then we must not attempt to attribute to not-being number<br>
                    either in the singular or plural?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. The argument implies that we should be wrong in doing 
                    so.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But how can a man either express in words or even conceive 
                    in<br>
                    thought things which are not or a thing which is not without 
                    number?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. How indeed?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. When we speak of things which are not attributing plurality<br>
                    to not-being?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But, on the other hand, when we say &quot;what is not,&quot; 
                    do we not<br>
                    attribute unity?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Manifestly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Nevertheless, we maintain that you may not and ought 
                    not to<br>
                    attribute being to not-being?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Most true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Do you see, then, that not-being in itself can neither 
                    be<br>
                    spoken, uttered, or thought, but that it is unthinkable,<br>
                    unutterable, unspeakable, indescribable?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. But, if so, I was wrong in telling you just now that 
                    the<br>
                    difficulty which was coming is the greatest of all.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What! is there a greater still behind?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Well, I am surprised, after what has been said already, 
                    that<br>
                    you do not see the difficulty in which he who would refute 
                    the<br>
                    notion of not-being is involved. For he is compelled to contradict<br>
                    himself as soon as he makes the attempt.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What do you mean? Speak more clearly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Do not expect clearness from me. For I, who maintain 
                    that<br>
                    not-being has no part either in the one or many, just now 
                    <br>
                    spoke and am still speaking of not-being as one; for I say 
                    &quot;not-being.&quot; Do you understand?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And a little while ago I said that not-being is unutterable,<br>
                    unspeakable, indescribable: do you follow?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I do after a fashion.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. When I introduced the word &quot;is,&quot; did I not 
                    contradict what I<br>
                    said before?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Clearly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And in using the singular verb, did I not speak of <br>
                    not-being as one?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And when I spoke of not-being as indescribable and<br>
                    unspeakable and unutterable, in using each of these words 
                    in the<br>
                    singular, did I not refer to not-being as one?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And yet we say that, strictly speaking, it should not 
                    be<br>
                    defined as one or many, and should not even be called &quot;it,&quot; 
                    for the<br>
                    use of the word &quot;it&quot; would imply a form of unity.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Quite true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. How, then, can any one put any faith in me? For now, 
                    <br>
                    as always, I am unequal to the refutation of not-being. And 
                    therefore, as I was saying, do not look to me for the right 
                    way of speaking about not-being; but come, let us try the 
                    experiment with you.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What do you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Make a noble effort, as becomes youth, and endeavour 
                    with all<br>
                    your might to speak of not-being in a right manner, without<br>
                    introducing into it either existence or unity or plurality.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. It would be a strange boldness in me which would 
                    <br>
                    attempt the task when I see you thus discomfited.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Say no more of ourselves; but until we find some one 
                    or other<br>
                    who can speak of not-being without number, we must acknowledge 
                    that the Sophist is a clever rogue who will not be got out 
                    of his hole.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Most true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And if we say to him that he professes an art of making<br>
                    appearances, he will grapple with us and retort our argument 
                    upon<br>
                    ourselves; and when we call him an image-maker he will say, 
                    <br>
                    &quot;Pray what do you mean at all by an image?&quot; -and 
                    I should like to know, Theaetetus, how we can possibly answer 
                    the younker's question?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. We shall doubtless tell him of the images which are<br>
                    reflected in water or in mirrors; also of sculptures, pictures, 
                    and<br>
                    other duplicates.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I see, Theaetetus, that you have never made the <br>
                    acquaintance of the Sophist.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Why do you think so?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. He will make believe to have his eyes shut, or to have 
                    none.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What do you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. When you tell him of something existing in a mirror, 
                    or in<br>
                    sculpture, and address him as though he had eyes, he will 
                    <br>
                    laugh you to scorn, and will pretend that he knows nothing 
                    of mirrors and streams, or of sight at all; he will say that 
                    he is asking about an<br>
                    idea.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What can he mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The common notion pervading all these objects, which 
                    you<br>
                    speak of as many, and yet call by the single name of image, 
                    as<br>
                    though it were the unity under which they were all included. 
                    How<br>
                    will you maintain your ground against him?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. How. Stranger, can I describe an image except as 
                    something<br>
                    fashioned in the likeness of the true?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And do you mean this something to be some other true 
                    thing,<br>
                    or what do you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly not another true thing, but only a resemblance.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And you mean by true that which really is?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And the not true is that which is the opposite of the 
                    true?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Exactly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. A resemblance, then, is not really real, if, as you 
                    say, not<br>
                    true?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Nay, but it is in a certain sense.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. You mean to say, not in a true sense?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes; it is in reality only an image.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Then what we call an image is in reality really unreal.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. In what a strange complication of being and <br>
                    not-being we are involved!<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Strange! I should think so. See how, by his reciprocation 
                    of<br>
                    opposites, the many-headed Sophist has compelled us, quite 
                    <br>
                    against our will, to admit the existence of not-being.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes, indeed, I see.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The difficulty is how to define his art without falling 
                    into<br>
                    a contradiction.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. How do you mean? And where does the danger lie?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. When we say that he deceives us with an illusion, and 
                    that<br>
                    his art is illusory, do we mean that our soul is led by his 
                    art to<br>
                    think falsely, or what do we mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. There is nothing else to be said.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Again, false opinion is that form of opinion which thinks 
                    the<br>
                    opposite of the truth:-You would assent?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. You mean to say that false opinion thinks what is not?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Of course.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Does false opinion think that things which are not are 
                    not,<br>
                    or that in a certain sense they are?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Things that are not must be imagined to exist in 
                    a certain<br>
                    sense, if any degree of falsehood is to be possible.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And does not false opinion also think that things which 
                    most<br>
                    certainly exist do not exist at all?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And here, again, is falsehood?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Falsehood-yes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And in like manner, a false proposition will be deemed 
                    to be<br>
                    one which are, the nonexistence of things which are, and the 
                    <br>
                    existence of things which are not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. There is no other way in which a false proposition 
                    can<br>
                    arise.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. There is not; but the Sophist will deny these statements. 
                    And<br>
                    indeed how can any rational man assent to them, when the very<br>
                    expressions which we have just used were before acknowledged 
                    by us to be unutterable, unspeakable, indescribable, unthinkable? 
                    <br>
                    Do you see his point, Theaetetus?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Of course he will say that we are contradicting ourselves<br>
                    when we hazard the assertion, that falsehood exists in opinion 
                    and<br>
                    in words; for in maintaining this, we are compelled over and 
                    over<br>
                    again to assert being of not-being, which we admitted just 
                    now to be<br>
                    an utter impossibility.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. How well you remember! And now it is high time to hold 
                    a<br>
                    consultation as to what we ought to do about the Sophist; 
                    for if we<br>
                    persist in looking for him in the class of false workers and<br>
                    magicians, you see that the handles for objection and the 
                    <br>
                    difficulties which will arise are very numerous and obvious.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. They are indeed.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. We have gone through but a very small portion of <br>
                    them, and they are really infinite.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. If that is the case, we cannot possibly catch the 
                    Sophist.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Shall we then be so faint-hearted as to give him up?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Certainly not, I should say, if we can get the slightest<br>
                    hold upon him.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Will you then forgive me, and, as your words imply, 
                    not be<br>
                    altogether displeased if I flinch a little from the grasp 
                    of such a<br>
                    sturdy argument?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. To be sure I will.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I have a yet more urgent request to make.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Which is-?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. That you will promise not to regard me as a parricide.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. And why?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Because, in self-defence, I must test the philosophy 
                    of my<br>
                    father Parmenides, and try to prove by main force, that in 
                    a certain<br>
                    sense not-being is, and that being, on the other hand, is 
                    not.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Some attempt of the kind is clearly needed.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. Yes, a blind man, as they say, might see that, and, 
                    unless<br>
                    these questions are decided in one way or another, no one 
                    when he<br>
                    speaks false words, or false opinion, or idols, or images 
                    or<br>
                    imitations or appearances, or about the arts which are concerned<br>
                    with them; can avoid falling into ridiculous contradictions.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Most true.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And therefore I must venture to lay hands on my father's<br>
                    argument; for if I am to be over-scrupulous, I shall have 
                    to give<br>
                    the matter up.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Nothing in the world should ever induce us to do 
                    so.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I have a third little request which I wish to make.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What is it?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. You heard me-say what-I have always felt and still feel-that<br>
                    I have no heart for this argument?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I did.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I tremble at the thought of what I have said, and expect 
                    that<br>
                    you will deem me mad, when you hear of my sudden changes and<br>
                    shiftings; let me therefore observe, that I am examining the<br>
                    question entirely out of regard for you.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. There is no reason for you to fear that I shall impute 
                    any<br>
                    impropriety to you, if you attempt this refutation and proof; 
                    take<br>
                    heart, therefore, and proceed.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And where shall I begin the perilous enterprise? I think 
                    that<br>
                    the road which I must take is-<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Which?-Let me hear.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I think that we had better, first of all, consider the 
                    points<br>
                    which at present are regard as self-evident, lest we may have 
                    fallen<br>
                    into some confusion, and be too ready to assent to one another,<br>
                    fancying that we are quite clear about them.<br>
                    Theaet. Say more distinctly what you mean.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I think that Parmenides, and all ever yet undertook 
                    to<br>
                    determine the number and nature of existences, talked to us 
                    in<br>
                    rather a light and easy strain.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. How?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. As if we had been children, to whom they repeated each 
                    his<br>
                    own mythus or story;-one said that there were three principles, 
                    and<br>
                    that at one time there was war between certain of them; and 
                    <br>
                    then again there was peace, and they were married and begat 
                    children, <br>
                    and brought them up; and another spoke of two principles,-a 
                    moist and a dry, or a hot and a cold, and made them marry 
                    and cohabit. The Eleatics, however, in our part of the world, 
                    say that things are many in name, but in nature one; this 
                    is their mythus, which goes back to Xenophanes, and is even 
                    older. Then there are Ionian, and in more<br>
                    recent times Sicilian muses, who have arrived at the conclusion 
                    that<br>
                    to unite the two principles is safer, and to say that being 
                    is one and<br>
                    many, and that these are held together by enmity and friendship,<br>
                    ever parting, ever meeting, as the-severer Muses assert, while 
                    the<br>
                    gentler ones do not insist on the perpetual strife and peace, 
                    but<br>
                    admit a relaxation and alternation of them; peace and unity 
                    sometimes prevailing under the sway of Aphrodite, and then 
                    again plurality and war, by reason of a principle of strife. 
                    Whether any of them spoke the truth in all this is hard to 
                    determine; besides, antiquity and famous men should have reverence, 
                    and not be liable to accusations; so serious; Yet one thing 
                    may be said of them without offence-<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. What thing?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. That they went on their several ways disdaining to notice<br>
                    people like ourselves; they did not care whether they took 
                    us with<br>
                    them, or left us behind them.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. How do you mean?<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. I mean to say, that when they talk of one, two, or more<br>
                    elements, which are or have become or are becoming, or again 
                    of heat<br>
                    mingling with cold, assuming in some other part of their works<br>
                    separations and mixtures,-tell me, Theaetetus, do you understand<br>
                    what they mean by these expressions? When I was a younger 
                    man, I<br>
                    used to fancy that I understood quite well what was meant 
                    by the<br>
                    term &quot;not-being,&quot; which is our present subject of 
                    dispute; <br>
                    and now you see in what a fix we are about it.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I see.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And very likely we have been getting into the same perplexity<br>
                    about &quot;being,&quot; and yet may fancy that when anybody 
                    utters <br>
                    the word, we understand him quite easily, although we do not 
                    know about not-being. But we may be; equally ignorant of both.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. I dare say.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. And the same may be said of all the terms just mentioned.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. True.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. The consideration of most of them may be deferred; but 
                    we had<br>
                    better now discuss the chief captain and leader of them.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Of what are you speaking? You clearly think that 
                    we must<br>
                    first investigate what people mean by the word &quot;being.&quot;<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Str. You follow close at heels, Theaetetus. For the right 
                    method,<br>
                    I conceive, will be to call into our presence the dualistic<br>
                    philosophers and to interrogate them. &quot;Come,&quot; we 
                    will say, &quot;Ye, who<br>
                    affirm that hot and cold or any other two principles are the 
                    <br>
                    universe,<br>
                    what is this term which you apply to both of them, and what 
                    do you<br>
                    mean when you say that both and each of them 'are'? How are 
                    we to<br>
                    understand the word 'are'? Upon your view, are we to suppose 
                    that<br>
                    there is a third principle over and above the other two-three 
                    in<br>
                    all, and not two? For clearly you cannot say that one of the 
                    two<br>
                    principles is being, and yet attribute being equally to both 
                    of<br>
                    them; for, if you did, whichever of the two is identified 
                    with<br>
                    being, will comprehend the other; and so they will be one 
                    and not<br>
                    two.&quot;<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theaet. Very true.</p>

                INT. FOYER - NIGHT</p>
              <p>O'Connell and Jonathan race into the foyer and skid to a<br>
                stop as they see Henderson's shriveled body on the floor.<br>
                O'Connell runs up to Evelyn's door and rattles the knob,<br>
                still locked. He bends down and looks in through the KEYHOLE.</p>
              <p>EVELYN'S ROOM - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Imhotep leans down towards Evelyn, about to kiss her as she<br>
                sleeps. The door starts to CRASH and BANG from O'Connell.<br>
                Imhotep ignores it. And KISSES Evelyn. His lips and mouth<br>
                instantly start to DEGENERATE and DECAY. Right down to the<br>
                bone. The door BURSTS OPEN. Evelyn wakes-up. Sees Imhotep's<br>
                rotted mouth kissing her. She SCREAMS and shoves him away.<br>
                Imhotep's putrid mouth grimaces in sadness.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Get your hands off my girl, pal.</p>
              <p>Imhotep's sadness turns to anger as he spins around and faces<br>
                O'Connell. Imhotep licks his fetid lips. O'Connell smirks.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Nice lips.</p>
              <p>Imhotep starts to move for O'Connell.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> I figured you might be here,<br>
                so I brought a friend.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>He throws the white cat at Imhotep. Imhotep instinctively<br>
                catches it. He SHRIEKS, drops the cat and stumbles back<br>
                towards the window, --which suddenly BLOWS OPEN. Imhotep<br>
                spins like a dervish and BURSTS INTO A WHIRLWIND OF SAND.<br>
                Everybody covers their eyes. The Imhotep/sand-devil EXPLODES<br>
                out the window and vanishes over the compound.</p>
              <p>Jonathan aims his gun at the window, his hand shaking badly.<br>
                O'Connell hugs Evelyn as she wipes her mouth in disgust.</p>
              <p>Daniels walks in, looks at Henderson's shriveled body on<br>
                the floor . .... and drops the martini glasses.</p>
              <p>INT. 1923 CONVERTIBLE DUSSENBERG - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Jonathan races his big convertible through the streets,<br>
                HONKING constantly. Evelyn sits between him and O'Connell,<br>
                looking scared and nervous, then she gives O'Connell a look.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> You called me your girl?</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> What? ... Oh yeah, that was just<br>
                um, you know, figure a speech.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> I think you were jealous</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did<br>
                you see that guy's face?</p>
              <p>Daniels leans forward from the back seat, filled with fear,</p>
              <p> DANIELS</p>
              <p> Shut-up! JUST SHUT-UP! We gotta<br>
                do somethin'! we gotta do somethin,<br>
                NOW! Before it's too late!</p>
              <p>They race into the driveway of the museum of Antiquities.</p>
              <p>EXT. CAIRO BAZAAR - NIGHT</p>
              <p>A FULL MOON now shines down on the bazaar, still bustling<br>
                with activity. Suddenly, a BREEZE kicks-in. GREEN MIST begins<br>
                to SWIRL down the street and through the stalls. The people<br>
                begin to CHOKE and COUGH and RETCH, as if being hit by a<br>
                severe sickness. --It's already too late.</p>
              <p>Imhotep strolls through the sickened mob, his face half<br>
                rotted off, his deformed mouth grinning happily. Beni is<br>
                at his side, looking very nervous. And then, one-by-one',<br>
                the people silently begin to follow Imhotep, their skin<br>
                now covered in disgustingly hideous BOILS AND SORES.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - NIGHT</p>
              <p>O'Connell., Jonathan, Daniels, the Curator and Ardeth Bay<br>
                fo11ow Evelyn as she strides through the museum.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Last month I came across an<br>
                inscription that mentioned<br>
                The Book Of The Dead.</p>
              <p> DANIELS</p>
              <p> That book we found at Hamunaptra?</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Yes. I dismissed it, because it<br>
                talked about bringing people<br>
                back from the dead. A notion<br>
                I was unwilling to believe.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Believe it, sister. That's what<br>
                brought our buddy back to life.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> And now he's going to use it<br>
                to bring his girlfriend back</p>
              <p> ARDETH BAY</p>
              <p> And if he succeeds, the two of<br>
                them together will bring about<br>
                the apocalypse.</p>
              <p>The Curator joins Evelyn at her side as she heads up the<br>
                stairs, everyone else in hot pursuit.</p>
              <p> THE CURATOR</p>
              <p> The plagues we have seen so far,<br>
                are merely Imhotep flexing his<br>
                muscles. only at the moment of<br>
                Anck-su-namun's resurrection<br>
                will he be truly invincible.</p>
              <p>They reach the display cases. Evelyn quickly opens them.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> I'm thinking that if the black<br>
                Book Of The Dead can bring people<br>
                back to life--</p>
              <p> CURATOR</p>
              <p> --then perhaps, the golden Book<br>
                Of The Living can return them<br>
                to the underworld.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Exactly -</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> So your sayin', if we find the<br>
                book made outta gold--</p>
              <p> CURATOR</p>
              <p> --And read the sacred incantations<br>
                contained inside it.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> You think it'll send this guy<br>
                back to hell?</p>
              <p> CURATOR</p>
              <p> Correct,</p>
              <p>And that's when LOUD CHANTING is heard coming from outside<br>
                They all rush over to the upper windows and look down--<br>
                OUTSIDE: A large, CRAZED MOB covered in hideous boils and sores<br>
                comes CHANTING up the driveway: 'Anck-su-namun! Anck-su-namun!</p>
              <p> ARDETH BAY</p>
              <p> it has begun. The beginning of<br>
                the end.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Not quite yet it hasn't. C'mon,</p>
              <p>Evelyn dashes back to the display cases. Everyone follows.</p>
              <p>EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT</p>
              <p>The crazed mob CRASHES into the huge front doors, which are<br>
                locked. They pound furiously, throwing themselves at it while<br>
                CHANTING CONSTANTLY. Imhotep solemnly comes up the driveway.</p>
              <p>INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - UPPER BALCONY - NIGHT</p>
              <p>The BANGING on the doors can be heard as Evelyn and the<br>
                Curator quickly sort through broken pieces of stone tablets.<br>
                The others watch. Evelyn pulls out a large piece.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Got it!</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Got what?</p>
              <p>The BANGING gets LOUDER. Multiple windows SHATTER. Evelyn<br>
                talks while quickly translating the tablet:</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Since the black Book of The Dead<br>
                was found inside the statue of<br>
                Anubis, then according to this,<br>
                the golden Book of The Living<br>
                should be inside ........</p>
              <p>Evelyn finds the translation in the tablet and smiles.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> what?</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> What?</p>
              <p> DANIELS</p>
              <p> WHAT!?</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> The golden Book Of The Living,<br>
                is inside the statue of Koz-us.</p>
              <p> CURATOR</p>
              <p> Which would be located not far to<br>
                the east of the Anubis statue.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Don't tell me we gotta go back<br>
                out there?</p>
              <p> CURATOR</p>
              <p> If we want to kill the creature, yes.</p>
              <p>TWO HIDEOUS BOIL &amp; SORE-COVERED MEN charge out of a doorway,<br>
                SCREAMING. O'Connell and Ardeth Bay grab them and chuck them<br>
                over the railing. The men fly through the air and CRASH into<br>
                the lower display cases. The front doors suddenly BURST OPEN,<br>
                The crazed mob pours into the museum. our heroes haul-ass<br>
                across the balcony and down the staircase.</p>
              <p>EXT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITY - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Jonathan sneaks out of some bushes and quickly heads for his<br>
                convertible. Suddenly, a splinter group of the diseased mob<br>
                comes around the side of the museum. Jonathan instantly bugs<br>
                his eyes out, starts drooling, and begins CHANTING---</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Anck-su-namun! Anck-su-namun!</p>
              <p>The crazed group runs past him and heads into the front doors<br>
                of the museum. Jonathan leaps into the convertible, fires it<br>
                up and 180's it back over to the bushes.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>O'Connell, Evelyn, Daniels, Ardeth Bay and the Curator jump<br>
                inside the car. Beni steps out of the museum and sees them.</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> Imhotep! IMHOTEP!</p>
              <p>Imhotep looks out of the museum from the shattered upper<br>
                windows just as the convertible PEELS OUT. O'Connell points a<br>
                finger at Beni as they race past him.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> You're gonna get yours, pal!</p>
              <p>Imhotep UNHINGES his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman<br>
                size, he lets out one of his horrific, primordial SHRIEKS.</p>
              <p>His disease-ridden disciples immediately begin pouring out<br>
                of the front doors of the museum and chasing after the car.</p>
              <p>EXT. BAZAAR - NIGHT</p>
              <p>The convertible hauls-ass down the narrow bazaar street.<br>
                Crazies start jumping out of stalls and LEAPING onto the<br>
                car. O'Connell and the others fight them off, throwing them<br>
                overboard. More people JUMP on. Jonathan SWERVES the car,<br>
                CRASHES through some stalls, knocking them off, but not<br>
                before they manage to open the back door and YANK Daniels<br>
                out. He TUMBLES across the pavement. Gets up SHOOTING. Backs<br>
                into a corner, FIRING his pistol into the hideous rabble,<br>
                killing several, keeping them at bay. His gun goes empty,<br>
                CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! But the mob stays back, looking at him<br>
                like rabid vultures. Daniels eyes them, filled with fear.<br>
                The mob parts like the red sea as Imhotep walks through them<br>
                and up to Daniels. Daniels whimpers in fear, tears pour down<br>
                his cheeks. Then he gets an idea, reaches into his pocket,<br>
                and pulls out his jewel encrusted SACRED CANOPIC JAR. He<br>
                holds it out for Imhotep. Imhotep takes it and grins. Through<br>
                his tears, Daniels grins back, hopeful that he'll be spared.</p>
              <p>WE CUT WIDE: Somewhere in the middle of the crazed, diseased<br>
                mob, we hear Daniels give out A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM ........</p>
              <p>INT./EXT. CONVERTIBLE - STREETS - NIGHT</p>
              <p>The convertible slowly motors down the narrow alleys. WE<br>
                DOLLY across the hood of the car from Jonathan to Evelyn to<br>
                O'Connell. Ardeth Bay and the Curator are still in the back.<br>
                All of them staring out the front windshield. Freaked-out.<br>
                Then suddenly one of the hideous ghouls CRASHES through the<br>
                windshield! Everybody SCREAMS. Jonathan hits the gas, loses<br>
                control, the car SLAMS into a wall. O'Connell grabs Evelyn.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> C'mon! C'mon! Let's go! Let's go!</p>
              <p><br>
                They all leap out of the car. But the angry, festering mob<br>
                quickly surrounds them. O'Connell quickly reaches into his<br>
                gunny-sack, pulls out a stick of dynamite, then reaches into<br>
                his pocket and pulls out a match. He looks around for a way<br>
                to light it, then reaches over and strikes it across Ardeth<br>
                Bay's stubbly face. Ardeth Bay YELPS. O'Connell holds the lit<br>
                match near the fuse.</p>
              <p>The crazed, CHANTING mob gives O'Connell a wide berth,<br>
                staring at him and the others with insane, bloodshot eyes.</p>
              <p>And then Imhotep steps through, --having fully regenerated,<br>
                he now looks as young and handsome and muscular as he did the<br>
                day he was buried alive. Evelyn stares at him.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> He's gorgeous.</p>
              <p>O'Connell gives her a look, the match burns his fingers. He<br>
                YELPS and throws it down, grabs another match and strikes it<br>
                across Ardeth Bay's face again. Ardeth Bay YELPS and gives<br>
                O'Connell a look to kill. The Curator shakes his head.</p>
              <p> THE CURATOR</p>
              <p> He has consummated the curse,<br>
                now all he need do is raise<br>
                Anck-su-namun from the dead,<br>
                then it will be the end of us,<br>
                and the beginning for them.</p>
              <p>Imhotep moves forward, heading right for them. O'Connell<br>
                LIGHTS THE FUSE. Imhotep steps up to O'Connell and stops,<br>
                watching the fuse burn down. it's a game of chicken. The<br>
                tension mounts. The LIT FUSE is about to vanish inside the<br>
                stick of dynamite, blowing it up, --when Evelyn leans forward<br>
                and blows it out. O'Connell exhales, but keeps his eyes on<br>
                Imhotep, who extends his hand to Evelyn.</p>
              <p> IMHOTEP</p>
              <p> Koontash dai na.</p>
              <p>Beni steps through the swarming mass, translating.</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> Take his hand and he will<br>
                spare the others.</p>
              <p>Evelyn hesitates, looks around at the huge, bloodthirsty<br>
                crowd surrounding them, holding axes, picks and scimitars,<br>
                waiting to pounce, then she looks at Imhotep, confident,<br>
                powerful, invincible. Then she looks at O'Connell.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Any bright ideas?</p>
              <p><br>
                O'Connell talks through angry, grit teeth.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Sorry, fresh out.</p>
              <p>Evelyn looks back at Imhotep, then starts to reach out to<br>
                take his hand. Both O'Connell and Jonathan move to stop her,<br>
                --but Ardeth Bay grabs them both and holds them tight.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL<br>
                <br>
                Don't do it, Evelyn.<br>
                <br>
                EVELYN</p>
              <p> I have no choice.</p>
              <p>Evelyn's trembling hand touches Imhotep's: His hand closes<br>
                around hers. Nothing happens. Imhotep smiles.</p>
              <p> IMHOTEP</p>
              <p> Keetah mi pharos, aja nilo, isirlan.</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> Come with me my princess. It is<br>
                time to make you mine, forever.</p>
              <p>Evelyn gives Beni a nasty look, correcting him--</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> All eternity, idiot,</p>
              <p>Then she looks at O'Connell and puts on her best face.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> You better think of something,<br>
                because if he turns me into a<br>
                mummy, your the first one I'm<br>
                coming after.</p>
              <p>O'Connell almost smiles</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Got guts, lady.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Yes, I know, and I'd like to<br>
                keep them.</p>
              <p>Imhotep suddenly notices something. He reaches forward and--</p>
              <p>RIPS THE KEY/BOX OUT OF JONATHAN'S UPPER JACKET POCKET.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Hey that's mine--!</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Ardeth Bay holds Jonathan back. Imhotep pulls Evelyn away.<br>
                O'Connell can't take it anymore, he tries to break free of<br>
                Ardeth Bay's grip.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Evelyn!</p>
              <p>The huge, powerful man holds him tight.</p>
              <p> ARDETH BAY</p>
              <p> Be calm. There is still time.<br>
                we can stop him yet.</p>
              <p>The crowd parts for Imhotep and Evelyn. And then Imhotep<br>
                stops and looks back at O'Connell.</p>
              <p> IMHOTEP</p>
              <p> Pared oos.</p>
              <p>Evelyn SCREAMS.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> NOOO!!</p>
              <p>Beni smiles.</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> Kill them.</p>
              <p>Imhotep pulls her away. O'Connell breaks free of Ardeth Bay's<br>
                grip and stumbles forward.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> EVELYN!</p>
              <p>But the rabid vultures are already moving in for the kill.<br>
                O'Connell quickly bends down, pulls open a CISTERN/MANHOLE<br>
                COVER and shoves Jonathan down inside it, then jumps in after<br>
                him. The Curator pushes Ardeth Bay towards the cistern hole.</p>
              <p> CURATOR</p>
              <p> Go! Find a way! Kill the creature!</p>
              <p>The Curator turns and throws himself at the mob as Ardeth Bay<br>
                crawls down into the hole. The mob tears the Curator apart.</p>

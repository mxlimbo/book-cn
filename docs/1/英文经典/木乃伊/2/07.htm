                EXT. CAMP - LATER THAT NIGHT</p>
              <p>Having just freshened up for bed, Evelyn exits the temple and<br>
                steps past the sleeping Diggers. She spots the Egyptologist,<br>
                his jeweled canopic jar snug under one arm, the Book Of The<br>
                Dead laying loose under the other. Evelyn stares at the Book,<br>
                nervously biting her lip, then she sneaks over, carefully<br>
                steals it, and quickly tip-toes away.</p>
              <p>Lying on some blankets by the campfire, O'Connell rolls over<br>
                and sees Evelyn, sitting wide-eyed, staring at the Book.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> You sure you outta be playin,<br>
                around with that?</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> It's just a book, no harm ever<br>
                came from a book.</p>
              <p>Evelyn opens the cover. THE FIRE FLICKERS. She and O'Connell<br>
                share a nervous look, then Evelyn shrugs and starts reading.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Ahm kum Ra. Ahm kum Dei.</p>
              <p>Evelyn continues READING THE BOOK ALOUD IN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN.</p>
              <p>INT. IMHOTEPIS CHAMBER - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Evelyn's VOICE is OVERLAID as WE START WIDE on Imhotep's<br>
                chamber and SLOWLY PUSH IN on his sarcophagus. WE PUSH IN<br>
                over the lip of the coffin, then closer and closer towards<br>
                Imhotep's rotten, twisted head, until his putrid face fills<br>
                FRAME, --and then suddenly his crusty eyelids Pop OPEN!<br>
                Revealing EMPTY SOCKETS. --BIG SCARY MUSIC STING.</p>
              <p>EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT</p>
              <p>The Egyptologist sits bolt upright. Quickly looks around,<br>
                sees Evelyn reading the Book. He gets up and runs for her.</p>
              <p> EGYTOLOGIST</p>
              <p> NO! NOOOO! YOU MUST NOT!</p>
              <p>He skids to a stop as a strange, piercing WHINE is heard,<br>
                coming from out in the desert. O'Connell and the others all<br>
                leap to their feet. The Americans run out of their tents.</p>
              <p>The SOUND gets LOUDER and CLOSER. And then from out of the<br>
                darkness a HUGE WALL OF LOCUSTS SWIRLS into camp and envelops<br>
                everyone. O'Connell grabs Evelyn, and with Jonathan at their<br>
                side they race for the crevice, trying to fend off the horrid<br>
                vermin as they go. Beni and the Americans run for the temple.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>The Egyptologist is covered in locusts. He stares at The Book<br>
                Of The Dead, looking haunted.</p>
              <p> EGYPTOLOGIST</p>
              <p> What have we done?</p>
              <p>The campfire is SUCKED UP INTO THE AIR</p>
              <p>INT. LABYRINTH CORRIDOR - NIGHT</p>
              <p>O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race down the labyrinth,<br>
                slapping at themselves and picking locusts out of their hair</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Did you see that!? Grasshoppers!</p>
              <p>Billions of grasshoppers!</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> That's one of the plagues, right?<br>
                The grasshopper plague!</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> This is not a plague. It's<br>
                generational. Every so many<br>
                years the locusts of Egypt<br>
                have a population explosion<br>
                and they all take flight.</p>
              <p>Evelyn steps forward, something SQUISHES. O'Connell lowers<br>
                his TORCH, --the entire floor is FILLED WITH SLIMY FROGS.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Okay, ....and what about frogs?</p>
              <p>INT. LABYRINTH PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT</p>
              <p>The Americans, Beni and the Diggers race into a passageway.<br>
                Burns is knocked down, his bifocals skitter across the<br>
                ground, they get CRUSHED in the stampede. Burns staggers to<br>
                his feet, squinting. BLURRY FIGURES vanish into the darkness,</p>
              <p> BURNS</p>
              <p> Daniels! Henderson!</p>
              <p>INT. LABYRINTH CORRIDOR - NIGHT</p>
              <p>The ground under O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan starts to<br>
                SHAKE. Then suddenly, right in front of them, --HUNDREDS OF<br>
                CHITTERING SCARAB-BEETLES BOIL UP OUT OF THE SAND. Start<br>
                scurrying towards them. Evelyn SCREAMS. Jonathan SCREAMS.<br>
                Even O'Connell almost screams. They turn around and haul-ass.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Burns staggers down a passageway, squinting, his hands out in<br>
                front of him, groping, trying not to bump into anything. Then<br>
                ten feet in front of him, a dark, blurry FIGURE steps out.</p>
              <p> BURNS</p>
              <p> Daniels? .... is that you?</p>
              <p>Burns half-blindly staggers forward. The Figure doesn't move.</p>
              <p> BURNS</p>
              <p> Henderson?</p>
              <p>Burns TRIPS, stumbles forward, towards the Figure, his hands<br>
                reach out and SINK INTO IMHOTEPIS PUTRID CHEST CAVITY. Burns<br>
                jumps like a scalded cat, pulls his hands out and looks at<br>
                them, --HIS HANDS ARE COVERED IN MOLTEN FLESH ROT. He starts<br>
                to SCREAM. A SKELETAL HAND clamps over his mouth.</p>
              <p>LABYRINTH STAIRCASE - NIGHT</p>
              <p>O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race up the staircase,<br>
                just ahead of the mass of SCURRYING, CHITTERING SCARABS.</p>
              <p>O'Connell leaps out onto a pedestal. Jonathan jumps up next<br>
                to him. Evelyn jumps up into a grotto on the other side of<br>
                the narrow stairway. The horrible herd of vicious scarabs<br>
                scurries between them, their ear-piercing CRITTERS send<br>
                shivers up Evelyn's spine. She leans back. THE WALL MOVES.<br>
                Evelyn falls backwards through an opening. O'Connell and<br>
                Jonathan watch the scarabs vanish up the staircase. Then<br>
                they look across the way. Evelyn is gone.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> EVY!?</p>
              <p>SCARAB CHAMBER - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Evelyn sits up, shakes the sand out of her hair, fearfully<br>
                looks around. It's almost PITCH BLACK. She gets up and feels<br>
                her way along the dark walls. She rounds a corner. A shaft of<br>
                MOONLIGHT filters in through a crack in the ceiling. A MAN<br>
                stands in the middle of the room. Evelyn walks towards him.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Oh thank goodness, you're one<br>
                of the Americans, aren't you?</p>
              <p>Just as she reaches him he turns around. It's Burns. BOTH OF<br>
                HIS EYES ARE MISSING. He stares at her with vacant sockets.<br>
                Evelyn SCREAMS in horror and backs away, hyperventilating,<br>
                she bumps into something. She SCREAMS again and spins around<br>
                It's Imhotep. With two fresh EYEBALLS in his sockets.</p>
              <p><br>
                Evelyn SCREAMS again and backs away into a wall. Her hair is<br>
                down, her face is dirty and sweaty, her blouse is ripped, her<br>
                dress is torn, she's never looked sexier. Imhotep SQUINTS.</p>
              <p> IMHOTEP</p>
              <p> Anck-su-namun?</p>
              <p>LABYRINTH STAIRCASE - NIGHT</p>
              <p>O'Connell is feeling his way around inside the grotto</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Damn-it! Must be a trap door<br>
                around here or somethin'.</p>
              <p>And then they heat MEN SCREAMING, and suddenly, Henderson,<br>
                Daniels and one of the Diggers come running down the stairs.</p>
              <p> HENDERSON</p>
              <p> RUN, YOU SONS-A-BITCHES! RUUUUN!</p>
              <p>O'Connell and Jonathan join them as they hear the herd of<br>
                CHITTERING scarabs coming their way. The Digger suddenly<br>
                trips and falls. O'Connell slows down, about to go back and<br>
                help him. But it's too late. The Digger SCREAMS in horror as<br>
                the herd of scarabs run over him, eating straight through<br>
                him, leaving behind the Digger's half eaten skeleton. Daniels<br>
                Henderson and Jonathan react in horror. O'Connell's already<br>
                running, races right past them. The others turn and haul-ass.</p>
              <p>SCARAB CHAMBER - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Imhotep steps forward, --the sand around him seems to<br>
                MAGNETIZE, swirling and dancing around his flaking skeletal<br>
                legs. Evelyn starts backing away, horrified, looks at Burns</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Help me, ...please, ...help me.</p>
              <p>Burns opens his mouth, but can only GURGLE and MOAN because<br>
                HIS TONGUE IS MISSING. Imhotep grabs him, throws him to the<br>
                ground and sets his skeletal foot on Burns' chest, like a big<br>
                game hunter standing on his kill. Imhotep then parts his<br>
                fetid lips, --A FRESH TONGUE FLAPS BETWEEN HIS ROTTED TEETH.</p>
              <p> IMHOTEP</p>
              <p> Kadeesh pharos Anck-su-namun!</p>
              <p>Evelyn shivers in fear. Suddenly, O'Connell comes flying<br>
                around the corner and runs right up to her.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Would you quit playin, around!<br>
                Let's get outta here already!</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>O'Connell sees the look in her eyes and turns around, --at<br>
                the sight of Imhotep, O'Connell jumps back in fright.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> WHOA!</p>
              <p>O'Connell and Evelyn start backing away down the wall.<br>
                Imhotep glides sideways with them, like a tiger cornering his<br>
                prey, the sand around him SWIRLS and DANCES. Burns starts to<br>
                crawl away, whimpering as he goes. Imhotep suddenly stops and<br>
                UNHINGES his skeletal jaw, his skinless mouth stretches to an<br>
                inhuman size, and he lets out a horrific, primordial SHRIEK.</p>
              <p> IMHOTEP</p>
              <p> ANCK-SU-NAMUUUUUN!!!!</p>
              <p>Evelyn SCREAMS. O'Connell shudders, then, embarrassed by his<br>
                fear, he opens his own mouth and ROARS right back at him--</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Ahhhhhhhh!!</p>
              <p>Then BLASTS him with the elephant gun, --BLAM! Through the<br>
                SMOKE AND FLAMMAGE we see Imhotep blown off his feet, his<br>
                ribcage half torn away. O'Connell grabs Evelyn and runs.</p>
              <p>EXT. CREVICE - NIGHT</p>
              <p>SAND and WIND whip through the ruins as O'Connell and Evelyn<br>
                stumble up out of the crevice and COME FACE-TO-FACE WITH TEN<br>
                ARMED MUMIA. The Mumia quickly raise their guns. O'Connell<br>
                and Evelyn quickly raise their hands. Jonathan, Henderson,<br>
                Daniels and the Egyptologist are already on their knees,<br>
                hands over their heads. Ardeth Bay steps forward.</p>
              <p> ARDETH BAY</p>
              <p> I told you to leave or die, you<br>
                refused, and now you may have killed<br>
                us all. For you have unleashed the<br>
                creature that we have feared for<br>
                more than four thousand years.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Relax, I got him.</p>
              <p> ARDETH BAY</p>
              <p> No mortal weapons can kill this<br>
                creature. He is not of this world.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Are we talkin, about the same<br>
                creature? The walking corpse?<br>
                Really big mouth? Really bad breath?</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Beni sloway backs up around Anubis, eyes wide, gun up. He<br>
                turns around, --IMHOTEP IS RIGHT THERE! Beni SCREAMS, backs<br>
                away and OPENS FIRE. Six GUNSHOTS perforate Imhotep, but have<br>
                no effect except to SPLATTER molten flesh rot onto the back<br>
                wall. Beni retreats into a corner, scared shitless. Imhotep<br>
                moves forward, his one hand trying to stop the molten mummy<br>
                guts from oozing out of the large shotgun hole in his side.<br>
                Beni drops his gun and grabs at the CHAINS around his neck,<br>
                'RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS AND ICONS dangle from each chain. Beni<br>
                holds the first one up: A CHRISTIAN CRUCIFIX. He quickly<br>
                makes the sign of-the cross and blesses himself in English:</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> May the good Lord protect and watch<br>
                over me as a shepherd watches over<br>
                his flock. And may Satan in all his<br>
                forms be vanquished forever.</p>
              <p>It has no effect on Imhotep, who continues forward. Beni<br>
                quickly grabs at the other symbols and icons, holding them<br>
                out towards Imhotep, one after the other, trying to slow his<br>
                progress: an Islamic Sword and Crescent Moon necklace; a<br>
                Hindu Brahma medallion; a small Buddhist Bodhisattva statue.<br>
                All while blessing himself in Arabic, Hindi, Chinese and<br>
                Latin. Nothing works. Imhotep's skeletal hand reaches for<br>
                Beni's throat. Tears run down Beni's cheeks he's so freaked.<br>
                And that's when he holds up THE STAR OF DAVID and blesses<br>
                himself in HEBREW. Imhotep stops in his tracks. His hand<br>
                lowers. His grotesque new eyeballs stare at Beni.</p>
              <p> IMHOTEP (subtitled)<br>
                <br>
                The language of the slaves.<br>
                <br>
                Looks at him quizzically. Imhotep takes a step back.</p>
              <p> IMHOTEP (in Hebrew - subtitled)</p>
              <p> I may have use for you. And<br>
                the rewards will be great.</p>
              <p>Imhotep reaches into his tattered robe, and then holds out<br>
                his fetid hand, filled with squirming MAGGOTS. Beni cringes,<br>
                about to throw up, but then the maggots part, --revealing a<br>
                tiny pile of little JEWELS. Beni's eyes widen. Imhotep raises<br>
                his other hand, it holds Anck-su-namun's BROKEN CANOPIC JAR.</p>
              <p> IMHOTEP (subtitled)</p>
              <p> Where are the other sacred jars?</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>EXT . CREVICE - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Several Mumia drag Burns up, he stares out with vacant<br>
                sockets. Daniels and Henderson are especially horrified.</p>
              <p> DANIELS</p>
              <p> You bastards!</p>
              <p> HENDERSON</p>
              <p> What did you do to him!?</p>
              <p> ARDETH BAY</p>
              <p> We saved him! Saved him before<br>
                the creature could finish his work<br>
                Now leave, all of you, quickly,<br>
                before he finishes you all.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> You're not going to kill us?</p>
              <p>Evelyn ELBOWS Jonathan in the ribs.</p>
              <p> ARDETH BAY</p>
              <p> We must now hunt him down, and<br>
                try and find a way to kill him,<br>
                before he consumes the earth.<br>
                Allah be with us.</p>
              <p>Ardeth Bay and the Mumia start heading down into the crevice.<br>
                O'Connell yells at them, trying to convince himself-</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> I told ya, I already got him!</p>
              <p>Ardeth Bay stops and looks back, deadly serious.</p>
              <p> ARDETH BAY</p>
              <p> Know this, the creature will be<br>
                coming for you. He must consummate<br>
                the curse. And until he does, he<br>
                will never eat, he will never sleep,<br>
                and he will never stop.</p>
              <p>Ardeth Bay turns and jumps down into the crevice,</p>

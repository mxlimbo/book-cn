                INT. SCARAB CHAMBER - DAY</p>
              <p>The Warden crawls into a DARK CHAMBER and LIGHTS A TORCH.<br>
                A mural wall comes alive. Embedded into it are dozens of<br>
                black amethyst SCARABS; glittering images of the sacred<br>
                beetles. Awestruck, the Warden pulls out a pocket knife and<br>
                starts prying away at one of the precious bugs.</p>
              <p>INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY</p>
              <p>Beni and the Americans hover around the Egyptologist, who's<br>
                found the SECRET COMPARTMENT inside Anubis. The Egyptologist<br>
                brushes sand away from the seam . Henderson steps forward and<br>
                grabs the seam, --the Egyptologist quickly stops him.</p>
              <p> EGYPTOLOGIST</p>
              <p> Seti was no fool.</p>
              <p>Henderson sees the intense look in the Egyptologist's eyes</p>
              <p> HENDERSON</p>
              <p> Yeah, sure....</p>
              <p>He looks back at the native Diggers.</p>
              <p> HENDERSON</p>
              <p> We'll let him open it.</p>
              <p>The Egyptologist nods, then YELLS IN EGYPTIAN at the Diggers.<br>
                The Diggers hesitate, filled with fear. Daniels pulls out his 
                gun,<br>
                aims it at three of the Diggers. The three Diggers hesitantly 
                step<br>
                forward with crowbars and stick them into the seams. The other<br>
                Diggers back away, scared shitless. Beni and the Americans<br>
                exchange looks, and then they back away as well.</p>
              <p>INT. IMHOTEPIS CHAMBER - DAY</p>
              <p>Three Heroes are still digging into the ceiling</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Lemme get this straight, they<br>
                stuck a sharp, red hot poker up<br>
                your nose, cut your brain into<br>
                small pieces, then ripped it<br>
                all out through your nostrils?</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> OWCH! That's really got to hurt.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> It's called mummification.<br>
                You're dead when they do this</p>
              <p><br>
                JONATHAN</p>
              <p> still....</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> You two are worse than a couple<br>
                of schoolboys.</p>
              <p>And that's when a huge chunk of the roof suddenly GIVES OUT.<br>
                O'Connell GRABS Evelyn and JERKS her clear. Jonathan DIVES<br>
                for the far wall. A MASSIVE STONE CASEMENT DROPS OUT OF THE<br>
                CEILING AND CRASHES to the floor. DUST FLIES. Fills the room.</p>
              <p>INT. ANLIBIS CHAMBER -</p>
              <p>Having heard the crash, Beni and the Americans have their<br>
                guns pointed at the floor. The Egyptologist could care less,<br>
                he looks at the Diggers, gripping their crowbars, and YELLS--</p>
              <p> EGYPTOLOGIST</p>
              <p> FENI!</p>
              <p>The three Diggers PULL HARD. The ancient seams start to give,<br>
                The Egyptologist YELLS again. The Diggers PULL HARDER. The<br>
                compartment starts to loosen. Again he YELLS. The Diggers<br>
                give one final pull and--</p>
              <p>--AN INTENSE BURST OF LIQUID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM. HITS THE<br>
                THREE DIGGERS. MELTS THEIR SKIN CLEAN OFF. They SCREAM. Dying<br>
                horribly. HALF SKELETAL by the time they hit the ground ......</p>
              <p>INT. IMHOTEPIS CHAMBER - DAY</p>
              <p>The dust is starting to clear. O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan<br>
                slowly get up and step over to the massive stone casement.<br>
                We immediately recognize it as IMHOTEPIS SARCOPHAGUS.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Oh my god, ...it looks like,<br>
                it looks like a sarcophagus.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Why would they bury somebody<br>
                in the ceiling?</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> They didn't, they buried him<br>
                at the foot of Anubis. He was<br>
                either someone of great importance.<br>
                or he did something very naughty.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>INT. SCARAB CHAMBER - DAY</p>
              <p>The warden drops an amethyst-scarab into his pouch, then<br>
                greedily-starts prying away at another. It rips off, he drops<br>
                it into his pouch, --only he misses, and this scarab quietly<br>
                falls to the sandy floor without the Warden noticing.</p>
              <p>CLOSE ON: the scarab on the floor. It begins to TRANSFORM.<br>
                The amethyst starts to glow. Something inside starts to<br>
                WIGGLE; as if the amethyst were some sort of strange cocoon.<br>
                Then it splits open and a real live hideous SCARAB--BEETLE<br>
                scurries out. It races over to the warden's shoe, quickly<br>
                burrows into the leather and vanishes inside.</p>
              <p>The Warden's eyes FLY OPEN. He starts to SCREAM, drops his<br>
                knife and frantically starts clawing away at his pant leg,<br>
                higher and higher until he rips open his shirt revealing a</p>
              <p>large, hideous LUMP, BURROWING UNDER HIS SKIN. IT BURROWS<br>
                IT'S WAY UP HIS FAT BELLY AND ACROSS HIS HAIRY CHEST. The<br>
                Warden claws and scratches at it, trying to stop it. The lump<br>
                BURROWS UP HIS NECK. The Warden starts GAGGING and COUGHING.<br>
                And then the scarab-lump VANISHES INTO HIS HEAD.</p>
              <p>INT. IMHOTEPIS CHAMBER - DAY</p>
              <p>Our Heroes clear the dirt off the top of the sarcophagus,<br>
                revealing a single, ominous hieroglyph. Evelyn stares at it<br>
                Jonathan impatiently strums his fingers across the lid.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Well? .... Who is it?</p>
              <p>Evelyn stares at the hieroglyph, confused and concerned.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> 'He that shall not be named.</p>
              <p>O'Connell dusts off the huge LOCK</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> There's some sort of lock here.<br>
                You say these thing's are made<br>
                of granite with a steel interior?</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Whoever's in here, sure wasn't<br>
                getting out.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> No kiddin', without a key, it'll<br>
                take us a month to crack this thing,</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> A key! That's it! That's what he<br>
                was talking about.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Who was talking about what?</p>
              <p>Evelyn starts rummaging through the pack on Jonathan's back.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> The man on the barge. The one<br>
                with the hook, he was looking<br>
                for a key.</p>
              <p>Evelyn pulls out the key/box. Jonathan tries to take it back,</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Hey that's mine!</p>
              <p>Evelyn slaps his hand and quickly unfolds the box, --it's now<br>
                shaped exactly like the LOCK'S KEYHOLE. Evelyn smiles. And<br>
                that's when they hear the Warden's SCREAMS echoing through<br>
                the labyrinth. All three of them turn and take-off running.</p>
              <p>INT. LABYRINTH - DAY</p>
              <p>The Warden is SCREAMING and dancing insanely around the<br>
                labyrinth, totally freaked from the extreme pain in his head.<br>
                O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan run up just as the Warden<br>
                starts RIPPING his own hair out of his head. O'Connell and<br>
                Jonathan grab at the Warden's hands, but he's far too crazed,<br>
                he shoves them aside, runs full bore down the length of the<br>
                labyrinth and SLAMS his head straight into a rock wall. The<br>
                Warden drops to the ground. Dead as lead. Eyes wide open.<br>
                O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan just stand there staring,<br>
                breathing hard, wide-eyed themselves ..............</p>
              <p>EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Evelyn and Jonathan are nuzzled up to a campfire.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> What do you suppose killed him?</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Did you ever see him eat?</p>
              <p>O'Connell comes up over some rocks.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Seems the Americans had a little<br>
                misadventure of their own today,<br>
                three of their diggers were killed.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> How?</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid.<br>
                Some sort of ancient booby-trap.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Maybe this place really is cursed</p>
              <p>A GUST OF WIND blows through the camp. The campfire FLICKERS<br>
                O'Connell and Jonathan share a nervous look. Evelyn laughs.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> two!</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> don't believe in curses, huh?</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> No. I believe if I can see it<br>
                and I can touch it, then it's<br>
                real. That's what I believe.</p>
              <p>O'Connell cocks his rifle, KA-CHANK! Gives her a big grin.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> I believe in being prepared.</p>
              <p>Jonathan opens the Warden's POUCH, the one that held the<br>
                scarabs. He reaches in, starts scrounging around. WE SLOWLY<br>
                PUSH IN. Waiting for the attack. THE MUSIC BUILDS. And then,<br>
                --Jonathan SCREAMS in pain and RIPS his hand back out of the<br>
                pouch. O'Connell and Evelyn both jump.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL/EVELYN</p>
              <p> WHAT?! WHAT IS IT?!</p>
              <p>Jonathan sucks his finger, then reaches back into the pouch<br>
                and pulls out a LIQUOR BOTTLE, the top has been chipped off.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Seagrams!</p>
              <p>Jonathan smiles at the bottle, then turns the pouch inside-<br>
                out and shakes it, nothing but SAND is inside it.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Well, he may have been a stinky<br>
                fellow,....but he had good taste</p>
              <p>Jonathan takes a swig. O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, guiltily</p>
              <p>And then O'Connell suddenly kneels down and sticks his ear to<br>
                the sand. Evelyn and Jonathan watch him. A BEAT. And then a<br>
                BARAGE OF GUNFIRE IS HEARD coming from the American camp.<br>
                O'Connell jumps up and throws the elephant gun to Evelyn.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Stay here!</p>
              <p>He takes off running through the ruins. Evelyn immediately<br>
                gets up and runs after him. Jonathan grabs a gun, holds the<br>
                bottle of Seagrams; tight and dashes after her.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Evy! Excuse me! But didn't<br>
                the man just say--!</p>
              <p>EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - NIGHT</p>
              <p>The American camp is under siege. Two dozen MUMIA RIDERS<br>
                gallop through. FIRING RIFLES. Several Diggers are killed as<br>
                they run. The Americans leap out of their tents FIRING. Kill<br>
                multiple Riders. Daniels is shot, spins and falls, keeps<br>
                SHOOTING. Henderson and Burns run to his aid, BLASTING AWAY.<br>
                O'Connell races through the ruins and SLAMS right into Beni,<br>
                who is obviously trying to high-tail-it out of there.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Goin' somewhere?</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> Just looking for you, O'Connell!<br>
                I wanted to be with my friend!</p>
              <p>O'Connell drags him back towards the American camp.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> C'mon, friend.</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> (struggling)<br>
                Why do you like to fight so much?</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> 'Cause I look good doin, it.</p>
              <p>Ardeth Bay gallops through the camp, cutting Diggers down<br>
                with his scimitar. O'Connell runs up on top of some rocks,<br>
                LEAPS OUT and TACKLES him off his horse. The two men SLAM to<br>
                the ground. O'Connell spins up onto one knee and FIRES, point<br>
                blank. Blows the scimitar out of Ardeth Bay's hand. O'Connell<br>
                is about to shoot again when a horse rides up between them.</p>
              <p><br>
                A scimitar swoops down, almost takes O'Connell's head off,<br>
                misses him by an inch. O'Connell leaps up and blows the Rider<br>
                off his mount. The horse BOLTS. --But Ardeth Bay is gone.</p>
              <p>Evelyn hides behind some rocks, watching the scene, suddenly,<br>
                she hears something coming up behind her and spins around.</p>
              <p>A vicious tattooed Mumia Rider races at her. Evelyn quickly<br>
                backpedals over the rocks, terrified. The Mumia Rider raises<br>
                his scimitar, about to strike. Evelyn SCREAMS, trips over a<br>
                rock and FIRES the elephant gun, --BLAM! Blows the Rider off<br>
                his mount and CATAPULTS him twenty feet back into some ruins.</p>
              <p>At the same time, the kick blows Evelyn off her feet and over<br>
                a ridge. She FLAILS through the air and lands in a sand dune.</p>
              <p>Jonathan and some - Diggers are holding their own near the<br>
                temple door. Four Riders come CHARGING right at them.<br>
                Jonathan takes a swig off the Seagrams.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Let 'em have it, boys!</p>
              <p>Jonathan and the Diggers OPEN FIRE. When the smoke clears,<br>
                the Riders are either dead or gone. Jonathan grins.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> I say, bloody good show.</p>
              <p>And then several more Mumia leap off the temple and land<br>
                behind them. Jonathan and the remaining Diggers spin around<br>
                and suddenly find themselves in hand-to-hand combat.<br>
                O'Connell is quickly loading his pistol. He hears something<br>
                THUNDERING UP behind him. He spins around just as Ardeth Bay<br>
                on a horse swings his scimitar. O'Connell instinctively<br>
                raises his hands to protect his face, the scimitar STRIKES!<br>
                Hits his gun, --CHING! O'Connell's gun flips away. Disarmed,<br>
                O'Connell dives and rolls and suddenly comes up with a stick<br>
                of dynamite in his hand. He shoves the fuse into a fire. It<br>
                IGNITES. He faces Ardeth Bay, towering above him. The two men<br>
                lock eyes. The fuse continues to burn down. Ardeth Bay points<br>
                his scimitar at O'Connell's head.</p>
              <p> ARDETH BAY</p>
              <p> LEAVE THIS PLACE! .... LEAVE THIS<br>
                PLACE OR DIE!</p>
              <p>Ardeth Bay GALLOPS OFF. The remaining Mumia Riders race after<br>
                him, vanishing into the night. O'Connell watches them leave,<br>
                then turns to the burning fuse, ....and blows it out. Evelyn<br>
                staggers up, looking very shaken. O'Connell gently takes her<br>
                and holds her close.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> You alright?</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Evelyn looks up into his strong eyes. It's the first time<br>
                he's shown genuine concern for her. And she likes it. He's<br>
                also holding her a little too close. And she likes that too.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Yes, ...fine, ...thank you.</p>
              <p>Beni crawls out from under some pillars as Henderson and<br>
                Burns help Daniels to his feet.</p>
              <p> DANIELS</p>
              <p> See! That proves it! Old Seti's<br>
                fortune's gotta be under this sand!</p>
              <p> HENDERSON</p>
              <p> For them to protect it like this,<br>
                you just know there's got to be<br>
                treasure down there.</p>
              <p>O'Connell looks up into the surrounding ridges, unsatisfied.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> These men are a desert people<br>
                they value water, not gold.</p>
              <p>Evelyn looks at O'Connell, suddenly very worried.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Where's Jonathan?</p>

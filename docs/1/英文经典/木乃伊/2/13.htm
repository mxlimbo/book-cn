                INT. CEMETERY - DAY</p>
              <p>Imhotep READS from the Book. The rotten Priest-mummies rock<br>
                back and forth, CHANTING. Evelyn struggles.<br>
                Then suddenly, the strange MIST wafts up out of the swirling<br>
                hole and over to the sacred jars, it passes through them and<br>
                into Evelyn. Evelyn JERKS as though she's been electrified.<br>
                The MIST passes through her and into Anck-su-namun's body.</p>
              <p>The CHANTING PRIESTS, SWIRLING HOLE, WAFTING MIST and<br>
                IMHOTEPIS READINGS reach a crescendo. Anck-su-namun's crusty<br>
                EYELIDS suddenly POP OPEN. Evelyn stares at her in disbelief.</p>
              <p>Anck-su-namun's rotted head turns and looks at Evelyn with<br>
                empty sockets. Evelyn freaks out and struggles wildly, then<br>
                she notices Imhotep holding the ancient sacrificial knife.</p>
              <p> IMHOTEP (subtitled)</p>
              <p> with your death, my love and<br>
                I will be invincible!</p>
              <p>He raises it up over Evelyn's chest, about to plunge it down.<br>
                Evelyn's eyes widen in horror And that's when O'Connell<br>
                and Jonathan BURST IN. Imhotep spins around and faces them.</p>
              <p>Jonathan beams as he holds up the golden Book Of The Living.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> I found it, Evy! I found it</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Shut-up and get me off of here!</p>
              <p>O'Connell grabs an ancient sword out of a statue's hand,<br>
                jumps up onto a gravestone and leaps out over the Priests.<br>
                The Priest-mummies stop chanting. The MIST vanishes.<br>
                Imhotep steps forward. O'Connell STRIKES the sacrificial<br>
                knife out of his hand. Imhotep BELLOWS a command. The Priests<br>
                stand up, swords and knives in hand, they ATTACK O'Connell.</p>
              <p>EVERYTHING HAPPENS AT ONCE, READ FASTER:</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Open the book, Jonathan! Open<br>
                the book! That's the only way<br>
                to kill him!</p>
              <p>O'Connell RACKS and CHOPS at the attacking Priest-mummies,<br>
                fighting his way to Evelyn. The skeletal creatures wildly<br>
                SWING their swords, trying to STAB O'Connell. Jonathan<br>
                fumbles with the book, struggling to open it, --he can't.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> I can't open it! It's locked<br>
                or something!</p>
              <p>O'Connell CUTS two of the mummies in half, then swings his<br>
                sword down at Evelyn, --CLANG! One chain breaks free.</p>
              <p>Jonathan spots a series of SOLID GOLD, FOUR-SIDED LOCKS<br>
                along the binder. It hits him like lightning--</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> We need the key!</p>
              <p>Imhotep grins, then grabs the KEY/BOX hanging from a chain<br>
                around his neck, rips it off and shoves it into his pocket</p>
              <p>He picks up the sacrificial sword and heads for Jonathan.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Read the inscription on the cover!</p>
              <p>O'Connell swings his sword down again, --CLANG! Evelyn now<br>
                has one hand and one leg free. More mummies attack O'Connell<br>
                force him back.</p>
              <p>Jonathan quickly starts translating the cover inscription,<br>
                but his ancient Egyptian is clearly awful.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> .Keetash-something, naraba-something.</p>
              <p>Jonathan starts to backpedal through the cemetery, clutching<br>
                the golden book; wide-eyed, as Imhotep moves in on him.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Ebarra im hatu Kashka ummmmm--?</p>
              <p>Jonathan trips and falls on his ass. Imhotep CHARGES FORWARD.<br>
                O'Connell SLASHES another chain. Only one more left holding<br>
                Evelyn. Jonathan sits up and quickly looks back at the cover.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Rasheem Aaaaa ANUBIS!</p>
              <p>Imhotep raises the sacrificial sword, about to kill Jonathan.<br>
                And that's when the giant statue of Anubis suddenly CRASHES<br>
                through the wall, --shades of Ray Harryhausen. only better.</p>
              <p>The god of Deaths, horrible, decrepit STONE FACE stares<br>
                angrily down. Jonathan stares back.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Oh boy</p>
              <p>O'Connell DECAPITATES a mummy and looks up at Anubis.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL (sarcastic)</p>
              <p> This just keeps gettin,<br>
                better and better.</p>
              <p>Imhotep leaves Jonathan and heads for the giant statue.<br>
                O'Connell leaps over and with one last swing of the sword,<br>
                frees Evelyn from her chains. More Priest-mummies attack,<br>
                forcing him away. Evelyn jumps off the altar and starts to<br>
                head for O'Connell, --a SKELETAL HAND grabs her! Spins her<br>
                around. It's Anck-su-namun's rotted corpse. Evelyn reacts.</p>
              <p><br>
                Imhotep looks up at Anubis, points to O'Connell, and in<br>
                ANCIENT EGYPTIAN commands him to attack. Anubis moves for<br>
                O'Connell, STOMPING over mausoleums and through the detritus<br>
                moat on his way. O'Connell quickly backs away.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> You have got to be joking?</p>
              <p>Evelyn is backing away from Anck-su-namun.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Finish the inscription, idiot!</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Oh.</p>
              <p>Anck-su-namun ATTACKS Evelyn. Evelyn fends her off as best<br>
                she can. Jonathan quickly looks back at the hieroglyphs on<br>
                the book cover, fumbling badly under the pressure-</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Ummm, Hootash im .... Hootash<br>
                im now what is this<br>
                last symbol here?</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> What's it look like!?</p>
              <p>Anck-su-namun grabs Evelyn by the throat. The statue of<br>
                Anubis corners O'Connell, reaches down and GRABS him with<br>
                it's MASSIVE TALONS. O'Connell HACKS away at it. Jonathan<br>
                stares at the inscription, slightly oblivious.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> It's an Anck symbol, with two<br>
                little squiggly lines above it,<br>
                and a bird, a stork! on either side,</p>
              <p>Evelyn is being STRANGLED by Anck-su-namun,</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> -Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Yes, ...I see.</p>
              <p>The talons lift O'Connell up and start to CRUSH him.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Hootash im Ahmenophus!</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>The giant statue of Anubis instantly freezes in it's tracks<br>
                and PETRIFIES. It's off balance. Starts to fall. O'Connell<br>
                slides free of it's talons. Evelyn SHOVES Anck-su-namun away,<br>
                Anck-su-namun looks up and opens her fetid mouth to scream<br>
                just as Anubis CRASHES DOWN on top of her, SMASHING HER to<br>
                powder and DRIVING her into the ground.</p>
              <p>Imhotep SHRIEKS in rage and horror, then turns and angrily<br>
                heads for Jonathan. Jonathan, sitting on his ass, quickly<br>
                backpedals on his hands and heels.</p>
              <p>O'Connell leaps to his feet, sword in hand and runs for<br>
                Imhotep. Imhotep grabs Jonathan, lifts him up, rips the<br>
                golden Book Of The Living out of his hand and pins him to a<br>
                wall.</p>
              <p>O'Connell runs up and swings his sword at Imhotep, --WAP!<br>
                SLICES Imhotep's 'right arm off. It drops to the ground, still<br>
                clutching The Book Of The Living. Imhotep drops Jonathan and<br>
                spins around, facing O'Connell. O'Connell grins.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Okay pal, let's see how tough<br>
                you are without your right arm.</p>
              <p>Imhotep grabs O'Connell with his left arm and THROWS him half<br>
                way across the cemetery. O'Connell SLAMS into a gravestone,<br>
                bounces off and crashes to the ground. He shakes it off.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Alright, ...so he's left handed</p>
              <p>Imhotep is already striding towards him. Jonathan lifts up<br>
                his hand, --HE HAS THE KEY/BOX BACK! He smiles at Evelyn.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> I got it!</p>
              <p>Evelyn runs for Jonathan.</p>
              <p>O'Connell SWINGS his sword and CLEAVES a big chunk of molten<br>
                flesh rot out of Imhotep's stomach. on the outside, Imhotep<br>
                looks human, but on the inside he is still a rotten old mummy.<br>
                Imhotep BACKHANDS O'Connell. Knocks him twenty feet back.<br>
                O'Connell staggers to his feet. Imhotep is right there. CLUBS<br>
                him hard with his left arm. O'Connell spins through the air,<br>
                SLAMS into the side of a mausoleum. Imhotep approaches, rage<br>
                in his eyes. O'Connell gets up, quickly pivots and HACKS into<br>
                Imhotep's head. Imhotep grins and PUNCHES O'Connell in the<br>
                face. O'Connell is thrown back, pulling his sword with him.<br>
                He bounces hard off the mausoleum. Lands on his feet.<br>
                Totally beat-to-shit. Knees buckling. He can barely stand.</p>
              <p>Jonathan lifts up the heavy gold book, --Imhotep's severed<br>
                hand still clings to it. Jonathan cringes in disgust. Evelyn<br>
                yanks it off, throws it away, then start furiously working<br>
                the key into the series of locks, unlocking each of them.</p>
              <p>Imhotep strides forward. O'Connell backs into the mausoleum,<br>
                swings the sword, Imhotep tries to catch it, --it CLEAVES<br>
                through his palm and deeply imbeds itself into his forearm.</p>
              <p>No matter, Imhotep rips the sword away from O'Connell and<br>
                casually flings it away.</p>
              <p>The golden Book Of The Living opens with a HISS. Jonathan<br>
                holds it tight as Evelyn quickly turns the heavy gold pages<br>
                Looking for something.</p>
              <p>O'Connell turns to run, but Imhotep grabs him by the throat<br>
                and lifts him off his feet. O'Connell hangs there, a dazed<br>
                mess. Imhotep grins, says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN, then<br>
                starts to strangle O'Connell. O'Connell chokes. About to die.</p>
              <p>Evelyn turns and faces Imhotep and reads an inscription:</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Kadeesh mal! Kadeesh mal!<br>
                Pared oos! PARED OOS!!</p>
              <p>Imhotep pivots and looks at Evelyn, a look of sheer terror<br>
                on his face. Then he looks over at the detritus bog. Which<br>
                starts to BUBBLE and SHIFT. The SWIRLING HOLE begins to open.</p>
              <p>And then suddenly THE SPIRITS OF THE EGYPTIAN GODS waft out<br>
                of the black bog and SWIRL around the Priest-mummies. The<br>
                mummies all collapse and turn to dust. And then the spirits<br>
                attack Imhotep. Lifting him and O'Connell up into the air.</p>
              <p>Imhotep let's go of O'Connell, who falls to the ground.<br>
                Evelyn and Jonathan fearfully stumble away from the spirits,<br>
                Jonathan trips and falls and accidentally throws The Book of<br>
                The Living into the detritus bog. Evelyn watches as the<br>
                golden book sinks into the black putrescence. Jonathan looks<br>
                like he's about to cry.</p>
              <p>Ten feet off the ground, the spirits SWIRL around Imhotep's<br>
                body, TWISTING IT and TURNING IT and slowly SHRIVELING IT.</p>
              <p>Accompanied by the same strange FLASHING LIGHT we saw at the<br>
                beginning of the movie when Anck-su-namun was cursed. one<br>
                last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, and Imhotep<br>
                is spit out and thrown to the floor. He staggers to his feet,<br>
                he looks perfectly normal. His body is completely intact.</p>
              <p>O'Connell swings his sword. Imhotep jerks back. The sword<br>
                scrapes Imhotep's chest, --a swath of blood appears across<br>
                Imhotep's chest where the sword hit him. Imhotep touches the<br>
                blood on his chest, amazed and horrified. He's mortal.</p>
              <p>O'Connell runs Imhotep through with the sword and shoves him<br>
                backwards. Imhotep stumbles back and falls into the detritus<br>
                bog. The sword still in his stomach.<br>
                Evelyn and Jonathan run up next to O'Connell. They watch as<br>
                Imhotep gently sinks into the fetid swamp, slowly dying. And<br>
                then, just before his head goes under, Imhotep looks up at<br>
                them, grins broadly, and says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN.</p>
              <p>Evelyn translates:</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Death is only the beginning.</p>
              <p>Imhotep's grinning face vanishes under the black bile</p>
              <p>STAFF CHAMBER - DAY</p>
              <p>Beni staggers across a chamber, straining under the weight<br>
                of another saddlebag filled with treasure. He spots a large,<br>
                ornate STAFF sticking out of a wall. He throws the saddlebag<br>
                over the staff and collapses against the wall. Exhausted.</p>
              <p>A BEAT. And then the weight of the treasure PULLS THE STAFF<br>
                DOWN. Which starts a massive AURAL CHAIN-REACTION.</p>
              <p>Beni-backs away from the wall, wide-eyed, filled with fear.<br>
                ALL THE WALLS START TO SINK INTO THE GROUND. Driven by tons<br>
                of pouring sand. Beni turns and hauls-ass out of the chamber.</p>
              <p>CEMETERY - DAY</p>
              <p>O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan look around as all the walls<br>
                start to DESCEND. O'Connell grabs Evelyn's hand.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> C'mon!</p>
              <p>He pulls her forward and all three of them race past sinking<br>
                pillars. They duck as they run into a descending doorway.</p>
              <p>INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY</p>
              <p>Beni scampers down a passageway, the ceiling getting lower<br>
                and lower until he has to crouch. And then he has to stick<br>
                the TORCH between his teeth and crawl on his hands and knees</p>
              <p>INT. TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY</p>
              <p>O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch-run into the treasure<br>
                chamber. Evelyn skids to a stop. Looks in wonder at all the<br>
                treasure. SAND rains down on them. O'Connell grabs her again<br>
                and quickly pulls her through the mounds of treasure towards<br>
                a SINKING DOORWAY on the far side of the room. The SOUND of<br>
                the sinking walls is deafening.</p>
              <p>Beni crouch-runs into the treasure chamber. O'Connell, Evelyn<br>
                and Jonathan race past him. He joins them as they run up a<br>
                staircase. heading for a DESCENDING DOORWAY, which is already<br>
                half gone, it's now only four feet high -- now three feet<br>
                high -- now two feet. Jonathan dives through the narrow gap.<br>
                Then O'Connell dives through, he spins around. Evelyn dives,<br>
                but gets stuck in the middle, about to get cut in half.</p>
              <p>O'Connell grabs her arm and YANKS her through in the nick of<br>
                time. Beni reaches through the narrowing gap with his hand--</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL!!</p>
              <p>O'Connell grabs it, but it's too late. Beni yanks his hand<br>
                back just as the top of the door CRASHES to the floor.<br>
                Sealing him in. Beni quickly crawls back down the stairs as<br>
                the ceiling SLAMS down behind him. He stands up and looks<br>
                around with his diminishing torch.</p>
              <p>All the doorways FINISH CLOSING. There's no way out. He's<br>
                trapped. And then he hears something, and turns around. Over<br>
                in the corner, a scarab-beetle stares at him, CHITTERING.<br>
                Beni waves his flickering torch at the scarab and backs away.</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> Go away</p>
              <p>He stands in the middle of the treasure chamber as dozens<br>
                upon dozens of scarabs boil up out of the floor around him.</p>
              <p>Beni is absolutely terrified. The scarabs start to move in.<br>
                And that's when Beni's torch goes out. PITCH BLACK. A BEAT.</p>
              <p>And then we hear Beni start SCREAMING in horror and pain.<br>
                And the scarabs CHITTERING hungrily.</p>
              <p>EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY</p>
              <p>The temple COLLAPSES as O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and a<br>
                pack of stray camels race through the ruins. A SINKING<br>
                CREVICE DROPS OUT right behind them. Chasing them out through<br>
                the front gates. The whole place RUMBLES ominously.</p>
              <p>They make it down the ramp as more ruins CRASH DOWN behind<br>
                them. A MASSIVE CLOUD OF SAND AND DUST billows out over the<br>
                wall and into the air. our heroes and all the stray camels<br>
                race out into the desert ..........</p>
              <p>SLOW DISSOLVE TO:</p>
              <p>EXT. PLATEALT - DAY</p>
              <p>O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan stand in the middle of the<br>
                plateau, surrounded by stray camels. They stare off at the<br>
                sandy, dusty, volcano as it continues to RUMBLE-ominously.</p>
              <p><br>
                JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Well, ...I guess we go home<br>
                empty handed.</p>
              <p>O'Connell looks at Evelyn</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Wouldn't say that.</p>
              <p>Evelyn returns the look, A BEAT, and then she wraps-her<br>
                arms around his neck and kisses him. O'Connell ret urn s it.<br>
                Jonathan just rolls his eyes, snorts in disgust and climbs<br>
                up onto a camel.</p>
              <p>When the kiss is-over, O'Connell and Evelyn share a smile,<br>
                then O'Connell leaps up into the saddle, reaches down, grabs<br>
                Evelyn's hand and pulls her up behind him. Evelyn wraps her<br>
                arms around his waist. O'Connell and Jonathan slap the reins.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL/JONATHAN</p>
              <p> TUK-TUK-TUK!!</p>
              <p>The camels start to move out. WE PAN DOWN: to the saddlebag<br>
                behind Evelyn, hidden under the closed back flap, --we can<br>
                see that it's filled with Beni's stolen TREASURE.<br>
                O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan ride off into the SUNSET.</p>
              <p><br>
                THE END</p>

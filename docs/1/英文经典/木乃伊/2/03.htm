                EXT. GALLOWS COURTYARD - DAY</p>
              <p>Hundreds of filthy PRISONERS stare down onto the gallows as the 
                hangman's<br>
                noose is draped over O'Connell's head and cinched tight around 
                his neck.<br>
                Evelyn follows the warden onto a balcony above the gallows. The 
                prisoners<br>
                all go dead quiet at the sight of her; like jackals staring at 
                fresh meat.</p>
              <p> WARDEN</p>
              <p> No women allowed.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> I am an English woman.</p>
              <p>This seems to confuse the Warden, he shrugs and sits down.</p>
              <p>O'Connell looks up as Evelyn plops down beside the Warden</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> I will give you one hundred<br>
                pounds to spare his life.</p>
              <p> WARDEN</p>
              <p> I would pay one hundred pounds<br>
                just to see him hang.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Two hundred pounds.</p>
              <p> WARDEN</p>
              <p> Proceed!</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Three hundred pounds!</p>
              <p>O'Connell can hear every word, he looks hopeful. Other than<br>
                Evelyn, you could hear a pin drop. The HANGMAN turns to him</p>
              <p> HANGMAN</p>
              <p> Any last requests, pig?</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Yeah, I'd like ya to let me go</p>
              <p>The Hangman grabs the lever to the trapdoor.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS!</p>
              <p>The Warden sets his greasy, lecherous hand on Evelyn's leg.</p>
              <p> WARDEN</p>
              <p> And what else?</p>
              <p>Evelyn is revolted, she quickly shoves his hand away.</p>
              <p>-Insulted, the Warden angrily turns and gestures to the<br>
                Hangman, who pulls the lever. The trapdoor DROPS AWAY.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> NOOO!</p>
              <p><br>
                O'Connell DROPS through the hole. The rope pays-out. Then<br>
                JERKS TAUGHT. O'Connell's body SNAPS at the end of the rope.<br>
                But he's still alive, because--</p>
              <p> WARDEN</p>
              <p> His neck did not break! Good!</p>
              <p>Now we watch him strangle to death.</p>
              <p>The prisoners go ape-shit, SCREAMING and SHOUTING in anger.<br>
                The GUARDS look around, nervous. O'Connell struggles at the<br>
                end of the rope, gagging. Evelyn is horrified, she quickly<br>
                turns to the warden, leans forward and whispers in his ear.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> He knows the location to Hamunaptra.</p>
              <p>The warden spins around and faces her</p>
              <p> WARDEN</p>
              <p> You lie.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> I would never!</p>
              <p>At the end of the rope, O'Connell is choking and gagging and<br>
                turning several shades of red. The Warden stares at Evelyn.</p>
              <p> WARDEN</p>
              <p> Are you saying this filthy godless<br>
                son of a pig knows where to find<br>
                The City Of The Dead? Truly?</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Yes and if you cut him down,<br>
                we will give you ten percent.</p>
              <p> WARDEN</p>
              <p> Fifty percent.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Twenty.</p>
              <p> WARDEN</p>
              <p> Forty.</p>
              <p>Evelyn hesitates, bites her lip. O'Connell's eyes bulge as he<br>
                looks up at her, he can't believe this girl.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Give .... give him .... give him GLAAAA--!</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Twenty-five percent, and not<br>
                one single farthing more.</p>
              <p><br>
                The warden flashes a big green smile, then YELLS in Arabic</p>
              <p>A scimitar SLASHES the air. The rope is CUT. O'Connell<br>
                CRASHES to the ground. Half dead. Rolls over. GAGGING.</p>
              <p>All of the prisoners BURST INTO CHEERS. O'Connell looks<br>
                up at Evelyn. She smiles broadly and waves down at him.</p>
              <p>CURATOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT</p>
              <p>CANDLE LIGHT FLICKERS across the Curator's face.</p>
              <p> CURATOR</p>
              <p> She must die</p>
              <p>Standing in the shadows across from his desk are THREE MUMIA:<br>
                blue tinted skin, hideous facial tattoos, --the works. One of<br>
                the Mumia has a rusty metal HOOK for a hand. He shrugs.</p>
              <p> HOOK</p>
              <p> She is like all the others.<br>
                She will die in the desert.</p>
              <p> CURATOR</p>
              <p> No! She has seen too much. She<br>
                knows too much.</p>
              <p>The Curator leans across his desk, fear in his eyes.</p>
              <p> CURATOR</p>
              <p> Not only does she have a map,<br>
                but she has the key.</p>
              <p>Spooks the hell out of the Mumia guys.</p>
              <p> HOOK</p>
              <p> The key!? She has the lost key!?</p>
              <p> CURATOR</p>
              <p> Yes. No one has ever had so much,<br>
                been so close. We must stop her,<br>
                or it will be the end of us all.</p>
              <p> HOOK</p>
              <p> Then we will kill her, we will<br>
                kill her and all those with her.</p>
              <p> CURATOR</p>
              <p> And burn the map and retrieve the key.</p>
              <p> HOOK</p>
              <p> It will be done. But what of<br>
                the American expedition? They<br>
                leave tomorrow as well.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> CURATOR</p>
              <p> Forget the bumbling Americans,<br>
                they will be like all the others.<br>
                without the map to guide them, how<br>
                can they possibly find Hamunaptra?</p>
              <p>EXT. GIZA PORT - DAY</p>
              <p>SMASH CUT TO: our old traitorous friend BENI,</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> It is three days down the Nile,<br>
                then two days by camel, sahibs.</p>
              <p>WE CRANE BACK: to reveal Beni standing on the bow of a<br>
                PASSENGER BARGE. Surrounded by DANIELS, HENDERSON and BURNS,</p>
              <p> DANIELS</p>
              <p> For all the money we're paying<br>
                you, something better god-damned<br>
                well be under that sand.</p>
              <p>WE KEEP CRANING BACK: as Henderson slaps Daniels on the back.</p>
              <p> HENDERSON</p>
              <p> &quot;Hamunaptra,&quot; Daniels, that's<br>
                all ya gotta keep sayin, to<br>
                yourself, &quot;Hamunaptra.&quot;</p>
              <p>Now we see all of GIZA PORT: Team of explorers swarm the<br>
                docks. Across the Nile, the PYRAMIDS spike the sky. Evelyn<br>
                and Jonathan walk along the boardwalk besieged by HAWKERS<br>
                selling everything from toy tombs to King Tut action figures.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Do you really think he'll show up?</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Undoubtedly, I know the breed,<br>
                he may be a cowboy, but his<br>
                word is his word.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Personally, I think he's filthy,<br>
                rude and a complete scoundrel.<br>
                I don't like him one bit.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL (o.s.)</p>
              <p> Anyone I know?</p>
              <p>They both turn. O'Connell walks up; shaved, showered, spit<br>
                and polished, with a new haircut and clothes. He looks more<br>
                dashing and handsome than ever. Evelyn is suitably impressed.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Oh .... um,...hello.</p>
              <p>Jonathan grabs O'Connell's arm and shakes his hand.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Smashing day for the start of<br>
                an adventure, eh, O'Connell?</p>
              <p>O'Connell quickly checks his pockets.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Yeah, sure, smashing.</p>
              <p>He finds his wallet and relaxes. DIRECTLY ABOVE HIM: on the<br>
                bow of the barge, Burns wipes his bifocals and turns to Beni.</p>
              <p> BURNS</p>
              <p> You're sure Hamunaptra is out there?</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> Along with the scorched bones<br>
                of my entire garrison, sahib.</p>
              <p>And that's when Beni spots O'Connell. Beni shakes his head,<br>
                as if seeing a mirage, then starts backing away from the men.</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> A thousand pardons, my good sahibs<br>
                but there is much work to be done.</p>
              <p>Beni quickly scurries off, vanishing down into the hold.</p>
              <p>BACK DOWN WITH: Evelyn, recovering, she clears her throat.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Mister O'Connell, can you look<br>
                me in the eye, and guarantee me<br>
                this is not some sort of flimflam?<br>
                Because if it is, I'm warning you--</p>
              <p>--O'Connell steps up close to Evelyn, invading her space<br>
                looks her straight in the eye. Evelyn doesn't back away.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> All I can tell you, miss, is that my<br>
                Colonel found that map in an ancient<br>
                fortress, and the whole damn garrison<br>
                believed in it so much, that without<br>
                orders, we marched halfway across<br>
                Libya and into Egypt to find that city.<br>
                Like I told ya, all I saw was sand.<br>
                Everybody else was wiped-out by<br>
                Tuareg warriors. I'll take your bags.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>O'Connell takes her bags and heads up the gangplank and onto</p>
              <p>THE SAME PASSENGER BARGE THAT BENI AND THE AMERICANS ARE ON.</p>
              <p>Evelyn's eyes follow him, a bit wistfully. Jonathan sees it.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Yes, yes, you're right, filthy,<br>
                rude, a complete scoundrel,<br>
                nothing to like there at all.</p>
              <p>Evelyn gives him a look. Jonathan just grins. And that's when<br>
                the warden suddenly brushes past, tipping his raggedy hat.</p>
              <p> WARDEN</p>
              <p> A bright good morning to all.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> What are you doing here?</p>
              <p> WARDEN</p>
              <p> I have come to protect my<br>
                investment, thank you very much.</p>
              <p>And up the plank he goes. Evelyn and Jonathan share a look.</p>
              <p>WE GO WIDE AGAIN: as the barge pulls out and heads down the<br>
                Nile. WE TILT UP: to the SUN, which then DISSOLVES into--</p>
              <p>EXT. RIVER NILE - NIGHT</p>
              <p>--The MOON, shining down on the desert. The THREE VICIOUS<br>
                MUMIA quietly glide a narrow skiff out onto the river. The<br>
                one with the hook sits in the middle of the skiff, the other<br>
                two row, heading for the PASSENGER BARGE coming their way.</p>
              <p>EXT. THE BAR AT THE BOW - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Jonathan and the three Americans are playing poker. O'Connell<br>
                comes out a door carrying a GUNNY-SACK.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Sit down, O'Connell, sit down,<br>
                we could use another good player.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> I only gamble with my life,<br>
                never my money.</p>
              <p> DANIELS</p>
              <p> Never? What if I were to wager<br>
                five hundred dollars says we<br>
                get to Hamunaptra before you?</p>
              <p>O'Connell returns Daniel's cocky look.</p>
              <p><br>
                O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Yer on.</p>
              <p>Burns slips on his dirty bifocals.</p>
              <p> BURNS</p>
              <p> What makes you so confident, sir?</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> What makes you?</p>
              <p>Henderson spits a wad of chew into a spittoon.</p>
              <p> HENDERSON</p>
              <p> We got us a man who's actually been there</p>
              <p>O'Connell's poker face drops, perplexed. Same with Jonathan</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> I say, what a coincidence, why--</p>
              <p>--O'Connell 'accidentally' hits him in the ribs with the<br>
                gunny-sack, shutting him up. Jonathan quickly covers.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> --whose deal is it? Is it my deal?<br>
                I thought I just dealt?</p>
              <p>EXT. BARGE - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Evelyn sits on a table, staring out over the passing river.<br>
                The gunny-sack DROPS onto the table, startling her.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya</p>
              <p> ELVELYN</p>
              <p> The only thing that scares me,<br>
                Mister O'Connell, are your manners,</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> If you call that a kiss.</p>
              <p>O'Connell reaches into the gunny-sack and starts pulling out<br>
                revolvers, pistols, hunting knives, a massive elephant gun,<br>
                and a half dozen carefully wrapped sticks of dynamite.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Did I miss something? Are we<br>
                going into battle?</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> The last time I was at that place<br>
                everybody I was with died.</p>
              <p>This takes the smile off Evelyn's face. O'Connell starts<br>
                dismantling and cleaning the guns.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> There's something out there, you<br>
                know, something under that sand.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain<br>
                artifact, a book, actually, my<br>
                brother thinks there's treasure.</p>
              <p> What do you think is out there?</p>
              <p>O'Connell looks into Evelyn's eyes.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin<br>
                believe that Hamunaptra is cursed,<br>
                they call it, &quot;the doorway to hell&quot;</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Ahmar is Ossirion. &quot;Passageway<br>
                to the underworld&quot;, actually.</p>
              <p>She gives him a know-it-all grin.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> I don't believe in fairy tales<br>
                and hokum, Mister 0'Connell, but<br>
                I do believe that one of the most<br>
                famous books in history is buried<br>
                out there, The Book Of The Living<br>
                It's what first interested me in<br>
                Egypt as a child. It's why I came<br>
                here, sort of a life's pursuit.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> And the fact that they say it's<br>
                made out of pure gold, makes no<br>
                nevermind to you, right?</p>
              <p>Evelyn is surprised by his knowledge.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> You know your history.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> I know my treasure.-</p>
              <p><br>
                Evelyn gets up to go, then she hesitates, nervous, she turns<br>
                back to O'Connell, and as matter-of-fact as possible says:</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> By the way, ...why did you kiss me?</p>
              <p>O'Connell, cleaning his guns, just shrugs his shoulders</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> I was about to be hanged, seemed<br>
                like a good idea at the time.</p>
              <p>Evelyn's eyes widen, furious, she turns and storms off.</p>
              <p>O'Connell looks up, watching her leave, a bit perplexed</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> What? .... Wha'd I say?</p>
              <p>Then he hears someone SNICKERING under the table. He quickly<br>
                reaches down, grabs that someone and lifts him up. It's Beni.</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> My very good friend! What a surprise</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Why if it ain't my little buddy,<br>
                Beni. I outta kill you.</p>
              <p>O'Connell sticks a knife under Beni's throat. Beni swallows<br>
                hard, then tries to weasel his way out with a big grin.</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> You never were any good with<br>
                the ladies, O'Connell.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> So you're the one leading the<br>
                Americans, I shoulda figured.<br>
                So what's the scam? You get 'em</p>
              <p>out in the middle of the desert</p>
              <p>then leave 'em to rot?</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> Unfortunately no, these Americans<br>
                are smart, they pay me only half<br>
                now, half when I get them back to<br>
                Cairo, so I must go all the way.</p>
              <p>O'Connell pulls the knife away. Beni relaxes, rubs his neck.</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> You never believed in Hamunaptra,<br>
                O'Connell. Why are you going back?<br>
                The devil himself lives out there.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They look as they hear Evelyn YELP. A single CAMEL in the<br>
                HORSE PADDOCK takes another bite at her. She YELPS again and<br>
                backs away. O'Connell grins as Evelyn flees down the deck.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> The girl saved my life, figured<br>
                it was the least I could do,<br>
                keep her out of trouble.</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> You always did have more balls<br>
                than brains.</p>
              <p>O'Connell's eyes narrow at the insult, he looks back at Beni</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Let's make us even, shall we?</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> Even?</p>
              <p>O'Connell grabs him and chucks him over the side of the<br>
                barge. Beni SPLASHES into the river. O'Connell takes his<br>
                gunny-sack and starts walking off down the deck.</p>
              <p> BENI(o.s)</p>
              <p> O'Connell! I am going to kill<br>
                you for this!</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Sounds familiar.</p>
              <p>And that's when he spots THREE SETS OF WET FOOTPRINTS, coming<br>
                up over the railing from the river and heading down the deck.</p>
              <p>O'Connell quickly looks around, immediately on the alert.</p>

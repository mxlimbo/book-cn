                The UNIVERSAL PICTURES globe spins. Then comes to a stop on the 
                African<br>
                continent. A golden papyrus MAP of ANCIENT EGYPT rises up. WE 
                PUSH IN on<br>
                it, towards a CITY along the Nile, it's name written in hierarchic. 
                WE KEEP<br>
                PUSHING IN until the golden map turns to golden sand and we find 
                ourselves<br>
                DESCENDING on this ancient Egyptian city. Only it's not ancient.<br>
                SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN are the WORDS.</p>
              <p> TREBES - 2,134 B.C</p>
              <p>Accompanied by a NARRATOR with a very thick Egyptian accent:</p>
              <p> NARRATOR </p>
              <p> Thebes. City of the Living. Crown<br>
                jewel of Pharaoh Seti the First.</p>
              <p>The CAMERA sets-down in an open plaza. An Arabian horse-drawn 
                CHARIOT comes<br>
                barreling right at us, driven by PHARAOH SETI; an aristocratic, 
                virile old<br>
                man. The chariot WIPES FRAME.</p>
              <p>INT. ANCK-SU-NAMUN'S BALCONY WINDOW - PALACE - DUSK</p>
              <p>Glaring out over the city at the setting sun is a handsome, muscular 
                MAN<br>
                with intense, evil eyes. This is IMHOTEP.</p>
              <p> NARRATOR </p>
              <p> Home of Imhotep, High Priest of<br>
                Osiris, Keeper of the Dead.</p>
              <p>A gorgeous, olive-skinned goddess enters the outer foyer. It 
                takes us a<br>
                moment to realize that the skin-tight dress she's wearing isn't 
                a dress at<br>
                all, but rather her entire naked body has been PAINTED in the 
                ancient<br>
                Egyptian manner She's a stunning sight to behold. This is ANCK-SU-NAMUN.</p>
              <p> NARRATOR </p>
              <p> Birthplace of Anck-su-namun.<br>
                Pharaoh's Mistress. No other man was allowed<br>
                to touch her.</p>
              <p>She makes her way through the ornate statuary. The CAMERA comes 
                to a stop<br>
                on a CRACKED STONE FACE. A BEAT. And then it's eyes suddenly POP 
                OPEN. It's<br>
                really a strange looking TATTOOED MAN. Several more of these hideous, 
                bald<br>
                MEN stand nearby. They are the PRIESTS of Osiris. Imhotep's guys. 
                Their<br>
                eyes watch Anck-su-namun vanish through the bedroom curtains. 
                Anck-su-namun<br>
                embraces Imhotep, they kiss passionately, feverishly. Imhotep's 
                hands roam<br>
                over her perfect body, smearing the paint. The Narrator's VOICE 
                fills with<br>
                lust:</p>
              <p> NARRATOR </p>
              <p> But for our love, we were willing to<br>
                risk life itself.</p>
              <p>And we realize that the Narrator is actually Imhotep himself</p>
              <p>on the other-side of the curtains, the bald Priests rush over 
                and close the<br>
                doors. But just as they do, the doors suddenly BURST OPEN. Pharaoh 
                angrily<br>
                strides in, looks at the Priests. The following DIALOGUE is in 
                ANCIENT<br>
                EGYPTIAN, --SUBTITLED.)</p>
              <p> PHARAOH</p>
              <p> What are you doing here?</p>
              <p>The Priests back away, scared shitless, obviously his arrival 
                was<br>
                unexpected. Pharaoh strides for the curtains. Throws them back.<br>
                Anck-su-namun stands alone. Gives him a sexy smile. Pharaoh sees 
                the<br>
                smeared body paint. Points his finger.</p>
              <p> PHARAOH</p>
              <p> WHO HAS TOUCHED YOU?!</p>
              <p>From behind him, his sword is ripped out of its scabbard. Pharaoh 
                spins<br>
                around. It's Imhotep. Pharaoh is shocked.</p>
              <p> PHARAOH</p>
              <p> Imhotep? .... My priest.</p>
              <p>Behind him, Anck-su-namun lifts a dagger and plunges it into 
                his back.<br>
                Pharaoh SCREAMS. Imhotep raises Pharaoh's sword. The hideous bald 
                Priests<br>
                SLAM the doors and bolt them tight. Through the curtains, they 
                see the<br>
                SHADOWS of Anck-su-namun and Imhotep stab away at Pharaoh. Suddenly, 
                the<br>
                doors are RAMMED from the other side, --WHAM! Imhotep and Anck-su-namun<br>
                turn and look. --WHAM! The doors are RAMMED again. The two lovers 
                share<br>
                desperate looks. --WHAM! The bald Priests run up and grab Imhotep 
                and try<br>
                and pull him towards the balcony.</p>
              <p> PRIESTS</p>
              <p> Pharaoh's bodyguards!</p>
              <p>Imhotep tries to break free, but Anck-su-namun rips Pharaoh's 
                sword out of<br>
                his hand and pushes him towards the balcony.</p>
              <p> ANCK-SU-NAMM</p>
              <p> You must go. Save yourself.<br>
                Only you can resurrect me.</p>
              <p>Imhotep's face fills with despair. The DOORS EXPLODE OPEN. MEN 
                with<br>
                BLUE-TINTED SKIN and strange PUZZLE-TATTOOS over their bodies 
                stride in,<br>
                armed to the teeth. These are the MUMIA. The Priests hustle Imhotep 
                out<br>
                onto the dark balcony just as the Mumia rip through the curtains.<br>
                Anck-su-namun points at Pharaoh and hisses--</p>
              <p> ANCK-SU-NAMUN</p>
              <p> My body is no longer his temple!</p>
              <p>She PLUNGES the sword into her own heart. out on the balcony, 
                Imhotep's<br>
                mouth opens into a horrible silent scream .........</p>
              <p> NARRATOR/IMHOTEP</p>
              <p> For murdering Pharaoh, Anck-su-namun's body <br>
                was to be cursed. And it was I, the High <br>
                Priest, whose duty it was to curse it.</p>
              <p>EXT. SAND DUNES - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Imhotep leads-a TORCH-LIT procession across the dunes. Anck-su-namun's<br>
                mummy is carried by NUBIAN SLAVES. They pet her down in the sand 
                along with<br>
                FIVE JEWEL ENCRUSTED JARS.</p>
              <p> IMHOTEP </p>
              <p> Her body was mummified, her vital<br>
                organs removed and placed in sacred canopic<br>
                jars</p>
              <p>Imhotep, filled with dread, reads from a OBOOKO made out of pure 
                GOLD. THIS<br>
                IS THE BOOK OF THE LIVING.</p>
              <p> IMHOTEP </p>
              <p> The Book of The Living contained<br>
                sacred incantations that would send the evil<br>
                dead on a journey into the dark underworld.</p>
              <p>Strange LIGHT suddenly FLASHES across Anck-su-namun's body and 
                across the<br>
                faces of the slaves and the EGYPTIAN SOLDIERS Suddenly, everyone's<br>
                fear-filled eyes all rise, as if watching Anck-su-namun's body 
                rising. Then<br>
                one last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, and it's 
                over.<br>
                Anck-su-namun's body now lies twisted on the ground.</p>
              <p>Imhotep's Priests place the body into a stone sarcophagus. The 
                Nubian<br>
                slaves lower it into a hole and bury it with sand Imhotep then 
                signals to<br>
                the Soldiers, who throw their spears at the Nubians. Killing them.</p>
              <p> INHOTEP<br>
                <br>
                The slaves were killed....</p>
              <p>Imhotep's knife-wielding Priests attack the now unarmed Soldiers, 
                hacking<br>
                at them in the flickering darkness as Imhotep and the Mumia solemnly<br>
                watches.</p>
              <p> IMHOTEP </p>
              <p> .... and the soldiers who killed them<br>
                were also slain, so that no unholy person<br>
                should ever know the exact location of the<br>
                burial site.</p>
              <p>The Mumia walk off across the sand and then, one by one,<br>
                the Priests stop their frenzied stabbing and stare off at the<br>
                vanishing Mumia. As the last Mumia disappears over a distant<br>
                dune, Imhotep nods, and the Priests leap onto Anck-su-namun's<br>
                grave and begin digging it back up with their hands.</p>
              <p>EXT. SAHARA DESERT - NIGHT</p>
              <p>CHARIOTS race out into the moonlit desert. Imhotep leads the 
                way. A<br>
                &quot;hearse&quot; carries Anck-su-namun's mummy. THE MAP OF ANCIENT 
                EGYPT FADES UP.<br>
                The chariots race across the map.</p>
              <p> IMHOTEP </p>
              <p> But there was another book, The Book<br>
                Of The Dead, which was never to-be opened,<br>
                never to be read, for it contained the<br>
                incantations that could bring a dead body<br>
                back to life a most unholy thing.</p>
              <p>The chariots arrive at a place marked on the map in hieratic. 
                They race up<br>
                the stone ramp and in through the city gates. SUPERIMPOSED across 
                the<br>
                SCREEN are the WORDS:</p>
              <p> KANUNAPTM - City of the Dead</p>
              <p> IMHOTEP </p>
              <p> It was hidden at Hamunaptra, City of<br>
                the Dead, inside the statue of Anubis, so<br>
                that no such sacrilege might ever disgrace<br>
                Egypt.</p>
              <p>EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - ANUBIS SITE - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Imhotep pulls an ORNATE CHEST out of a SECRET COMPARTMENT inside 
                the giant<br>
                STATUE OF ANUBIS. He opens the chest and lifts out THE BOOK OF 
                THE DEAD,<br>
                made of black stone.</p>
              <p> IMHOTEP </p>
              <p> But for my love of Anck-su-namun I<br>
                was willing to defy the gods.</p>
              <p>INT- UNDERGROUND NECROPOLIS - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Big hairy RATS scurry through the mausoleums and over the headstones 
                of<br>
                this very large, scary, UNDERGROUND CEMETERY. A DETRITUS MOAT 
                surrounds the<br>
                cemetery, --muck made out of filthy water and human remains. Skulls 
                bob in<br>
                the goop. The Priests have gathered in a circle. Their hooded, 
                lifeless<br>
                eyes seem dead to this world. Their bald heads rock back and forth 
                as they<br>
                CHANT, a quiet eerie HUM. Heinous creatures. In the middle of 
                the circle is<br>
                a strange, twisted ALTAR.' Imhotep has unwrapped Anck-su-namun's 
                gorgeous,<br>
                lifeless body and placed her five sacred canopic jars around her.</p>
              <p> IMHOTEP </p>
              <p> Anck-su-namun's vital organs were<br>
                still fresh, so a human sacrifice would not<br>
                need be made</p>
              <p>As Imhotep begins to read from The Book of The Dead, a large 
                SWIRLING HOLE<br>
                starts to open in the detritus bog. Several Priests look over 
                at it,<br>
                frightened, then quickly look back down and resume CHANTING. A 
                strange MIST<br>
                wafts up out of the swirling hole and over to the jars, it passes 
                through<br>
                them and into Anck-su-namun's body. One of the jars SHUDDERS, 
                the heart<br>
                inside begins to BEAT. The CHANTING PRIESTS, SWIRLING HOLE, WAFTING 
                MIST,<br>
                BEATING HEART and IMHOTEP'S READINGS are reaching a crescendo.<br>
                Anck-su-namun's EYES suddenly FLY OPEN.</p>
              <p> IMHOTEP </p>
              <p> Anck-su-namun soul had come back from<br>
                the dead! Now all that was needed, was to<br>
                return her organs to their rightful place<br>
                within her body.</p>
              <p>Imhotep lifts a sacrificial knife above Anck-su-namun's breast, 
                about to<br>
                plunge it down. The CHANTING, SWIRLING and BEATING heart CLIMAX. 
                And that's<br>
                when the Mumia BURST IN and storm through the startled Priests. 
                The HEAD<br>
                MUMIA SMASHES the jar with the beating heart. The MIST instantly 
                sucks back<br>
                out of Anck-su-namun's body and IMPLODES back into the swirling 
                hole.<br>
                Anck-su-namun's eyes close. Dying once again. Imhotep SCREAMS 
                in rage. The<br>
                Mumia grab him and his Priests.</p>
              <p> IMHOTEP </p>
              <p> My Priests were condemned to be<br>
                mummified alive.</p>
              <p>INT. EMBALMF.RIS CHAMBER (necropolis re-vamp) - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Inside a TORCH-LIT CHAMBER, Imhotep is held by Anubis-headed 
                EMBALMERS. He<br>
                cringes at the flickering, impressionistic glimpses of his Priests 
                being<br>
                embalmed and mummified alive. The horrid-looking Embalmers, using 
                knives,<br>
                needles and thread, calmly perform their ghastly surgery on the 
                SCREAMING<br>
                Priests, who are going insane from the procedure.</p>
              <p>A red hot POKER is pulled out of a pit of burning coals.</p>
              <p>A Priest's head is wedged between two strong boards. His eyes 
                widen in<br>
                terror as an Embalmer moves to insert the red hot poker up his 
                nose. But<br>
                just before he does, WE QUICKLY CUT TO IMHOTEP'S FACE, horrified, 
                as OFF<br>
                CAMERA, the Priest SCREAMS.</p>
              <p>WE GO WIDE on the chamber. All twenty-one of Imhotep's Priests 
                squirm<br>
                inside their wrappings. Imhotep is forced to his knees. His arms 
                are held<br>
                back. His mouth is pried open.</p>
              <p> IMHOTEP </p>
              <p> As for me, I was condemned to endure<br>
                the HOM-DAI. The worst of all ancient curses.<br>
                one so horrible, it had never before been<br>
                bestowed.</p>
              <p>Using a pair of tongs, an Embalmer slowly pulls Imhotep's TONGUE 
                out of his<br>
                mouth, then places a very sharp knife on top of it. WE-GO TIGHT 
                on<br>
                IMHOTEP'S EYES as his tongue is apparently cut out. The Embalmer 
                flings<br>
                Imhotep's tongue onto the floor. The Mumia's dogs attack and quickly 
                eat<br>
                it.</p>
              <p>Imhotep is WRAPPED AL M . Only his mouth, nostrils and fear-filled 
                eyes are<br>
                left free of the slimy bandages. Detritus muck boils inside a 
                black<br>
                cauldron. Embalmers scoop out the fetid muck and apply it to Imhotep's<br>
                wrappings as he squirms. He's then laid in a wooden COFFIN inside 
                a stone<br>
                SARCOPHAGUS. An Embalmer with a BUCKET steps up and looks into 
                the coffin.<br>
                Imhotep's wild eyes stare back. The Embalmer empties the bucket 
                over<br>
                Imhotep's chest: dozens of SCARABS, disgusting dung beetles. They 
                scurry<br>
                across Imhotep's SCREAMING face. Some vanish into his tongue-less 
                mouth<br>
                and up his nostrils.</p>
              <p> INHOTEP </p>
              <p> By eating the sacred scarabs, I would<br>
                be cursed to stay alive forever. And by<br>
                eating me, they were cursed just the same.</p>
              <p>The lid to the coffin is SLAMMED SHUT. Then, using a strange 
                four-sided<br>
                YCEY, the Head Mumia locks the coffin lid tight. The heavy sarcophagus 
                lid<br>
                is shoved into place and with a loud WHOOSH seals itself airtight. 
                once<br>
                again, the Head Mumia uses the strange key, locking the sarcophagus 
                lid<br>
                tight.</p>
              <p> IMHOTEP </p>
              <p> I was to remain sealed inside my<br>
                sarcophagus, the undead for all of eternity.</p>
              <p>The blue-skinned, strangely tattooed man carefully collapses 
                the sides of<br>
                the key, --turning it into a little puzzle BOX.</p>
              <p> INHOTEP </p>
              <p> They would never allow me to be<br>
                released. For I would arise a walking<br>
                disease, a plague upon mankind, an unholy<br>
                flesh-eater, with the strength of ages, power<br>
                over the sands, and the glory of<br>
                invincibility.</p>
              <p>Imhotep's sarcophagus is dropped into a DETRITUS PIT. The disgusting 
                muck<br>
                SPLASHES up, drools down it-s sides, and then is mysteriously 
                sucked into<br>
                It's seams, vanishing clean.</p>
              <p> INHOTEP </p>
              <p> And if I could raise my beloved<br>
                Anck-su-namun from her place in hell,<br>
                together, we would be an unstoppable<br>
                infection upon this world. The Apocalypse.<br>
                The End</p>
              <p>Imhotep's horrifying tongue-less SCREANS can be heard coming 
                from inside<br>
                his sarcophagus as grave diggers shovel dirt onto it. THE MAIN 
                TITLE IS<br>
                SUPERIMPOSED ON THE SCREAM: THE MUMMY</p>
              <p>The heavily armed Mumia stand guard around Imhotep's grave. Looking 
                down on<br>
                the burial site is the huge statue of ANUBIS, the jackal-headed 
                god of<br>
                death. it stares at us. Then begins to DECAY before bur very eyes, 
                aging<br>
                4.159 years in only seconds. And then we find ourselves and the 
                decrepit,<br>
                half-buried statue of Anubis out in the middle of the desert.</p>
              <p>EXT. SAHARA - HAMANAPTRA RUINS (1925) - DAY</p>
              <p>Imhotep's horrifying SCREAMS become the SCREAMS of a TUAREG HORSEMAN.<br>
                Racing across the desert with two thousand of his warrior brethren. 
                Armed<br>
                to the teeth. SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN are the WORDS: TEE 
                SARKRA -<br>
                1925</p>
              <p>A mile across the scorching desert TWO HUNDRED FRENCH FOREIGN 
                LEGIONNAIRES<br>
                scurry through the ruins, preparing for the onslaught. OUR HERO 
                is up on<br>
                the wall. His Kepi sits at a jaunty angle. Dashing and handsome. 
                This is<br>
                RICK O'CONNELL. He looks out at the massive SCREAMING horde galloping 
                at<br>
                him.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> I knew this was gonna be a lousy day.</p>
              <p>A doughy little Frenchman joins him as he makes his way across 
                the top of<br>
                the wall. This is BENI.</p>
              <p> BENI </p>
              <p> Personally, I would like to surrender.<br>
                Why can we not just surrender?</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Shut-up and gimme your bandolier,</p>
              <p>Beni pulls off his cartridge belt. Hands it to O'Connell.</p>
              <p> BENI </p>
              <p> Then let's run away. Right now. while we<br>
                can still make it.</p>
              <p>O'Connell throws it on, crisscrossing his own bandolier.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL </p>
              <p> Now gimme your revolver, you'll<br>
                never use it anyway.</p>
              <p>Beni pulls out his pistol and chucks it to O'Connell</p>
              <p> BENI </p>
              <p> Then let's play dead, huh? Nobody ever<br>
                does that anymore</p>
              <p>O'Connell slides it into his belt, next to his own revolver</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL </p>
              <p> Now go find me a big stick.</p>
              <p> BENI </p>
              <p> in the desert? What for?</p>
              <p>O'Connell turns and goes nose-to-nose with him.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL </p>
              <p> So I can tie it to your back, you<br>
                appear to be without a spine</p>
              <p>The horde of warriors THUNDERS forward. Now a half mile out. 
                Scimitars<br>
                RATTLING. O'Connell and Beni run through the ruins.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL </p>
              <p> How'd a guy like you end up in the<br>
                Legion anyways?</p>
              <p> BENI </p>
              <p> I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots<br>
                of good stuff in them holy places; churches,<br>
                temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL </p>
              <p> Altar boys?</p>
              <p> BENI </p>
              <p> Exactly! I speak seven languages,<br>
                including Hebrew, so my specialty was<br>
                synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?</p>
              <p>Beni trips and accidentally tackles O'Connell to the ground. 
                O'Connell<br>
                gives him a nasty look.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL </p>
              <p> No, but I'm considering it.</p>
              <p>They get up and run out the gate and down the stone ramp</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> What then? Robbery? Extortion?<br>
                Kidnapping!</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> None of the above, thank you</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> Then what the hell are you<br>
                doing here!?</p>
              <p>They both skid to a stop at the front line as they see the horde 
                of<br>
                warriors.-The SOUND of CHARGING HORSES is deafening. O'Connell 
                gives Beni a<br>
                big cheesy smile.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> I was just looking for a good time.</p>
              <p>And that's when the cowardly Legionnaire Colonel suddenly panics, 
                cuts and<br>
                runs. O'Connell instantly stiffens.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Oh shit Steady!</p>
              <p>Gives the men around him courage. But onward comes the horde 
                Hoofs pounding<br>
                the sand. Several more Legionnaires take off.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> STEADY!</p>
              <p> (to himself)</p>
              <p> What the hell am I sayin'?</p>
              <p>The Tuaregs let loose with those horrifying oooo-loo-loog SCREAMS. 
                More<br>
                Legionnaires haul-ass. Beni is one of them.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> STEADY!!</p>
              <p> (to himself)</p>
              <p> What the hell am I doin'?</p>
              <p>The Tuaregs set their rifles and take aim. O'Connell steels himself, 
                cocks<br>
                and locks. The cartridge in his mouth suddenly snaps, he spits 
                it into the<br>
                sand. Another BEAT. And then--</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> FIRE!</p>
              <p>The Legionnaires on the ground FIRE. The rifles report with a 
                CRASH. The<br>
                BLAST blows dozens of Tuaregs clean off their mounts. The prone<br>
                Legionnaires quickly begin to reload.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> FIRE!</p>
              <p>The kneeling Legionnaires FIRE. More Tuaregs bite the sand. The 
                remaining<br>
                warriors OPEN FIRE. THUNDER and SMOKE rip the hot air. A third 
                of the<br>
                Legionnaires are killed instantly.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> FIRE!</p>
              <p>The remaining standing Legionnaires FIRE. Tuaregs spin off their 
                mounts.<br>
                Crash to the sand. And then the entire Tuareg force plows into 
                the ruins<br>
                and through the Legionnaires. O'Connell grabs the barrel of his 
                rifle and<br>
                starts CLUBBING riders off their steeds, fighting like a man possessed.</p>
              <p>Beni on the other hand, is bellycrawling across the sand, whimpering 
                in<br>
                full retreat as Legionnaires fall dead all around him. He crawls 
                through<br>
                the front gate.</p>
              <p>O'Connell throws his rifle down and goes for his guns. He cross-draws, 
                gun<br>
                in each hand, starts blowing riders off their mounts.</p>
              <p>Beni crawls faster, and then he spots an open TEMPLE DOORWAY 
                amongst the<br>
                rocks. He gets up and sprints for the door as the last of the 
                Legionnaires<br>
                are shot off their feet behind him. O'Connell's guns go empty.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Son-of-a-bitch.</p>
              <p>He turns and runs like hell, right through the front gate. Four 
                Tuareg<br>
                warriors on massive Arabians haul-ass after him. O'Connell hurdles 
                a stone<br>
                column, hits the ground running. He spots Beni inside the Temple 
                doorway,<br>
                trying to close the heavy sandstone door.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Hey! Beni! Wait up!</p>
              <p>Beni has no intention of waiting up, he pushes harder.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> What are ya doing?! Wait up!</p>
              <p>O'Connell runs faster. Beni pushes harder. The four Horsemen 
                LEAP the big<br>
                column and CHARGE after him. HOOFS POUNDING.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Don't you close that door!</p>
              <p> DON'T YOU CLOSE TRAT DOOR!</p>
              <p>Beni closes the door just as O'Connell reaches it. O'Connell 
                SLAMS his body<br>
                into the door. It doesn't budge</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> I'm gonna get you for this!</p>
              <p>He turns and bolts off around the rocks. Running for his life, 
                weaving<br>
                through the ruins. The Arabians getting closer and closer. The 
                POUNDING<br>
                hoofs getting LOUDER and LOUDER. O'Connell finally spins around 
                and faces<br>
                his attackers. The four massive horses crash to a stop in front 
                of him.<br>
                The vicious Tuaregs raise their rifles to finish him off. O'Connell 
                just<br>
                stands there, exhausted and beaten, then he slowly lifts his right 
                hand and gives them the bird.</p>
              <p>And that's when the horses go ape-shit. All four of them REAR 
                UP. Two of<br>
                the Riders are THROWN to the ground. The horses SCREECH and BELLOW 
                and<br>
                SNORT in fear, then buck like fury and haul-ass away as if the 
                devil<br>
                himself had scared them. The thrown Riders get up and race off 
                after their<br>
                mounts.</p>
              <p>O'Connell just stands there, stunned, then he lifts his right 
                hand and<br>
                checks out his middle finger. And then he feels the evil himself, 
                and turns<br>
                around. --The shattered, decrepit statue of Anubis stares back 
                at him.</p>
              <p>Suddenly, the sand begins to shift under O'Connell's feet. He 
                starts to<br>
                back away, keeping his eyes on the transforming sand, it looks

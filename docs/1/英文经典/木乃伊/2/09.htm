                INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - DAY</p>
              <p>O'Connell, Jonathan, Henderson and Daniels follow Evelyn<br>
                across the Ramesseum.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> There's only one person I know<br>
                who can possibly give us some<br>
                answers.</p>
              <p>They round a corner and come upon the Curator, --who is<br>
                talking with Ardeth Bay. Everybody stops.</p>
              <p> EVERYBODY</p>
              <p> YOU!</p>
              <p>O'Connell and the American's quickly draw their guns.<br>
                Ardeth Bay just scowls. The Curator nods his head.</p>
              <p> CURATOR</p>
              <p> Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> What is he doing here?</p>
              <p> CURATOR</p>
              <p> Do you truly wish to know? or<br>
                would you prefer to just shoot us?</p>
              <p>Everybody tenses, guns up. Then O'Connell uncocks his .38.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> I just saw my fist vanish into<br>
                some guy's head.</p>
              <p>He slides his gun back into his shoulder-holster.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> I'm willin, to go on a little<br>
                faith, here.</p>
              <p> CURATOR</p>
              <p> You will not believe it</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Try me.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. RAMESSEUM - MOMENTS LATER</p>
              <p>Everyone is assembled around the tomb display of Seti The<br>
                First. We recognize his chariot and sword. The Curator sits<br>
                on Seti's throne.</p>
              <p> CURATOR</p>
              <p> We are part of an ancient secret<br>
                society, the cult-of-the-Mumia,<br>
                and we have a sacred mission,<br>
                passed down through thirty-nine<br>
                generations. For over four thousand<br>
                years we have guarded The City Of<br>
                The Dead. we are sworn at manhood<br>
                to , do any and all in our power to<br>
                stop the High Priest Imhotep from<br>
                being reborn into this world.</p>
              <p> ARDETH RAY</p>
              <p> And because of you, we have failed.</p>
              <p> EVELYN (appalled)</p>
              <p> And you think this justifies<br>
                killing innocent people!?</p>
              <p> CURATOR</p>
              <p> To have stopped this creature? Yes!</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's<br>
                afraid of cats, what's that about?</p>
              <p> CURATOR</p>
              <p> According to the ancients, cat's<br>
                are the guardians at the gates of<br>
                the underworld. Imhotep will fear<br>
                them until he is fully regenerated,<br>
                and then he will fear nothing.</p>
              <p>Daniels is totally wigged-out, he looks at O'Connell.</p>
              <p> DANIELS</p>
              <p> Right! And ya know how he gets<br>
                fully regenerated?! By killing<br>
                everybody who opened that chest<br>
                and sucking us dry! That's how!</p>
              <p> CURATOR</p>
              <p> Yes, the creature must first try<br>
                and regenerate, and then he will<br>
                attempt to resurrect the one he<br>
                has loved for more than four<br>
                thousand years.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Anck-su-namun.</p>
              <p>The Curator and Ardeth Bay look at Evelyn, thunderstruck.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> In the necropolis, when I saw him,<br>
                alive, ...walking, he called me<br>
                Anck-su-namun. And then in Mister<br>
                Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.</p>
              <p> CURATOR</p>
              <p> It is because it was you who read<br>
                from the Book. He has chosen you to<br>
                be-the human sacrifice needed to<br>
                regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.</p>
              <p>Jonathan scratches his ear with the barrel of his pistol.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> This is not good. Not good at all</p>
              <p>Ardeth Bay has been staring out a wall of windows.</p>
              <p> ARDETH BAY</p>
              <p> Tonight is the full moon. The moon<br>
                of Osiris. It will begin tonight.</p>
              <p>Everyone follows Ardeth Bay's eyes, through the windows we<br>
                can see the SUN, --which is now going into a FULL ECLIPSE.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> &quot;...and he stretched forth his<br>
                hands towards the heavens, and<br>
                there was darkness throughout<br>
                the land of Egypt.&quot;</p>
              <p>EXT. BRITISH FORT - WINDOW - DAY FOR NIGHT</p>
              <p>O'Connell looks out a window at the British Soldiers manning<br>
                the walls. Above and beyond them, --is the BLACK SUN.</p>
              <p>EXT. EVELYN'S FOYER - DAY FOR NIGHT</p>
              <p>Evelyn and Jonathan are pacing the foyer</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> we must stop him from regenerating.<br>
                She turns to Daniels and Henderson</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Who opened that chest?</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> HENDERSON</p>
              <p> Well, there was me and Daniels here<br>
                and then poor Burns of course, oh<br>
                yeah, and that Egyptologist fella.</p>
              <p>O'Connell turns from the window</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> What about my buddy, Beni?</p>
              <p> DANIELS</p>
              <p> Naw, he scrammed outta there,</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> We must find the Egyptologist<br>
                and bring him back here to the<br>
                safety of the fort, before the<br>
                creature can get to him.</p>
              <p>O'Connell looks at Evelyn, Daniels and Henderson.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Okay, ...Evelyn, you wait here,<br>
                you two come with me.</p>
              <p>All three of them pounce on him at once--</p>
              <p> HENDERSON</p>
              <p> The hell with that! I'm not<br>
                goin' nowhere! we're safe here.</p>
              <p> DANIELS</p>
              <p> Yeah, I'm not leavin, this<br>
                fort for nothin'.</p>
              <p> EVELYN</p>
              <p> Who put you in charge? You can't<br>
                just leave me behind like some old<br>
                suitcase. I'm the one responsible<br>
                for this mess and I intend to be<br>
                the one to clean it up.</p>
              <p>O'Connell just shakes his head and SIGHS. Totally put-upon.<br>
                Then he takes Evelyn, shoves her into the bedroom, slams the<br>
                door and locks it with a skeleton key. From inside her room<br>
                we can hear Evelyn POUNDING on the door and YELLING.</p>
              <p>O'Connell throws the skeleton key to Daniels.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Keep an eye on her. If you leave<br>
                her door, I'll rip your spleen out<br>
                C'mon, Jonathan.</p>
              <p>Jonathan swallows hard and points to himself</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Me?</p>
              <p>CAIRO ALLEYWAYS - BAZAAR - DAY FOR NIGHT</p>
              <p>The Egyptologist stumbles through the dark alleys, looking<br>
                haunted. He clutches the Book of The Dead in one hand and his<br>
                SACRED CANOPIC JAR in the other. Imhotep is stalking him. A<br>
                STREET VENDOR turns and sees Imhotep's horribly decayed face.</p>
              <p>He reacts and scurries away. Imhotep lifts his robe, covers<br>
                his face, and moves in on the Egyptologist, who is heading<br>
                into the bazaar. WE PAN UP TO--</p>
              <p>THE EGYPTOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY FOR NIGHT</p>
              <p>Beni is RANSACKING the joint, pulling out drawers and files<br>
                and throwing them on the floor. He finds a silver pocket<br>
                watch, shakes it, then throws it into his pocket, then he<br>
                starts tipping over bookcases and clearing shelves.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL(o.s.)</p>
              <p> well, well, well.</p>
              <p>Beni spins around. O'Connell and Jonathan stand in the door.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Lemme guess, spring cleaning?</p>
              <p>Beni turns and runs for an open window. O'Connell grabs a<br>
                chair, FLINGS IT into his path. Beni TRIPS and CRASHES into a<br>
                wall. O'Connell strides over, grabs him and lifts him up the<br>
                wall. Beni's feet dangle off the floor.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Where's your new friend?</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> what friend? You're my only friend</p>
              <p>O'Connell quickly slides his knife up under Beni's chin</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Then you got no excuse for living.<br>
                What the hell you doin, being<br>
                buddies with this creep, Beni?<br>
                What's in it for you?</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> It is better to be the right hand<br>
                of the Devil,....than in his path.<br>
                As long as I serve him, I am immune.<br>
              </p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Immune from what?</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> You shall see.<br>
                <br>
                O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> What are you looking for?<br>
                Lie, and I'll slit your throat</p>
              <p>O'Connell shoves the knife deeper into Beni's skin.</p>
              <p> BENI</p>
              <p> The book! The black book they<br>
                found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep<br>
                wants it back. Said to me it<br>
                would be worth it's weight<br>
                in diamonds.</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> What does he want the book for?</p>
              <p> BENI (shrugs)</p>
              <p> Something about bringing his<br>
                dead girly-friend back to life<br>
                He needs the book....</p>
              <p> (looks at Jonathan)</p>
              <p> And your sister.</p>
              <p>O'Connell looks at Jonathan. Beni seizes the moment and KNEES<br>
                O'Connell in the balls. O'Connell doubles over and collapses.<br>
                Beni leaps out the window. Jonathan cringes.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> That looked rather painful</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL (wincing)</p>
              <p> Ya know, ever since I met you,<br>
                my luck has been for crap.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> Yes, I know, I do that to people</p>
              <p>And that's when they hear a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM coming from<br>
                down in the bazaar. O'Connell and Jonathan scramble to the<br>
                window and look out--</p>
              <p>EXT. BAZAAR - DAY FOR NIGHT</p>
              <p>Down in the bazaar, people are SCREAMING and quickly backing<br>
                away from the SHRIVELLED CORPSE OF THE EGYPTOLOGIST.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>A partially decayed HAND reaches down and takes the sacred<br>
                canopic jar out of the Egyptologist's shriveled hand. It's<br>
                Imhotep, having regenerated even further. He looks up and<br>
                catches eyes with O'Connell. Imhotep grins, then UNHINGES; his<br>
                jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman size, and then a huge<br>
                SWARM OF FLIES comes out of his mouth and races straight up<br>
                at O'Connell and Jonathan. They both SLAM the shutters.<br>
                The flies SLAM into the closed window and immediately spread<br>
                throughout the bazaar. Sending people SCREAMING and running.</p>
              <p>EGYPTOLOGISTS OFFICE - DAY FOR NIGHT</p>
              <p>O'Connell and Jonathan look at each other, panicked</p>
              <p> O'CONNELL</p>
              <p> Damn-it! That's two down and<br>
                only two to go.</p>
              <p> JONATHAN</p>
              <p> And then he'll be coming after Evy.</p>
              <p>They turn and race out of the office.</p>
              <p>BRITISH FORT - WINDOW --NIGHT</p>
              <p>Daniels stares out a window, watching the British Guards at<br>
                the front gate. more Soldiers march the encircling parapet.</p>
              <p> SOLDIER</p>
              <p> Ten O'clock! All is well!</p>
              <p>The lights and MUSIC from the Casbah come up from below</p>
              <p>INT. EVELYN'S FOYER - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Daniels turns from the window. Henderson sits in a chair next<br>
                to Evelyn's door, chain smoking. Both look wired with fear.</p>
              <p> DANIELS</p>
              <p> The hell with this. I'm goin,<br>
                downstairs to get me a drink.<br>
                You want somethin,?</p>
              <p> HENDERSON</p>
              <p> Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a<br>
                shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser</p>
              <p>Daniels nods and heads out. Henderson just sits there, alone,<br>
                smoking. He reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out his<br>
                SACRED CANOPIC JAR and fondles it. A BREEZE suddenly comes in<br>
                through the open window. The curtains flutter. Henderson gets<br>
                up and goes over to shut it. He looks out the window.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>The CAMERA races over the compound, into the window and HITS<br>
                Henderson square in the FACE just as he's about to scream.</p>
              <p>Henderson is lifted into the air by a mass of SWIRLING SAND.<br>
                His body TWISTS and TURNS and Slowly SHRIVELS as the life is<br>
                SUCKED out of him. Then he COLLAPSES to the floor. On the<br>
                wall above him, the SHADOW of the SWIRLING SAND condenses,<br>
                forming a SHADOW of a human body. The SHADOW CONVULSES as the<br>
                body REGENERATES. And then it's over.</p>
              <p>Imhotep steps into view. He's regenerated even further and<br>
                looks almost normal now, his face no longer decayed. He steps<br>
                over Henderson's shriveled body and up to Evelyn's door,<br>
                rattles the knob. it's locked. Imhotep grins.</p>
              <p>EVELYN'S ROOM - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Evelyn is asleep in her bed as SAND begins streaming in through<br>
                the keyhole, pouring onto the floor, forming a large mound. Evelyn<br>
                starts to toss and turn. WE PAN BACK OVER TO THE DOOR: The mound<br>
                of sand is gone and in it's place is Imhotep.</p>

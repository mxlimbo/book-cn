                IMPERIAL BOX</p>
              <p>Falco leans over and plops down five gold coins.</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                I wouldn't know who to bet on.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS (O.S.)<br>
                Great Caesar! We who are about to die, salute you!</p>
              <p>The sound of Narcissus' voice hits Commodus like a blow.<br>
                Stunned he and Falco rise and gawk down into the arena --<br>
                Commodus locks eyes with Narcissus.</p>
              <p>Narcissus stares at Commodus... then turns as the people<br>
                cheer and give cat-calls. Narcissus faces a gladiator<br>
                approaching from the opposite side. He's a THRACIAN<br>
                GLADIATOR; he holds up his round shield and curved sword<br>
                to the crowd.</p>
              <p>COMMODUS --</p>
              <p>just gawks at Narcissus.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Why isn't he dead? Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!</p>
              <p> TRIBUUS<br>
                Caesar, I did my best. The<br>
                Colosseum isn't under my control...</p>
              <p>Sudden panic from Jerses who realizes the ball's in his<br>
                court.</p>
              <p> JERSES<br>
                Truthfully, Caesar, the crowd doesn't care for him. He wins, but...</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Wins? What in hell are you talking about? That man is my enemy!<br>
                Lucilla, you knew he was here! You did this to humiliate me!</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                Don't be ridiculous. Come on; he's just a gladiator. Will you 
                sit<br>
                down? Everyone's watching.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS &amp; SOME CROWD<br>
                Surrender, or I'll kill you!</p>
              <p>This does not help Jerses' case.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                The crowd does seem to know him...</p>
              <p> JERSES<br>
                But just a handful in the cheap seats.</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS</p>
              <p>watches the Thracian very closely. Obviously the man is<br>
                not going to surrender. They circle as the crowd shouts<br>
                -- the sound of the full fifty thousand people is<br>
                deafening. For a second Narcissus stops paying attention,<br>
                and he looks up toward the Imperial Box. The Thracian<br>
                charges and Narcissus just has time to block his sword and<br>
                shove him aside.</p>
              <p>Now Narcissus gets furious and bangs away at the Thracian.</p>
              <p> JERSES<br>
                He's making a mistake. He'll lose now, he can't match the Thracian's<br>
                strength. He's one of the best from School of Lykas.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                And Narcissus...?</p>
              <p> JERSES<br>
                School of Proximo! If anyone's responsible for his life it's Proximo, 
                he saved him.</p>
              <p>Just as those words leave Jerses' mouth Narcissus shoves his 
                sword right through the Thracian's shield with a tremendous blow 
                that kills him.</p>
              <p>AND COMMODUS</p>
              <p>He just turns away.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                As soon as he goes, distribute the grain. Jerses?</p>
              <p> JERSES<br>
                Yes. I can hold the rest of the fights until the food is given 
                out,<br>
                that's why everyone came anyway.<br>
                Honestly, he's not really that popular, Caesar.</p>
              <p>A MUG on Commodus' table suddenly SHATTERS. He looks at<br>
                it like &quot;what the hell?&quot; The crowd HOWLS.</p>
              <p>BELOW</p>
              <p>Narcissus picks up ROCKS and throws them up at the imperial box. 
                Adonis tries to drag him off as Dala clutches the swords.</p>
              <p>The audience goes completely NUTS -- some spectators in the cheap 
                seats actually keel over from spasms of laughter.</p>
              <p>Praetorian Guard immediately move in front of Commodus and<br>
                the crowd BOOS them. At the same time more and more call<br>
                Narcissus name. Dala and Adonis grab Narcissus and pull<br>
                him off the sand as the crowd continues to go nuts.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Kill him! Tribuus -- execute that bastard.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                You can't do that! You came here to turn the crowd around not 
                make them hate you.</p>
              <p>Commodus stands and pushes aside the Praetorian Guard so<br>
                the crowd can see him. He smiles, making the best of it.<br>
                The Good Seats applaud his effort.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Tribuus... tomorrow.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                You're coming back?</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                I have to come back. If I don't come back the people will think 
                I'm<br>
                a coward. Tribuus, tomorrow he dies -- I want his blood on the 
                sand. Do you understand?</p>
              <p> TRIBUUS<br>
                Yes, Caesar?</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Jerses -- tomorrow...</p>
              <p>THE TRENCHES</p>
              <p>As the other gladiators hold Narcissus back -- his eyes<br>
                are wild, months of hate crashing to the surface. He pulls loose 
                and sits.</p>
              <p> JERSES (O.S.)<br>
                On this next day, Emperor Commodus will give out double this same<br>
                amount of grain and loaves of fresh bread from the Imperial ovens!</p>
              <p>COMMODUS STANDS</p>
              <p>and the crowd goes wild... he smiles and nods grimly.<br>
                Looks like today he's had the last word.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. GLADIATOR WAGON - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
              <p>Narcissus breathing hard as if he were still resonating from 
                a rush of renewal. Proximo sits opposite with a guard, absolutely 
                gleeful -- wrapping his hands together and all but muttering &quot;O-boy, 
                o-boy, o-boy!&quot;</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Throwing rocks at the Emperor! I can't tell you how much I love 
                that!<br>
                Oh, Gods, thank you! (to Adonis)<br>
                When we get back -- wine for our hero. The best red from Moselle!<br>
                Not that piss from Crete! Wine that's not the color of blood is 
                no<br>
                wine!</p>
              <p>Kids race alongside the wagon shouting his name -- people<br>
                they pass wave and shout for Narcissus. Now PEOPLE mob<br>
                the wagon, and it slows. Narcissus still seems to be<br>
                recovering, it's as if his mind were ascending from hell<br>
                back to the daylight.</p>
              <p>Proximo edges closer so no one else will hear.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii<br>
                Olive Oil company. Small, but profitable. They asked if you would<br>
                endorse their oil. We could get some very nice posters. Make some<br>
                very big money...</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                What would the poster say: &quot;Narcissus would kill for a taste 
                of<br>
                Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?&quot;</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Think about it! Just think about it!</p>
              <p> DALA<br>
                Look at that! That's new!</p>
              <p>Narcissus looks out through the bars as they pass a square<br>
                and a large STATUE OF COMMODUS.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                The big push is on, for the month of Janus approaches!</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - NEAR DUSK</p>
              <p>As Armed Slaves unload the gladiators, two separate<br>
                Narcissus and bring him to Proximo.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                We're going some place tonight. Don't even think about trying 
                to<br>
                escape you'll be heavily guarded. We're going to a party where 
                Adonis will beat the brains out of some fool. Your presence has 
                been requested.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. DOMUS - PRIVATE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT</p>
              <p>A palatial private residence in Rome. Judging from the<br>
                heavily embroidered togas this is a high-end crowd:<br>
                'equites publicani'.</p>
              <p>Narcissus sits on a chair, wrists cuffed, flanked by armed<br>
                slaves, watching as Adonis squares off with a tall, lean<br>
                EGYPTIAN. They both wear leather gloves studded with<br>
                spikes. The Egyptian nails Adonis who totters bloody from<br>
                the blow -- and the CROWD moves in blocking the view.</p>
              <p>A SERVANT sets three dishes on tripod stands for guests to<br>
                wander past and help themselves.</p>
              <p>The FIRST is a pile of FISH HEADS -- remarkable for their<br>
                ENORMOUS GAPING EYES. The SECOND is a spiral of multi-<br>
                colored BIRD EGGS. A YOUNG MAN cracks an egg, hold it up<br>
                and a whole BIRD EMBRYO drops into his mouth. He clamps<br>
                down on it with a CRUNCH.</p>
              <p>Narcissus sees TWO ATTRACTIVE GIRLS watching him from<br>
                across the room. They whisper, giggle, and approach.<br>
                Then they pause by the three dishes. The girls are<br>
                suddenly right in front of Narcissus.</p>
              <p> GIRL #1<br>
                You're Narcissus, aren't you? The gladiator? My sister has something<br>
                she wants to give you...</p>
              <p>Girl #2 kneels, parts his legs so she can get very close<br>
                and opens her mouth. In the cup of her tongue is a huge<br>
                FISH EYE. Apparently she wants him to suck it off.<br>
                Narcissus might actually be tempted, but...</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I've eaten, but thank you...</p>
              <p>Girl #2 makes a show of swallowing the eye. She climbs<br>
                off her knees, kisses Narcissus, then arm in arm she and<br>
                her sister leave.</p>
              <p>Narcissus' eyes are drawn to the third bowl and it seems<br>
                to contain BRIGHTLY COLORED CHIPS. But they MOVE...<br>
                they're LIVING BUTTERFLIES dusted with a sparkling colored<br>
                coating of diluted honey. Helpless in the bowl, their<br>
                wings fold and unfold.</p>
              <p>Proximo arrives with six very wealthy-looking MEN in tow.<br>
                While slaves bring up chairs Proximo casually scoops up a<br>
                handful of butterflies and pops them into his mouth like<br>
                Fritos.</p>
              <p>Chairs are brought up for each and they all sit directly<br>
                opposite Narcissus and study him as if he were some piece<br>
                of art.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Gentlemen, Narcissus The Good!</p>
              <p>Hmm... they continue to study him. Then a GREY HAIRED MAN<br>
                sorts himself out of the guests and approaches. It's<br>
                Gracchus.</p>
              <p> GRACCHUS<br>
                Who are you? Narcissus The Good? I have heard of Narcissus Meridas.<br>
                That's who I hear you are.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                You're hearing about somebody else.</p>
              <p> GRACCHUS<br>
                How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.</p>
              <p> GRACCHUS<br>
                Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial? You'd 
                have to give me your word.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?</p>
              <p> GRACCHUS<br>
                You're a citizen and a soldier. Not<br>
                a gladiator.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                You don't know how wrong you are.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. COLOSSEUM - NEXT DAY</p>
              <p>Narcissus waits with the other gladiators. Proximo<br>
                approaches Narcissus. An Arena Slave hands Narcissus a<br>
                sword and shield.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Jerses is pitting you against one of<br>
                Lykas' Dimachaeri -- Saturnus...</p>
              <p> BAD TEETH<br>
                A two-sword; light armor, Saturnus is one of Lykas' best, very 
                fast.<br>
                The Emperor is behind this. First Crassus, now you're dead.</p>
              <p>CENTER ARENA</p>
              <p>As soon as Narcissus steps out the crowd goes wild.</p>
              <p>Dozens of people call his name. Saturnus holds two<br>
                swords, one short and the other long with an X-shaped<br>
                head. For a moment the audience goes quiet as the two<br>
                face off. Narcissus YELLS:</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Surrender or I'll kill you.</p>
              <p>The crowd loves it -- some cheer. Saturnus flips his<br>
                short sword into a stabbing position, holds out his long<br>
                sword. Narcissus charges whaling at him with his shield.</p>
              <p>Taken completely off-guard Saturnus dodges -- and TRIPS.<br>
                Narcissus is on him -- crushing down on his head with his<br>
                shield. Saturnus flails wildly -- cuts Narcissus on the<br>
                right with the long sword. Narcissus yanks the short<br>
                sword out of the man's hand and kills him with it. The<br>
                crowd GASPS.</p>
              <p>Narcissus reels to his feet, drops his shield and grips<br>
                his wound which spews blood. Then he sees 'PLUTO'<br>
                approaching with his death hammer.</p>
              <p>THE GLADIATORS</p>
              <p>rush to the doorway, shout his name, urging him on.</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS</p>
              <p>Staggers, keeps moving as Pluto dogs his steps waiting for<br>
                Narcissus to fall. He gets within twenty feet of the<br>
                doorway... suddenly looks like he's going to fall --<br>
                there's a GASP from the crowd.</p>
              <p>AND COMMODUS --</p>
              <p>On the edge of his seat.</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS</p>
              <p>Gives Pluto the hard stare... and DROPS -- but all the<br>
                Proximo gladiators rush out and he falls into Bad Teeth's<br>
                arms. The crowd ROARS.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Give out the food -- quickly!</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. GLADIATOR WAGON - AFTERNOON</p>
              <p>Narcissus barely wakes. Adonis works desperately to stop<br>
                the wound as Proximo squats nearby crazy with anxiety.<br>
                The GANG KIDS jog along side the wagon, deathly quiet as<br>
                they watch. The Blonde Kid reaches in through the bars<br>
                with a small mug of water.</p>
              <p> BLOND KID<br>
                Don't die Narcissus! It's<br>
                Narcissus! Narcissus The Good!</p>
              <p>Narcissus agonizingly reaches up and clasps it -- for a<br>
                second the boy holds on, then lets it go. Now the Cute<br>
                Whore appears frantically blowing him kisses as if they<br>
                could somehow save him. Now more and more hands reach in<br>
                through the bars as citizens hear his name and crowd<br>
                around.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Don't die, general! One third! One third! After today everyone 
                will<br>
                know your name!</p>

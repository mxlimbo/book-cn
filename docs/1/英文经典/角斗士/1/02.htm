                watching the troops, seeming to weigh any response with the utmost 
                calculation.</p>
              <p>AND MARCUS</p>
              <p>eyes dead-ahead on the troops.</p>
              <p> MARCUS AURELIUS<br>
                But on this day I ask you to put those nine centuries down -- 
                they're<br>
                too heavy for us to carry into battle again! So, we'll leave them<br>
                here for the Senators to guard for us!</p>
              <p>QUINTUS</p>
              <p>allows himself a smile as the troops grin and laugh. He looks 
                across at Narcissus who manages the faintest of smiles -- a very 
                serious man...</p>
              <p> MARCUS AURELIUS<br>
                This day I want you to fight for the cold and the heat and the 
                filth --<br>
                and for all those friends who will never feel the sun on their 
                faces<br>
                again! I want you to fight for you!<br>
                For at the moment of battle you and you alone are Rome!</p>
              <p>THE SOLDIERS...</p>
              <p>Rank after disciplined rank: not one sideways look, not one sound...</p>
              <p>AND MARCUS...</p>
              <p>As his eyes pass from cohort to cohort.</p>
              <p> MARCUS AURELIUS<br>
                How quickly all things sordid and perishable in the universe disappear. 
                Yet throughout time the remembrance of great deeds grows only 
                fresher bringing life again to those who dare perform them...<br>
                (pause)<br>
                Legate Narcissus Meridas and Legate Quintus Clarus, I must ask 
                you and your legions for one more day out of nine centuries! Will 
                you give it to me?</p>
              <p>The troops HOWL their support. Marcus pulls his sword and half 
                turns aiming it behind him.</p>
              <p> MARCUS AURELIUS<br>
                There is the enemy of Rome!</p>
              <p>Commodus steps forward to join his father and the uproar grows.</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS</p>
              <p>removes his helmet as a sign of respect. Now the stoic veneer 
                of his face cracks into a mixture of reverence and perhaps even 
                love for the emperor.</p>
              <p>AND COMMODUS...</p>
              <p>taking every single bit of this in. He seems particularly interested 
                in Narcissus.</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS &amp; QUINTUS</p>
              <p>Move their horses close and dismount.</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the 
                army.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Let's hope he doesn't start giving orders.</p>
              <p>Servis approaches and salutes. It starts to RAIN.</p>
              <p> SERVIS<br>
                At your command, sir.</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. FOREST - EARLY MORNING</p>
              <p>In a howling RAINSTORM Felix Division breaks through the<br>
                dense woods like a moving human wall behind their rectangular 
                shields.</p>
              <p>They're in the midst of MASS COMBAT -- spears, arrows and<br>
                stones crash off shields, taking out soldiers.</p>
              <p>The ZING of arrows and WHOOSH of spears saturate the air.<br>
                Because there are no explosives EVERY SCREAM and ARROW<br>
                SHOT is HEARD.</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS</p>
              <p>leads his troops on foot in the thick of battle. A<br>
                CONTUBERNIUM walks beside Narcissus tugged on by the<br>
                leashed WOLF MASCOT as painted GERMAN WARRIORS dart out of the 
                woods hurling spears. NARCISSUS YELLS OVER THE SOUNDS OF BATTLE, 
                WIND AND RAIN.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Tribune! The right flank is falling back! If we lose the flank 
                we're<br>
                all dead!</p>
              <p>The Tribune salutes and dashes off and Servis rushes in from 
                another direction.</p>
              <p> SERVIS<br>
                Sir! There's a fortification ahead!<br>
                The Germans are waiting for us!<br>
                Should we slow the men down?</p>
              <p>AHEAD</p>
              <p>Juba leads his Numidians in a fluid, disorderly formation<br>
                into the thickest part of the forest. Just before he dodges into 
                the woods Juba locks eyes with Narcissus -- and he's GONE.</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS --</p>
              <p>jerks his shield up in time to stop an ARROW. But a<br>
                LEGIONNAIRE is SLAMMED IN THE CHEST by another as sniper- shots 
                whiz in.</p>
              <p>Now, from the distance comes the rolling roar of DRUMS and<br>
                HOWLS. Then a horrendous THUNDERCLAP and a bolt of<br>
                lightning tears the lead grey sky.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Come on, Servis! Forward!</p>
              <p>Servis turns and runs down the front line as the storm becomes 
                more intense. The YELLING and DRUMMING get<br>
                LOUDER...</p>
              <p>THE GERMAN FORTIFICATION</p>
              <p>A chaos of interlocked logs rimmed at the top with<br>
                sharpened stakes. GERMAN WARRIORS SHOUT WAVING SPEARS<br>
                AND CLUBS.</p>
              <p>THE FELIX DIVISION</p>
              <p>scatters the German snipers and rearguard before it,<br>
                closing on the fortification.</p>
              <p> TRIBUNE<br>
                Where the hell are the damned archers?</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Don't worry about Juba; just keep our own damned troops moving!</p>
              <p>German warriors loose an avalanche of rocks and spears.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Tortoise!</p>
              <p> TRIBUNE<br>
                Tortoise! Form a tortoise!</p>
              <p>As the call echoes legionnaires furiously overlap their shields 
                on all sides and overhead forming a perfect BOX<br>
                just as the stones and spears crash against them...</p>
              <p>INSIDE THE TORTOISE</p>
              <p>rocks slam the wall of interlocked shields with ear- splitting 
                resonance. But the tortoise holds.</p>
              <p>OUTSIDE</p>
              <p>soon as the barrage stops the Germans unleash FIGHTING<br>
                MASTIFFS. The dogs tear into the legionnaires. One leaps<br>
                at Narcissus and he kills it with a single chop of his Spatha 
                sword.</p>
              <p> SERVIS<br>
                Here they come!</p>
              <p>German warriors charge the shields as the legionnaires level 
                their spears. Singing and screaming the warriors<br>
                IMPALE THEMSELVES ON THE SPEARS and grasp the shafts. A<br>
                SECOND WAVE charges the line on the heels of the first.</p>
              <p>THE LEGIONNAIRES --</p>
              <p>In a well rehearsed movement twist their spears releasing the 
                tips. As the dying warriors drop with the quick- release spear 
                tips embedded in their bodies, the Romans reverse their spears 
                over the top and -- no problem:<br>
                Roman spears have points on BOTH ENDS. So the German second wave 
                is met by an intact position.</p>
              <p>Still they power into the line chopping at the Roman<br>
                shields with axes.</p>
              <p>FAR BEHIND...</p>
              <p>a legionnaire blows a piercing note on a brass horn and a second, 
                thin line of legionnaires APPEARS OUT OF THE<br>
                FOREST. Narcissus turns, yelling to a contubernium behind<br>
                him.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Answer that signal!</p>
              <p>A red 'flag' on a long pole goes up answering the trumpet, and 
                the line of the fresh cohort parts in segments revealing ONAGERS 
                -- portable catapults -- and SCORPIONS -- powerful precision-fire 
                crossbows that launch javelins.</p>
              <p>THE ARTILLERY FIRES...</p>
              <p>cannonball-size shot driven at a hundred miles an hour rip over 
                the heads of Narcissus' troopers and slam against the fort walls.</p>
              <p>ONAGER CREWS</p>
              <p>reload with incredible speed from wagons filled with hand-<br>
                picked rocks -- some bear SCRAWLED EPITHETS essentially<br>
                the Latin equivalent of &quot;EAT THIS HANS!&quot; Onagers launch<br>
                barrage after barrage, their backs leaping off the ground like 
                recoiling 45 millimeter field guns.</p>
              <p>SCORPION OPERATORS</p>
              <p>picks their targets. The Germans are leveled by a sheet of scorpion 
                javelins as their crude log fortification splinters under the 
                onager barrage. The Germans are being pulverized by superior technology.</p>
              <p>THE WHOLE GERMAN ARMY --</p>
              <p>led by tall GREY BEARDED MAN, pours from the log blockade<br>
                and hurls itself against the Roman line.</p>
              <p>Again the Romans are staggered as the Germans collapse more of 
                their shields, battering through the front line with clubs and 
                axes.</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS --</p>
              <p>fights desperately refusing to give ground. A German rears up 
                from behind and slams Narcissus in the back with a club and HE 
                GOES DOWN.</p>
              <p>Narcissus is nearly trampled as another GERMAN WARRIOR<br>
                throws himself on Narcissus holding his sword arm about to<br>
                kill him with a club -- there's a blur of fur and blood as<br>
                the ROMAN WOLF LEAPS INTO THE WARRIOR'S FACE.</p>
              <p>Narcissus lurches back to his feet and seeing he's in the<br>
                midst of the whole German army he goes wild. Yelling and<br>
                slashing out with his sword and the knife-edge top of his<br>
                shield, in seconds he's drenched with blood.</p>
              <p>LIKE SOME FANTASTIC ROMANTIC PAINTING --</p>
              <p>Narcissus climbs onto a HEAP OF BODIES flashing his sword<br>
                with the snarling Wolf of Rome at his side.</p>
              <p>CENTURIONS AND LEGIONNAIRES --</p>
              <p>see this supernatural vision of their leader battling for life 
                --</p>
              <p> SERVIS<br>
                Romulus! The gods of Rome are<br>
                fighting with general Narcissus!</p>
              <p>Others join the cry as more legionnaires turn and there's<br>
                an irresistible surge of the army back toward Narcissus.</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS</p>
              <p>joined by Servis, then another, then two Contubernium,<br>
                then ten legionnaires... the legionnaires fight desperately to 
                hold their ground around Narcissus.</p>
              <p>Then with a sound of a hundred out-of-tune violins the<br>
                Germans are SWEPT FROM BEHIND BY ARROWS.</p>
              <p>JUBA'S NUMIDIANS</p>
              <p>line the edge of the forest four deep pouring arrows into<br>
                the Germans. Juba stands on a log in front shouting<br>
                PIERCING SING-SONG ORDERS easily heard over the screams of<br>
                battle.</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS &amp; HIS TROOPS</p>
              <p>DIVE behind their shields for cover from the cloudburst of arrows.</p>
              <p>Arrows fired by almighty recurve bows hit the Germans with the 
                power of .44 magnum rounds: arms splinter like twigs; shields 
                are nailed to chests; skulls explode.</p>
              <p>The Germans turn and charge the Numidians but they may as<br>
                well hurl themselves against a machine gun nest as they're<br>
                mowed-down in whole lines. They hurtle back in disorder into the 
                forest.</p>
              <p>THE ROMANS</p>
              <p>lower their shields. Narcissus catches a fast smile from Juba, 
                then jumps to his feet...</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Come on men! Forward!</p>
              <p>RIVER BANK</p>
              <p>The retreating German army spills out of the forest following 
                their leader into a shallow narrows, Narcissus and his division 
                on their heels.</p>
              <p>ABOVE</p>
              <p>on the opposite bank is a single Roman on horse back.<br>
                It's Quintus. He draws his sword and spurs ahead -- then right 
                behind him rush his fresh ROME COHORTS.</p>
              <p>THE TWO ROMAN ARMIES --</p>
              <p>crash into the Germans in the middle of the river -- throwing 
                aside his shield and holding his sword with two hands Narcissus 
                chops his way into the enemy with a fury.</p>
              <p>Wild chaos of horrendous fighting in knee-deep water -- spray, 
                blood, flashing swords and flying spears as men desperately kill 
                to stay alive.</p>
              <p>Then the two Roman armies close like a fist and the surviving 
                Germans squeeze through the fingers in disarray.</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS &amp; QUINTUS</p>
              <p>meet in the middle of the river and at that moment the legionnaires 
                realize they've won. They howl and stab at the heavens with their 
                swords to intimidate the gods.</p>
              <p>Narcissus pulls off his lorica segmentata which literally drools 
                blood and heaves it into the water. Then in the vortex of the 
                cheering cohorts, he and Quintus embrace.</p>
              <p>FROM ABOVE</p>
              <p>The Danube runs RED...</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. ROMAN CAMP - VINDOBONA - NEAR DUSK</p>
              <p>Surrounded by cheering legions Narcissus rides his grey<br>
                horse slowly into camp. Servis walks ahead leading the beloved 
                wolf mascot on a leash. Quintus rides beside Narcissus, but it's 
                clear all this adulation is for<br>
                Narcissus.</p>
              <p>Narcissus dismounts and finally the crowd parts revealing<br>
                Commodus outside the Roman headquarters flanked by slaves<br>
                and Praetorian Guard. Commodus strides forward and embraces him 
                as a cheer goes up from the soldiers.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas. My father 
                sends his heart felt praise. Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- 
                nothing<br>
                to worry about, but he needs rest.<br>
                Likely just the weather.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Of course, but not now. However, if he continues to be unwell, 
                you may report to me.</p>

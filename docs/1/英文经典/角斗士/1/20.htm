                FALCO</p>
              <p>pushes through the senators up to the bars on one side and<br>
                starts yelling for the crowd to listen to him... but the crowd 
                roars all the more. Arena Slaves stack kindling and logs underneath 
                the brass bull. Jerses stands.</p>
              <p> JERSES<br>
                In the name of Caesar Marcus Aurelius Commodus Antoninus<br>
                Augustus, the entire Senate has been found guilty of conspiracy 
                against the emperor!</p>
              <p>Again, a mixed response from the crowd. Commodus jumps<br>
                up, throws off his robe revealing his imposing physique<br>
                and leaps onto the edge of the lowest wall on the arena.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                These Senators -- and my own sister -- have determined they should 
                rule Rome! The Empire! They better than an emperor! They better 
                than Augustus Octavian! Better than Trajan, Hadrian -- or even 
                my divine father, Marcus Aurelius! These names echo down to us 
                throughout history! Name one Senator! One Senator whose name falls 
                from the lips with the same power! I defy you to name one! And 
                as for my sister -- shall we now have women running the greatest 
                empire in the history of the world?!</p>
              <p>That brings a loud outburst of &quot;NO!&quot; and a background 
                of laughter from the mob.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Since Romans are accused of not spending enough time in the Senate, 
                I have brought the whole Senate to the people! Let's show them 
                how real Romans treat treachery! Light that fire!</p>
              <p>The Slaves heave on a bucket of lampante -- highly inflammable 
                olive oil -- and another tosses in a torch.<br>
                Flames roar up around the bull.</p>
              <p>INSIDE THE BULL</p>
              <p>... like the end of the world. Smoke whips through the openings 
                as SENATORS weep, lunge against the bars or walls and scream. 
                Lucilla kneels, crying. Falco crouches beside her and they embrace.</p>
              <p>ARENA</p>
              <p>As the fire grows Arena Slaves close hinged panels over the barred 
                openings using poles. Inside the screaming and drumming of fists 
                on hot metal reaches a crescendo.</p>
              <p>COMMODUS</p>
              <p>stands on his imperial seat watching the last great moment in 
                his final conquest of Rome.</p>
              <p>THE BRASS BULL</p>
              <p>shaking from the frenzy inside as its belly GLOWS.<br>
                SCREAMS rise to SHRIEKS and as do the shouts and howls of<br>
                delight from the crowd.</p>
              <p>Finally the cries inside become the animal screeches of<br>
                PURE PAIN -- and that sound is so DEVASTATING that the mob<br>
                involuntarily goes quiet. As the sound reaches a horrific<br>
                crescendo BLACK SMOKE SHOOTS OUT through the trumpets at<br>
                the top of the bull and THE TRUMPETS SOUND...</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. STREETS OF ROME</p>
              <p>Narcissus stops, hearing the horns and seeing the TWIN<br>
                PLUMES rising over the Colosseum. Then the ANIMAL HOWL OF<br>
                THE MOB...</p>
              <p>Narcissus continues through the narrow streets between the<br>
                high-rise 'insulae', housing the Roman underclass.<br>
                They're slums with garbage in heaps outside the buildings<br>
                rummaged by dogs.</p>
              <p>He rounds a corner and comes across CHILDREN playing<br>
                GLADIATOR among the filth. Three KIDS have made wooden<br>
                swords and a fourth the trident of the retiarius; he even<br>
                has a 'net' made from a cheap piece of cloth. Narcissus<br>
                checks them out. Then he turns back to the main street.</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. COLOSSEUM - DAY</p>
              <p>Narcissus stops yards away, sizing the situation up.<br>
                Cages of ANIMALS are delivered by a dozen MEN. A ROAR<br>
                goes up from the arena.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. COLOSSEUM ARENA</p>
              <p>Carnage. Dead gladiators and animals have been left on the sand. 
                An orchestra of DRUMS resound.</p>
              <p> JERSES<br>
                Friends and citizens, you are fortunate to live on the most<br>
                glorious day in the history of Rome! The Fatherland's greatest 
                enemies roam Hades, sent on that eternal mission by our beloved 
                emperor, the demi-god Commodus!</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. COLOSSEUM PASSAGES</p>
              <p>Narcissus sees there are plenty of armed guards at the<br>
                main entrance into the halls. He turns right into a<br>
                narrow opening that becomes an internal aqueduct. This he<br>
                climbs, then leaps down on top of a CAGE. A LION inside<br>
                leaps up at him and he jumps to the top of the next cage<br>
                which holds a panther -- and another holding a POLAR BEAR.</p>
              <p>Narcissus pauses to look down at the magnificent, pacing<br>
                white animal; clearly never seen anything like it in his<br>
                life. Then another cage RISES up on an elevator blocking<br>
                his way. Narcissus almost does a double-take... Inside<br>
                are CHIMPANZEES dressed as ROMAN SENATORS. He leaps down<br>
                into a narrow passage.</p>
              <p>ARENA</p>
              <p>Jerses continues.</p>
              <p> JERSES<br>
                To show his benevolence and his good standing with all the Gods, 
                Emperor Commodus has negotiated a bargain with Hades himself! 
                The Senators so lately late of Rome are to be returned to us on 
                condition they do so in a form which will vex us no more!</p>
              <p>THE CAGE DOOR...</p>
              <p>slides open and the Chimps rush out into the arena. When the 
                audience sees them they crack-up.</p>
              <p> JERSES<br>
                Go! Scurry on! Take your places in the Senate! You have much work 
                to do -- for this day the City of Rome is proclaimed renamed the 
                City of Commodus!</p>
              <p>The chimps exit, trumpets blow and Arena Slaves run out<br>
                onto the sand still strewn with dead animals and<br>
                gladiators. As the crowd 'OOS' and 'AHS' they cover the<br>
                floor of the arena with GOLD DUST until the arena dead<br>
                seem SCULPTURED IN GOLD.</p>
              <p>Drums roll and Commodus enters the arena. He stands in<br>
                the golden arena and receives wave after wave of applause<br>
                from the crowd.</p>
              <p>BUTCHER SHOP</p>
              <p>As the FAT BUTCHER raises his huge cleaver a LIVING ARM<br>
                reaches out of the carnage and GRABS HIS THROAT.<br>
                Narcissus shoves a body aside and HEAVES the Fat Butcher<br>
                over the edge into the lion's cage -- his SCREAMS are<br>
                drowned out by the CHEERS from the arena. Narcissus leaps<br>
                onto the floor; he heads down toward the main entrance<br>
                hall.</p>
              <p>COMMODUS</p>
              <p>faces a Thracian -- a man with a round shield and a curved<br>
                dagger. Commodus easily chops the shield out of the<br>
                inexperienced man's hand, knocks the man over, straddles<br>
                him, holds a sword point over the man's heart. He looks<br>
                up to the crowd. The upscale seats jab their thumbs<br>
                against their chests... Commodus raises his sword...</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I want you!</p>
              <p>Commodus spins on his heels as the entire arena goes<br>
                SILENT.</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS</p>
              <p>stands on the arena floor. He yanks off his cloak and the<br>
                crowd sees he's wearing his old GENERAL'S UNIFORM. The<br>
                Thracian runs off...</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I accuse you, Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus of betraying Rome; 
                of betraying her courageous soldiers for the sake of personal 
                gain! I<br>
                accuse you of murder: of the Senators of Rome, of untold<br>
                citizens, of your sister and of poisoning your own father, our<br>
                beloved Marcus Aurelius!<br>
                (Narcissus draws his<br>
                sword)<br>
                The punishment is death in the arena...</p>
              <p>Commodus stares at this apparition. He turns up toward<br>
                the Imperial box where Quintus is about to come to his<br>
                rescue when VOICES shout:</p>
              <p> CHEAP SEATS<br>
                Let them fight! Narcissus!<br>
                Narcissus!</p>
              <p>People in the upscale seats shout for Commodus. And at<br>
                that moment Commodus holds up his hand stopping Quintus;<br>
                can tell by the look on his face he is sick of Narcissus<br>
                once again throwing his absolute ascendancy up for grabs.</p>
              <p>When the audience sees he's going to fight a universal<br>
                cheer goes up. But he holds up his hand and Quintus<br>
                tosses down his gilt bow and arrows.</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS</p>
              <p>moves toward Commodus, a gentle wind stirs his hair and<br>
                once again he's the noble Roman General -- all around is<br>
                the surreal gold dust coated nightmare of bodies in<br>
                hideous death poses, a golden 'Guernica'.</p>
              <p>Narcissus goes straight for him as Commodus hurriedly<br>
                cocks an arrow... Just as Narcissus is nearly within sword<br>
                range Commodus hastily fires -- he hits Narcissus, but<br>
                rushed his aim and the arrow sinks into his left shoulder.</p>
              <p>Narcissus staggers -- cheers and cries of dismay rise<br>
                together from the audience. But Narcissus manages to<br>
                strike out splitting the bow... still it's plain he's<br>
                badly hit. He staggers sideways.</p>
              <p>Now Commodus is sure he's got him and holds his hand up<br>
                stopping Quintus who again moves to enter the arena.<br>
                Commodus draws his sword... Narcissus responds by BREAKING<br>
                OFF THE ARROW IN HIS SHOULDER and going right for<br>
                Commodus.</p>
              <p>THE TWO BATTLE IN THE CENTER OF THE ARENA --</p>
              <p>Wounded, Narcissus is slowly backed up. The crowd is on<br>
                edge -- cheap seats solidly on Narcissus' side, their<br>
                enthusiasm unnerves Quintus. He moves Praetorian Guard to<br>
                flank the seats of the rich.</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS</p>
              <p>is getting the worst of it, his shoulder bleeds through<br>
                his armor. Commodus gets stronger, anticipating finally<br>
                killing his enemy with his own hands. Commodus slams the<br>
                sword out of Narcissus' hand and Narcissus GOES DOWN...</p>
              <p>Behind Commodus the crowd is going truly NUTS -- but he<br>
                just doesn't care: he raises his sword to let the world<br>
                know he's about to strike the fatal blow when Narcissus<br>
                TACKLES him at the waist.</p>
              <p>Commodus GOES DOWN -- sword flying away -- and Narcissus<br>
                is on him, the two roll in the gore and gold dust and<br>
                Narcissus gets Commodus on his back and starts strangling<br>
                him with his one good arm.</p>
              <p>The cheap seats GO CRAZY -- Quintus struggles to pull<br>
                together a force to get into the arena but people rush<br>
                into the arena blocking the troops...</p>
              <p>AND NARCISSUS --</p>
              <p>crushing Commodus down into the golden sand of the<br>
                Colosseum. He speaks with serenity and power.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                God, Janus, for saving my family I<br>
                sacrifice the emperor of Rome...</p>
              <p>He crushes Commodus' throat with his bare hands. Quintus<br>
                stands over him as the rest of the guard battles the<br>
                crowd. Quintus raises his sword and slams it down...<br>
                beside Narcissus in the SAND.</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. MERCHANT SHIP - OFF THE COAST OF AFRICA - DAY</p>
              <p>Narcissus with Selene, his arms around Themis and Manto on<br>
                deck watching the coast approach.</p>
              <p> THE END</p>
              <p><br>
                After Commodus' death the Praetorian Guard auctioned off<br>
                the position of Roman Emperor to the highest bidder. In<br>
                response the Army of the Danube marched on Rome, killed<br>
                the new 'Emperor' and tried to establish a strong<br>
                government... but the empire slipped into civil war.</p>
              <p>The Colosseum and its slaughter of animals and gladiators<br>
                continued -- even through two hundred years of Popes --<br>
                until German 'barbarians' toppled Rome and put an end to<br>
                the circus.</p>
              <p></p>

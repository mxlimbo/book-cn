                INT. COLOSSEUM ARENA - DAY/MONTAGE:</p>
              <p>Narcissus circles a 'THRACIAN' GLADIATOR: small round<br>
                shields with a curved scythe-like sword. The Thracian whips the 
                sword overhead in a circle with enormous agility... Narcissus 
                watches and then circles in the opposite direction. In a flash 
                he races at the<br>
                Thracian...</p>
              <p>NEW ANGLE</p>
              <p>That scythe-sword spinning off into the ether.</p>
              <p>THE THRACIAN...</p>
              <p>Dead in the sand as Narcissus walks away paying no<br>
                attention to the cheering crowd and getting some BOOS as a<br>
                result.</p>
              <p>COLOSSEUM ARENA - ANOTHER DAY</p>
              <p>On a 'COLOSSUS OF RHODES' design on a shield showing an<br>
                image of the legendary copper giant.</p>
              <p>A RHODIAN faces Narcissus. He wears a shiny lorica<br>
                segmentata designed from copper, armed with a splay-edged<br>
                sword. Narcissus approaches him, this time carrying his<br>
                small shield. The Rhodian slashes at him and Narcissus<br>
                deflects the blow with his shield. As the crowd HOWLS<br>
                they crash together...</p>
              <p>THE COPPER SHIELD...</p>
              <p>sticking on the edge in the sand, the giant -- feet up...<br>
                beside the body of the Rhodian. Narcissus again strides<br>
                away, victorious.</p>
              <p>COLOSSEUM ARENA - ANOTHER DAY</p>
              <p>A MYRMIDON gladiator in black leather... 'Antenna' poke<br>
                from his leather helmet, and a symbol of an ant of his shield 
                -- rears backward as Narcissus fells him with a powerful blow...</p>
              <p>COLOSSEUM ARENA - ANOTHER DAY</p>
              <p>A MIRMILLONES -- a gladiator with scale-like armor and a fish-shield 
                -- tumbles dead in the sand...</p>
              <p>AND THE CROWD...</p>
              <p>Cheering, stamping their feet.</p>
              <p>AND NARCISSUS</p>
              <p>Once again striding off the sand. But this time he stops, turns 
                and looks back at the crowd.</p>
              <p>HIS POV</p>
              <p>The uninhibited proletariat in the upper seats howl.<br>
                Their area is littered with trash and a few women even NURSE BABIES.</p>
              <p>THE FRONT SEATS</p>
              <p>Some slaves of the upper-class 'fans' smack long WOODEN<br>
                HANDS(2) together overhead as their MASTERS recline in<br>
                luxurious padded seats. Others -- equally wealthy -- leap up cheering 
                and one even grabs the 'souvenir hands' away from his slave and 
                whacks them together himself.</p>
              <p>AND NARCISSUS...</p>
              <p>Taking this all in, his eyes shift to:</p>
              <p>THE IMPERIAL BOX</p>
              <p>Empty... the relief marble Wolf of Rome glares in the burning 
                sun.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. ARENA - ANOTHER DAY</p>
              <p>Narcissus, armed with just his sword, faces a LAQUEARIUS,<br>
                a 'lasso man'. Shirtless, but wearing leather fringed pants he 
                whirls a rope overhead like Hopalong-fucking- Cassidy. Narcissus 
                circles.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Surrender, or I'll kill you!</p>
              <p> VOICE<br>
                Go ahead and kill him!</p>
              <p>Laughter... but as Narcissus circles he stumbles.</p>
              <p>PROXIMO</p>
              <p>watches from the 'trenches'. He turns to Adonis.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                He's drunk... he's going to die this time.</p>
              <p>ARENA</p>
              <p>The Laquearius almost magically spins his rope so the loop<br>
                straightens and he snaps Narcissus' cheek with it like a whip. 
                The crowd loves it. Narcissus grabs his cheek, puzzled by what's 
                happening.</p>
              <p>For a second he seems to clear his head, but now the crowd<br>
                is into the thrill of the hunt. When the Laquearius turns to close 
                the distance -- in a flash that whirling rope is back defining 
                the limit of Narcissus' approach.<br>
                Humiliated and just not thinking straight he makes a sudden rush 
                -- and Laquearius lassos him...</p>
              <p>Narcissus tries to pull his arms loose but the Laquearius yanks 
                the noose so tight Narcissus' arms are frozen with his sword against 
                his body.</p>
              <p>Now the Laquearius plays to the crowd -- he yanks Narcissus to 
                his knees and dances around him, winding himself closer as the 
                rope twists around Narcissus. Then he kneels behind Narcissus, 
                pulls his head back by his hair and puts the knife against his 
                throat... he look up to the crowd.</p>
              <p>THE MOB...</p>
              <p>Shouting, stamping, all plunging their thumbs down against their 
                chests.</p>
              <p>PROXIMO</p>
              <p>turns away. He sits on Narcissus' rock beside Dala. He just can't 
                watch.</p>
              <p>LAQUEARIUS</p>
              <p>smiles for the fans -- but Narcissus sees that exposed wrist 
                and sinks his teeth into the man's artery -- Laquearius rips his 
                arm loose and blood spews like a broken garden hose.</p>
              <p>Laquearius grabs his wrist and drops his sword -- Narcissus kicks 
                him, flips him and pins him with his knees. He gets hold of the 
                sword, jams the blade under the ropes and slices himself free. 
                In a flash he turns the sword and drives it into the Laquearius' 
                chest.</p>
              <p>He stands, catches his breath -- the crowd cheers.<br>
                Narcissus turns face smeared with blood, watches them yell<br>
                and gesture at him. He looks like an ANIMAL...</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. 'TRENCHES'</p>
              <p>The gladiators silently watch Narcissus as he comes in from the 
                arena and crosses to a stone cistern to splash cold water on his 
                face and hair. Proximo gingerly approaches. The CHEERS now include 
                more calls for &quot;Narcissus.&quot; Proximo snaps his fingers 
                -- a slave brings<br>
                Narcissus wine.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                That was one of the most impressive feats I've ever seen. You 
                hear them calling your name?<br>
                (Narcissus drinks)<br>
                You scorn them. But, they admire you. When Emperor Trajan had 
                his<br>
                victory over five thousand gladiators fought to the death --<br>
                out there. So, they know a good fight. As a soldier you must have<br>
                fought very well for Rome.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. GLADIATOR WAGON - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
              <p>Silence, all the gladiators focused on Narcissus who<br>
                couches in the corner, face on his folded arms as if he<br>
                were asleep. As usual the kids chase the wagon, taunting.<br>
                Suddenly Bad Teeth shoots his hand through the bars and<br>
                snags the little Blonde Kid by the throat. The kid gags,<br>
                dragging as his friends try to pull him loose.</p>
              <p>Bad Teeth just grins his grin and hangs on -- strangling.<br>
                Out of nowhere Narcissus grabs Bad Teeth's arm -- they<br>
                look each other in the eye and Bad Teeth drops the kid in<br>
                the dirt.</p>
              <p> BAD TEETH<br>
                Narcissus The Good!</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. GLADIATOR AREA - THE 'TRENCHES'...</p>
              <p>As Narcissus, Bad Teeth, Vednas, Adonis, Crassus, Dala and<br>
                others enter, Proximo follows in the wake of an Arena<br>
                Slave who's handing out bread and wine. A few VOICES call<br>
                Narcissus by name...</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                You hear, General? Some people remember you. You're a surly<br>
                bastard and still they like you.</p>
              <p>An ARENA SLAVE hands Crassus a long spear and he enters<br>
                the arena -- CHEERS of the mob welcome him.</p>
              <p>Narcissus turns toward a horrendous clank of CHAINS: two<br>
                arena SLAVES race in opposite directions down a long hall<br>
                yanking chains that lift a cage to ground level.</p>
              <p>ARENA</p>
              <p>Crassus faces a scenery facade that's shaped like a STONE<br>
                CAVE. A TIGER rushes from the cave.</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS</p>
              <p>sits on a stone block beside the other gladiators.</p>
              <p> DALA<br>
                Bad luck! A tiger. Someone important must be betting against<br>
                Crassus...</p>
              <p>A LIGHT FEMALE VOICE calls Narcissus' name. The sound is<br>
                so strange that at first Narcissus doesn't respond. Then he sees 
                the FOUR WHORES at a barred window. The Cute Whore wearing a wig 
                with spring-like curled hair waves Narcissus over. Fascinated, 
                he crosses to the bars.</p>
              <p> CUTE WHORE<br>
                Narcissus The Good! Can you afford me today?</p>
              <p>Narcissus turns away toward a SHOUT from the arena.</p>
              <p>ARENA</p>
              <p>Within twenty feet the tiger crouches to spring. Crassus<br>
                SHAKES HIS LONG HAIR and the TINY BELLS FLASH AND TINKLE.<br>
                Baffled by the glinting bells, the tiger stands out of his crouch.</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS</p>
              <p>turns back to the Whore. She smiles.</p>
              <p> CUTE WHORE<br>
                Pay the guard something. They'll let me in and we can do it here.</p>
              <p>Narcissus seems confused and maybe he would except:</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I... have no money.</p>
              <p> ANOTHER WHORE<br>
                She's in love with you! She'll do you for free!</p>
              <p>The Whores break into laughter. Then the Cute Whore gestures 
                Narcissus to the bars like she wanted to whisper and when he gets 
                close she kisses his cheek -- they break off laughing again and 
                suddenly GUARDS outside shoo them away... Proximo puts a hand 
                on Narcissus' shoulder.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                The Emperor is here. He's come here himself to distribute bread 
                to the<br>
                people!</p>
              <p>It takes Narcissus a second, then he slowly rises and looks through 
                the bars.</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. IMPERIAL BOX</p>
              <p>Six Praetorian Guard flank the Imperial seat. The crowd<br>
                shouts as the tiger CHARGES -- Crassus DROPS and the SUN<br>
                CRASHES INTO THE TIGER'S EYES...</p>
              <p>Crassus angles the spear to catch the blinded tiger straight 
                in the chest. He flips the impaled cat onto its back and LEANS 
                on the spear. The tiger tears out with a paw and SINKS ITS CLAWS 
                INTO CRASSUS' SHOULDER, pulling him down.</p>
              <p> DALA<br>
                Watch out for the back claws!</p>
              <p>Crassus is pulled down as the tiger's thrashing rear legs tearing 
                into Crassus' gut. Crassus falls on the cat with his huge hands 
                around its throat. Face-to-face, their foreheads touching -- the 
                tiger, fangs bared, Crassus grimacing -- they die.</p>
              <p>IN THE BEST SEATS</p>
              <p>A bleak looking PROCONSUL hands a fistful of GOLD to a<br>
                self-important MERCHANT who makes a big show of winning<br>
                his bet.</p>
              <p>ALL THE GLADIATORS</p>
              <p>stand, watching. Bad Teeth is the first to sit. Proximo<br>
                waves a pair of slaves out.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Shit! Get his body! Damn! Damn them all!</p>
              <p>Then, with a RUMBLING FANFARE of DRUMS and staccato horns<br>
                Commodus makes a grand entrance. Lucilla, Tribuus and<br>
                Falco are at the forefront of an entourage which includes<br>
                all manner of wealthy hangers-on.</p>
              <p> JERSES (O.S.)<br>
                After an absence of nearly an entire generation...</p>
              <p>JERSES</p>
              <p>stands on Commodus' left side.</p>
              <p> JERSES<br>
                ... great Caesar, Emperor of all Rome has returned to our beloved<br>
                Colosseum!</p>
              <p>Commodus stands receiving the unbelievable howls and cheers of 
                the crowd. Even he is amazed by the reception and stands grinning 
                and waving. Commodus finally turns, nods to Jerses and sits. More 
                drum and horn effects and then silence.</p>
              <p> JERSES<br>
                In his boundless wisdom, and with the generosity of the gods, 
                Caesar<br>
                Marcus Aurelius Commodus Antoninus Augustus...</p>
              <p>GLADIATORS</p>
              <p>By now all watch the display. With every second Narcissus' interest 
                grows. Crassus body is brought in and the others crowd around. 
                Even Proximo steps up to put a hand on him.</p>
              <p> JERSES (O.S.)<br>
                ... in keeping his sworn trust to<br>
                Rome's Citizens...</p>
              <p>ARENA</p>
              <p>Jerses reaching an apoplexy of passion.</p>
              <p> JERSES<br>
                ... will distribute as much grain or bread as each man, woman 
                or child<br>
                present here may carry!</p>
              <p>The crowd goes wild. Commodus rises and the crowd begins<br>
                a football-like chant of CAESAR-CAESAR-CAESAR... He holds<br>
                up his arms welcoming the adulation. Commodus is almost<br>
                physically effected by the cheers the power and psychological 
                rush is so tremendous. </p>

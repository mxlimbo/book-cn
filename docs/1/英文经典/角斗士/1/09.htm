                A set of tall doors are pulled back by pairs of slaves and<br>
                ANIMALS RUSH INTO THE ARENA. WILDEBEESTS -- HYENAS --<br>
                ANTELOPE -- ZEBRAS -- WILD ASSES -- BEARS -- JACKALS --<br>
                even a LONE HIPPO... blunder off the smooth marble walls in terrified 
                confusion. Commodus seems physically struck.</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                The money was set aside for your father's triumph. The people 
                expect it.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Gods of hell! This must cost a fortune! How many days is this<br>
                going to go on?</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                Until your confirmation date.</p>
              <p>Commodus looks back out on the arena where every animal must 
                look like a heap of cash.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                A month! The treasury is bleeding... and these pigs expect me<br>
                to sponsor their amusement while they boo me?</p>
              <p>Commodus turns and his entourage follows him out.</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS</p>
              <p>moves closer to the opening, trying to see through the dust and 
                animals but gets shoved back. The other gladiators sit on stones, 
                backs to the action. There's an 'imminent feeling' like soldiers 
                gathered in a trench before battle. Narcissus turns back to the 
                arena.</p>
              <p>MOUNTED HUNTERS --</p>
              <p>Carrying javelins charge into the arena.</p>
              <p>And while they corner animals and impale them a LONE MAN<br>
                -- a 'Colosseum Clown' rushes across the sands with a furious 
                BEAR hot on his heels.</p>
              <p>The Colosseum Clown reaches the far end of the arena and 'runs' 
                up the slick marble side using his momentum. As the bear lunges 
                for him he flips off the wall, over the bear and starts running 
                the other way. The crowd goes wild for it.</p>
              <p>LOWER CELLS/THE HOLE...</p>
              <p>ABSOLUTE BLACKNESS. A solid door pulls back and faint<br>
                light reveals Juba collapsed in the filth of the cave-like cell. 
                Drenched with perspiration he gasps in the 'fresh' air and like 
                the other prisoners looks nearly asphyxiated.<br>
                Arena Slaves poke torches at them.</p>
              <p> ARENA SLAVE<br>
                Come on! Time to meet Pluto!</p>
              <p>GLADIATOR AREA</p>
              <p>As Dala jabbers on, the PRISONERS are rushed up from the<br>
                depths of the Colosseum.</p>
              <p> DALA<br>
                I usually fight women gladiators or other dwarfs. Sometimes I 
                ride into battle on an ostrich. Women are ruthless! Ostriches 
                can break your arm with a single kick!</p>
              <p>Narcissus is yanked to his feet by armed slaves and chained to 
                the German Warrior who bears the same blue paint smear as he. 
                They study one another, brothers in pain. Narcissus searches the 
                faces and sees Juba is one of the last men being pulled out of 
                the 'hole' by a chain. Bad Teeth looks up:</p>
              <p> BAD TEETH<br>
                They're going to bet on you:<br>
                whoever dies last wins! So long<br>
                general...</p>
              <p>AT THE DOOR</p>
              <p>The prisoners are lined up as the last of the dead animals<br>
                are dragged off. A slave dumps short gladius swords from<br>
                a sack, the prisoners scramble to arm themselves. At the<br>
                last second Proximo shoves through and grabs hold of<br>
                Narcissus' arm.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Legate Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish Felix Legions! 
                I'm<br>
                proud to have you in my school!<br>
                (picks up a sword)<br>
                Now, show them what you can do!</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I'm not a gladiator. I refuse to fight.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Then, you'll die...<br>
                (off his silence)<br>
                Just, know this: because you asked<br>
                I asked: I'm sorry but...</p>
              <p>A HORN BLOWS and the Colosseum Slaves herd the prisoners<br>
                out in a rush.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                ... the emperor has executed your family!</p>
              <p>Narcissus is YANKED ahead.</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. ARENA</p>
              <p>Narcissus is so staggered by this news he seems barely able to 
                walk.</p>
              <p> JUBA<br>
                Narcissus! A sword! Get a sword!</p>
              <p>As the prisoners are double-timed around the arena spectators 
                rise like a Dodger Wave, shouting and pointing out pairs -- money 
                swaps hands. Arena Slaves circle quickly with rakes smoothing 
                the sand over the animal blood.</p>
              <p> JERSES<br>
                Citizens! Make your final wagers!</p>
              <p>Jerses unrolls a scroll. As he speaks ARCHERS line up<br>
                against the wall directly beneath Jerses facing the prisoners.</p>
              <p> JERSES<br>
                Prisoners, you have been found guilty of offenses against the<br>
                Fatherland: In the name of Caesar Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus 
                and the Senate of Rome, you have been condemned to the arena, 
                beneath the beneath. Fight well -- live long!</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS</p>
              <p>barely has time to absorb this when the archers take aim.<br>
                PANICKED prisoners trip over their own chains, colliding<br>
                with each other.</p>
              <p>The German crosses in front of Narcissus and is hit square<br>
                in the chest with an arrow. Instinctively Narcissus tries<br>
                to help the German but the man slides out of his arms and<br>
                crumples dead in the sand. Narcissus looks UP as the<br>
                crowd cheers...</p>
              <p>ANDABATAE ENTER...</p>
              <p>They're gladiators with faces hidden by helmets; carrying<br>
                THRUSTING SPEARS they look like EXECUTIONER ROBOTS.</p>
              <p>Narcissus sees that one man of each chained-together pair<br>
                has been killed and then that Juba is still alive. Each<br>
                Andabatus squares off with a surviving prisoner.</p>
              <p> JUBA<br>
                Narcissus -- fight! Fight!</p>
              <p>The crowd ROARS as the Andabatae attack. The 'joke' is<br>
                Narcissus -- like the other prisoners -- has to drag a dead man 
                around while fighting for his life.</p>
              <p>Narcissus dodges the first blow but the movement yanks his<br>
                chain taunt and he falls -- barely rolls clear of the next<br>
                blow. Spectators CHEER and LAUGH; the Andabatus circles<br>
                keeping Narcissus stretched to the limit of his chain.</p>
              <p>Juba lurches, nicks the Andabatus and has time to grab the<br>
                sword of the dead Blonde German.</p>
              <p> JUBA<br>
                General!</p>
              <p>Juba heaves the sword toward Narcissus, turns to parry<br>
                away the Andabatus. The crowd HOWLS...</p>
              <p>Narcissus sees the sword is within grabbing range but he<br>
                still won't go for it. Then the crowd SHOUTS...</p>
              <p>JUBA GOES DOWN...</p>
              <p>The Andabatus straddles the badly wounded man, salutes the<br>
                audience and kills him. Narcissus now sees he's the last<br>
                prisoner left alive.</p>
              <p>Narcissus' Andabatus lunges and as Narcissus quickly pulls<br>
                out of range he falls forward foot coiled in the chain.<br>
                Now it looks like it's all over -- the crowd goes wild<br>
                with expectation.</p>
              <p>The Andabatus raises his weapon over Narcissus as<br>
                spectators poke their chest with their thumbs to symbolize<br>
                they want Narcissus killed. He looks to Jerses for<br>
                orders.</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS</p>
              <p>sees Juba dead, his blood in the sand. And suddenly<br>
                something happens to him -- with every once of energy<br>
                left, Narcissus grabs the sword, and CHOPS through the<br>
                ACHILLES TENDON of the Andabatus' left leg. The Andabatus<br>
                DROPS as Narcissus lunges out with the sword and the man<br>
                FALLS on the blade.</p>
              <p>It's over. Narcissus rolls on his side to face up at<br>
                Jerses who still stands about to give the death command --<br>
                his mouth DROPS.</p>
              <p>AND PROXIMO</p>
              <p>got those Don King Eyes... Adonis and Dala come forward.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Did you see that?! Did you see?! I knew he was a fighter! A real<br>
                fighter!</p>
              <p>THE AUDIENCE --</p>
              <p>GOES WILD. Especially those in the cheap seats.<br>
                Narcissus stands with the chain to the dead German in his<br>
                hand. Then he looks over to where Juba has fallen in the<br>
                sand. A man dressed in A COSTUME OF BLACK SCALES and a<br>
                monster head walks to each prisoner administering a coup<br>
                de grace by clubbing them with a big HAMMER. He's<br>
                'PLUTO'.</p>
              <p>Narcissus drags the chain with the body of the German<br>
                behind him until he reaches Juba's side. Pluto sees<br>
                Narcissus protecting Juba's body and decides to take a<br>
                'pass'.</p>
              <p>Finally, exhausted, Narcissus drops to his knees on the<br>
                burning sand. Lowering his head as cheers of the crowd<br>
                surround him...</p>
              <p>IMPERIAL ENTRANCE - COLOSSEUM</p>
              <p>At ground level at the dead end of a long hall Lucilla<br>
                watches through an ornate stone grate. Of course, she's<br>
                seen everything.</p>
              <p> TRIBUUS<br>
                Lady, are you coming?</p>
              <p>She's startled to find Tribuus has come looking for her.<br>
                She nods, shoves past and he follows her down the hall<br>
                without a single backward glance.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. IMPERIAL 'CHAIR' - LATER AFTERNOON</p>
              <p>Commodus and Lucilla ride along in silence, Praetorian<br>
                Guard walking ahead to part the crowd. As they pass the<br>
                Senate, Commodus points to a clutch of CITIZENS gathered<br>
                on the steps.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                They're talking about me.</p>
              <p>Lucilla gives him the hard stare. But then all the citizens turn 
                to watch the Imperial Chair pass.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                They hate me, they really hate me don't they?</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                Maybe you should get married. Pick one of your cousins, it would<br>
                demonstrate a profound stability.</p>
              <p>Commodus puts his hand on her leg.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                What about you?</p>
              <p>They just stare at each other. As he talks he continues to feel 
                under her toga to her hip. She tries to remain<br>
                amused.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                I should at least have you, don't<br>
                you think?</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir 
                and<br>
                will end up killing you for the throne.</p>
              <p>He freezes -- absolutely turned off -- and takes away his hand.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Did Narcissus die today? Wasn't this his day to die?</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                I'm sure, I don't know.</p>
              <p>Finally he removes his hand and leans out the opening to Tribuus 
                who rides alongside.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Tribuus, what happened in the arena?<br>
                Was Narcissus killed?</p>
              <p> TRIBUUS<br>
                He must have been. He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                No one in Rome has ever heard of him. Do you want to remind those<br>
                few in the Senate who have? The whole sordid thing is far beneath<br>
                your position to begin with. Forget about him.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing 
                it<br>
                comes from me.</p>
              <p> TRIBUUS<br>
                Leave it to me, Caesar.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. NARCISSUS' CELL - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
              <p>Narcissus has drunk himself unconscious and lies face down<br>
                on the table. The door swings open and Proximo enters with an 
                armed guard and COS, a handsome young man who looks like a student. 
                As the light sweeps in through the open door Narcissus blinks 
                awake.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish VII, famed Felix Legions.<br>
                I'm proud to have you in my school!</p>
              <p>Narcissus staggers to his feet and crosses to the rear window. 
                He leans against the bars and gulps cool air.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                General, do you realize what happened out there today?</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I didn't get killed and everyone else did.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                That's one way to look at it.</p>
              <p> COS<br>
                You won an impossible fight. You got the attention of the crowd,<br>
                legate...</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                This is Cos, this precocious young man. A scribe for the Daily<br>
                Action.(1) I've invited him to write a small piece about you...</p>
              <p> COS<br>
                I'm mentioning you in tomorrow's athlete's section, legate. So, 
                I'd<br>
                love to know your birth sign; it effects how people bet. And perhaps<br>
                you could tell me a bit about... well, who are you?</p>
              <p>Narcissus looks from one to the other then back to his view of 
                Rome which looks like lead in shadows.</p>

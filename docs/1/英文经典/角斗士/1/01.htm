              <p>FADE IN:</p>
              <p>EXT. NEAR THE GERMAN FRONT - 180 A.D. - DAWN</p>
              <p>The rising sun unveils steep hills and luxuriant mountains untouched 
                by man. Snow flurries dart in the frigid air and on the horizon 
                ROWS gather.</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. DIRT ROAD</p>
              <p>A column of Praetorian Cavalry flank two enclosed wagons as they 
                rattle along a rock and log accordion road. On all sides a forest 
                rises like some kind of primordial soul: limitless and dark. With 
                every step 'steam' whooshes from the nostrils of the horses.</p>
              <p>The first wagon halts as a Praetorian Guard jogs back. He straightens 
                his tunic and helmet and raps on the wooden door as the second 
                wagon stops behind. The door swings aside and another Praetorian 
                Guard leans out.</p>
              <p> 1ST PRAETORIAN GUARD<br>
                Sir, we must be getting near.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. FIRST WAGON</p>
              <p>LUCIUS AELIUS AURELIUS COMMODUS huddles in the back of the wagon: 
                Dark hair, handsome, beard; as Commodus rises we see he's a large, 
                powerfully built young man and though barely twenty years old 
                he already has the caution and arrogance of a Caesar.</p>
              <p>Opposite A GAUNT MAN climbs from a heap of blankets:<br>
                GALEN of PERGAMUM, probably the most frozen, unhappy man<br>
                on earth. The wagon is lined with pillows and blankets.<br>
                Baskets of bread and dried fruit are stacked in one corner and 
                an oil lamp hangs from a pivoting cleat like the swinging lamp 
                in a ship.</p>
              <p> 2ND PRAETORIAN GUARD<br>
                Caesar, we're nearly there.</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. WAGON</p>
              <p>Commodus steps down and pulls his cape up against the bitter 
                cold. Galen follows, curiously overcoming his natural hatred of 
                discomfort. TRIBUUS, burly Praetorian Guard commander salutes 
                Commodus and leads him to the edge of a gully. Tribuus is an old-timer 
                for whom Commodus is just another royal pain-in-the-ass.</p>
              <p>THE GULLY IS BLACK WITH CROWS -- with their endless CAW- CAW-CAW&quot; 
                they feast on corpses and in the shadows below ROMAN SOLDIERS 
                bury dead comrades. Compared with the burnished perfection of 
                the Praetorian Guards these typical infantry grunts are grizzled 
                and battered.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Soldier! What happened here!</p>
              <p>A legionnaire stops working, spits, leans on his shovel so he 
                can shout up toward Tribuus and Commodus. Galen squats beside 
                a corpse, fascinated.</p>
              <p> LEGIONNAIRE<br>
                We had a battle!</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                I can see that. You leave your dead on the field?</p>
              <p> LEGIONNAIRE<br>
                General Narcissus beat the Germans here and now the whole army 
                is<br>
                moving fast! No time to let them get away!</p>
              <p>THE SECOND WAGON --</p>
              <p>as a twenty-five year old ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN opens the door. 
                She is LUCILLA -- Commodus' sister. Lucilla pulls<br>
                her coat tight against the wind.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                Where are we now, Commodus? Can you see the camp? My Gods! The 
                air is turning into ice!</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                We're nearly there, Lucilla.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                That's what you told me two days ago!</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Will you please get back in your wagon? And stay there?</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                I'm tired of being stuck in that wagon.</p>
              <p>Embarrassed by Commodus' childish spat with is sister,<br>
                Tribuus gestures to the 2nd Praetorian.</p>
              <p> TRIBUUS<br>
                Soldier, help the Emperor's sister.</p>
              <p>As a soldier jogs back up toward Lucilla Commodus looks down 
                at the legionnaire leaning on his shovel.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Where is my father?</p>
              <p> TRIBUUS<br>
                Where is the emperor and the army,<br>
                soldier?</p>
              <p>The legionnaire points up the road. Commodus and Tribuus<br>
                return to the wagon. Galen rolls the dead soldier over and sticks 
                his finger into a gaping chest wound, then notices the legionnaire 
                glaring at him.</p>
              <p> GALEN<br>
                I'm a doctor.</p>
              <p>The legionnaire studies him a second, then the corpse as if giving 
                a second opinion.</p>
              <p> LEGIONNAIRE<br>
                Well, you're too late.</p>
              <p>Galen pulls back in revulsion at his impudence. He scrambles 
                to follow Commodus. The legionnaire spits and gets back to work.</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAWN</p>
              <p>The wagon crests a hill with a precipitous view of the valley 
                and torches that seem to fill the lingering dark far below. The 
                wagon makes straight for them.</p>
              <p>AND COMMODUS...</p>
              <p>Riding on a seat on the front of the wagon, wrapped to his chin 
                in a bearskin blanket -- absolutely set on catching up with the 
                army.</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. GERMAN FRONT - VINDOBONA - 182 A.D. - NIGHT</p>
              <p>On the edge of a forest sixty year old EMPEROR MARCUS<br>
                AURELIUS stands in the back of an unharnessed supply wagon<br>
                surrounded by a dark so black it's barely moved by blazing<br>
                torches.</p>
              <p>A WOLF -- living symbol of Rome -- stand before the wagon<br>
                held on a leash by a battle-hardened SENIOR CENTURION:<br>
                SERVIS.</p>
              <p>Marcus wears the purple robe of imperial power over his<br>
                leather and copper segmented upper body armor (LORICA<br>
                SEGMENTATA). His breath clouds in the bitter cold; the man is 
                tired to the bone.</p>
              <p>OPPOSITE STANDS THE ROMAN ARMY</p>
              <p>This is the mighty army of the Danube, yet it seems like these 
                men -- buried in the shadows and as frozen and worn as their leader 
                -- have come to the very edge of the world to be swallowed by 
                this wilderness.</p>
              <p>NUMIDIAN ARCHERS, tall Africans, out of place in this freezing 
                land, stand behind their leader -- JUBA -- who has the whip-like 
                body of a dancer. Each carries his recurve bow as if it were a 
                delicate musical instrument.<br>
                Quivers of brightly colored arrows hang from their backs.</p>
              <p>Field commanders -- CONTUBERNIUM -- stand by each row of<br>
                soldiers. Less numerous, and above the Contubernium, are the CENTURIONS, 
                and at the front line of the mass of cohorts are four TRIBUNES.</p>
              <p>BEFORE THE ENTIRE ARMY</p>
              <p>mounted on magnificent grey horses, are two LEGATE, the overall 
                commanding generals, wearing ornate lorica segmentata. The first 
                Legatus is QUINTUS CLARUS, Rome Army General: fair-haired, fit, 
                forty. He has the face of a boy.</p>
              <p>The second is NARCISSUS MERIDAS, General, Spanish Gemina<br>
                Felix VII Army: dark hair, proud and though about Quintus' age 
                his face is like a map of a soldiers's hard life. Narcissus' eyes 
                are locked on Marcus like the eyes of a long-suffering pilgrim 
                on the icon of his single hope.</p>
              <p>THE WAGON</p>
              <p>Just before Marcus is about to speak, Commodus steps into the 
                wagon looking out of breath. Surprised, Marcus embraces him and 
                then Commodus stands behind his father wrapped tightly in his 
                bearskin robe. He's trying to look tough but unlike his father 
                he's not used to this rigorous life.</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS &amp; QUINTUS</p>
              <p>swap looks as if Commodus were the last person they were expecting...</p>
              <p> MARCUS AURELIUS<br>
                Citizens!</p>
              <p>Marcus' voice booms out tough and firm as if defying the cold 
                and dark.</p>
              <p> MARCUS AURELIUS<br>
                Today may be the last day in the life of Rome... For nine hundred<br>
                years Rome has lived! For nine hundred years architects, mathematicians, 
                poets, and philosophers have fled within her arms sheltered from 
                superstition, prejudice, hate, and every form of<br>
                human cruelty. We Romans have become a light in the barbarian<br>
                night!</p>
              <p>ON NARCISSUS</p>
              <p>No trace of feeling, just his breath slowly clouding in the frigid 
                air.</p>
              <p>AND MARCUS...</p>
              <p>Seeming to look at each legionnaire as he speaks.</p>
              <p> MARCUS AURELIUS<br>
                For nine hundred years this one heart of humankind has been defended 
                by the likes of Pompeii, Mark Anthony, Julius Caesar, The Divine 
                Augustus, Claudius, Trajan, Hadrian, and my own father Antoninus 
                Pius. Now, it has come down to us!<br>
                It has come down to this one day...</p>
              <p>He leans forward on the rail of the wagon, a gesture that seems 
                to bring him closer to the men.</p>
              <p> MARCUS AURELIUS<br>
                Five years we've lived together, you and I, in a state of total 
                war. We<br>
                have shared cold, rain, heat, bitterly watched the deaths of beloved 
                friends. We are not alone. Look around you! Consuls and Senators 
                have forsworn the luxuries of home and moved with us to the front 
                to ensure that the administration of our government radiates from 
                the source of her bravest citizens.</p>
              <p>OUTSIDE A FIELD TENT</p>
              <p>Stand SENATOR GAIUS and SENATOR FALCO wrapped to their<br>
                chins against the staggering cold.</p>
              <p>Both men are in advanced middle age. Gaius looks like a stoic: 
                impassive, plainly dressed. Falco wears an expensive fur trimmed 
                robe with gold and asbestos.<br>
                Flanking them are CONSULS and various OFFICIALS. Lucilla<br>
                stands by Gaius and a very stately, attractive NUMIDIAN WOMAN, 
                MELA, Juba's wife.</p>
              <p> MARCUS AURELIUS (O.S.)<br>
                The link between us and Rome is a solid chain of unbroken purpose!<br>
                For nine hundred years the Roman Senate has stood one with the 
                army in dignity and resolve!</p>
              <p>AND COMMODUS...</p>

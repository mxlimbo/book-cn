                SLAVE<br>
                The emperor is awake. He asks to see his generals.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. MARCUS AURELIUS' ROOM - LATER</p>
              <p>Marcus Aurelius sits up in his bed and watches with a seasoned 
                campaigner's eye as Narcissus and Quintus lean over a large, beautifully 
                hand-drawn map. Commodus sits by his side, the attentive son.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Felix Army controls the narrows.<br>
                Four cohorts from Quintus' legion hold the opposite shore and 
                once we repair the German fort we'll be able to reinforce and 
                supply them at will.</p>
              <p>Seeing he's having trouble seeing, Narcissus holds the map up 
                for him.</p>
              <p> MARCUS AURELIUS<br>
                Can the Germans cross up stream on boats or float bridges?</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                Not through those rapids. They're disorganized and their army 
                barely<br>
                exists.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                But they're not destroyed, not yet.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Do we really need to repair this fort? It seems like an expensive<br>
                undertaking. I propose we burn it to the ground. That way if the<br>
                Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them 
                build an offensive position.</p>
              <p> MARCUS AURELIUS<br>
                Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring 
                when<br>
                they're most vulnerable.</p>
              <p> MARCUS AURELIUS<br>
                Commodus -- listen to Narcissus, listen to the man who has never 
                lost a battle for Rome! You're young with years ahead of you before 
                you gain the experience to wear the purple!</p>
              <p>Commodus visibly reacts, but swallows his anger. Marcus<br>
                sits back, weakened from the exchange.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Father, you have to rest...</p>
              <p> MARCUS AURELIUS<br>
                I'm sorry... all of you, excuse me.</p>
              <p>They all make shallow bows and turn to leave, but Marcus holds 
                Narcissus' hand. Quintus sees and politely leaves, but Commodus 
                only goes reluctantly.</p>
              <p> MARCUS AURELIUS<br>
                I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I will, Marcus. But you're going to be well enough to direct it 
                yourself.</p>
              <p> MARCUS AURELIUS<br>
                I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus. We all put off the very<br>
                last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when 
                our<br>
                lives are over.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                There's no reason to say that.<br>
                Everyone knows you're going to be well. I had Servis groom your 
                horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.</p>
              <p> MARCUS AURELIUS<br>
                Servis made it through again?</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow.</p>
              <p>Marcus laughs and looks like he's better just talking with<br>
                Narcissus. But now he holds Narcissus' hand with both of<br>
                his.</p>
              <p> MARCUS AURELIUS<br>
                If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... 
                no,<br>
                again, it's my own bullheadedness.<br>
                Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago. And now the Gods 
                are begging me to make you my son!</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.</p>
              <p> MARCUS AURELIUS<br>
                It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant.<br>
                His sister is a better man. That's why I have undertaken to begin<br>
                sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the 
                Senate.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                So I understand.</p>
              <p> MARCUS AURELIUS<br>
                Everyone talking about it? I wouldn't wonder. All I seek is a<br>
                genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate. Thus 
                I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with 
                -- back to the Senators. This includes a shared right to taxation 
                too but some bite in the plan. It's a start, only a start. If 
                the Emperor and the<br>
                Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their<br>
                share. This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as 
                that<br>
                type?</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                You're too hard on him. He is a strong young man, with you as 
                his<br>
                guide...</p>
              <p> MARCUS AURELIUS<br>
                A man should be upright, not be kept upright.<br>
                (pause)<br>
                History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities 
                -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute. 
                I want you to consider becoming my heir.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell 
                out<br>
                of me.</p>
              <p> MARCUS AURELIUS<br>
                The Senators admire you.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                They fear me.</p>
              <p> MARCUS AURELIUS<br>
                They fear change. The new Caesar must be honest enough to know 
                when the emperorship is no longer feasible. You could be the one, 
                the<br>
                Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic 
                but I can't be that power.</p>
              <p>The door creeps open and Galen slips in followed by Commodus.</p>
              <p>GALEN<br>
                General; the emperor needs my full attention. Please? He must 
                have<br>
                his elixirs.</p>
              <p> MARCUS AURELIUS<br>
                Don't waste time. Finish our work... Swear!</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I swear, Marcus.</p>
              <p>Marcus smiles, but grips his hand.</p>
              <p> MARCUS AURELIUS<br>
                I'm going to miss riding the lines with you, Narcissus...</p>
              <p>HALLWAY</p>
              <p>Commodus walks Narcissus to the door himself.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                You and my father have become very close. Perhaps one day I may 
                say the same for us.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                You flatter me, Caesar.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Caesar?</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                That this illness has clouded his mind.</p>
              <p>He shuts the door with an ominous finality.</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. MARCUS AURELIUS' QUARTERS - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Narcissus turns and runs straight into Lucilla who's been waiting 
                for him. Her reaction is to put her arms around his neck and look 
                up into his smiling face. But he's just amused.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Sneaking around with your brother?</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                Without him. He'd be weeping if he overheard that. Well? The idea 
                of<br>
                you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking 
                the job.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                Why do you keep playing at being so humble? It's a little mbarrassing.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Why do you play at being drunk?</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                How do you know I am playing? Well, the clown is always harmless. 
                Isn't that right? And how did you ever get to know me so well? 
                The last we spent any time together I was fourteen. I think you 
                know me<br>
                better than my father.<br>
                (pause)<br>
                He's going to die, isn't he?</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I don't believe that. He's got the best doctor in the world and 
                a will<br>
                of iron. You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of<br>
                Germany.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it? The Emperor<br>
                himself, didn't you know? Why do you think Commodus came rushing 
                up to the front? Burning patriotism?<br>
                Filial love? He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough<br>
                cash left in the treasury to... play Emperor. Watch out for him,<br>
                Narcissus; he's inexperienced, but... be careful.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. NARCISSUS' TENT - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Narcissus painfully pulls his toga over his head and for the 
                first time we really get to see his battle wounds.<br>
                All the dressings have bled through. He dips fresh bandages in 
                a bowl of hot water... then reaches back and peels off a dressing.</p>

                INT. IMPERIAL PALACE - PALATINE HILL - EVENING</p>
              <p>Lucilla watches as Commodus heaves statuary, paintings, even 
                furniture into a heap on the central room floor; slaves scurry 
                to pick it up.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                Those are priceless sculptures.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this<br>
                house! If it's worth something then sell it!</p>
              <p>Falco enters with Tribuus. Commodus rages at him.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                It's disgusting! Animals! I had to come here under armed guard. 
                Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father. 
                Except that he can't heave out his ghost.</p>
              <p>Commodus hits her hard across the face. She staggers back<br>
                against the edge of a fountain.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Shut up! This is no joke! I am no joke! You understand me!</p>
              <p>Only her anger keeps back her tears.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                Yes... brother.</p>
              <p>For a moment everyone is overwhelmed -- and Falco steps<br>
                between them. Lucilla sits, washes the corner of her mouth from 
                the fountain.</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                Gracchus and Gaius are inciting the crowd by holding you up for<br>
                comparison. You must kill that ghost that's haunting you.</p>
              <p>Commodus turns and comes nearly nose-to-nose with a statue<br>
                of Marcus Aurelius. He grabs a slave.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                I told you to get that bust out of my sight!</p>
              <p>The hapless slave hugs the statue but no way will it budge.</p>
              <p> SLAVE<br>
                Caesar -- it outweighs me!</p>
              <p> TRIBUUS<br>
                Guards -- help us here.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Throw it down into the streets!<br>
                Down into the Forum. If it's my father they want then give him 
                to<br>
                them!</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                Yes. You know, that's not a bad<br>
                idea.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Maybe it'll crush Gaius.</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                I'm serious.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                So am I.</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                We can crush Gaius another way.<br>
                What if you do throw something to the people they really want? 
                Make<br>
                them a gift of food.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Give away food?</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                Sacks of grain, even bread. I own the grain licenses for the military,<br>
                I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Take grain away from the army?</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                Make a gift to the people. It's your money anyway so it's only 
                fair.</p>
              <p>Lucilla seems very interested.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                And make a huge deal out of it... If you want the people to truly<br>
                remember the gesture, that is at least until the first of Janus, 
                it<br>
                must be an event, an occasion of celebration.</p>
              <p> FALCO<br>
                She's right about that. It's going to be damned expensive so better 
                get<br>
                your money's worth.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                How about in the forum. Right in front of the Senate.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                If I may be so bold...</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                For the gods, spit it out!</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                Why not do it in the Colosseum?</p>
              <p>Hard to tell exactly what Commodus thinks of this.</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                When Julius Caesar overthrew the Republic he held massive games 
                at<br>
                Circus Maximus to divert the people.<br>
                By the time they came home from all their fun... they were living 
                in a<br>
                dictatorship.</p>
              <p>That gets him interested. Tribuus and the guards begin to wrestle 
                the statue of Marcus Aurelius out of the hall.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. NARCISSUS' CELL - DAY LATER - DAWN</p>
              <p>The door bangs back and Narcissus wakes. Adonis enters<br>
                with two guards. Narcissus gets up from the floor where<br>
                he's been sleeping on a blanket.</p>
              <p> ADONIS<br>
                General...</p>
              <p>Other cells can be heard clanking aside, men cursing and laughing. 
                Far off ROOSTERS CROW. Adonis steps out and Proximo pokes his 
                head in.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Like an animal. I give you one of the best cells -- look at you, 
                on<br>
                the ground. And the crowd -- you win and they hate you because 
                you<br>
                never ask them for permission to kill your opponent! You could 
                win<br>
                the wooden sword if the crowd loves you enough! The wooden sword! 
                It's freedom -- you listening to me?<br>
                Gladiator has the chance of winning it... technically.</p>
              <p>Narcissus just shoves past.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                This isn't a war, you know! Have<br>
                some fun with it!</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAWN</p>
              <p>Narcissus pauses to watch the other gladiators herded together 
                from the pitiful cells, some naked pulling on ragged togas. In 
                the yard steaming cauldrons of food are prepared by slaves.</p>
              <p>Dragged from his cell a new, young gladiator -- VEDNAS --<br>
                weeps and screams that he doesn't want to die.</p>
              <p>Bad Teeth crawls out of his cell like a bear, punches<br>
                Vednas in the mouth to shut him up and moves on before the<br>
                guards can get to him.</p>
              <p>Already dressed, Crassus kneels before a crude stone alter, praying 
                to his God.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. GLADIATOR WAGON - MORNING</p>
              <p>Silence from the gladiators as the wagon squeaks and thumps through 
                Rome. The Gang-Kids race alongside, shouting. Bad Teeth reaches 
                under his rough toga and comes up with a small jug of wine. He 
                hands it to Narcissus.</p>
              <p> BAD TEETH<br>
                This is my God.</p>
              <p>Narcissus eyeballs the jug, then takes it and turns away from 
                the rest to drink. The others swap looks. Gathering his courage, 
                Vednas crawls near.</p>
              <p> VEDNAS<br>
                They say, you are a general...</p>
              <p>Narcissus looks him over a moment, says nothing. But Vednas pours 
                forth in desperation.</p>
              <p> VEDNAS<br>
                I don't belong here! I'm Vednas the scribe! I can read and write<br>
                Etruscan, Greek; I can read the pictures of the great Pharaohs 
                and<br>
                the tongue of Cyrus the Younger! I once translated the whole Epic 
                of<br>
                Gilgamesh from Babylonian into Greek for the library of Ephesus! 
                My ancestors were scribes at the Great Library of Alexandria!</p>
              <p> BAD TEETH<br>
                I'll bet he can scream in ten<br>
                languages!</p>
              <p>Howls from the others. Narcissus remains unmoved.</p>
              <p> VEDNAS<br>
                I never bothered anyone. I had a corner, out on the verge where 
                the<br>
                insula and the domus meet. Anyone with good taste came to me to 
                write their letters. Love letters were my specialty! General, 
                I can compose like no other man!</p>
              <p> BAD TEETH<br>
                Yeah, but pretty soon you'll be decomposing!</p>
              <p>More laughs... Vednas gets desperate.</p>
              <p> VEDNAS<br>
                Please! I was condemned for over charging for a document! They 
                need bodies for the arena! I did nothing! Help me!</p>
              <p>Narcissus has another sip of wine.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                You want to live?<br>
                (pause)<br>
                Kill.</p>

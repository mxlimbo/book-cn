                INT. COLOSSEUM - GLADIATOR AREA - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
              <p>Arena Slaves basically packing it in for the day. Proximo<br>
                slings an arm over Narcissus.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Listen, there's some people who want to talk to you.</p>
              <p>He indicates A WOMAN, about forty and her son about twenty. They 
                look prosperous.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                How much money is involved?</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                A great deal. They designed and build Tiger's chariot...</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, 
                right?<br>
                They don't waste time...</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                I can really rape them on this! Can I at least tell them you'll 
                think<br>
                about it?</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                No. Tell them I'll do it. But I want more posters all over Rome.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Fantastic! Wonderful! But posters are very expensive.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Then get a large cash advance.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer. I don't 
                want to<br>
                get sued over this.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Before they leave, get gold.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Right, right, what am I thinking of?</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I want another interview with Cos.<br>
                Tell him to bring plenty of ink.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                I'll do it! Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going 
                to die,<br>
                but for you -- anything!</p>
              <p> TRIBUUS<br>
                Proximo Palindromos?</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Ah! Already we're dead!</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                What do you want, mighty Tribuus?</p>
              <p> TRIBUUS<br>
                Caesar wants to talk. I've come to guarantee Narcissus safety.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                You've come to send us to hell!</p>
              <p>As they talk other gladiators close around Tribuus.</p>
              <p> DALA<br>
                Our general stays with us.</p>
              <p>Tribuus puts hand on his sword.</p>
              <p> TRIBUUS<br>
                Keep away from me, animal!</p>
              <p>Vednas and Dala move closer. Narcissus steps in between<br>
                and grabs Tribuus' sword arm.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Tell your master I'll meet here, on the sand. After the Colosseum<br>
                closes.</p>
              <p>Tribuus pulls lose, turns -- and runs smack into Bad Teeth<br>
                -- who SMILES. He shoves past.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. COLOSSEUM - MORNING</p>
              <p>Narcissus sits face-to-face with Commodus across a tiny<br>
                table. They have wine and bread. Just behind Commodus is<br>
                Tribuus with the Praetorian Guard. Narcissus is flanked<br>
                by Proximo and his gladiators.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Endorse me in public. Do that and I'll make you rich and set you 
                free.<br>
                I'll return your estates. I know you would give anything to be<br>
                outside again. Endorse me and you will be free. Think of it. What<br>
                would you do with your freedom?</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                If you set me free I will find my<br>
                way back to the army, march on Rome<br>
                and depose you. Then, the army and<br>
                I will restore the Republic so that<br>
                animals like you will never control<br>
                human destinies again.</p>
              <p>Outraged, Tribuus makes a move toward Narcissus --<br>
                immediately the gladiators pull their swords. For a<br>
                second it looks like there's going to be blood shed...<br>
                Commodus leans on the table between them and holds up his<br>
                fist for emphasis.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Is that how you want to spend your life? You're trapped in the<br>
                Colosseum!</p>
              <p>Narcissus GRABS his fist, locks it in his grip.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                So are you...</p>
              <p>Bad Teeth smiles at Tribuus again. Commodus pulls his hand free...</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. PALACE - PALATINE HILL - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
              <p>In a small, circular marble space outside the gardens,<br>
                Commodus oiled and stripped to leather shorts wrestles a<br>
                really tough looking SLAVE. Commodus EASILY dominates the<br>
                match, clearly becoming a DRIVEN MAN. Lucilla leads<br>
                Tribuus with Jerses and Lykas in tow.</p>
              <p> LYKAS<br>
                Caesar, I am here...</p>
              <p>Commodus doesn't even break stride.</p>
              <p> COMMODUS<br>
                Lykas, pick a man. Someone who will look good. Jerses I want it 
                built up in the Daily Action...</p>
              <p> LUCILLA<br>
                Do you want posters, too?</p>
              <p>Commodus gives her an evil glare.</p>
              <p><br>
                INT. PROXIMO'S INSULA - EARLY EVENING</p>
              <p>Narcissus faces-off with Cos and Proximo across a table<br>
                laden with food and wine.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                &quot;Bread and circuses,&quot; that's all the great poet said 
                we Romans need.</p>
              <p>Narcissus sees that glazed look in Cos' eyes. Narcissus<br>
                pours them both wine.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                It's time for you to tell the<br>
                Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending 
                the<br>
                German border. It's time to tell the citizens everything. Will 
                you<br>
                write it?</p>
              <p> COS<br>
                Yes, because I know they'll read it.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to? And don't tell me you 
                don't<br>
                know!</p>
              <p> COS<br>
                I don't know...</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                AGH! Please! He's having a secret device constructed for the circus.<br>
                The brass craftsmen are working overtime.</p>
              <p> COS<br>
                I'll nose around...</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                You know there were riots last night. Now the unrest has started<br>
                again and Commodus has sent for an army division. You understand 
                what you are doing...</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. COLOSSEUM ARENA - DAY</p>
              <p>Commodus -- hair sparkling with gold dust, wearing the<br>
                Hercules lion skin -- struts into the arena at the head of<br>
                the gladiator parade. This time the audience applauds.</p>
              <p>Narcissus enters with the Proximo gladiators behind the<br>
                emperor and the volume of the cheers DOUBLES. Forcing<br>
                himself not to turn, Commodus ascends to the imperial box.<br>
                Before he sits, two SLAVES carry what looks like a folding<br>
                campstool with curved legs. Cheers as Commodus sits in<br>
                it.</p>
              <p><br>
                EXT. COLOSSEUM</p>
              <p>Narcissus slowly puts on his garish armor as Dala sits beside 
                him.</p>
              <p> DALA<br>
                What's that stupid stool?</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                It's the curule chair.</p>
              <p> DALA<br>
                What in Hades is the curule chair?</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Rome's most ancient symbol of leadership. While all other kings<br>
                sat in great stone thrones, Rome's leaders were always on the 
                move with the army. Some of her greatest emperors barely had time 
                to set foot in Rome. So this cheap little folding stool became 
                a powerful<br>
                symbol.</p>
              <p>All eyes on Proximo now, Narcissus must be touched to hear these 
                words from &quot;such an ignoble mouth.&quot; Proximo shrugs it 
                off, turns to Narcissus.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                So, things change. The government has moved to the circus. You're<br>
                going to fight last. And Commodus is going to fight first.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Was I?</p>
              <p>They hold on each other -- then the crowd HOWLS.</p>
              <p> DALA<br>
                Here he comes...</p>
              <p>ARENA</p>
              <p>Commodus struts onto the sand, muscular body oiled, golden<br>
                hair glinting in the sun. A SLAVE trails behind, then<br>
                gets on his knees and offers Commodus a vicious looking<br>
                sword. Commodus holds up the sword CHEERS raining on him,<br>
                the crowd going more and more with Commodus.</p>
              <p>PROXIMO</p>
              <p>joins his gladiators watching the spectacle.</p>
              <p>COMMODUS</p>
              <p>faces off with a heavily built PERSIAN and immediately<br>
                attacks. The Persian hesitates, but then when he sees<br>
                Commodus is serious he fights back. They swap blow upon<br>
                blow and finally Commodus expertly topples the man with a<br>
                swipe of his shield. Silence of disbelief from the<br>
                audience -- then they break into prolonged cheering.</p>
              <p>Commodus raises his sword, accepting the acclaim. Then he<br>
                KILLS the Persian. And the crowd loves it.</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS</p>
              <p>turns away, watches as Commodus joins the Lykas gladiators<br>
                in their own 'holding' area on the opposite side of the<br>
                arena.</p>
              <p> PROXIMO<br>
                Why don't you let me assemble a sort of... how shall I put this,<br>
                'Package' of enterprises which you could endorse while leaving 
                all the<br>
                messy business to me? I don't want to over-state the possibilities, 
                but<br>
                I've been approached by cheese- makers; a sandal manufacturer; 
                at<br>
                least four wineries; gymnasium machines...</p>
              <p>Narcissus seems to measure the distance to his rival, then<br>
                looks into a dark passage behind with the door left ajar.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                I'm going to leave this all up to you, Proximo. I trust you.<br>
                (off his look)<br>
                Just be prepared to do me a few favors in return.</p>
              <p>NARCISSUS...</p>
              <p>Moves toward the butcher shop, but sees armed slaves at<br>
                the doors of the passages beyond. Still he reaches in<br>
                between two hanging racks of ribs for a flat cleaver...<br>
                but his hand freezes.</p>
              <p>On ice, in a mangled disorder is long hair bearing BELLS.<br>
                It's the dismembered corpse of Crassus.</p>
              <p>A sweating FAT MAN in a loin cloth sings as he hacks<br>
                gladiator bodies to bits. He pauses, then crosses to the<br>
                lip of a sunken CAGE where two lionesses pace. He heaves<br>
                in two HUMAN LEGS, then wanders back as slaves unwrap two<br>
                more bodies.</p>
              <p> QUINTUS (O.S.)<br>
                You'd never make it.</p>
              <p>Narcissus wheels to confront two Praetorian Guard... and Quintus.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                You brought the army into Rome.</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                I was summoned.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                It's my job to keep my job. And that, by the way, is now head 
                of<br>
                Praetorian Guard. Good ole Tribuus has been retired.</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take<br>
                Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand! Narcissus, 
                the<br>
                Republic is dead. You think those Senators could govern? For the 
                last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an 
                endless<br>
                succession of Imperial asses!</p>
              <p> NARCISSUS<br>
                Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will 
                grow<br>
                up to become senators...</p>
              <p> QUINTUS<br>
                The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want: 
                A<br>
                government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them 
                with messy thoughts of issues. You know, messy... thinking. They 
                want a dictator! As far as the children, there is only one thing 
                that every Roman child dreams of: being you!<br>
                A famous gladiator!</p>

                next<br>
                act, guaranteed to bring the house down. Everyone will be holding<br>
                their breath to what you come up with in return...</p>

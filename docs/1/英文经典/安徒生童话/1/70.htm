              <p class="h" align="center"> THE MARSH KING'S DAUGHTER</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THE storks relate to their little ones a great many stories, 
                and<br>
                they are all about moors and reed banks, and suited to their age 
                and<br>
                capacity. The youngest of them are quite satisfied with &quot;kribble,<br>
                krabble,&quot; or such nonsense, and think it very grand; but 
                the elder<br>
                ones want something with a deeper meaning, or at least something 
                about their own family.<br>
              </p>
              <p>We are only acquainted with one of the two longest and oldest<br>
                stories which the storks relate- it is about Moses, who was exposed 
                by his mother on the banks of the Nile, and was found by the king's<br>
                daughter, who gave him a good education, and he afterwards became 
                a great man; but where he was buried is still unknown.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Every one knows this story, but not the second; very likely<br>
                because it is quite an inland story. It has been repeated from 
                mouth<br>
                to mouth, from one stork-mamma to another, for thousands of years; 
                and each has told it better than the last; and now we mean to 
                tell it<br>
                better than all.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The first stork pair who related it lived at the time it happened,<br>
                and had their summer residence on the rafters of the Viking's 
                house,<br>
                which stood near the wild moorlands of Wendsyssell; that is, to<br>
                speak more correctly, the great moorheath, high up in the north 
                of<br>
                Jutland, by the Skjagen peak. This wilderness is still an immense 
                wild<br>
                heath of marshy ground, about which we can read in the &quot;Official<br>
                Directory.&quot; It is said that in olden times the place was 
                a lake, the<br>
                ground of which had heaved up from beneath, and now the moorland<br>
                extends for miles in every direction, and is surrounded by damp<br>
                meadows, trembling, undulating swamps, and marshy ground covered 
                with turf, on which grow bilberry bushes and stunted trees. Mists 
                are almost always hovering over this region, which, seventy years 
                ago, was overrun with wolves. It may well be called the Wild Moor; 
                and one can easily imagine, with such a wild expanse of marsh 
                and lake, how lonely and dreary it must have been a thousand years 
                ago. Many things may be noticed now that existed then. The reeds 
                grow to the same height, and bear the same kind of long, purple-brown 
                leaves, with their feathery tips. There still stands the birch, 
                with its white bark and its delicate, loosely hanging leaves; 
                and with regard to the living beings who frequented this spot, 
                the fly still wears a gauzy dress of the same cut, and the favorite 
                colors of the stork are white, with black and red for stockings. 
                The people, certainly, in those days, wore very different dresses 
                to those they now wear, but if any of them, be he huntsman or 
                squire, master or servant, ventured on the wavering, undulating, 
                marshy ground of the moor, they met with the same fate a thousand 
                years ago as they would now. The wanderer sank, and went down 
                to the Marsh King, as he is named, who rules in the great moorland 
                empire beneath. They also called him &quot;Gunkel King,&quot; 
                but we like the name of &quot;Marsh King&quot; better, and we 
                will give him that name as the storks do. Very little is known 
                of the Marsh King's rule, but that, perhaps, is a good thing.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the neighborhood of the moorlands, and not far from the great<br>
                arm of the North Sea and the Cattegat which is called the<br>
                Lumfjorden, lay the castle of the Viking, with its water-tight 
                stone<br>
                cellars, its tower, and its three projecting storeys. On the ridge<br>
                of the roof the stork had built his nest, and there the stork-mamma<br>
                sat on her eggs and felt sure her hatching would come to something.<br>
                One evening, stork-papa stayed out rather late, and when he came<br>
                home he seemed quite busy, bustling, and important. &quot;I have<br>
                something very dreadful to tell you,&quot; said he to the stork-mamma.<br>
                &quot;Keep it to yourself then,&quot; she replied. &quot;Remember 
                that I am<br>
                hatching eggs; it may agitate me, and will affect them.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You must know it at once,&quot; said he. &quot;The daughter 
                of our host<br>
                in Egypt has arrived here. She has ventured to take this journey,<br>
                and now she is lost.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;She who sprung from the race of the fairies, is it?&quot; 
                cried the<br>
                mother stork. &quot;Oh, tell me all about it; you know I cannot 
                bear to<br>
                be kept waiting at a time when I am hatching eggs.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well, you see, mother,&quot; he replied, &quot;she believed 
                what the<br>
                doctors said, and what I have heard you state also, that the<br>
                moor-flowers which grow about here would heal her sick father; 
                and she has flown to the north in swan's plumage, in company with 
                some other swan-princesses, who come to these parts every year 
                to renew their youth. She came, and where is she now!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You enter into particulars too much,&quot; said the mamma 
                stork,<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;and the eggs may take cold; I cannot bear such suspense 
                as this.&quot;<br>
                &quot;Well,&quot; said he, &quot;I have kept watch; and this evening 
                I went among<br>
                the rushes where I thought the marshy ground would bear me, and<br>
                while I was there three swans came. Something in their manner 
                of<br>
                flying seemed to say to me, 'Look carefully now; there is one 
                not<br>
                all swan, only swan's feathers.' You know, mother, you have the 
                same<br>
                intuitive feeling that I have; you know whether a thing is right 
                or<br>
                not immediately.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, of course,&quot; said she; &quot;but tell me about 
                the princess; I<br>
                am tired of hearing about the swan's feathers.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well, you know that in the middle of the moor there is<br>
                something like a lake,&quot; said the stork-papa. &quot;You can 
                see the edge<br>
                of it if you raise yourself a little. Just there, by the reeds 
                and the<br>
                green banks, lay the trunk of an elder-tree; upon this the three 
                swans<br>
                stood flapping their wings, and looking about them; one of them<br>
                threw off her plumage, and I immediately recognized her as one 
                of<br>
                the princesses of our home in Egypt. There she sat, without any<br>
                covering but her long, black hair. I heard her tell the two others<br>
                to take great care of the swan's plumage, while she dipped down 
                into<br>
                the water to pluck the flowers which she fancied she saw there. 
                The<br>
                others nodded, and picked up the feather dress, and took possession 
                of it. I wonder what will become of it? thought I, and she most 
                likely<br>
                asked herself the same question. If so, she received an answer, 
                a very<br>
                practical one; for the two swans rose up and flew away with her 
                swan's plumage. 'Dive down now!' they cried; 'thou shalt never 
                more fly in the swan's plumage, thou shalt never again see Egypt; 
                here, on the moor, thou wilt remain.' So saying, they tore the 
                swan's plumage<br>
                into a thousand pieces, the feathers drifted about like a snow-shower,<br>
                and then the two deceitful princesses flew away.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Why, that is terrible,&quot; said the stork-mamma; &quot;I 
                feel as if I<br>
                could hardly bear to hear any more, but you must tell me what 
                happened next.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The princess wept and lamented aloud; her tears moistened 
                the<br>
                elder stump, which was really not an elder stump but the Marsh 
                King<br>
                himself, he who in marshy ground lives and rules. I saw myself 
                how the stump of the tree turned round, and was a tree no more, 
                while long, clammy branches like arms, were extended from it. 
                Then the poor child was terribly frightened, and started up to 
                run away. She<br>
                hastened to cross the green, slimy ground; but it will not bear 
                any<br>
                weight, much less hers. She quickly sank, and the elder stump 
                dived<br>
                immediately after her; in fact, it was he who drew her down. Great<br>
                black bubbles rose up out of the moor-slime, and with these every<br>
                trace of the two vanished. And now the princess is buried in the<br>
                wild marsh, she will never now carry flowers to Egypt to cure 
                her<br>
                father. It would have broken your heart, mother, had you seen 
                it.&quot;<br>
                &quot;You ought not to have told me,&quot; said she, &quot;at 
                such a time as<br>
                this; the eggs might suffer. But I think the princess will soon 
                find<br>
                help; some one will rise up to help her. Ah! if it had been you 
                or<br>
                I, or one of our people, it would have been all over with us.&quot;<br>
                I mean to go every day,&quot; said he, &quot;to see if anything 
                comes to<br>
                pass;&quot; and so he did.<br>
              </p>
              <p>A long time went by, but at last he saw a green stalk shooting<br>
                up out of the deep, marshy ground. As it reached the surface of 
                the<br>
                marsh, a leaf spread out, and unfolded itself broader and broader, 
                and close to it came forth a bud.<br>
              </p>
              <p>One morning, when the stork-papa was flying over the stem, he<br>
                saw that the power of the sun's rays had caused the bud to open, 
                and<br>
                in the cup of the flower lay a charming child- a little maiden,<br>
                looking as if she had just come out of a bath. The little one 
                was so<br>
                like the Egyptian princess, that the stork, at the first moment,<br>
                thought it must be the princess herself, but after a little reflection<br>
                he decided that it was much more likely to be the daughter of 
                the<br>
                princess and the Marsh King; and this explained also her being<br>
                placed in the cup of a water-lily. &quot;But she cannot be left 
                to lie<br>
                here,&quot; thought the stork, &quot;and in my nest there are 
                already so many.<br>
                But stay, I have thought of something: the wife of the Viking 
                has no<br>
                children, and how often she has wished for a little one. People 
                always<br>
                say the stork brings the little ones; I will do so in earnest 
                this<br>
                time. I shall fly with the child to the Viking's wife; what<br>
                rejoicing there will be!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And then the stork lifted the little girl out of the flower-cup,<br>
                flew to the castle, picked a hole with his beak in the<br>
                bladder-covered, window, and laid the beautiful child in the bosom<br>
                of the Viking's wife. Then he flew back quickly to the stork-mamma 
                and told her what he had seen and done; and the little storks 
                listened<br>
                to it all, for they were then quite old enough to do so. &quot;So 
                you see,&quot;<br>
                he continued, &quot;that the princess is not dead, for she must 
                have sent<br>
                her little one up here; and now I have found a home for her.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ah, I said it would be so from the first,&quot; replied 
                the<br>
                stork-mamma; &quot;but now think a little of your own family. 
                Our<br>
                travelling time draws near, and I sometimes feel a little irritation<br>
                already under the wings. The cuckoos and the nightingale are already<br>
                gone, and I heard the quails say they should go too as soon as 
                the<br>
                wind was favorable. Our youngsters will go through all the<br>
                manoeuvres at the review very well, or I am much mistaken in them.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Viking's wife was above measure delighted when she awoke 
                the<br>
                next morning and found the beautiful little child lying in her<br>
                bosom. She kissed it and caressed it; but it cried terribly, and<br>
                struck out with its arms and legs, and did not seem to be pleased 
                at<br>
                all. At last it cried itself to sleep; and as it lay there so 
                still<br>
                and quiet, it was a most beautiful sight to see. The Viking's 
                wife was<br>
                so delighted, that body and soul were full of joy. Her heart felt 
                so<br>
                light within her, that it seemed as if her husband and his soldiers,<br>
                who were absent, must come home as suddenly and unexpectedly as 
                the little child had done. She and her whole household therefore 
                busied themselves in preparing everything for the reception of 
                her lord.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The long, colored tapestry, on which she and her maidens had 
                worked pictures of their idols, Odin, Thor, and Friga, was hung 
                up. The slaves polished the old shields that served as ornaments; 
                cushions were placed on the seats, and dry wood laid on the fireplaces 
                in the centre of the hall, so that the flames might be fanned 
                up at a moment's notice. The Viking's wife herself assisted in 
                the work, so that at night she felt very tired, and quickly fell 
                into a sound<br>
                sleep. When she awoke, just before morning, she was terribly alarmed<br>
                to find that the infant had vanished. She sprang from her couch,<br>
                lighted a pine-chip, and searched all round the room, when, at 
                last,<br>
                in that part of the bed where her feet had been, lay, not the 
                child,<br>
                but a great, ugly frog. She was quite disgusted at this sight, 
                and<br>
                seized a heavy stick to kill the frog; but the creature looked 
                at<br>
                her with such strange, mournful eyes, that she was unable to strike<br>
                the blow. Once more she searched round the room; then she started 
                at hearing the frog utter a low, painful croak. She sprang from 
                the couch and opened the window hastily; at the same moment the 
                sun rose, and threw its beams through the window, till it rested 
                on the couch where the great frog lay. Suddenly it appeared as 
                if the frog's<br>
                broad mouth contracted, and became small and red. The limbs moved 
                and stretched out and extended themselves till they took a beautiful 
                shape; and behold there was the pretty child lying before her, 
                and the ugly frog was gone. &quot;How is this?&quot; she cried, 
                &quot;have I had a wicked dream? Is it not my own lovely cherub 
                that lies there.&quot; Then she kissed it and fondled it; but 
                the child struggled and fought, and<br>
                bit as if she had been a little wild cat.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Viking did not return on that day, nor the next; he was,<br>
                however, on the way home; but the wind, so favorable to the storks,<br>
                was against him; for it blew towards the south. A wind in favor 
                of one<br>
                is often against another.<br>
              </p>
              <p>After two or three days had passed, it became clear to the<br>
                Viking's wife how matters stood with the child; it was under the<br>
                influence of a powerful sorcerer. By day it was charming in appearance 
                as an angel of light, but with a temper wicked and wild; while 
                at night, in the form of an ugly frog, it was quiet and mournful, 
                with eyes full of sorrow. Here were two natures, changing inwardly 
                and outwardly with the absence and return of sunlight. And so 
                it<br>
                happened that by day the child, with the actual form of its mother,<br>
                possessed the fierce disposition of its father; at night, on the<br>
                contrary, its outward appearance plainly showed its descent on 
                the<br>
                father's side, while inwardly it had the heart and mind of its 
                mother.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Who would be able to loosen this wicked charm which the sorcerer 
                had worked upon it? The wife of the Viking lived in constant pain 
                and<br>
                sorrow about it. Her heart clung to the little creature, but she 
                could<br>
                not explain to her husband the circumstances in which it was placed.<br>
                He was expected to return shortly; and were she to tell him, he<br>
                would very likely, as was the custom at that time, expose the 
                poor<br>
                child in the public highway, and let any one take it away who 
                would.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The good wife of the Viking could not let that happen, and she<br>
                therefore resolved that the Viking should never see the child<br>
                excepting by daylight.<br>
              </p>
              <p>One morning there sounded a rushing of storks' wings over the<br>
                roof. More than a hundred pair of storks had rested there during 
                the<br>
                night, to recover themselves after their excursion; and now they<br>
                soared aloft, and prepared for the journey southward.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;All the husbands are here, and ready!&quot; they cried; 
                &quot;wives and<br>
                children also!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;How light we are!&quot; screamed the young storks in chorus.<br>
                &quot;Something pleasant seems creeping over us, even down to 
                our toes,<br>
                as if we were full of live frogs. Ah, how delightful it is to 
                travel<br>
                into foreign lands!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Hold yourselves properly in the line with us,&quot; cried 
                papa and<br>
                mamma. &quot;Do not use your beaks so much; it tries the lungs.&quot; 
                And then the storks flew away.<br>
              </p>
              <p>About the same time sounded the clang of the warriors' trumpets<br>
                across the heath. The Viking had landed with his men. They were<br>
                returning home, richly laden with spoil from the Gallic coast, 
                where<br>
                the people, as did also the inhabitants of Britain, often cried 
                in<br>
                alarm, &quot;Deliver us from the wild northmen.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Life and noisy pleasure came with them into the castle of the<br>
                Viking on the moorland. A great cask of mead was drawn into the<br>
                hall, piles of wood blazed, cattle were slain and served up, that 
                they<br>
                might feast in reality, The priest who offered the sacrifice sprinkled<br>
                the devoted parishioners with the warm blood; the fire crackled, 
                and<br>
                the smoke rolled along beneath the roof; the soot fell upon them<br>
                from the beams; but they were used to all these things. Guests 
                were<br>
                invited, and received handsome presents. All wrongs and unfaithfulness 
                were forgotten. They drank deeply, and threw in each other's faces 
                the bones that were left, which was looked upon as a sign of good 
                feeling amongst them. A bard, who was a kind of musician as well 
                as warrior, and who had been with the Viking in his expedition, 
                and knew what to sing about, gave them one of his best songs, 
                in which they heard all their warlike deeds praised, and every 
                wonderful action brought forward with honor. Every verse ended 
                with this refrain,-</p>
              <p> &quot;Gold and possessions will flee away,<br>
                Friends and foes must die one day;<br>
                Every man on earth must die,<br>
                But a famous name will never die.&quot;</p>
              <p>And with that they beat upon their shields, and hammered upon 
                the<br>
                table with knives and bones, in a most outrageous manner.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Viking's wife sat upon a raised cross seat in the open hall.<br>
                She wore a silk dress, golden bracelets, and large amber beads. 
                She<br>
                was in costly attire, and the bard named her in his song, and 
                spoke of<br>
                the rich treasure of gold which she had brought to her husband. 
                Her<br>
                husband had already seen the wonderfully beautiful child in the<br>
                daytime, and was delighted with her beauty; even her wild ways 
                pleased him. He said the little maiden would grow up to be a heroine, 
                with the strong will and determination of a man. She would never 
                wink her eyes, even if, in joke, an expert hand should attempt 
                to cut off her eye-brows with a sharp sword.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The full cask of mead soon became empty, and a fresh one was<br>
                brought in; for these were people who liked plenty to eat and 
                drink.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The old proverb, which every one knows, says that &quot;the cattle 
                know<br>
                when to leave their pasture, but a foolish man knows not the measure<br>
                of his own appetite.&quot; Yes, they all knew this; but men may 
                know what<br>
                is right, and yet often do wrong. They also knew &quot;that even 
                the<br>
                welcome guest becomes wearisome when he sits too long in the house.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But there they remained; for pork and mead are good things. And 
                so<br>
                at the Viking's house they stayed, and enjoyed themselves; and 
                at<br>
                night the bondmen slept in the ashes, and dipped their fingers 
                in<br>
                the fat, and licked them. Oh, it was a delightful time!<br>
              </p>
              <p>Once more in the same year the Viking went forth, though the<br>
                storms of autumn had already commenced to roar. He went with his<br>
                warriors to the coast of Britain; he said that it was but an excursion<br>
                of pleasure across the water, so his wife remained at home with 
                the<br>
                little girl. After a while, it is quite certain the foster-mother<br>
                began to love the poor frog, with its gentle eyes and its deep<br>
                sighs, even better than the little beauty who bit and fought with<br>
                all around her.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The heavy, damp mists of autumn, which destroy the leaves of 
                the<br>
                wood, had already fallen upon forest and heath. Feathers of plucked<br>
                birds, as they call the snow, flew about in thick showers, and<br>
                winter was coming. The sparrows took possession of the stork's 
                nest, and conversed about the absent owners in their own fashion; 
                and they, the stork pair and all their young ones, where were 
                they staying now? The storks might have been found in the land 
                of Egypt, where the sun's rays shone forth bright and warm, as 
                it does here at<br>
                midsummer. Tamarinds and acacias were in full bloom all over the<br>
                country, the crescent of Mahomet glittered brightly from the cupolas<br>
                of the mosques, and on the slender pinnacles sat many of the storks,<br>
                resting after their long journey. Swarms of them took divided<br>
                possession of the nests- nests which lay close to each other between<br>
                the venerable columns, and crowded the arches of temples in<br>
                forgotten cities. The date and the palm lifted themselves as a<br>
                screen or as a sun-shade over them. The gray pyramids looked like<br>
                broken shadows in the clear air and the far-off desert, where 
                the<br>
                ostrich wheels his rapid flight, and the lion, with his subtle 
                eyes,<br>
                gazes at the marble sphinx which lies half buried in sand. The<br>
                waters of the Nile had retreated, and the whole bed of the river 
                was<br>
                covered with frogs, which was a most acceptable prospect for the 
                stork families. The young storks thought their eyes deceived them,<br>
                everything around appeared so beautiful.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is always like this here, and this is how we live in 
                our<br>
                warm country,&quot; said the stork-mamma; and the thought made 
                the young ones almost beside themselves with pleasure.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Is there anything more to see?&quot; they asked; &quot;are 
                we going farther<br>
                into the country?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There is nothing further for us to see,&quot; answered 
                the<br>
                stork-mamma. &quot;Beyond this delightful region there are immense 
                forests,where the branches of the trees entwine round each other, 
                while prickly, creeping plants cover the paths, and only an elephant 
                could force a passage for himself with his great feet. The snakes 
                are too large, and the lizards too lively for us to catch. Then 
                there is the<br>
                desert; if you went there, your eyes would soon be full of sand 
                with<br>
                the lightest breeze, and if it should blow great guns, you would<br>
                most likely find yourself in a sand-drift. Here is the best place<br>
                for you, where there are frogs and locusts; here I shall remain, 
                and<br>
                so must you.&quot; And so they stayed.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The parents sat in the nest on the slender minaret, and rested,<br>
                yet still were busily employed in cleaning and smoothing their<br>
                feathers, and in sharpening their beaks against their red stockings;<br>
                then they would stretch out their necks, salute each other, and<br>
                gravely raise their heads with the high-polished forehead, and 
                soft,<br>
                smooth feathers, while their brown eyes shone with intelligence. 
                The<br>
                female young ones strutted about amid the moist rushes, glancing 
                at<br>
                the other young storks and making acquaintances, and swallowing 
                a frog at every third step, or tossing a little snake about with 
                their beaks, in a way they considered very becoming, and besides 
                it tasted very good. The young male storks soon began to quarrel; 
                they struck at each other with their wings, and pecked with their 
                beaks till the blood came. And in this manner many of the young 
                ladies and gentlemen were betrothed to each other: it was, of 
                course, what they wanted, and indeed what they lived for. Then 
                they returned to a nest, and there the quarrelling began afresh; 
                for in hot countries people are almost all violent and passionate. 
                But for all that it was pleasant,<br>
                especially for the old people, who watched them with great joy: 
                all<br>
                that their young ones did suited them. Every day here there was<br>
                sunshine, plenty to eat, and nothing to think of but pleasure. 
                But<br>
                in the rich castle of their Egyptian host, as they called him,<br>
                pleasure was not to be found. The rich and mighty lord of the 
                castle<br>
                lay on his couch, in the midst of the great hall, with its many<br>
                colored walls looking like the centre of a great tulip; but he 
                was<br>
                stiff and powerless in all his limbs, and lay stretched out like 
                a<br>
                mummy. His family and servants stood round him; he was not dead,<br>
                although he could scarcely be said to live. The healing moor-flower<br>
                from the north, which was to have been found and brought to him 
                by her who loved him so well, had not arrived. His young and beautiful<br>
                daughter who, in swan's plumage, had flown over land and seas 
                to the<br>
                distant north, had never returned. She is dead, so the two<br>
                swan-maidens had said when they came home; and they made up quite 
                a story about her, and this is what they told,-<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We three flew away together through the air,&quot; said 
                they: &quot;a<br>
                hunter caught sight of us, and shot at us with an arrow. The arrow<br>
                struck our young friend and sister, and slowly singing her farewell<br>
                song she sank down, a dying swan, into the forest lake. On the<br>
                shores of the lake, under a spreading birch-tree, we laid her 
                in the<br>
                cold earth. We had our revenge; we bound fire under the wings 
                of a<br>
                swallow, who had a nest on the thatched roof of the huntsman. 
                The<br>
                house took fire, and burst into flames; the hunter was burnt with<br>
                the house, and the light was reflected over the sea as far as 
                the<br>
                spreading birch, beneath which we laid her sleeping dust. She 
                will<br>
                never return to the land of Egypt.&quot; And then they both wept. 
                And<br>
                stork-papa, who heard the story, snapped with his beak so that 
                it<br>
                might be heard a long way off.<br>
              </p>
              <p>'Deceit and lies!&quot; cried he; &quot;I should like to run 
                my beak deep<br>
                into their chests.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And perhaps break it off,&quot; said the mamma stork, &quot;then 
                what a<br>
                sight you would be. Think first of yourself, and then of your<br>
                family; all others are nothing to us.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; said the stork-papa; &quot;but to-morrow 
                I can easily<br>
                place myself on the edge of the open cupola, when the learned 
                and wise men assemble to consult on the state of the sick man; 
                perhaps they may come a little nearer to the truth.&quot; And 
                the learned and wise men assembled together, and talked a great 
                deal on every point; but the stork could make no sense out of 
                anything they said; neither were<br>
                there any good results from their consultations, either for the 
                sick<br>
                man, or for his daughter in the marshy heath. When we listen to 
                what<br>
                people say in this world, we shall hear a great deal; but it is 
                an<br>
                advantage to know what has been said and done before, when we 
                listen to a conversation. The stork did, and we know at least 
                as much as he, the stork.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Love is a life-giver. The highest love produces the highest 
                life.<br>
                Only through love can the sick man be cured.&quot; This had been 
                said by<br>
                many, and even the learned men acknowledged that it was a wise 
                saying.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What a beautiful thought!&quot; exclaimed the papa stork 
                immediately.<br>
                &quot;I don't quite understand it,&quot; said the mamma stork, 
                when her<br>
                husband repeated it; &quot;however, it is not my fault, but the 
                fault of<br>
                the thought; whatever it may be, I have something else to think 
                of.&quot;<br>
                Now the learned men had spoken also of love between this one and<br>
                that one; of the difference of the love which we have for our<br>
                neighbor, to the love that exists between parents and children; 
                of the<br>
                love of the plant for the light, and how the germ springs forth 
                when<br>
                the sunbeam kisses the ground. All these things were so elaborately<br>
                and learnedly explained, that it was impossible for stork-papa 
                to<br>
                follow it, much less to talk about it. His thoughts on the subject<br>
                quite weighed him down; he stood the whole of the following day 
                on one leg, with half-shut eyes, thinking deeply. So much learning 
                was<br>
                quite a heavy weight for him to carry. One thing, however, the 
                papa<br>
                stork could understand. Every one, high and low, had from their 
                inmost hearts expressed their opinion that it was a great misfortune 
                for so many thousands of people- the whole country indeed- to 
                have this man so sick, with no hopes of his recovery. And what 
                joy and blessing it would spread around if he could by any means 
                be cured! </p>
              <p>But where bloomed the flower that could bring him health? They 
                had searched for it everywhere; in learned writings, in the shining 
                stars, in the weather and wind. Inquiries had been made in every 
                by-way that could be thought of, until at last the wise and learned 
                men has asserted, as we have been already told, that &quot;love, 
                the life-giver, could alone give new life to a father;&quot; and 
                in saying this, they had overdone<br>
                it, and said more than they understood themselves. They repeated 
                it,<br>
                and wrote it down as a recipe, &quot;Love is a life-giver.&quot; 
                But how could<br>
                such a recipe be prepared- that was a difficulty they could not<br>
                overcome. At last it was decided that help could only come from 
                the<br>
                princess herself, whose whole soul was wrapped up in her father,<br>
                especially as a plan had been adopted by her to enable her to 
                obtain a<br>
                remedy.<br>
              </p>
              <p>More than a year had passed since the princess had set out at<br>
                night, when the light of the young moon was soon lost beneath 
                the<br>
                horizon. She had gone to the marble sphinx in the desert, shaking<br>
                the sand from her sandals, and then passed through the long passage,<br>
                which leads to the centre of one of the great pyramids, where 
                the<br>
                mighty kings of antiquity, surrounded with pomp and splendor, 
                lie<br>
                veiled in the form of mummies. She had been told by the wise men, 
                that if she laid her head on the breast of one of them, from the 
                head she would learn where to find life and recovery for her father. 
                She had<br>
                performed all this, and in a dream had learnt that she must bring 
                home<br>
                to her father the lotus flower, which grows in the deep sea, near<br>
                the moors and heath in the Danish land. The very place and situation<br>
                had been pointed out to her, and she was told that the flower 
                would<br>
                restore her father to health and strength. And, therefore, she 
                had<br>
                gone forth from the land of Egypt, flying over to the open marsh 
                and<br>
                the wild moor in the plumage of a swan.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The papa and mamma storks knew all this, and we also know it<br>
                now. We know, too, that the Marsh King has drawn her down to<br>
                himself, and that to the loved ones at home she is forever dead. 
                One<br>
                of the wisest of them said, as the stork-mamma also said, &quot;That 
                in<br>
                some way she would, after all, manage to succeed;&quot; and so 
                at last they comforted themselves with this hope, and would wait 
                patiently; in fact, they could do nothing better.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I should like to get away the swan's feathers from those 
                two<br>
                treacherous princesses,&quot; said the papa stork; &quot;then, 
                at least, they<br>
                would not be able to fly over again to the wild moor, and do more<br>
                wickedness. I can hide the two suits of feathers over yonder, 
                till<br>
                we find some use for them.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But where will you put them?&quot; asked the mamma stork.<br>
                &quot;In our nest on the moor. I and the young ones will carry 
                them<br>
                by turns during our flight across; and as we return, should they 
                prove<br>
                too heavy for us, we shall be sure to find plenty of places on 
                the way<br>
                in which we can conceal them till our next journey. Certainly 
                one suit<br>
                of swan's feathers would be enough for the princess, but two are<br>
                always better. In those northern countries no one can have too 
                many<br>
                travelling wrappers.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No one will thank you for it,&quot; said stork-mamma; &quot;but 
                you are<br>
                master; and, excepting at breeding time, I have nothing to say.&quot;<br>
                In the Viking's castle on the wild moor, to which the storks<br>
                directed their flight in the following spring, the little maiden 
                still<br>
                remained. They had named her Helga, which was rather too soft 
                a name for a child with a temper like hers, although her form 
                was still<br>
                beautiful. Every month this temper showed itself in sharper<br>
                outlines; and in the course of years, while the storks still made<br>
                the same journeys in autumn to the hill, and in spring to the 
                moors,<br>
                the child grew to be almost a woman, and before any one seemed 
                aware of it, she was a wonderfully beautiful maiden of sixteen. 
                The casket was splendid, but the contents were worthless. She 
                was, indeed, wild and savage even in those hard, uncultivated 
                times. It was a pleasure to her to splash about with her white 
                hands in the warm blood of the horse which had been slain for 
                sacrifice. In one of her wild moods she bit off the head of the 
                black cock, which the priest was about to slay for the sacrifice. 
                To her foster-father she said one day, &quot;If thine enemy were 
                to pull down thine house about thy ears, and thou shouldest be 
                sleeping in unconscious security, I would not wake thee; even 
                if I had the power I would never do it, for my ears still tingle 
                with the blow that thou gavest me years ago. I have never forgotten 
                it.&quot; But the Viking treated her words as a joke; he was, 
                like every one else, bewitched with her beauty, and knew nothing 
                of the change in the form and temper of Helga at night. Without 
                a saddle, she would sit on a horse as if she were a part of it, 
                while it rushed along at full speed; nor would she spring from 
                its back, even when it<br>
                quarrelled with other horses and bit them. She would often leap 
                from<br>
                the high shore into the sea with all her clothes on, and swim 
                to<br>
                meet the Viking, when his boat was steering home towards the shore.<br>
                She once cut off a long lock of her beautiful hair, and twisted 
                it<br>
                into a string for her bow. &quot;If a thing is to be done well,&quot; 
                said<br>
                she, &quot;I must do it myself.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Viking's wife was, for the time in which she lived, a woman 
                of<br>
                strong character and will; but, compared to her daughter, she 
                was a<br>
                gentle, timid woman, and she knew that a wicked sorcerer had the<br>
                terrible child in his power. It was sometimes as if Helga acted 
                from<br>
                sheer wickedness; for often when her mother stood on the threshold<br>
                of the door, or stepped into the yard, she would seat herself 
                on the<br>
                brink of the well, wave her arms and legs in the air, and suddenly<br>
                fall right in. Here she was able, from her frog nature, to dip 
                and<br>
                dive about in the water of the deep well, until at last she would<br>
                climb forth like a cat, and come back into the hall dripping with<br>
                water, so that the green leaves that were strewed on the floor 
                were<br>
                whirled round, and carried away by the streams that flowed from 
                her.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But there was one time of the day which placed a check upon Helga.<br>
                It was the evening twilight; when this hour arrived she became 
                quiet<br>
                and thoughtful, and allowed herself to be advised and led; then 
                also a<br>
                secret feeling seemed to draw her towards her mother. And as usual,<br>
                when the sun set, and the transformation took place, both in body<br>
                and mind, inwards and outwards, she would remain quiet and mournful, 
                with her form shrunk together in the shape of a frog. Her body 
                was much larger than those animals ever are, and on this account 
                it was much more hideous in appearance; for she looked like a 
                wretched dwarf, with a frog's head, and webbed fingers. Her eyes 
                had a most piteous expression; she was without a voice, excepting 
                a hollow, croaking sound, like the smothered sobs of a dreaming 
                child.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the Viking's wife took her on her lap, and forgot the ugly<br>
                form, as she looked into the mournful eyes, and often said, &quot;I 
                could<br>
                wish that thou wouldst always remain my dumb frog child, for thou<br>
                art too terrible when thou art clothed in a form of beauty.&quot; 
                And the<br>
                Viking woman wrote Runic characters against sorcery and spells 
                of<br>
                sickness, and threw them over the wretched child; but they did 
                no<br>
                good.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;One can scarcely believe that she was ever small enough 
                to lie in<br>
                the cup of the water-lily,&quot; said the papa stork; &quot;and 
                now she is grown<br>
                up, and the image of her Egyptian mother, especially about the 
                eyes.<br>
                Ah, we shall never see her again; perhaps she has not discovered 
                how<br>
                to help herself, as you and the wise men said she would. Year 
                after<br>
                year have I flown across and across the moor, but there was no 
                sign of her being still alive. Yes, and I may as well tell you 
                that you that<br>
                each year, when I arrived a few days before you to repair the 
                nest,<br>
                and put everything in its place, I have spent a whole night flying<br>
                here and there over the marshy lake, as if I had been an owl or 
                a bat,<br>
                but all to no purpose. The two suit of swan's plumage, which I 
                and the young ones dragged over here from the land of the Nile, 
                are of no use; trouble enough it was to us to bring them here 
                in three journeys,<br>
                and now they are lying at the bottom of the nest; and if a fire 
                should<br>
                happen to break out, and the wooden house be burnt down, they 
                would be destroyed.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And our good nest would be destroyed, too,&quot; said the 
                mamma stork;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;but you think less of that than of your plumage stuff and 
                your<br>
                moor-princess. Go and stay with her in the marsh if you like. 
                You<br>
                are a bad father to your own children, as I have told you already,<br>
                when I hatched my first brood. I only hope neither we nor our 
                children may have an arrow sent through our wings, owing to that 
                wild girl.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Helga does not know in the least what she is about. We have lived 
                in<br>
                this house longer than she has, she should think of that, and 
                we<br>
                have never forgotten our duty. We have paid every year our toll 
                of a<br>
                feather, an egg, and a young one, as it is only right we should 
                do.<br>
              </p>
              <p>You don't suppose I can wander about the court-yard, or go<br>
                everywhere as I used to do in old times. I can do it in Egypt, 
                where I<br>
                can be a companion of the people, without forgetting myself. But<br>
                here I cannot go and peep into the pots and kettles as I do there. 
                No,<br>
                I can only sit up here and feel angry with that girl, the little<br>
                wretch; and I am angry with you, too; you should have left her 
                lying<br>
                in the water lily, then no one would have known anything about 
                her.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You are far better than your conversation,&quot; said the 
                papa<br>
                stork; &quot;I know you better than you know yourself.&quot; And 
                with that he<br>
                gave a hop, and flapped his wings twice, proudly; then he stretched<br>
                his neck and flew, or rather soared away, without moving his outspread 
                wings. He went on for some distance, and then he gave a great 
                flap with his wings and flew on his course at a rapid rate, his 
                head and neck bending proudly before him, while the sun's rays 
                fell on his glossy plumage.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;He is the handsomest of them all,&quot; said the mamma 
                stork, as she<br>
                watched him; &quot;but I won't tell him so.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Early in the autumn, the Viking again returned home laden with<br>
                spoil, and bringing prisoners with him. Among them was a young<br>
                Christian priest, one of those who contemned the gods of the north.<br>
                Often lately there had been, both in hall and chamber, a talk 
                of the<br>
                new faith which was spreading far and wide in the south, and which,<br>
                through the means of the holy Ansgarius, had already reached as 
                far as Hedeby on the Schlei. Even Helga had heard of this belief 
                in the<br>
                teachings of One who was named Christ, and who for the love of<br>
                mankind, and for their redemption, had given up His life. But 
                to her<br>
                all this had, as it were, gone in one ear and out the other. It 
                seemed<br>
                that she only understood the meaning of the word &quot;love,&quot; 
                when in the<br>
                form of a miserable frog she crouched together in the corner of 
                the<br>
                sleeping chamber; but the Viking's wife had listened to the<br>
                wonderful story, and had felt herself strangely moved by it.<br>
                On their return, after this voyage, the men spoke of the beautiful<br>
                temples built of polished stone, which had been raised for the<br>
                public worship of this holy love. Some vessels, curiously formed 
                of<br>
                massive gold, had been brought home among the booty. There was 
                a<br>
                peculiar fragrance about them all, for they were incense vessels,<br>
                which had been swung before the altars in the temples by the Christian 
                priests. In the deep stony cellars of the castle, the young<br>
                Christian priest was immured, and his hands and feet tied together<br>
                with strips of bark. The Viking's wife considered him as beautiful<br>
                as Baldur, and his distress raised her pity; but Helga said he 
                ought<br>
                to have ropes fastened to his heels, and be tied to the tails 
                of<br>
                wild animals.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I would let the dogs loose after him&quot; she said; &quot;over 
                the moor<br>
                and across the heath. Hurrah! that would be a spectacle for the<br>
                gods, and better still to follow in its course.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the Viking would not allow him to die such a death as that,<br>
                especially as he was the disowned and despiser of the high gods. 
                In<br>
                a few days, he had decided to have him offered as a sacrifice 
                on the<br>
                blood-stone in the grove. For the first time, a man was to be<br>
                sacrificed here. Helga begged to be allowed to sprinkle the<br>
                assembled people with the blood of the priest. She sharpened her<br>
                glittering knife; and when one of the great, savage dogs, who 
                were<br>
                running about the Viking's castle in great numbers, sprang towards<br>
                her, she thrust the knife into his side, merely, as she said, 
                to prove<br>
                its sharpness.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Viking's wife looked at the wild, badly disposed girl, with<br>
                great sorrow; and when night came on, and her daughter's beautiful<br>
                form and disposition were changed, she spoke in eloquent words 
                to<br>
                Helga of the sorrow and deep grief that was in her heart. The 
                ugly<br>
                frog, in its monstrous shape, stood before her, and raised its 
                brown<br>
                mournful eyes to her face, listening to her words, and seeming 
                to<br>
                understand them with the intelligence of a human being.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Never once to my lord and husband has a word passed my 
                lips of<br>
                what I have to suffer through you; my heart is full of grief about<br>
                you,&quot; said the Viking's wife. &quot;The love of a mother 
                is greater and<br>
                more powerful than I ever imagined. But love never entered thy<br>
                heart; it is cold and clammy, like the plants on the moor.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the miserable form trembled; it was as if these words had<br>
                touched an invisible bond between body and soul, for great tears 
                stood in the eyes.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;A bitter time will come for thee at last,&quot; continued 
                the Viking's<br>
                wife; &quot;and it will be terrible for me too. It had been better 
                for thee<br>
                if thou hadst been left on the high-road, with the cold night 
                wind<br>
                to lull thee to sleep.&quot; And the Viking's wife shed bitter 
                tears, and<br>
                went away in anger and sorrow, passing under the partition of 
                furs,<br>
                which hung loose over the beam and divided the hall.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The shrivelled frog still sat in the corner alone. Deep silence<br>
                reigned around. At intervals, a half-stifled sigh was heard from 
                its<br>
                inmost soul; it was the soul of Helga. It seemed in pain, as if 
                a<br>
                new life were arising in her heart. Then she took a step forward 
                and<br>
                listened; then stepped again forward, and seized with her clumsy 
                hands the heavy bar which was laid across the door. Gently, and 
                with much trouble, she pushed back the bar, as silently lifted 
                the latch, and<br>
                then took up the glimmering lamp which stood in the ante-chamber 
                of<br>
                the hall. It seemed as if a stronger will than her own gave her<br>
                strength. She removed the iron bolt from the closed cellar-door, 
                and<br>
                slipped in to the prisoner. He was slumbering. She touched him 
                with<br>
                her cold, moist hand, and as he awoke and caught sight of the<br>
                hideous form, he shuddered as if he beheld a wicked apparition. 
                She<br>
                drew her knife, cut through the bonds which confined his hands 
                and<br>
                feet, and beckoned to him to follow her. He uttered some holy 
                names<br>
                and made the sign of the cross, while the form remained motionless<br>
                by his side.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Who art thou?&quot; he asked, &quot;whose outward appearance 
                is that of<br>
                an animal, while thou willingly performest acts of mercy?&quot;<br>
                The frog-figure beckoned to him to follow her, and led him through<br>
                a long gallery concealed by hanging drapery to the stables, and 
                then<br>
                pointed to a horse. He mounted upon it, and she sprang up also<br>
                before him, and held tightly by the animal's mane. The prisoner<br>
                understood her, and they rode on at a rapid trot, by a road which 
                he<br>
                would never have found by himself, across the open heath. He forgot<br>
                her ugly form, and only thought how the mercy and loving-kindness 
                of the Almighty was acting through this hideous apparition. As 
                he offered pious prayers and sang holy songs of praise, she trembled. 
                Was it the effect of prayer and praise that caused this? or, was 
                she<br>
                shuddering in the cold morning air at the thought of approaching<br>
                twilight? What were her feelings? She raised herself up, and wanted 
                to<br>
                stop the horse and spring off, but the Christian priest held her<br>
                back with all his might, and then sang a pious song, as if this<br>
                could loosen the wicked charm that had changed her into the<br>
                semblance of a frog.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the horse galloped on more wildly than before. The sky painted<br>
                itself red, the first sunbeam pierced through the clouds, and 
                in the<br>
                clear flood of sunlight the frog became changed. It was Helga 
                again,<br>
                young and beautiful, but with a wicked demoniac spirit. He held 
                now<br>
                a beautiful young woman in his arms, and he was horrified at the<br>
                sight. He stopped the horse, and sprang from its back. He imagined<br>
                that some new sorcery was at work. But Helga also leaped from 
                the<br>
                horse and stood on the ground. The child's short garment reached<br>
                only to her knee. She snatched the sharp knife from her girdle, 
                and<br>
                rushed like lightning at the astonished priest. &quot;Let me get 
                at<br>
                thee!&quot; she cried; &quot;let me get at thee, that I may plunge 
                this knife<br>
                into thy body. Thou art pale as ashes, thou beardless slave.&quot; 
                She<br>
                pressed in upon him. They struggled with each other in heavy combat, 
                but it was as if an invisible power had been given to the Christian 
                in the struggle. He held her fast, and the old oak under which 
                they stood seemed to help him, for the loosened roots on the ground 
                became entangled in the maiden's feet, and held them fast. Close 
                by rose a bubbling spring, and he sprinkled Helga's face and neck 
                with the water, commanded the unclean spirit to come forth, and 
                pronounced upon her a Christian blessing. But the water of faith 
                has no power unless the well-spring of faith flows within. And 
                yet even here its power was shown; something more than the mere 
                strength of a man opposed itself, through his means, against the 
                evil which struggled within her. His holy action seemed to overpower 
                her. She dropped her arms, glanced at him with pale cheeks and 
                looks of amazement. He appeared to her a mighty magician skilled 
                in secret arts; his language was the darkest magic to her, and 
                the movements of his hands in the air were as the secret signs 
                of a magician's wand. She would not have blinked had he waved 
                over her head a sharp knife or a glittering axe; but she shrunk 
                from him as he signed her with the sign of the cross on her forehead 
                and breast, and sat before him like a tame bird, with her head 
                bowed down. Then he spoke to her, in gentle words, of the deed 
                of love she had performed for him during the night, when she had 
                come to him in the form of an ugly frog, to loosen his bonds, 
                and to lead him forth to life and light; and he told her that 
                she was bound in closer fetters than he had been, and that she 
                could recover also life and light by his means. He would take 
                her to Hedeby to St. Ansgarius, and there, in that Christian town, 
                the spell of the sorcerer would be removed. But he would not let 
                her sit before him on the horse, though of her own free will she 
                wished to do so. </p>
              <p>&quot;Thou must sit behind me, not before me,&quot; said he. 
                &quot;Thy magic beauty has a magic power which comes from an evil 
                origin, and I fear it; still I am sure to overcome through my 
                faith in Christ.&quot; Then he knelt down, and prayed with pious 
                fervor. It was as if the quiet woodland were a holy church consecrated 
                by his worship. The birds sang as if they were also of this new 
                congregation; and the fragrance of the wild flowers was as the 
                ambrosial perfume of incense; while, above all, sounded the words 
                of Scripture, &quot;A light to them that sit in darkness and in 
                the shadow of death, to guide their feet into the way of peace.&quot; 
                And he spoke these words with the deep longing of his whole nature.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the horse that had carried them in wild career stood<br>
                quietly by, plucking at the tall bramble-bushes, till the ripe 
                young<br>
                berries fell down upon Helga's hands, as if inviting her to eat.<br>
                Patiently she allowed herself to be lifted on the horse, and sat 
                there<br>
                like a somnambulist- as one who walked in his sleep. The Christian<br>
                bound two branches together with bark, in the form of a cross, 
                and<br>
                held it on high as they rode through the forest. The way gradually<br>
                grew thicker of brushwood, as they rode along, till at last it<br>
                became a trackless wilderness. Bushes of the wild sloe here and<br>
                there blocked up the path, so that they had to ride over them. 
                The<br>
                bubbling spring formed not a stream, but a marsh, round which 
                also<br>
                they were obliged to guide the horse; still there were strength 
                and<br>
                refreshment in the cool forest breeze, and no trifling power in 
                the<br>
                gentle words spoken in faith and Christian love by the young priest,<br>
                whose inmost heart yearned to lead this poor lost one into the 
                way<br>
                of light and life. It is said that rain-drops can make a hollow 
                in the<br>
                hardest stone, and the waves of the sea can smooth and round the 
                rough edges of the rocks; so did the dew of mercy fall upon Helga, 
                softening what was hard, and smoothing what was rough in her character. 
                These effects did not yet appear; she was not herself aware of 
                them; neither does the seed in the lap of earth know, when the 
                refreshing dew and the warm sunbeams fall upon it, that it contains 
                within itself power by which it will flourish and bloom. The song 
                of the mother sinks into the heart of the child, and the little 
                one prattles the words after her, without understanding their 
                meaning; but after a time the thoughts expand, and what has been 
                heard in childhood seems to the mind clear and bright. So now 
                the &quot;Word,&quot; which is all-powerful to create, was working 
                in the heart of Helga.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They rode forth from the thick forest, crossed the heath, and<br>
                again entered a pathless wood. Here, towards evening, they met 
                with<br>
                robbers.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Where hast thou stolen that beauteous maiden?&quot; cried 
                the robbers,<br>
                seizing the horse by the bridle, and dragging the two riders from<br>
                its back.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The priest had nothing to defend himself with, but the knife 
                he<br>
                had taken from Helga, and with this he struck out right and left.<br>
                One of the robbers raised his axe against him; but the young priest<br>
                sprang on one side, and avoided the blow, which fell with great<br>
                force on the horse's neck, so that the blood gushed forth, and 
                the<br>
                animal sunk to the ground. Then Helga seemed suddenly to awake 
                from her long, deep reverie; she threw herself hastily upon the 
                dying<br>
                animal. The priest placed himself before her, to defend and shelter<br>
                her; but one of the robbers swung his iron axe against the Christian's<br>
                head with such force that it was dashed to pieces, the blood and<br>
                brains were scattered about, and he fell dead upon the ground. 
                Then<br>
                the robbers seized beautiful Helga by her white arms and slender<br>
                waist; but at that moment the sun went down, and as its last ray<br>
                disappeared, she was changed into the form of a frog. A greenish 
                white mouth spread half over her face; her arms became thin and 
                slimy; while broad hands, with webbed fingers, spread themselves 
                out like fans.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the robbers, in terror, let her go, and she stood among 
                them, a<br>
                hideous monster; and as is the nature of frogs to do, she hopped 
                up as high as her own size, and disappeared in the thicket. Then 
                the robbers knew that this must be the work of an evil spirit 
                or some secret sorcery, and, in a terrible fright, they ran hastily 
                from the spot.<br>
                The full moon had already risen, and was shining in all her<br>
                radiant splendor over the earth, when from the thicket, in the 
                form of<br>
                a frog, crept poor Helga. She stood still by the corpse of the<br>
                Christian priest, and the carcase of the dead horse. She looked 
                at<br>
                them with eyes that seemed to weep, and from the frog's head came<br>
                forth a croaking sound, as when a child bursts into tears. She 
                threw<br>
                herself first upon one, and then upon the other; brought water 
                in<br>
                her hand, which, from being webbed, was large and hollow, and 
                poured it over them; but they were dead, and dead they would remain. 
                She understood that at last. Soon wild animals would come and 
                tear their dead bodies; but no, that must not happen. Then she 
                dug up the earth, as deep as she was able, that she might prepare 
                a grave for them. She had nothing but a branch of a tree and her 
                two hands, between the fingers of which the webbed skin stretched, 
                and they were torn by the work, while the blood ran down her hands. 
                She saw at last that her work would be useless, more than she 
                could<br>
                accomplish; so she fetched more water, and washed the face of 
                the<br>
                dead, and then covered it with fresh green leaves; she also brought<br>
                large boughs and spread over him, and scattered dried leaves between<br>
                the branches. Then she brought the heaviest stones that she could<br>
                carry, and laid them over the dead body, filling up the crevices<br>
                with moss, till she thought she had fenced in his resting-place<br>
                strongly enough. The difficult task had employed her the whole<br>
                night; and as the sun broke forth, there stood the beautiful Helga<br>
                in all her loveliness, with her bleeding hands, and, for the first<br>
                time, with tears on her maiden cheeks. It was, in this transformation,<br>
                as if two natures were striving together within her; her whole 
                frame<br>
                trembled, and she looked around her as if she had just awoke from 
                a<br>
                painful dream. She leaned for support against the trunk of a slender<br>
                tree, and at last climbed to the topmost branches, like a cat, 
                and<br>
                seated herself firmly upon them. She remained there the whole 
                day,<br>
                sitting alone, like a frightened squirrel, in the silent solitude 
                of<br>
                the wood, where the rest and stillness is as the calm of death.<br>
                Butterflies fluttered around her, and close by were several<br>
                ant-hills, each with its hundreds of busy little creatures moving<br>
                quickly to and fro. In the air, danced myriads of gnats, swarm 
                upon<br>
                swarm, troops of buzzing flies, ladybirds, dragon-flies with golden<br>
                wings, and other little winged creatures. The worm crawled forth<br>
                from the moist ground, and the moles crept out; but, excepting<br>
                these, all around had the stillness of death: but when people 
                say<br>
                this, they do not quite understand themselves what they mean. 
                None<br>
                noticed Helga but a flock of magpies, which flew chattering round<br>
                the top of the tree on which she sat. These birds hopped close 
                to<br>
                her on the branches with bold curiosity. A glance from her eyes 
                was<br>
                a signal to frighten them away, and they were not clever enough 
                to<br>
                find out who she was; indeed she hardly knew herself.<br>
              </p>
              <p>When the sun was near setting, and the evening's twilight about 
                to<br>
                commence, the approaching transformation aroused her to fresh<br>
                exertion. She let herself down gently from the tree, and, as the<br>
                last sunbeam vanished, she stood again in the wrinkled form of 
                a frog, with the torn, webbed skin on her hands, but her eyes 
                now gleamed with more radiant beauty than they had ever possessed 
                in her most beautiful form of loveliness; they were now pure, 
                mild maidenly eyes that shone forth in the face of a frog. They 
                showed the existence of deep feeling and a human heart, and the 
                beauteous eyes overflowed with tears, weeping precious drops that 
                lightened the heart.<br>
              </p>
              <p>On the raised mound which she had made as a grave for the dead<br>
                priest, she found the cross made of the branches of a tree, the 
                last<br>
                work of him who now lay dead and cold beneath it. A sudden thought 
                came to Helga, and she lifted up the cross and planted it upon 
                the grave, between the stones that covered him and the dead horse. 
                The sad recollection brought the tears to her eyes, and in this 
                gentle spirit she traced the same sign in the sand round the grave; 
                and as she formed, with both her hands, the sign of the cross, 
                the web skin fell from them like a torn glove. She washed her 
                hands in the water of the spring, and gazed with astonishment 
                at their delicate whiteness.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Again she made the holy sign in the air, between herself and 
                the<br>
                dead man; her lips trembled, her tongue moved, and the name which<br>
                she in her ride through the forest had so often heard spoken, 
                rose<br>
                to her lips, and she uttered the words, &quot;Jesus Christ.&quot; 
                Then the<br>
                frog skin fell from her; she was once more a lovely maiden. Her 
                head<br>
                bent wearily, her tired limbs required rest, and then she slept.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Her sleep, however, was short. Towards midnight, she awoke; before<br>
                her stood the dead horse, prancing and full of life, which shone 
                forth<br>
                from his eyes and from his wounded neck. Close by his side appeared 
                the murdered Christian priest, more beautiful than Baldur, as 
                the Viking's wife had said; but now he came as if in a flame of 
                fire. </p>
              <p>Such gravity, such stern justice, such a piercing glance shone 
                from his large, gentle eyes, that it seemed to penetrate into 
                every corner of<br>
                her heart. Beautiful Helga trembled at the look, and her memory<br>
                returned with a power as if it had been the day of judgment. Every<br>
                good deed that had been done for her, every loving word that had<br>
                been said, were vividly before her mind. She understood now that<br>
                love had kept her here during the day of her trial; while the 
                creature<br>
                formed of dust and clay, soul and spirit, had wrestled and struggled<br>
                with evil. She acknowledged that she had only followed the impulses 
                of an evil disposition, that she had done nothing to cure herself;<br>
                everything had been given her, and all had happened as it were 
                by<br>
                the ordination of Providence. She bowed herself humbly, confessed<br>
                her great imperfections in the sight of Him who can read every 
                fault<br>
                of the heart, and then the priest spoke. &quot;Daughter of the 
                moorland,<br>
                thou hast come from the swamp and the marshy earth, but from this 
                thou shalt arise. The sunlight shining into thy inmost soul proves 
                the<br>
                origin from which thou hast really sprung, and has restored the 
                body<br>
                to its natural form. I am come to thee from the land of the dead,<br>
                and thou also must pass through the valley to reach the holy mountains 
                where mercy and perfection dwell. I cannot lead thee to Hedeby 
                that thou mayst receive Christian baptism, for first thou must 
                remove the thick veil with which the waters of the moorland are 
                shrouded, and bring forth from its depths the living author of 
                thy being and thy life. Till this is done, thou canst not receive 
                consecration.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then he lifted her on the horse and gave her a golden censer,<br>
                similar to those she had already seen at the Viking's house. A 
                sweet<br>
                perfume arose from it, while the open wound in the forehead of 
                the<br>
                slain priest, shone with the rays of a diamond. He took the cross 
                from<br>
                the grave, and held it aloft, and now they rode through the air 
                over<br>
                the rustling trees, over the hills where warriors lay buried each 
                by<br>
                his dead war-horse; and the brazen monumental figures rose up 
                and<br>
                galloped forth, and stationed themselves on the summits of the<br>
                hills. The golden crescent on their foreheads, fastened with golden<br>
                knots, glittered in the moonlight, and their mantles floated in 
                the<br>
                wind. The dragon, that guards buried treasure, lifted his head 
                and<br>
                gazed after them. The goblins and the satyrs peeped out from beneath<br>
                the hills, and flitted to and fro in the fields, waving blue, 
                red, and<br>
                green torches, like the glowing sparks in burning paper. Over 
                woodland and heath, flood and fen, they flew on, till they reached 
                the wild moor, over which they hovered in broad circles. The Christian 
                priest held the cross aloft, and it glittered like gold, while 
                from his<br>
                lips sounded pious prayers. Beautiful Helga's voice joined with 
                his in<br>
                the hymns he sung, as a child joins in her mother's song. She 
                swung<br>
                the censer, and a wonderful fragrance of incense arose from it; 
                so<br>
                powerful, that the reeds and rushes of the moor burst forth into<br>
                blossom. Each germ came forth from the deep ground: all that had<br>
                life raised itself. Blooming water-lilies spread themselves forth 
                like<br>
                a carpet of wrought flowers, and upon them lay a slumbering woman,<br>
                young and beautiful. Helga fancied that it was her own image she 
                saw<br>
                reflected in the still water. But it was her mother she beheld, 
                the<br>
                wife of the Marsh King, the princess from the land of the Nile.<br>
                The dead Christian priest desired that the sleeping woman should<br>
                be lifted on the horse, but the horse sank beneath the load, as 
                if<br>
                he had been a funeral pall fluttering in the wind. But the sign 
                of the<br>
                cross made the airy phantom strong, and then the three rode away<br>
                from the marsh to firm ground.<br>
              </p>
              <p>At the same moment the cock crew in the Viking's castle, and 
                the<br>
                dream figures dissolved and floated away in the air, but mother 
                and<br>
                daughter stood opposite to each other.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Am I looking at my own image in the deep water?&quot; said 
                the mother.<br>
                &quot;Is it myself that I see represented on a white shield?&quot; 
                cried the<br>
                daughter.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then they came nearer to each other in a fond embrace. The<br>
                mother's heart beat quickly, and she understood the quickened<br>
                pulses. &quot;My child!&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;the flower 
                of my heart- my lotus<br>
                flower of the deep water!&quot; and she embraced her child again 
                and<br>
                wept, and the tears were as a baptism of new life and love for<br>
                Helga. &quot;In swan's plumage I came here,&quot; said the mother, 
                &quot;and here I<br>
                threw off my feather dress. Then I sank down through the wavering<br>
                ground, deep into the marsh beneath, which closed like a wall 
                around<br>
                me; I found myself after a while in fresher water; still a power<br>
                drew me down deeper and deeper. I felt the weight of sleep upon 
                my<br>
                eyelids. Then I slept, and dreams hovered round me. It seemed 
                to me as if I were again in the pyramids of Egypt, and yet the 
                waving elder<br>
                trunk that had frightened me on the moor stood ever before me. 
                I<br>
                observed the clefts and wrinkles in the stem; they shone forth 
                in<br>
                strange colors, and took the form of hieroglyphics. It was the 
                mummy case on which I gazed. At last it burst, and forth stepped 
                the<br>
                thousand years' old king, the mummy form, black as pitch, black 
                as the shining wood-snail, or the slimy mud of the swamp. Whether 
                it was really the mummy or the Marsh King I know not. He seized 
                me in his arms, and I felt as if I must die. When I recovered 
                myself, I found in my bosom a little bird, flapping its wings, 
                twittering and fluttering.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The bird flew away from my bosom, upwards towards the dark, heavy 
                canopy above me, but a long, green band kept it fastened to me. 
                I heard and understood the tenor of its longings. Freedom! sunlight! 
                to my father! Then I thought of my father, and the sunny land 
                of my birth, my life, and my love. Then I loosened the band, and 
                let the bird fly away to its home- to a father. Since that hour 
                I have<br>
                ceased to dream; my sleep has been long and heavy, till in this 
                very<br>
                hour, harmony and fragrance awoke me, and set me free.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The green band which fastened the wings of the bird to the<br>
                mother's heart, where did it flutter now? whither had it been<br>
                wafted? The stork only had seen it. The band was the green stalk,<br>
                the cup of the flower the cradle in which lay the child, that 
                now in<br>
                blooming beauty had been folded to the mother's heart.</p>
              <p><br>
                And while the two were resting in each other's arms, the old stork<br>
                flew round and round them in narrowing circles, till at length 
                he flew<br>
                away swiftly to his nest, and fetched away the two suits of swan's<br>
                feathers, which he had preserved there for many years. Then he<br>
                returned to the mother and daughter, and threw the swan's plumage 
                over them; the feathers immediately closed around them, and they 
                rose up from the earth in the form of two white swans.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And now we can converse with pleasure,&quot; said the stork-papa;<br>
                &quot;we can understand one another, although the beaks of birds 
                are so<br>
                different in shape. It is very fortunate that you came to-night.<br>
              </p>
              <p>To-morrow we should have been gone. The mother, myself and the<br>
                little ones, we're about to fly to the south. Look at me now: 
                I am<br>
                an old friend from the Nile, and a mother's heart contains more 
                than<br>
                her beak. She always said that the princess would know how to 
                help<br>
                herself. I and the young ones carried the swan's feathers over 
                here,<br>
                and I am glad of it now, and how lucky it is that I am here still.<br>
                When the day dawns we shall start with a great company of other<br>
                storks. We'll fly first, and you can follow in our track, so that<br>
                you cannot miss your way. I and the young ones will have an eye 
                upon you.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And the lotus-flower which I was to take with me,&quot; 
                said the<br>
                Egyptian princess, &quot;is flying here by my side, clothed in 
                swan's<br>
                feathers. The flower of my heart will travel with me; and so the<br>
                riddle is solved. Now for home! now for home!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But Helga said she could not leave the Danish land without once<br>
                more seeing her foster-mother, the loving wife of the Viking. 
                Each<br>
                pleasing recollection, each kind word, every tear from the heart 
                which<br>
                her foster-mother had wept for her, rose in her mind, and at that<br>
                moment she felt as if she loved this mother the best.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, we must go to the Viking's castle,&quot; said the 
                stork;<br>
                &quot;mother and the young ones are waiting for me there. How 
                they will<br>
                open their eyes and flap their wings! My wife, you see, does not 
                say<br>
                much; she is short and abrupt in her manner; but she means well, 
                for<br>
                all that. I will flap my wings at once, that they may hear us 
                coming.&quot;<br>
                Then stork-papa flapped his wings in first-rate style, and he 
                and<br>
                the swans flew away to the Viking's castle.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the castle, every one was in a deep sleep. It had been late<br>
                in the evening before the Viking's wife retired to rest. She was<br>
                anxious about Helga, who, three days before, had vanished with 
                the<br>
                Christian priest. Helga must have helped him in his flight, for 
                it was<br>
                her horse that was missed from the stable; but by what power had 
                all<br>
                this been accomplished? The Viking's wife thought of it with wonder,<br>
                thought on the miracles which they said could be performed by 
                those<br>
                who believed in the Christian faith, and followed its teachings. 
                These<br>
                passing thoughts formed themselves into a vivid dream, and it 
                seemed<br>
                to her that she was still lying awake on her couch, while without<br>
                darkness reigned. A storm arose; she heard the lake dashing and<br>
                rolling from east and west, like the waves of the North Sea or 
                the<br>
                Cattegat. The monstrous snake which, it is said, surrounds the 
                earth<br>
                in the depths of the ocean, was trembling in spasmodic convulsions.<br>
                The night of the fall of the gods was come, &quot;Ragnorock,&quot; 
                as the<br>
                heathens call the judgment-day, when everything shall pass away,<br>
                even the high gods themselves. The war trumpet sounded; riding 
                upon the rainbow, came the gods, clad in steel, to fight their 
                last<br>
                battle on the last battle-field. Before them flew the winged vampires,<br>
                and the dead warriors closed up the train. The whole firmament 
                was<br>
                ablaze with the northern lights, and yet the darkness triumphed. 
                It<br>
                was a terrible hour. And, close to the terrified woman, Helga 
                seemed<br>
                to be seated on the floor, in the hideous form of a frog, yet<br>
                trembling, and clinging to her foster-mother, who took her on 
                her lap,<br>
                and lovingly caressed her, hideous and frog-like as she was. The 
                air<br>
                was filled with the clashing of arms and the hissing of arrows, 
                as<br>
                if a storm of hail was descending upon the earth. It seemed to 
                her the<br>
                hour when earth and sky would burst asunder, and all things be<br>
                swallowed up in Saturn's fiery lake; but she knew that a new heaven<br>
                and a new earth would arise, and that corn-fields would wave where 
                now the lake rolled over desolate sands, and the ineffable God 
                reign. Then she saw rising from the region of the dead, Baldur 
                the gentle, the loving, and as the Viking's wife gazed upon him, 
                she recognized his countenance. It was the captive Christian priest. 
                &quot;White Christian!&quot; she exclaimed aloud, and with the 
                words, she pressed a kiss on the forehead of the hideous frog-child. 
                Then the frog-skin fell off, and Helga stood before her in all 
                her beauty, more lovely and<br>
                gentle-looking, and with eyes beaming with love. She kissed the<br>
                hands of her foster-mother, blessed her for all her fostering 
                love and<br>
                care during the days of her trial and misery, for the thoughts 
                she had<br>
                suggested and awoke in her heart, and for naming the Name which 
                she now repeated. Then beautiful Helga rose as a mighty swan, 
                and spread her wings with the rushing sound of troops of birds 
                of passage flying through the air.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the Viking's wife awoke, but she still heard the rushing<br>
                sound without. She knew it was the time for the storks to depart,<br>
                and that it must be their wings which she heard. She felt she 
                should<br>
                like to see them once more, and bid them farewell. She rose from 
                her<br>
                couch, stepped out on the threshold, and beheld, on the ridge 
                of the<br>
                roof, a party of storks ranged side by side. Troops of the birds<br>
                were flying in circles over the castle and the highest trees; 
                but just<br>
                before her, as she stood on the threshold and close to the well<br>
                where Helga had so often sat and alarmed her with her wildness, 
                now<br>
                stood two swans, gazing at her with intelligent eyes. Then she<br>
                remembered her dream, which still appeared to her as a reality. 
                She<br>
                thought of Helga in the form of a swan. She thought of a Christian<br>
                priest, and suddenly a wonderful joy arose in her heart. The swans<br>
                flapped their wings and arched their necks as if to offer her 
                a<br>
                greeting, and the Viking's wife spread out her arms towards them, 
                as<br>
                if she accepted it, and smiled through her tears. She was roused<br>
                from deep thought by a rustling of wings and snapping of beaks; 
                all<br>
                the storks arose, and started on their journey towards the south.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We will not wait for the swans,&quot; said the mamma stork; 
                &quot;if they<br>
                want to go with us, let them come now; we can't sit here till 
                the<br>
                plovers start. It is a fine thing after all to travel in families, 
                not<br>
                like the finches and the partridges. There the male and the female<br>
                birds fly in separate flocks, which, to speak candidly, I consider<br>
                very unbecoming.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What are those swans flapping their wings for?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well, every one flies in his own fashion,&quot; said the 
                papa stork.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The swans fly in an oblique line; the cranes, in the form 
                of a<br>
                triangle; and the plovers, in a curved line like a snake.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Don't talk about snakes while we are flying up here,&quot; 
                said<br>
                stork-mamma. &quot;It puts ideas into the children's heads that 
                can not<br>
                be realized.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Are those the high mountains I have heard spoken of?&quot; 
                asked<br>
                Helga, in the swan's plumage.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They are storm-clouds driving along beneath us,&quot; replied 
                her<br>
                mother.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What are yonder white clouds that rise so high?&quot; again 
                inquired<br>
                Helga.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Those are mountains covered with perpetual snows, that 
                you see<br>
                yonder,&quot; said her mother. And then they flew across the Alps 
                towards the blue Mediterranean.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Africa's land! Egyptia's strand!&quot; sang the daughter 
                of the<br>
                Nile, in her swan's plumage, as from the upper air she caught 
                sight of<br>
                her native land, a narrow, golden, wavy strip on the shores of 
                the<br>
                Nile; the other birds espied it also and hastened their flight.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I can smell the Nile mud and the wet frogs,&quot; said 
                the<br>
                stork-mamma, &quot;and I begin to feel quite hungry. Yes, now 
                you shall<br>
                taste something nice, and you will see the marabout bird, and 
                the<br>
                ibis, and the crane. They all belong to our family, but they are 
                not<br>
                nearly so handsome as we are. They give themselves great airs,<br>
                especially the ibis. The Egyptians have spoilt him. They make 
                a<br>
                mummy of him, and stuff him with spices. I would rather be stuffed<br>
                with live frogs, and so would you, and so you shall. Better have<br>
                something in your inside while you are alive, than to be made 
                a parade<br>
                of after you are dead. That is my opinion, and I am always right.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The storks are come,&quot; was said in the great house 
                on the banks of<br>
                the Nile, where the lord lay in the hall on his downy cushions,<br>
                covered with a leopard skin, scarcely alive, yet not dead, waiting 
                and<br>
                hoping for the lotus-flower from the deep moorland in the far 
                north.<br>
                Relatives and servants were standing by his couch, when the two<br>
                beautiful swans who had come with the storks flew into the hall.<br>
                They threw off their soft white plumage, and two lovely female 
                forms<br>
                approached the pale, sick old man, and threw back their long hair, 
                and when Helga bent over her grandfather, redness came back to 
                his cheeks, his eyes brightened, and life returned to his benumbed 
                limbs. </p>
              <p>The old man rose up with health and energy renewed; daughter 
                and<br>
                grandchild welcomed him as joyfully as if with a morning greeting<br>
                after a long and troubled dream.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Joy reigned through the whole house, as well as in the stork's<br>
                nest; although there the chief cause was really the good food,<br>
                especially the quantities of frogs, which seemed to spring out 
                of<br>
                the ground in swarms.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the learned men hastened to note down, in flying<br>
                characters, the story of the two princesses, and spoke of the<br>
                arrival of the health-giving flower as a mighty event, which had<br>
                been a blessing to the house and the land. Meanwhile, the stork-papa<br>
                told the story to his family in his own way; but not till they 
                had<br>
                eaten and were satisfied; otherwise they would have had something 
                else to do than to listen to stories.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said the stork-mamma, when she had heard it, 
                &quot;you will<br>
                be made something of at last; I suppose they can do nothing less.&quot;<br>
                &quot;What could I be made?&quot; said stork-papa; &quot;what 
                have I done?-<br>
                just nothing.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You have done more than all the rest,&quot; she replied. 
                &quot;But for<br>
                you and the youngsters the two young princesses would never have<br>
                seen Egypt again, and the recovery of the old man would not have<br>
                been effected. You will become something. They must certainly 
                give you a doctor's hood, and our young ones will inherit it, 
                and their<br>
                children after them, and so on. You already look like an Egyptian<br>
                doctor, at least in my eyes.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I cannot quite remember the words I heard when I listened 
                on<br>
                the roof,&quot; said stork-papa, while relating the story to his 
                family;<br>
                &quot;all I know is, that what the wise men said was so complicated 
                and<br>
                so learned, that they received not only rank, but presents; even 
                the<br>
                head cook at the great house was honored with a mark of distinction,<br>
                most likely for the soup.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And what did you receive?&quot; said the stork-mamma. &quot;They<br>
                certainly ought not to forget the most important person in the 
                affair,<br>
                as you really are. The learned men have done nothing at all but 
                use<br>
                their tongues. Surely they will not overlook you.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Late in the night, while the gentle sleep of peace rested on 
                the<br>
                now happy house, there was still one watcher. It was not stork-papa,<br>
                who, although he stood on guard on one leg, could sleep soundly. 
                Helga alone was awake. She leaned over the balcony, gazing at 
                the<br>
                sparkling stars that shone clearer and brighter in the pure air 
                than<br>
                they had done in the north, and yet they were the same stars. 
                She<br>
                thought of the Viking's wife in the wild moorland, of the gentle<br>
                eyes of her foster-mother, and of the tears she had shed over 
                the poor frog-child that now lived in splendor and starry beauty 
                by the<br>
                waters of the Nile, with air balmy and sweet as spring. She thought 
                of<br>
                the love that dwelt in the breast of the heathen woman, love that<br>
                had been shown to a wretched creature, hateful as a human being, 
                and<br>
                hideous when in the form of an animal. She looked at the glittering<br>
                stars, and thought of the radiance that had shone forth on the<br>
                forehead of the dead man, as she had fled with him over the woodland 
                and moor. Tones were awakened in her memory; words which she had 
                heard him speak as they rode onward, when she was carried, wondering 
                and trembling, through the air; words from the great Fountain 
                of love, the highest love that embraces all the human race. What 
                had not been won and achieved by this love?<br>
              </p>
              <p>Day and night beautiful Helga was absorbed in the contemplation 
                of<br>
                the great amount of her happiness, and lost herself in the<br>
                contemplation, like a child who turns hurriedly from the giver 
                to<br>
                examine the beautiful gifts. She was over-powered with her good<br>
                fortune, which seemed always increasing, and therefore what might 
                it<br>
                become in the future? Had she not been brought by a wonderful<br>
                miracle to all this joy and happiness? And in these thoughts she<br>
                indulged, until at last she thought no more of the Giver. It was 
                the<br>
                over-abundance of youthful spirits unfolding its wings for a daring<br>
                flight. Her eyes sparkled with energy, when suddenly arose a loud<br>
                noise in the court below, and the daring thought vanished. She<br>
                looked down, and saw two large ostriches running round quickly 
                in<br>
                narrow circles; she had never seen these creatures before,- great,<br>
                coarse, clumsy-looking birds with curious wings that looked as 
                if they<br>
                had been clipped, and the birds themselves had the appearance 
                of<br>
                having been roughly used. She inquired about them, and for the 
                first<br>
                time heard the legend which the Egyptians relate respecting the<br>
                ostrich.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Once, say they, the ostriches were a beautiful and glorious race<br>
                of birds, with large, strong wings. One evening the other large<br>
                birds of the forest said to the ostrich, &quot;Brother, shall 
                we fly to the<br>
                river to-morrow morning to drink, God willing?&quot; and the ostrich<br>
                answered, &quot;I will.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>With the break of day, therefore, they commenced their flight;<br>
                first rising high in the air, towards the sun, which is the eye 
                of<br>
                God; still higher and higher the ostrich flew, far above the other<br>
                birds, proudly approaching the light, trusting in its own strength,<br>
                and thinking not of the Giver, or saying, &quot;if God will.&quot; 
                When suddenly the avenging angel drew back the veil from the flaming 
                ocean of sunlight, and in a moment the wings of the proud bird 
                were scorched and shrivelled, and they sunk miserably to the earth. 
                Since that time the ostrich and his race have never been able 
                to rise in the air; they can only fly terror-stricken along the 
                ground, or run round and round in narrow circles. It is a warning 
                to mankind, that in all our<br>
                thoughts and schemes, and in every action we undertake, we should 
                say, &quot;if God will.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then Helga bowed her head thoughtfully and seriously, and looked<br>
                at the circling ostrich, as with timid fear and simple pleasure 
                it<br>
                glanced at its own great shadow on the sunlit walls. And the story<br>
                of the ostrich sunk deeply into the heart and mind of Helga: a 
                life of<br>
                happiness, both in the present and in the future, seemed secure 
                for<br>
                her, and what was yet to come might be the best of all, God willing.<br>
                Early in the spring, when the storks were again about to journey<br>
                northward, beautiful Helga took off her golden bracelets, scratched<br>
                her name on them, and beckoned to the stork-father. He came to 
                her,<br>
                and she placed the golden circlet round his neck, and begged him 
                to<br>
                deliver it safely to the Viking's wife, so that she might know 
                that<br>
                her foster-daughter still lived, was happy, and had not forgotten 
                her.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is rather heavy to carry,&quot; thought stork-papa, 
                when he had<br>
                it on his neck; &quot;but gold and honor are not to be flung into 
                the<br>
                street. The stork brings good fortune- they'll be obliged to<br>
                acknowledge that at last.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You lay gold, and I lay eggs,&quot; said stork-mamma; &quot;with 
                you it<br>
                is only once in a way, I lay eggs every year But no one appreciates<br>
                what we do; I call it very mortifying.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But then we have a consciousness of our own worth, mother,&quot;<br>
                replied stork-papa.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What good will that do you?&quot; retorted stork-mamma; 
                &quot;it will<br>
                neither bring you a fair wind, nor a good meal.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The little nightingale, who is singing yonder in the tamarind<br>
                grove, will soon be going north, too.&quot; Helga said she had 
                often<br>
                heard her singing on the wild moor, so she determined to send 
                a<br>
                message by her. While flying in the swan's plumage she had learnt<br>
                the bird language; she had often conversed with the stork and 
                the<br>
                swallow, and she knew that the nightingale would understand. So 
                she<br>
                begged the nightingale to fly to the beechwood, on the peninsula 
                of<br>
                Jutland, where a mound of stone and twigs had been raised to form<br>
                the grave, and she begged the nightingale to persuade all the 
                other<br>
                little birds to build their nests round the place, so that evermore<br>
                should resound over that grave music and song. And the nightingale<br>
                flew away, and time flew away also.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the autumn, an eagle, standing upon a pyramid, saw a stately<br>
                train of richly laden camels, and men attired in armor on foaming<br>
                Arabian steeds, whose glossy skins shone like silver, their nostrils<br>
                were pink, and their thick, flowing manes hung almost to their 
                slender<br>
                legs. A royal prince of Arabia, handsome as a prince should be, 
                and<br>
                accompanied by distinguished guests, was on his way to the stately<br>
                house, on the roof of which the storks' empty nests might be seen.<br>
                They were away now in the far north, but expected to return very 
                soon.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And, indeed, they returned on a day that was rich in joy and 
                gladness.<br>
                A marriage was being celebrated, in which the beautiful Helga,<br>
                glittering in silk and jewels, was the bride, and the bridegroom 
                the<br>
                young Arab prince. Bride and bridegroom sat at the upper end of 
                the<br>
                table, between the bride's mother and grandfather. But her gaze 
                was<br>
                not on the bridegroom, with his manly, sunburnt face, round which<br>
                curled a black beard, and whose dark fiery eyes were fixed upon 
                her;<br>
                but away from him, at a twinkling star, that shone down upon her<br>
                from the sky. Then was heard the sound of rushing wings beating 
                the<br>
                air. The storks were coming home; and the old stork pair, although<br>
                tired with the journey and requiring rest, did not fail to fly 
                down at<br>
                once to the balustrades of the verandah, for they knew already 
                what<br>
                feast was being celebrated. They had heard of it on the borders 
                of the<br>
                land, and also that Helga had caused their figures to be represented<br>
                on the walls, for they belonged to her history.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I call that very sensible and pretty,&quot; said stork-papa.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, but it is very little,&quot; said mamma stork; &quot;they 
                could not<br>
                possibly have done less.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But, when Helga saw them, she rose and went out into the<br>
                verandah to stroke the backs of the storks. The old stork pair 
                bowed<br>
                their heads, and curved their necks, and even the youngest among 
                the<br>
                young ones felt honored by this reception.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Helga continued to gaze upon the glittering star, which seemed<br>
                to glow brighter and purer in its light; then between herself 
                and<br>
                the star floated a form, purer than the air, and visible through 
                it.<br>
                It floated quite near to her, and she saw that it was the dead<br>
                Christian priest, who also was coming to her wedding feast- coming<br>
                from the heavenly kingdom.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The glory and brightness, yonder, outshines all that is 
                known<br>
                on earth,&quot; said he.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then Helga the fair prayed more gently, and more earnestly, than<br>
                she had ever prayed in her life before, that she might be permitted 
                to<br>
                gaze, if only for a single moment, at the glory and brightness 
                of<br>
                the heavenly kingdom. Then she felt herself lifted up, as it were,<br>
                above the earth, through a sea of sound and thought; not only 
                around<br>
                her, but within her, was there light and song, such as words cannot<br>
                express.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now we must return;&quot; he said; &quot;you will be missed.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Only one more look,&quot; she begged; &quot;but one short 
                moment more.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We must return to earth; the guests will have all departed.<br>
                Only one more look!- the last!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then Helga stood again in the verandah. But the marriage lamps<br>
                in the festive hall had been all extinguished, and the torches 
                outside<br>
                had vanished. The storks were gone; not a guest could be seen; 
                no<br>
                bridegroom- all in those few short moments seemed to have died. 
              </p>
              <p>Then a great dread fell upon her. She stepped from the verandah 
                through the empty hall into the next chamber, where slept strange 
                warriors. She opened a side door, which once led into her own 
                apartment, but now, as she passed through, she found herself suddenly 
                in a garden which she had never before seen here, the sky blushed 
                red, it was the dawn of morning. Three minutes only in heaven, 
                and a whole night on earth had passed away! Then she saw the storks, 
                and called to them in their own language.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then stork-papa turned his head towards here, listened to her<br>
                words, and drew near. &quot;You speak our language,&quot; said 
                he, &quot;what do<br>
                you wish? Why do you appear,- you- a strange woman?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is I- it is Helga! Dost thou not know me? Three minutes 
                ago we<br>
                were speaking together yonder in the verandah.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That is a mistake,&quot; said the stork, &quot;you must 
                have dreamed all<br>
                this.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No, no,&quot; she exclaimed. Then she reminded him of the 
                Viking's<br>
                castle, of the great lake, and of the journey across the ocean.<br>
                Then stork-papa winked his eyes, and said, &quot;Why that's an 
                old<br>
                story which happened in the time of my grandfather. There certainly<br>
                was a princess of that kind here in Egypt once, who came from 
                the<br>
                Danish land, but she vanished on the evening of her wedding day,<br>
                many hundred years ago, and never came back. You may read about 
                it yourself yonder, on a monument in the garden. There you will 
                find<br>
                swans and storks sculptured, and on the top is a figure of the<br>
                princess Helga, in marble.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And so it was; Helga understood it all now, and sank on her knees.<br>
                The sun burst forth in all its glory, and, as in olden times, 
                the form<br>
                of the frog vanished in his beams, and the beautiful form stood<br>
                forth in all its loveliness; so now, bathed in light, rose a beautiful<br>
                form, purer, clearer than air- a ray of brightness- from the Source 
                of<br>
                light Himself. The body crumbled into dust, and a faded lotus-flower<br>
                lay on the spot on which Helga had stood.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now that is a new ending to the story,&quot; said stork-papa; 
                &quot;I<br>
                really never expected it would end in this way, but it seems a 
                very<br>
                good ending.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And what will the young ones say to it, I wonder?&quot; 
                said<br>
                stork-mamma.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ah, that is a very important question,&quot; replied the 
                stork.</p>

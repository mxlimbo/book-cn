              <p class="h" align="center"> SHE WAS GOOD FOR NOTHING</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THE mayor stood at the open window. He looked smart, for his<br>
                shirt-frill, in which he had stuck a breast-pin, and his ruffles, 
                were<br>
                very fine. He had shaved his chin uncommonly smooth, although 
                he had cut himself slightly, and had stuck a piece of newspaper 
                over the<br>
                place. &quot;Hark 'ee, youngster!&quot; cried he.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The boy to whom he spoke was no other than the son of a poor<br>
                washer-woman, who was just going past the house. He stopped, and<br>
                respectfully took off his cap. The peak of this cap was broken 
                in<br>
                the middle, so that he could easily roll it up and put it in his<br>
                pocket. He stood before the mayor in his poor but clean and<br>
                well-mended clothes, with heavy wooden shoes on his feet, looking 
                as humble as if it had been the king himself.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You are a good and civil boy,&quot; said the mayor. &quot;I 
                suppose your<br>
                mother is busy washing the clothes down by the river, and you 
                are<br>
                going to carry that thing to her that you have in your pocket. 
                It is<br>
                very bad for your mother. How much have you got in it?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Only half a quartern,&quot; stammered the boy in a frightened 
                voice.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And she has had just as much this morning already?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No, it was yesterday,&quot; replied the boy.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Two halves make a whole,&quot; said the mayor. &quot;She's 
                good for<br>
                nothing. What a sad thing it is with these people. Tell your mother<br>
                she ought to be ashamed of herself. Don't you become a drunkard, 
                but I expect you will though. Poor child! there, go now.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The boy went on his way with his cap in his hand, while the wind<br>
                fluttered his golden hair till the locks stood up straight. He<br>
                turned round the corner of the street into the little lane that 
                led to<br>
                the river, where his mother stood in the water by her washing 
                bench,<br>
                beating the linen with a heavy wooden bar. The floodgates at the<br>
                mill had been drawn up, and as the water rolled rapidly on, the 
                sheets<br>
                were dragged along by the stream, and nearly overturned the bench,<br>
                so that the washer-woman was obliged to lean against it to keep 
                it<br>
                steady. &quot;I have been very nearly carried away,&quot; she 
                said; &quot;it is a<br>
                good thing that you are come, for I want something to strengthen 
                me.<br>
                It is cold in the water, and I have stood here six hours. Have 
                you<br>
                brought anything for me?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The boy drew the bottle from his pocket, and the mother put it<br>
                to her lips, and drank a little.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ah, how much good that does, and how it warms me,&quot; 
                she said;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;it is as good as a hot meal, and not so dear. Drink a little, 
                my boy;<br>
                you look quite pale; you are shivering in your thin clothes, and<br>
                autumn has really come. Oh, how cold the water is! I hope I shall<br>
                not be ill. But no, I must not be afraid of that. Give me a little<br>
                more, and you may have a sip too, but only a sip; you must not 
                get<br>
                used to it, my poor, dear child.&quot; She stepped up to the bridge 
                on<br>
                which the boy stood as she spoke, and came on shore. The water 
                dripped from the straw mat which she had bound round her body, 
                and from her gown. &quot;I work hard and suffer pain with my poor 
                hands,&quot; said she, &quot;but I do it willingly, that I may 
                be able to bring you up honestly and truthfully, my dear boy.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>At the same moment, a woman, rather older than herself, came<br>
                towards them. She was a miserable-looking object, lame of one 
                leg, and with a large false curl hanging down over one of her 
                eyes, which was blind. This curl was intended to conceal the blind 
                eye, but it made the defect only more visible. She was a friend 
                of the laundress, and was called, among the neighbors, &quot;Lame 
                Martha, with the curl.&quot; </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, you poor thing; how you do work, standing there in 
                the water!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;You really do need something 
                to give you a little<br>
                warmth, and yet spiteful people cry out about the few drops you 
                take.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And then Martha repeated to the laundress, in a very few minutes,<br>
                all that the mayor had said to her boy, which she had overheard; 
                and<br>
                she felt very angry that any man could speak, as he had done, 
                of a<br>
                mother to her own child, about the few drops she had taken; and 
                she<br>
                was still more angry because, on that very day, the mayor was 
                going to have a dinner-party, at which there would be wine, strong, 
                rich<br>
                wine, drunk by the bottle. &quot;Many will take more than they 
                ought, but<br>
                they don't call that drinking! They are all right, you are good 
                for<br>
                nothing indeed!&quot; cried Martha indignantly.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And so he spoke to you in that way, did he, my child?&quot; 
                said the<br>
                washer-woman, and her lips trembled as she spoke. &quot;He says 
                you have a mother who is good for nothing. Well, perhaps he is 
                right, but he should not have said it to my child. How much has 
                happened to me from that house!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Martha; &quot;I remember you were in service 
                there, and<br>
                lived in the house when the mayor's parents were alive; how many 
                years ago that is. Bushels of salt have been eaten since then, 
                and people may well be thirsty,&quot; and Martha smiled. &quot;The 
                mayor's great<br>
                dinner-party to-day ought to have been put off, but the news came<br>
                too late. The footman told me the dinner was already cooked, when 
                a<br>
                letter came to say that the mayor's younger brother in Copenhagen 
                is<br>
                dead.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Dead!&quot; cried the laundress, turning pale as death.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, certainly,&quot; replied Martha; &quot;but why do 
                you take it so<br>
                much to heart? I suppose you knew him years ago, when you were 
                in<br>
                service there?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Is he dead?&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Oh, he was such 
                a kind, good-hearted<br>
                man, there are not many like him,&quot; and the tears rolled down 
                her<br>
                cheeks as she spoke. Then she cried, &quot;Oh, dear me; I feel 
                quite ill:<br>
                everything is going round me, I cannot bear it. Is the bottle<br>
                empty?&quot; and she leaned against the plank.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Dear me, you are ill indeed,&quot; said the other woman. 
                &quot;Come,<br>
                cheer up; perhaps it will pass off. No, indeed, I see you are 
                really<br>
                ill; the best thing for me to do is to lead you home.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But my washing yonder?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I will take care of that. Come, give me your arm. The boy 
                can<br>
                stay here and take care of the linen, and I'll come back and finish<br>
                the washing; it is but a trifle.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The limbs of the laundress shook under her, and she said, &quot;I<br>
                have stood too long in the cold water, and I have had nothing 
                to eat<br>
                the whole day since the morning. O kind Heaven, help me to get 
                home; I am in a burning fever. Oh, my poor child,&quot; and she 
                burst into tears. And he, poor boy, wept also, as he sat alone 
                by the river, near to and watching the damp linen.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The two women walked very slowly. The laundress slipped and<br>
                tottered through the lane, and round the corner, into the street 
                where<br>
                the mayor lived; and just as she reached the front of his house, 
                she<br>
                sank down upon the pavement. Many persons came round her, and 
                Lame Martha ran into the house for help. The mayor and his guests 
                came to the window.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, it is the laundress,&quot; said he; &quot;she has had 
                a little drop too<br>
                much. She is good for nothing. It is a sad thing for her pretty 
                little<br>
                son. I like the boy very well; but the mother is good for nothing.&quot;<br>
                After a while the laundress recovered herself, and they led her 
                to<br>
                her poor dwelling, and put her to bed. Kind Martha warmed a mug 
                of<br>
                beer for her, with butter and sugar- she considered this the best<br>
                medicine- and then hastened to the river, washed and rinsed, badly<br>
                enough, to be sure, but she did her best. Then she drew the linen<br>
                ashore, wet as it was, and laid it in a basket. Before evening, 
                she<br>
                was sitting in the poor little room with the laundress. The mayor's<br>
                cook had given her some roasted potatoes and a beautiful piece 
                of<br>
                fat for the sick woman. Martha and the boy enjoyed these good 
                things very much; but the sick woman could only say that the smell 
                was very nourishing, she thought. By-and-by the boy was put to 
                bed, in the same bed as the one in which his mother lay; but he 
                slept at her feet, covered with an old quilt made of blue and 
                white patchwork. </p>
              <p>The laundress felt a little better by this time. The warm beer 
                had<br>
                strengthened her, and the smell of the good food had been pleasant<br>
                to her.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Many thanks, you good soul,&quot; she said to Martha. &quot;Now 
                the boy<br>
                is asleep, I will tell you all. He is soon asleep. How gentle 
                and<br>
                sweet he looks as he lies there with his eyes closed! He does 
                not know how his mother has suffered; and Heaven grant he never 
                may know it. I was in service at the counsellor's, the father 
                of the mayor, and it happened that the youngest of his sons, the 
                student, came home. I was a young wild girl then, but honest; 
                that I can declare in the sight of Heaven. The student was merry 
                and gay, brave and<br>
                affectionate; every drop of blood in him was good and honorable; 
                a<br>
                better man never lived on earth. He was the son of the house, 
                and I<br>
                was only a maid; but he loved me truly and honorably, and he told<br>
                his mother of it. She was to him as an angel upon earth; she was 
                so<br>
                wise and loving. He went to travel, and before he started he placed<br>
                a gold ring on my finger; and as soon as he was out of the house, 
                my<br>
                mistress sent for me. Gently and earnestly she drew me to her, 
                and<br>
                spake as if an angel were speaking. She showed me clearly, in 
                spirit<br>
                and in truth, the difference there was between him and me. 'He 
                is<br>
                pleased now,' she said, 'with your pretty face; but good looks 
                do<br>
                not last long. You have not been educated like he has. You are 
                not<br>
                equals in mind and rank, and therein lies the misfortune. I esteem 
                the<br>
                poor,' she added. 'In the sight of God, they may occupy a higher 
                place than many of the rich; but here upon earth we must beware 
                of<br>
                entering upon a false track, lest we are overturned in our plans, 
                like<br>
                a carriage that travels by a dangerous road. I know a worthy man, 
                an<br>
                artisan, who wishes to marry you. I mean Eric, the glovemaker. 
                He is a widower, without children, and in a good position. Will 
                you think it<br>
                over?' Every word she said pierced my heart like a knife; but 
                I knew<br>
                she was right, and the thought pressed heavily upon me. I kissed 
                her<br>
                hand, and wept bitter tears, and I wept still more when I went 
                to my<br>
                room, and threw myself on the bed. I passed through a dreadful<br>
                night; God knows what I suffered, and how I struggled. The following 
                Sunday I went to the house of God to pray for light to direct 
                my path.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It seemed like a providence that as I stepped out of church Eric<br>
                came towards me; and then there remained not a doubt in my mind. 
              </p>
              <p>We were suited to each other in rank and circumstances. He was, 
                even then, a man of good means. I went up to him, and took his 
                hand, and said, 'Do you still feel the same for me?' 'Yes; ever 
                and always,' said he. 'Will you, then, marry a maiden who honors 
                and esteems you, although she cannot offer you her love? but that 
                may come.' 'Yes, it will come,' said he; and we joined our hands 
                together, and I went home to my mistress. The gold ring which 
                her son had given me I wore next to my heart. I could not place 
                it on my finger during the daytime, but only in the evening, when 
                I went to bed. I kissed the ring till my lips almost bled, and 
                then I gave it to my mistress, and told her that the banns were 
                to be put up for me and the glovemaker the following week. Then 
                my mistress threw her arms round me, and kissed me. She did not 
                say that I was 'good for nothing;' very likely I was better then 
                than I am now; but the misfortunes of this world, were unknown 
                to me then. At Michaelmas we were married, and for the first year 
                everything went well with us. We had a journeyman and an apprentice, 
                and you were our servant, Martha.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ah, yes, and you were a dear, good mistress,&quot; said 
                Martha, &quot;I<br>
                shall never forget how kind you and your husband were to me.&quot;<br>
                &quot;Yes, those were happy years when you were with us, although 
                we<br>
                had no children at first. The student I never met again. Yet I 
                saw him<br>
                once, although he did not see me. He came to his mother's funeral. 
                I<br>
                saw him, looking pale as death, and deeply troubled, standing 
                at her<br>
                grave; for she was his mother. Sometime after, when his father 
                died,<br>
                he was in foreign lands, and did not come home. I know that he 
                never<br>
                married, I believe he became a lawyer. He had forgotten me, and 
                even<br>
                had we met he would not have known me, for I have lost all my 
                good<br>
                looks, and perhaps that is all for the best.&quot; And then she 
                spoke of<br>
                the dark days of trial, when misfortune had fallen upon them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We had five hundred dollars,&quot; she said, &quot;and 
                there was a house in<br>
                the street to be sold for two hundred, so we thought it would 
                be worth our while to pull it down and build a new one in its 
                place; so it<br>
                was bought. The builder and carpenter made an estimate that the 
                new<br>
                house would cost ten hundred and twenty dollars to build. Eric 
                had<br>
                credit, so he borrowed the money in the chief town. But the captain,<br>
                who was bringing it to him, was shipwrecked, and the money lost.<br>
                Just about this time, my dear sweet boy, who lies sleeping there,<br>
                was born, and my husband was attacked with a severe lingering 
                illness.<br>
              </p>
              <p>For three quarters of a year I was obliged to dress and undress 
                him.<br>
                We were backward in our payments, we borrowed more money, and 
                all that we had was lost and sold, and then my husband died. Since 
                then I have worked, toiled, and striven for the sake of the child. 
                I have<br>
                scrubbed and washed both coarse and fine linen, but I have not 
                been<br>
                able to make myself better off; and it was God's will. In His 
                own time<br>
                He will take me to Himself, but I know He will never forsake my<br>
                boy.&quot; Then she fell asleep. In the morning she felt much 
                refreshed,<br>
                and strong enough, as she thought, to go on with her work. But 
                as soon as she stepped into the cold water, a sudden faintness 
                seized her; she clutched at the air convulsively with her hand, 
                took one step forward, and fell. Her head rested on dry land, 
                but her feet were in the water; her wooden shoes, which were only 
                tied on by a wisp of straw, were carried away by the stream, and 
                thus she was found by Martha when she came to bring her some coffee.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the meantime a messenger had been sent to her house by the<br>
                mayor, to say that she must come to him immediately, as he had<br>
                something to tell her. It was too late; a surgeon had been sent 
                for to<br>
                open a vein in her arm, but the poor woman was dead.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;She has drunk herself to death,&quot; said the cruel mayor. 
                In the<br>
                letter, containing the news of his brother's death, it was stated 
                that<br>
                he had left in his will a legacy of six hundred dollars to the<br>
                glovemaker's widow, who had been his mother's maid, to be paid 
                with discretion, in large or small sums to the widow or her child.<br>
                &quot;There was something between my brother and her, I remember,&quot; 
                said the mayor; &quot;it is a good thing that she is out of the 
                way, for now the boy will have the whole. I will place him with 
                honest people to<br>
                bring him up, that he may become a respectable working man.&quot; 
                And the blessing of God rested upon these words. The mayor sent 
                for the boy to come to him, and promised to take care of him, 
                but most cruelly added that it was a good thing that his mother 
                was dead, for &quot;she was good for nothing.&quot; They carried 
                her to the churchyard, the<br>
                churchyard in which the poor were buried. Martha strewed sand 
                on the grave and planted a rose-tree upon it, and the boy stood 
                by her side.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, my poor mother!&quot; he cried, while the tears rolled 
                down his<br>
                cheeks. &quot;Is it true what they say, that she was good for 
                nothing?&quot;<br>
                &quot;No, indeed, it is not true,&quot; replied the old servant, 
                raising her<br>
                eyes to heaven; &quot;she was worth a great deal; I knew it years 
                ago,<br>
                and since the last night of her life I am more certain of it than<br>
                ever. I say she was a good and worthy woman, and God, who is in<br>
                heaven, knows I am speaking the truth, though the world may say,<br>
                even now she was good for nothing.&quot;</p>

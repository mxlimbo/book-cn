              <p class="h" align="center"> THE FLYING TRUNK</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THERE was once a merchant who was so rich that he could have 
                paved the whole street with gold, and would even then have had 
                enough for a small alley. But he did not do so; he knew the value 
                of money better than to use it in this way. So clever was he, 
                that every shilling he put out brought him a crown; and so he 
                continued till he died. His son inherited his wealth, and he lived 
                a merry life with it; he went to a masquerade every night, made 
                kites out of five pound notes, and threw pieces of gold into the 
                sea instead of stones, making ducks and drakes of them. In this 
                manner he soon lost all his money. </p>
              <p>At last he had nothing left but a pair of slippers, an old dressing-gown, 
                and four shillings. And now all his friends deserted him, they 
                could not walk with him in the streets; but one of them, who was 
                very<br>
                good-natured, sent him an old trunk with this message, &quot;Pack 
                up!&quot;<br>
                &quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;it is all very well to say 'pack 
                up,' &quot;but he had<br>
                nothing left to pack up, therefore he seated himself in the trunk.<br>
                It was a very wonderful trunk; no sooner did any one press on 
                the lock than the trunk could fly. He shut the lid and pressed 
                the lock, when away flew the trunk up the chimney with the merchant's 
                son in it, right up into the clouds. Whenever the bottom of the 
                trunk cracked, he was in a great fright, for if the trunk fell 
                to pieces he would have made a tremendous somerset over the trees. 
                However, he got safely in his trunk to the land of Turkey. He 
                hid the trunk in the wood under some dry leaves, and then went 
                into the town: he could so this very well, for the Turks always 
                go about dressed in dressing-gowns and slippers, as he was himself. 
                He happened to meet a nurse with a little child. &quot;I say, 
                you Turkish nurse,&quot; cried he, &quot;what castle is that near 
                the town, with the windows placed so high?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The king's daughter lives there,&quot; she replied; &quot;it 
                has been<br>
                prophesied that she will be very unhappy about a lover, and<br>
                therefore no one is allowed to visit her, unless the king and 
                queen<br>
                are present.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said the merchant's son. So he went back 
                to the wood,<br>
                seated himself in his trunk, flew up to the roof of the castle, 
                and<br>
                crept through the window into the princess's room. She lay on 
                the sofa asleep, and she was so beautiful that the merchant's 
                son could not help kissing her. Then she awoke, and was very much 
                frightened; but he told her he was a Turkish angel, who had come 
                down through the air to see her, which pleased her very much. 
                He sat down by her side and talked to her: he said her eyes were 
                like beautiful dark lakes, in which the thoughts swam about like 
                little mermaids, and he told her<br>
                that her forehead was a snowy mountain, which contained splendid 
                halls full of pictures. And then he related to her about the stork 
                who<br>
                brings the beautiful children from the rivers. These were delightful<br>
                stories; and when he asked the princess if she would marry him, 
                she<br>
                consented immediately.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But you must come on Saturday,&quot; she said; &quot;for 
                then the king<br>
                and queen will take tea with me. They will be very proud when 
                they<br>
                find that I am going to marry a Turkish angel; but you must think 
                of<br>
                some very pretty stories to tell them, for my parents like to 
                hear<br>
                stories better than anything. My mother prefers one that is deep 
                and<br>
                moral; but my father likes something funny, to make him laugh.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; he replied; &quot;I shall bring you no 
                other marriage<br>
                portion than a story,&quot; and so they parted. But the princess 
                gave him a<br>
                sword which was studded with gold coins, and these he could use.<br>
                Then he flew away to the town and bought a new dressing-gown,<br>
                and afterwards returned to the wood, where he composed a story, 
                so<br>
                as to be ready for Saturday, which was no easy matter. It was 
                ready<br>
                however by Saturday, when he went to see the princess. The king, 
                and queen, and the whole court, were at tea with the princess; 
                and he<br>
                was received with great politeness.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Will you tell us a story?&quot; said the queen,- &quot;one 
                that is<br>
                instructive and full of deep learning.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, but with something in it to laugh at,&quot; said the 
                king.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; he replied, and commenced at once, asking 
                them to<br>
                listen attentively. &quot;There was once a bundle of matches that 
                were<br>
                exceedingly proud of their high descent. Their genealogical tree, 
                that<br>
                is, a large pine-tree from which they had been cut, was at one 
                time<br>
                a large, old tree in the wood. The matches now lay between a<br>
                tinder-box and an old iron saucepan, and were talking about their<br>
                youthful days. 'Ah! then we grew on the green boughs, and were 
                as<br>
                green as they; every morning and evening we were fed with diamond<br>
                drops of dew. Whenever the sun shone, we felt his warm rays, and 
                the little birds would relate stories to us as they sung. We knew 
                that<br>
                we were rich, for the other trees only wore their green dress 
                in<br>
                summer, but our family were able to array themselves in green,<br>
                summer and winter. But the wood-cutter came, like a great<br>
                revolution, and our family fell under the axe. The head of the 
                house<br>
                obtained a situation as mainmast in a very fine ship, and can 
                sail<br>
                round the world when he will. The other branches of the family 
                were<br>
                taken to different places, and our office now is to kindle a light 
                for<br>
                common people. This is how such high-born people as we came to 
                be in a kitchen.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Mine has been a very different fate,' said the iron pot, 
                which<br>
                stood by the matches; 'from my first entrance into the world I 
                have<br>
                been used to cooking and scouring. I am the first in this house,<br>
                when anything solid or useful is required. My only pleasure is 
                to be<br>
                made clean and shining after dinner, and to sit in my place and 
                have a<br>
                little sensible conversation with my neighbors. All of us, excepting<br>
                the water-bucket, which is sometimes taken into the courtyard, 
                live<br>
                here together within these four walls. We get our news from the<br>
                market-basket, but he sometimes tells us very unpleasant things<br>
                about the people and the government. Yes, and one day an old pot 
                was so alarmed, that he fell down and was broken to pieces. He 
                was a liberal, I can tell you.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'You are talking too much,' said the tinder-box, and the 
                steel<br>
                struck against the flint till some sparks flew out, crying, 'We 
                want a<br>
                merry evening, don't we?'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Yes, of course,' said the matches, 'let us talk about 
                those<br>
                who are the highest born.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'No, I don't like to be always talking of what we are,' 
                remarked the saucepan; 'let us think of some other amusement; 
                I will begin. We will tell something that has happened to ourselves; 
                that will be very easy, and interesting as well. On the Baltic 
                Sea, near the Danish shore'-<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'What a pretty commencement!' said the plates; 'we shall 
                all<br>
                like that story, I am sure.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Yes; well in my youth, I lived in a quiet family, where 
                the<br>
                furniture was polished, the floors scoured, and clean curtains 
                put<br>
                up every fortnight,'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'What an interesting way you have of relating a story,' 
                said<br>
                the carpet-broom; 'it is easy to perceive that you have been a 
                great<br>
                deal in women's society, there is something so pure runs through<br>
                what you say.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'That is quite true,' said the water-bucket; and he made 
                a spring<br>
                with joy, and splashed some water on the floor.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Then the saucepan went on with his story, and the end was 
                as good<br>
                as the beginning.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The plates rattled with pleasure, and the carpet-broom 
                brought<br>
                some green parsley out of the dust-hole and crowned the saucepan,<br>
                for he knew it would vex the others; and he thought, 'If I crown 
                him<br>
                to-day he will crown me to-morrow.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Now, let us have a dance,' said the fire-tongs; and then 
                how<br>
                they danced and stuck up one leg in the air. The chair-cushion 
                in<br>
                the corner burst with laughter when she saw it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Shall I be crowned now?' asked the fire-tongs; so the 
                broom<br>
                found another wreath for the tongs.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'They were only common people after all,' thought the matches.<br>
                The tea-urn was now asked to sing, but she said she had a cold, 
                and<br>
                could not sing without boiling heat. They all thought this was<br>
                affectation, and because she did not wish to sing excepting in 
                the<br>
                parlor, when on the table with the grand people.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;In the window sat an old quill-pen, with which the maid 
                generally<br>
                wrote. There was nothing remarkable about the pen, excepting that 
                it<br>
                had been dipped too deeply in the ink, but it was proud of that.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'If the tea-urn won't sing,' said the pen, 'she can leave 
                it alone; there is a nightingale in a cage who can sing; she has 
                not been taught much, certainly, but we need not say anything 
                this evening about that.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'I think it highly improper,' said the tea-kettle, who 
                was kitchen singer, and half-brother to the tea-urn, 'that a rich 
                foreign bird should be listened to here. Is it patriotic? Let 
                the market-basket decide what is right.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'I certainly am vexed,' said the basket; 'inwardly vexed, 
                more<br>
                than any one can imagine. Are we spending the evening properly?<br>
                Would it not be more sensible to put the house in order? If each<br>
                were in his own place I would lead a game; this would be quite 
                another thing.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Let us act a play,' said they all. At the same moment 
                the door<br>
                opened, and the maid came in. Then not one stirred; they all<br>
                remained quite still; yet, at the same time, there was not a single<br>
                pot amongst them who had not a high opinion of himself, and of 
                what he could do if he chose.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Yes, if we had chosen,' they each thought, 'we might have<br>
                spent a very pleasant evening.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The maid took the matches and lighted them; dear me, how 
                they<br>
                sputtered and blazed up!<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Now then,' they thought, 'every one will see that we are 
                the<br>
                first. How we shine; what a light we give!' Even while they spoke<br>
                their light went out.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What a capital story,&quot; said the queen, &quot;I feel 
                as if I were<br>
                really in the kitchen, and could see the matches; yes, you shall 
                marry<br>
                our daughter.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; said the king, &quot;thou shalt have our 
                daughter.&quot; The<br>
                king said thou to him because he was going to be one of the family.<br>
                The wedding-day was fixed, and, on the evening before, the whole<br>
                city was illuminated. Cakes and sweetmeats were thrown among the<br>
                people. The street boys stood on tiptoe and shouted &quot;hurrah,&quot; 
                and<br>
                whistled between their fingers; altogether it was a very splendid<br>
                affair.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I will give them another treat,&quot; said the merchant's 
                son. So he<br>
                went and bought rockets and crackers, and all sorts of fire-works 
                that<br>
                could be thought of, packed them in his trunk, and flew up with 
                it<br>
                into the air. What a whizzing and popping they made as they went<br>
                off! The Turks, when they saw such a sight in the air, jumped 
                so<br>
                high that their slippers flew about their ears. It was easy to 
                believe<br>
                after this that the princess was really going to marry a Turkish<br>
                angel.<br>
              </p>
              <p>As soon as the merchant's son had come down in his flying trunk 
                to<br>
                the wood after the fireworks, he thought, &quot;I will go back 
                into the<br>
                town now, and hear what they think of the entertainment.&quot; 
                It was<br>
                very natural that he should wish to know. And what strange things<br>
                people did say, to be sure! every one whom he questioned had a<br>
                different tale to tell, though they all thought it very beautiful.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'I saw the Turkish angel myself,&quot; said one; &quot;he 
                had eyes like<br>
                glittering stars, and a head like foaming water.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;He flew in a mantle of fire,&quot; cried another, &quot;and 
                lovely little<br>
                cherubs peeped out from the folds.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>He heard many more fine things about himself, and that the next<br>
                day he was to be married. After this he went back to the forest 
                to<br>
                rest himself in his trunk. It had disappeared! A spark from the<br>
                fireworks which remained had set it on fire; it was burnt to ashes! 
                So<br>
                the merchant's son could not fly any more, nor go to meet his 
                bride.<br>
                She stood all day on the roof waiting for him, and most likely 
                she<br>
                is waiting there still; while he wanders through the world telling<br>
                fairy tales, but none of them so amusing as the one he related 
                about<br>
                the matches.</p>

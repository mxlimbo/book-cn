              <p class="h" align="center"> THE CHILD IN THE GRAVE</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> IT was a very sad day, and every heart in the house felt the<br>
                deepest grief; for the youngest child, a boy of four years old, 
                the<br>
                joy and hope of his parents, was dead. Two daughters, the elder 
                of<br>
                whom was going to be confirmed, still remained: they were both 
                good, charming girls; but the lost child always seems the dearest; 
                and<br>
                when it is youngest, and a son, it makes the trial still more 
                heavy.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The sisters mourned as young hearts can mourn, and were especially<br>
                grieved at the sight of their parents' sorrow. The father's heart<br>
                was bowed down, but the mother sunk completely under the deep 
                grief.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Day and night she had attended to the sick child, nursing and 
                carrying<br>
                it in her bosom, as a part of herself. She could not realize the<br>
                fact that the child was dead, and must be laid in a coffin to 
                rest<br>
                in the ground. She thought God could not take her darling little 
                one<br>
                from her; and when it did happen notwithstanding her hopes and 
                her<br>
                belief, and there could be no more doubt on the subject, she said 
                in<br>
                her feverish agony, &quot;God does not know it. He has hard-hearted<br>
                ministering spirits on earth, who do according to their own will,<br>
                and heed not a mother's prayers.&quot; Thus in her great grief 
                she fell<br>
                away from her faith in God, and dark thoughts arose in her mind<br>
                respecting death and a future state. She tried to believe that 
                man was<br>
                but dust, and that with his life all existence ended. But these 
                doubts<br>
                were no support to her, nothing on which she could rest, and she<br>
                sunk into the fathomless depths of despair. In her darkest hours 
                she<br>
                ceased to weep, and thought not of the young daughters who were<br>
                still left to her. The tears of her husband fell on her forehead,<br>
                but she took no notice of him; her thoughts were with her dead<br>
                child; her whole existence seemed wrapped up in the remembrances 
                of the little one and of every innocent word it had uttered.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The day of the little child's funeral came. For nights<br>
                previously the mother had not slept, but in the morning twilight 
                of<br>
                this day she sunk from weariness into a deep sleep; in the mean 
                time<br>
                the coffin was carried into a distant room, and there nailed down,<br>
                that she might not hear the blows of the hammer. When she awoke, 
                and wanted to see her child, the husband, with tears, said, &quot;We 
                have<br>
                closed the coffin; it was necessary to do so.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;When God is so hard to me, how can I expect men to be better?&quot;<br>
                she said with groans and tears.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The coffin was carried to the grave, and the disconsolate mother<br>
                sat with her young daughters. She looked at them, but she saw 
                them<br>
                not; for her thoughts were far away from the domestic hearth. 
                She gave herself up to her grief, and it tossed her to and fro, 
                as the sea<br>
                tosses a ship without compass or rudder. So the day of the funeral<br>
                passed away, and similar days followed, of dark, wearisome pain.<br>
              </p>
              <p>With tearful eyes and mournful glances, the sorrowing daughters 
                and<br>
                the afflicted husband looked upon her who would not hear their 
                words of comfort; and, indeed, what comforting words could they 
                speak, when they were themselves so full of grief? It seemed as 
                if she<br>
                would never again know sleep, and yet it would have been her best<br>
                friend, one who would have strengthened her body and poured peace 
                into her soul. They at last persuaded her to lie down, and then 
                she would lie as still as if she slept.<br>
              </p>
              <p>One night, when her husband listened, as he often did, to her<br>
                breathing, he quite believed that she had at length found rest 
                and<br>
                relief in sleep. He folded his arms and prayed, and soon sunk<br>
                himself into healthful sleep; therefore he did not notice that 
                his<br>
                wife arose, threw on her clothes, and glided silently from the<br>
                house, to go where her thoughts constantly lingered- to the grave 
                of<br>
                her child. She passed through the garden, to a path across a field<br>
                that led to the churchyard. No one saw her as she walked, nor 
                did<br>
                she see any one; for her eyes were fixed upon the one object of 
                her<br>
                wanderings. It was a lovely starlight night in the beginning of<br>
                September, and the air was mild and still. She entered the<br>
                churchyard, and stood by the little grave, which looked like a 
                large<br>
                nosegay of fragrant flowers. She sat down, and bent her head low 
                over the grave, as if she could see her child through the earth 
                that<br>
                covered him- her little boy, whose smile was so vividly before 
                her,<br>
                and the gentle expression of whose eyes, even on his sick-bed, 
                she<br>
                could not forget. How full of meaning that glance had been, as 
                she<br>
                leaned over him, holding in hers the pale hand which he had no 
                longer<br>
                strength to raise! As she had sat by his little cot, so now she 
                sat<br>
                by his grave; and here she could weep freely, and her tears fell 
                upon<br>
                it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Thou wouldst gladly go down and be with thy child,&quot; 
                said a<br>
                voice quite close to her,- a voice that sounded so deep and clear,<br>
                that it went to her heart.<br>
              </p>
              <p>She looked up, and by her side stood a man wrapped in a black<br>
                cloak, with a hood closely drawn over his face; but her keen glance<br>
                could distinguish the face under the hood. It was stern, yet<br>
                awakened confidence, and the eyes beamed with youthful radiance.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Down to my child,&quot; she repeated; and tones of despair 
                and<br>
                entreaty sounded in the words.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Darest thou to follow me?&quot; asked the form. &quot;I 
                am Death.&quot;<br>
                She bowed her head in token of assent. Then suddenly it appeared<br>
                as if all the stars were shining with the radiance of the full 
                moon on<br>
                the many-colored flowers that decked the grave. The earth that 
                covered it was drawn back like a floating drapery. She sunk down, 
                and the spectre covered her with a black cloak; night closed around 
                her, the night of death. She sank deeper than the spade of the 
                sexton could penetrate, till the churchyard became a roof above 
                her. Then the cloak was removed, and she found herself in a large 
                hall, of<br>
                wide-spreading dimensions, in which there was a subdued light, 
                like<br>
                twilight, reigning, and in a moment her child appeared before 
                her,<br>
                smiling, and more beautiful than ever; with a silent cry she pressed<br>
                him to her heart. A glorious strain of music sounded- now distant, 
                now near. Never had she listened to such tones as these; they 
                came from beyond a large dark curtain which separated the regions 
                of death<br>
                from the land of eternity.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;My sweet, darling mother,&quot; she heard the child say. 
                It was the<br>
                well-known, beloved voice; and kiss followed kiss, in boundless<br>
                delight. Then the child pointed to the dark curtain. &quot;There 
                is nothing<br>
                so beautiful on earth as it is here. Mother, do you not see them<br>
                all? Oh, it is happiness indeed.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the mother saw nothing of what the child pointed out, only 
                the<br>
                dark curtain. She looked with earthly eyes, and could not see 
                as the<br>
                child saw,- he whom God has called to be with Himself. She could<br>
                hear the sounds of music, but she heard not the words, the Word 
                in<br>
                which she was to trust.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I can fly now, mother,&quot; said the child; &quot;I can 
                fly with other<br>
                happy children into the presence of the Almighty. I would fain 
                fly<br>
                away now; but if you weep for me as you are weeping now, you may 
                never see me again. And yet I would go so gladly. May I not fly 
                away? And you will come to me soon, will you not, dear mother?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, stay, stay!&quot; implored the mother; &quot;only one 
                moment more; only<br>
                once more, that I may look upon thee, and kiss thee, and press 
                thee to my heart.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then she kissed and fondled her child. Suddenly her name was<br>
                called from above; what could it mean? her name uttered in a plaintive<br>
                voice.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Hearest thou?&quot; said the child. &quot;It is my father 
                who calls<br>
                thee.&quot; And in a few moments deep sighs were heard, as of 
                children<br>
                weeping. &quot;They are my sisters,&quot; said the child. &quot;Mother, 
                surely you<br>
                have not forgotten them.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And then she remembered those she left behind, and a great<br>
                terror came over her. She looked around her at the dark night. 
                Dim<br>
                forms flitted by. She seemed to recognize some of them, as they<br>
                floated through the regions of death towards the dark curtain, 
                where<br>
                they vanished. Would her husband and her daughters flit past? 
                No;<br>
                their sighs and lamentations still sounded from above; and she 
                had<br>
                nearly forgotten them, for the sake of him who was dead.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Mother, now the bells of heaven are ringing,&quot; said 
                the child;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;mother, the sun is going to rise.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>An overpowering light streamed in upon her, the child had<br>
                vanished, and she was being borne upwards. All around her became 
                cold;<br>
              </p>
              <p>she lifted her head, and saw that she was lying in the churchyard,<br>
                on the grave of her child. The Lord, in a dream, had been a guide 
                to<br>
                her feet and a light to her spirit. She bowed her knees, and prayed<br>
                for forgiveness. She had wished to keep back a soul from its<br>
                immortal flight; she had forgotten her duties towards the living 
                who<br>
                were left her. And when she had offered this prayer, her heart 
                felt<br>
                lighter. The sun burst forth, over her head a little bird carolled 
                his<br>
                song, and the church-bells sounded for the early service. Everything<br>
                around her seemed holy, and her heart was chastened. She<br>
                acknowledged the goodness of God, she acknowledged the duties 
                she had to perform, and eagerly she returned home. She bent over 
                her<br>
                husband, who still slept; her warm, devoted kiss awakened him, 
                and<br>
                words of heartfelt love fell from the lips of both. Now she was 
                gentle<br>
                and strong as a wife can be; and from her lips came the words 
                of<br>
                faith: &quot;Whatever He doeth is right and best.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then her husband asked, &quot;From whence hast thou all at once 
                derived<br>

              </p>
              <p>And as she kissed him and her children, she said, &quot;It came 
                from<br>
                God, through my child in the grave.&quot;</p>

              <p  align="center"> FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN</p>
              <p class="h" align="center"> THE SHADOW</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> IN very hot climates, where the heat of the sun has great power,<br>
                people are usually as brown as mahogany; and in the hottest<br>
                countries they are negroes, with black skins. A learned man once<br>
                travelled into one of these warm climates, from the cold regions 
                of<br>
                the north, and thought he would roam about as he did at home; 
                but he<br>
                soon had to change his opinion. He found that, like all sensible<br>
                people, he must remain in the house during the whole day, with 
                every<br>
                window and door closed, so that it looked as if all in the house<br>
                were asleep or absent. The houses of the narrow street in which 
                he<br>
                lived were so lofty that the sun shone upon them from morning 
                till<br>
                evening, and it became quite unbearable. This learned man from 
                the<br>
                cold regions was young as well as clever; but it seemed to him 
                as if<br>
                he were sitting in an oven, and he became quite exhausted and 
                weak,<br>
                and grew so thin that his shadow shrivelled up, and became much<br>
                smaller than it had been at home. The sun took away even what 
                was left of it, and he saw nothing of it till the evening, after 
                sunset. It was<br>
                really a pleasure, as soon as the lights were brought into the 
                room,<br>
                to see the shadow stretch itself against the wall, even to the<br>
                ceiling, so tall was it; and it really wanted a good stretch to<br>
                recover its strength. The learned man would sometimes go out into<br>
                the balcony to stretch himself also; and as soon as the stars 
                came<br>
                forth in the clear, beautiful sky, he felt revived. People at 
                this<br>
                hour began to make their appearance in all the balconies in the<br>
                street; for in warm climates every window has a balcony, in which 
                they can breathe the fresh evening air, which is very necessary, 
                even to those who are used to a heat that makes them as brown 
                as mahogany; so that the street presented a very lively appearance. 
                Here were shoemakers, and tailors, and all sorts of people sitting. 
                In the<br>
                street beneath, they brought out tables and chairs, lighted candles 
                by<br>
                hundreds, talked and sang, and were very merry. There were people<br>
                walking, carriages driving, and mules trotting along, with their 
                bells<br>
                on the harness, &quot;tingle, tingle,&quot; as they went. Then 
                the dead were<br>
                carried to the grave with the sound of solemn music, and the tolling<br>
                of the church bells. It was indeed a scene of varied life in the<br>
                street. One house only, which was just opposite to the one in 
                which<br>
                the foreign learned man lived, formed a contrast to all this, 
                for it<br>
                was quite still; and yet somebody dwelt there, for flowers stood 
                in<br>
                the balcony, blooming beautifully in the hot sun; and this could 
                not<br>
                have been unless they had been watered carefully. Therefore some 
                one must be in the house to do this. The doors leading to the 
                balcony were half opened in the evening; and although in the front 
                room all was dark, music could be heard from the interior of the 
                house. The foreign learned man considered this music very delightful; 
                but perhaps he fancied it; for everything in these warm countries 
                pleased him, excepting the heat of the sun. The foreign landlord 
                said he did not know who had taken the opposite house- nobody 
                was to be seen there; and as to the music, he thought it seemed 
                very tedious, to him most uncommonly so.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is just as if some one was practising a piece that he 
                could<br>
                not manage; it is always the same piece. He thinks, I suppose, 
                that he<br>
                will be able to manage it at last; but I do not think so, however 
                long<br>
                he may play it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Once the foreigner woke in the night. He slept with the door<br>
                open which led to the balcony; the wind had raised the curtain<br>
                before it, and there appeared a wonderful brightness over all 
                in the<br>
                balcony of the opposite house. The flowers seemed like flames 
                of the<br>
                most gorgeous colors, and among the flowers stood a beautiful<br>
                slender maiden. It was to him as if light streamed from her, and<br>
                dazzled his eyes; but then he had only just opened them, as he 
                awoke<br>
                from his sleep. With one spring he was out of bed, and crept softly<br>
                behind the curtain. But she was gone- the brightness had<br>
                disappeared; the flowers no longer appeared like flames, although<br>
                still as beautiful as ever. The door stood ajar, and from an inner<br>
                room sounded music so sweet and so lovely, that it produced the 
                most enchanting thoughts, and acted on the senses with magic power. 
              </p>
              <p>Who could live there? Where was the real entrance? for, both 
                in the street and in the lane at the side, the whole ground floor 
                was a continuation of shops; and people could not always be passing 
                through them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>One evening the foreigner sat in the balcony. A light was<br>
                burning in his own room, just behind him. It was quite natural,<br>
                therefore, that his shadow should fall on the wall of the opposite<br>
                house; so that, as he sat amongst the flowers on his balcony, 
                when<br>
                he moved, his shadow moved also.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I think my shadow is the only living thing to be seen opposite,&quot; 
                said the learned man; &quot;see how pleasantly it sits among the 
                flowers. The door is only ajar; the shadow ought to be clever 
                enough to step in and look about him, and then to come back and 
                tell me what he has seen. You could make yourself useful in this 
                way,&quot; said he, jokingly; &quot;be so good as to step in now, 
                will you?&quot; and then he nodded to the shadow, and the shadow 
                nodded in return. &quot;Now go, but don't stay away altogether.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the foreigner stood up, and the shadow on the opposite<br>
                balcony stood up also; the foreigner turned round, the shadow<br>
                turned; and if any one had observed, they might have seen it go<br>
                straight into the half-opened door of the opposite balcony, as 
                the<br>
                learned man re-entered his own room, and let the curtain fall. 
                The<br>
                next morning he went out to take his coffee and read the newspapers.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;How is this?&quot; he exclaimed, as he stood in the sunshine. 
                &quot;I<br>
                have lost my shadow. So it really did go away yesterday evening, 
                and<br>
                it has not returned. This is very annoying.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And it certainly did vex him, not so much because the shadow 
                was<br>
                gone, but because he knew there was a story of a man without a 
                shadow.<br>
              </p>
              <p>All the people at home, in his country, knew this story; and 
                when he<br>
                returned, and related his own adventures, they would say it was 
                only<br>
                an imitation; and he had no desire for such things to be said 
                of<br>
                him. So he decided not to speak of it at all, which was a very<br>
                sensible determination.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the evening he went out again on his balcony, taking care 
                to<br>
                place the light behind him; for he knew that a shadow always wants 
                his master for a screen; but he could not entice him out. He made<br>
                himself little, and he made himself tall; but there was no shadow, 
                and<br>
                no shadow came. He said, &quot;Hem, a-hem;&quot; but it was all 
                useless. That<br>
                was very vexatious; but in warm countries everything grows very<br>
                quickly; and, after a week had passed, he saw, to his great joy,<br>
                that a new shadow was growing from his feet, when he walked in 
                the<br>
                sunshine; so that the root must have remained. After three weeks, 
                he<br>
                had quite a respectable shadow, which, during his return journey 
                to<br>
                northern lands, continued to grow, and became at last so large 
                that he<br>
                might very well have spared half of it. When this learned man<br>
                arrived at home, he wrote books about the true, the good, and 
                the<br>
                beautiful, which are to be found in this world; and so days and<br>
                years passed- many, many years.<br>
              </p>
              <p>One evening, as he sat in his study, a very gentle tap was heard<br>
                at the door. &quot;Come in,&quot; said he; but no one came. He 
                opened the<br>
                door, and there stood before him a man so remarkably thin that 
                he felt<br>
                seriously troubled at his appearance. He was, however, very well<br>
                dressed, and looked like a gentleman. &quot;To whom have I the 
                honor of<br>
                speaking?&quot; said he.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ah, I hoped you would recognize me,&quot; said the elegant 
                stranger;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I have gained so much that I have a body of flesh, and 
                clothes to<br>
                wear. You never expected to see me in such a condition. Do you 
                not<br>
                recognize your old shadow? Ah, you never expected that I should 
                return to you again. All has been prosperous with me since I was 
                with you last; I have become rich in every way, and, were I inclined 
                to<br>
                purchase my freedom from service, I could easily do so.&quot; 
                And as he<br>
                spoke he rattled between his fingers a number of costly trinkets 
                which<br>
                hung to a thick gold watch-chain he wore round his neck. Diamond 
                rings sparkled on his fingers, and it was all real.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I cannot recover from my astonishment,&quot; said the learned 
                man.<br>
                &quot;What does all this mean?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Something rather unusual,&quot; said the shadow; &quot;but 
                you are yourself<br>
                an uncommon man, and you know very well that I have followed in 
                your footsteps ever since your childhood. As soon as you found 
                that I have travelled enough to be trusted alone, I went my own 
                way, and I am now in the most brilliant circumstances. But I felt 
                a kind of<br>
                longing to see you once more before you die, and I wanted to see<br>
                this place again, for there is always a clinging to the land of<br>
                one's birth. I know that you have now another shadow; do I owe 
                you<br>
                anything? If so, have the goodness to say what it is.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No! Is it really you?&quot; said the learned man. &quot;Well, 
                this is<br>
                most remarkable; I never supposed it possible that a man's old<br>
                shadow could become a human being.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Just tell me what I owe you,&quot; said the shadow, &quot;for 
                I do not like<br>
                to be in debt to any man.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;How can you talk in that manner?&quot; said the learned 
                man. &quot;What<br>
                question of debt can there be between us? You are as free as any<br>
                one. I rejoice exceedingly to hear of your good fortune. Sit down, 
                old<br>
                friend, and tell me a little of how it happened, and what you 
                saw in<br>
                the house opposite to me while we were in those hot climates.&quot;<br>
                &quot;Yes, I will tell you all about it,&quot; said the shadow, 
                sitting<br>
                down; &quot;but then you must promise me never to tell in this 
                city,<br>
                wherever you may meet me, that I have been your shadow. I am<br>
                thinking of being married, for I have more than sufficient to<br>
                support a family.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Make yourself quite easy,&quot; said the learned man; &quot;I 
                will tell<br>
                no one who you really are. Here is my hand,- I promise, and a 
                word<br>
                is sufficient between man and man.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Between man and a shadow,&quot; said the shadow; for he 
                could not help<br>
                saying so.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was really most remarkable how very much he had become a man 
                in appearance. He was dressed in a suit of the very finest black 
                cloth,<br>
                polished boots, and an opera crush hat, which could be folded 
                together so that nothing could be seen but the crown and the rim, 
                besides the trinkets, the gold chain, and the diamond rings already 
                spoken of. The shadow was, in fact, very well dressed, and this 
                made a man of him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now I will relate to you what you wish to know,&quot; said 
                the shadow,<br>
                placing his foot with the polished leather boot as firmly as<br>
                possible on the arm of the new shadow of the learned man, which 
                lay at his feet like a poodle dog. This was done, it might be 
                from pride,<br>
                or perhaps that the new shadow might cling to him, but the prostrate<br>
                shadow remained quite quiet and at rest, in order that it might<br>
                listen, for it wanted to know how a shadow could be sent away 
                by its<br>
                master, and become a man itself. &quot;Do you know,&quot; said 
                the shadow, &quot;that in the house opposite to you lived the 
                most glorious creature in the world? It was poetry. I remained 
                there three weeks, and it was more like three thousand years, 
                for I read all that has ever been written<br>
                in poetry or prose; and I may say, in truth, that I saw and learnt<br>
                everything.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Poetry!&quot; exclaimed the learned man. &quot;Yes, she 
                lives as a hermit<br>
                in great cities. Poetry! Well, I saw her once for a very short 
                moment,<br>
                while sleep weighed down my eyelids. She flashed upon me from 
                the<br>
                balcony like the radiant aurora borealis, surrounded with flowers 
                like<br>
                flames of fire. Tell me, you were on the balcony that evening; 
                you<br>
                went through the door, and what did you see?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I found myself in an ante-room,&quot; said the shadow. 
                &quot;You still<br>
                sat opposite to me, looking into the room. There was no light, 
                or at<br>
                least it seemed in partial darkness, for the door of a whole suite<br>
                of rooms stood open, and they were brilliantly lighted. The blaze 
                of<br>
                light would have killed me, had I approached too near the maiden<br>
                myself, but I was cautious, and took time, which is what every 
                one<br>
                ought to do.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And what didst thou see?&quot; asked the learned man.<br>
                &quot;I saw everything, as you shall hear. But- it really is not<br>
                pride on my part, as a free man and possessing the knowledge that 
                I<br>
                do, besides my position, not to speak of my wealth- I wish you 
                would say you to me instead of thou.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; said the learned man; &quot;it 
                is an old habit,<br>
                which it is difficult to break. You are quite right; I will try 
                to<br>
                think of it. But now tell me everything that you saw.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Everything,&quot; said the shadow; &quot;for I saw and 
                know everything.&quot;<br>
                &quot;What was the appearance of the inner rooms?&quot; asked 
                the scholar.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Was it there like a cool grove, or like a holy temple? 
                Were the<br>
                chambers like a starry sky seen from the top of a high mountain?&quot;<br>
                &quot;It was all that you describe,&quot; said the shadow; &quot;but 
                I did not go<br>
                quite in- I remained in the twilight of the ante-room- but I was 
                in<br>
                a very good position,- I could see and hear all that was going 
                on in<br>
                the court of poetry.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But what did you see? Did the gods of ancient times pass<br>
                through the rooms? Did old heroes fight their battles over again? 
              </p>
              <p>Were there lovely children at play, who related their dreams?&quot;<br>
                &quot;I tell you I have been there, and therefore you may be sure<br>
                that I saw everything that was to be seen. If you had gone there,<br>
                you would not have remained a human being, whereas I became one; 
                and at the same moment I became aware of my inner being, my inborn 
                affinity to the nature of poetry. It is true I did not think much<br>
                about it while I was with you, but you will remember that I was 
                always much larger at sunrise and sunset, and in the moonlight 
                even more visible than yourself, but I did not then understand 
                my inner<br>
                existence. In the ante-room it was revealed to me. I became a 
                man; I<br>
                came out in full maturity. But you had left the warm countries. 
                As a<br>
                man, I felt ashamed to go about without boots or clothes, and 
                that<br>
                exterior finish by which man is known. So I went my own way; I 
                can<br>
                tell you, for you will not put it in a book. I hid myself under 
                the<br>
                cloak of a cake woman, but she little thought who she concealed. 
                It<br>
                was not till evening that I ventured out. I ran about the streets 
                in<br>
                the moonlight. I drew myself up to my full height upon the walls,<br>
                which tickled my back very pleasantly. I ran here and there, looked<br>
                through the highest windows into the rooms, and over the roofs. 
                I<br>
                looked in, and saw what nobody else could see, or indeed ought 
                to see; in fact, it is a bad world, and I would not care to be 
                a man, but that men are of some importance. I saw the most miserable 
                things going on between husbands and wives, parents and children,- 
                sweet, incomparable children. I have seen what no human being 
                has the power of knowing, although they would all be very glad 
                to know- the evil conduct of their neighbors. Had I written a 
                newspaper, how eagerly it would have been read! Instead of which, 
                I wrote directly to the persons themselves, and great alarm arose 
                in all the town I visited. </p>
              <p>They had so much fear of me, and yet how dearly they loved me. 
                The<br>
                professor made me a professor. The tailor gave me new clothes; 
                I am<br>
                well provided for in that way. The overseer of the mint struck 
                coins<br>
                for me. The women declared that I was handsome, and so I became 
                the man you now see me. And now I must say adieu. Here is my card. 
                I live on the sunny side of the street, and always stay at home 
                in rainy weather.&quot; And the shadow departed.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;This is all very remarkable,&quot; said the learned man.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Years passed, days and years went by, and the shadow came again.<br>
                &quot;How are you going on now?&quot; he asked.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ah!&quot; said the learned man; &quot;I am writing about 
                the true, the<br>
                beautiful, and the good; but no one cares to hear anything about 
                it. I<br>
                am quite in despair, for I take it to heart very much.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That is what I never do,&quot; said the shadow; &quot;I 
                am growing quite<br>
                fat and stout, which every one ought to be. You do not understand<br>
                the world; you will make yourself ill about it; you ought to travel; 
                I<br>
                am going on a journey in the summer, will you go with me? I should<br>
                like a travelling companion; will you travel with me as my shadow?<br>
                It would give me great pleasure, and I will pay all expenses.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Are you going to travel far?&quot; asked the learned man.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That is a matter of opinion,&quot; replied the shadow. 
                &quot;At all events,<br>
                a journey will do you good, and if you will be my shadow, then 
                all<br>
                your journey shall be paid.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It appears to me very absurd,&quot; said the learned man.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But it is the way of the world,&quot; replied the shadow, 
                &quot;and<br>
                always will be.&quot; Then he went away.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Everything went wrong with the learned man. Sorrow and trouble<br>
                pursued him, and what he said about the good, the beautiful, and 
                the<br>
                true, was of as much value to most people as a nutmeg would be 
                to a<br>
                cow. At length he fell ill. &quot;You really look like a shadow,&quot; 
                people<br>
                said to him, and then a cold shudder would pass over him, for 
                he had<br>
                his own thoughts on the subject.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You really ought to go to some watering-place,&quot; said 
                the shadow<br>
                on his next visit. &quot;There is no other chance for you. I will 
                take<br>
                you with me, for the sake of old acquaintance. I will pay the 
                expenses<br>
                of your journey, and you shall write a description of it to amuse 
                us<br>
                by the way. I should like to go to a watering-place; my beard 
                does not grow as it ought, which is from weakness, and I must 
                have a beard. Now do be sensible and accept my proposal; we shall 
                travel as intimate friends.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And at last they started together. The shadow was master now,<br>
                and the master became the shadow. They drove together, and rode 
                and walked in company with each other, side by side, or one in 
                front and the other behind, according to the position of the sun. 
                The shadow always knew when to take the place of honor, but the 
                learned man took no notice of it, for he had a good heart, and 
                was exceedingly mild and friendly.<br>
              </p>
              <p>One day the master said to the shadow, &quot;We have grown up<br>
                together from our childhood, and now that we have become travelling<br>
                companions, shall we not drink to our good fellowship, and say 
                thee<br>
                and thou to each other?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What you say is very straightforward and kindly meant,&quot; 
                said<br>
                the shadow, who was now really master. &quot;I will be equally 
                kind and<br>
                straightforward. You are a learned man, and know how wonderful 
                human nature is. There are some men who cannot endure the smell 
                of brown paper; it makes them ill. Others will feel a shuddering 
                sensation to their very marrow, if a nail is scratched on a pane 
                of glass. I myself<br>
                have a similar kind of feeling when I hear any one say thou to 
                me. I<br>
                feel crushed by it, as I used to feel in my former position with<br>
                you. You will perceive that this is a matter of feeling, not pride.<br>
                I cannot allow you to say thou to me; I will gladly say it to 
                you, and<br>
                therefore your wish will be half fulfilled.&quot; Then the shadow 
                addressed<br>
                his former master as thou.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is going rather too far,&quot; said the latter, &quot;that 
                I am to say<br>
                you when I speak to him, and he is to say thou to me.&quot; However, 
                he was obliged to submit.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They arrived at length at the baths, where there were many<br>
                strangers, and among them a beautiful princess, whose real disease<br>
                consisted in being too sharp-sighted, which made every one very<br>
                uneasy. She saw at once that the new comer was very different 
                to every one else. &quot;They say he is here to make his beard 
                grow,&quot; she thought; &quot;but I know the real cause, he is 
                unable to cast a shadow.&quot; </p>
              <p>Then she became very curious on the matter, and one day, while 
                on the promenade, she entered into conversation with the strange 
                gentleman.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Being a princess, she was not obliged to stand upon much ceremony,<br>
                so she said to him without hesitation, &quot;Your illness consists 
                in not<br>
                being able to cast a shadow.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Your royal highness must be on the high road to recovery 
                from<br>
                your illness,&quot; said he. &quot;I know your complaint arose 
                from being too<br>
                sharp-sighted, and in this case it has entirely failed. I happen 
                to<br>
                have a most unusual shadow. Have you not seen a person who is 
                always at my side? Persons often give their servants finer cloth 
                for their liveries than for their own clothes, and so I have dressed 
                out my<br>
                shadow like a man; nay, you may observe that I have even given 
                him a shadow of his own; it is rather expensive, but I like to 
                have things<br>
                about me that are peculiar.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;How is this?&quot; thought the princess; &quot;am I really 
                cured? This must<br>
                be the best watering-place in existence. Water in our times has<br>
                certainly wonderful power. But I will not leave this place yet, 
                just<br>
                as it begins to be amusing. This foreign prince- for he must be 
                a<br>
                prince- pleases me above all things. I only hope his beard won't 
                grow,<br>
                or he will leave at once.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the evening, the princess and the shadow danced together in 
                the<br>
                large assembly rooms. She was light, but he was lighter still; 
                she had<br>
                never seen such a dancer before. She told him from what country 
                she<br>
                had come, and found he knew it and had been there, but not while 
                she<br>
                was at home. He had looked into the windows of her father's palace,<br>
                both the upper and the lower windows; he had seen many things, 
                and<br>
                could therefore answer the princess, and make allusions which 
                quite<br>
                astonished her. She thought he must be the cleverest man in all 
                the<br>
                world, and felt the greatest respect for his knowledge. When she<br>
                danced with him again she fell in love with him, which the shadow<br>
                quickly discovered, for she had with her eyes looked him through 
                and<br>
                through. They danced once more, and she was nearly telling him, 
                but<br>
                she had some discretion; she thought of her country, her kingdom,<br>
                and the number of people over whom she would one day have to rule. 
                &quot;He is a clever man,&quot; she thought to herself, &quot;which 
                is a good thing, and he dances admirably, which is also good. 
                But has he<br>
                well-grounded knowledge? that is an important question, and I 
                must try him.&quot; Then she asked him a most difficult question, 
                she herself<br>
                could not have answered it, and the shadow made a most unaccountable 
                grimace.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You cannot answer that,&quot; said the princess.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I learnt something about it in my childhood,&quot; he replied; 
                &quot;and<br>
                believe that even my very shadow, standing over there by the door,<br>
                could answer it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Your shadow,&quot; said the princess; &quot;indeed that 
                would be very<br>
                remarkable.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I do not say so positively,&quot; observed the shadow; 
                &quot;but I am<br>
                inclined to believe that he can do so. He has followed me for 
                so<br>
                many years, and has heard so much from me, that I think it is 
                very<br>
                likely. But your royal highness must allow me to observe, that 
                he is<br>
                very proud of being considered a man, and to put him in a good<br>
                humor, so that he may answer correctly, he must be treated as 
                a man.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I shall be very pleased to do so,&quot; said the princess. 
                So she<br>
                walked up to the learned man, who stood in the doorway, and spoke 
                to him of the sun, and the moon, of the green forests, and of 
                people near home and far off; and the learned man conversed with 
                her pleasantly and sensibly.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What a wonderful man he must be, to have such a clever 
                shadow!&quot;<br>
                thought she. &quot;If I were to choose him it would be a real 
                blessing to<br>
                my country and my subjects, and I will do it.&quot; So the princess 
                and the<br>
                shadow were soon engaged to each other, but no one was to be told 
                a word about it, till she returned to her kingdom.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No one shall know,&quot; said the shadow; &quot;not even 
                my own shadow;&quot;<br>
                and he had very particular reasons for saying so.<br>
              </p>
              <p>After a time, the princess returned to the land over which she<br>
                reigned, and the shadow accompanied her.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Listen my friend,&quot; said the shadow to the learned 
                man; &quot;now<br>
                that I am as fortunate and as powerful as any man can be, I will 
                do<br>
                something unusually good for you. You shall live in my palace, 
                drive<br>
                with me in the royal carriage, and have a hundred thousand dollars 
                a<br>
                year; but you must allow every one to call you a shadow, and never<br>
                venture to say that you have been a man. And once a year, when 
                I sit<br>
                in my balcony in the sunshine, you must lie at my feet as becomes 
                a<br>
                shadow to do; for I must tell you I am going to marry the princess,<br>
                and our wedding will take place this evening.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now, really, this is too ridiculous,&quot; said the learned 
                man. &quot;I<br>
                cannot, and will not, submit to such folly. It would be cheating 
                the<br>
                whole country, and the princess also. I will disclose everything,<br>
                and say that I am the man, and that you are only a shadow dressed 
                up<br>
                in men's clothes.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No one would believe you,&quot; said the shadow; &quot;be 
                reasonable,<br>
                now, or I will call the guards.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I will go straight to the princess,&quot; said the learned 
                man.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But I shall be there first,&quot; replied the shadow, &quot;and 
                you will be<br>
                sent to prison.&quot; And so it turned out, for the guards readily 
                obeyed<br>
                him, as they knew he was going to marry the king's daughter.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You tremble,&quot; said the princess, when the shadow appeared<br>
                before her. &quot;Has anything happened? You must not be ill to-day, 
                for<br>
                this evening our wedding will take place.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I have gone through the most terrible affair that could<br>
                possibly happen,&quot; said the shadow; &quot;only imagine, my 
                shadow has gone mad; I suppose such a poor, shallow brain, could 
                not bear much; he fancies that he has become a real man, and that 
                I am his shadow.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;How very terrible,&quot; cried the princess; &quot;is he 
                locked up?&quot;<br>
                &quot;Oh yes, certainly; for I fear he will never recover.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Poor shadow!&quot; said the princess; &quot;it is very 
                unfortunate for him;<br>
                it would really be a good deed to free him from his frail existence;<br>
                and, indeed, when I think how often people take the part of the<br>
                lower class against the higher, in these days, it would be policy 
                to<br>
                put him out of the way quietly.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is certainly rather hard upon him, for he was a faithful<br>
                servant,&quot; said the shadow; and he pretended to sigh.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yours is a noble character,&quot; said the princess, and 
                bowed herself<br>
                before him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the evening the whole town was illuminated, and cannons fired<br>
                &quot;boom,&quot; and the soldiers presented arms. It was indeed 
                a grand<br>
                wedding. The princess and the shadow stepped out on the balcony 
                to<br>
                show themselves, and to receive one cheer more. But the learned 
                man<br>
                heard nothing of all these festivities, for he had already been<br>
                executed.</p>

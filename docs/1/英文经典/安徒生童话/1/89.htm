              <p class="h" align="center"> THE RACES</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> A PRIZE, or rather two prizes, a great one and a small one, 
                had<br>
                been awarded for the greatest swiftness in running,- not in a 
                single<br>
                race, but for the whole year.</p>
              <p> &quot;I obtained the first prize,&quot; said the hare. &quot;Justice 
                must still<br>
                be carried out, even when one has relations and good friends among 
                the prize committee; but that the snail should have received the 
                second prize, I consider almost an insult to myself&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No,&quot; said the fence-rail, who had been a witness at 
                the<br>
                distribution of prizes; &quot;there should be some consideration 
                for<br>
                industry and perseverance. I have heard many respectable people 
                say<br>
                so, and I can quite understand it. The snail certainly took half 
                a<br>
                year to get over the threshold of the door; but he injured himself,<br>
                and broke his collar-bone by the haste he made. He gave himself 
                up<br>
                entirely to the race, and ran with his house on his back, which 
                was<br>
                all, of course, very praiseworthy; and therefore he obtained the<br>
                second prize.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I think I ought to have had some consideration too,&quot; 
                said the<br>
                swallow. &quot;I should imagine no one can be swifter in soaring 
                and flight<br>
                than I am; and how far I have been! far, far away.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, that is your misfortune,&quot; said the fence-rail; 
                &quot;you are so<br>
                fickle, so unsettled; you must always be travelling about into 
                foreign<br>
                lands when the cold commences here. You have no love of fatherland<br>
                in you. There can be no consideration for you.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But now, if I have been lying the whole winter in the moor,&quot; 
                said<br>
                the swallow, &quot;and suppose I slept the whole time, would that 
                be<br>
                taken into account?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Bring a certificate from the old moor-hen,&quot; said he, 
                &quot;that you<br>
                have slept away half your time in fatherland; then you will be 
                treated<br>
                with some consideration.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I deserved the first prize, and not the second,&quot; said 
                the<br>
                snail. &quot;I know so much, at least, that the hare only ran 
                from<br>
                cowardice, and because he thought there was danger in delay. I, 
                on the other hand, made running the business of my life, and have 
                become a cripple in the service. If any one had a first prize, 
                it ought to have been myself. But I do not understand chattering 
                and boasting; on the contrary, I despise it.&quot; And the snail 
                spat at them with contempt.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I am able to affirm with word of oath, that each prize- 
                at least,<br>
                those for which I voted- was given with just and proper<br>
                consideration,&quot; said the old boundary post in the wood, who 
                was a<br>
                member of the committee of judges. &quot;I always act with due 
                order,<br>
                consideration, and calculation. Seven times have I already had 
                the<br>
                honor to be present at the distribution of the prizes, and to 
                vote;<br>
                but to-day is the first time I have been able to carry out my 
                will.<br>
                I always reckon the first prize by going through the alphabet 
                from the<br>
                beginning, and the second by going through from the end. Be so 
                kind as to give me your attention, and I will explain to you how 
                I reckon from the beginning. The eighth letter from A is H, and 
                there we have H for hare; therefore I awarded to the hare the 
                first prize. The<br>
                eighth letter from the end of the alphabet is S, and therefore 
                the<br>
                snail received the second prize. Next year, the letter I will 
                have its<br>
                turn for the first prize, and the letter R for the second.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I should really have voted for myself,&quot; said the mule, 
                &quot;if I<br>
                had not been one of the judges on the committee. Not only the 
                rapidity with which advance is made, but every other quality should 
                have due consideration; as, for instance, how much weight a candidate 
                is able to draw; but I have not brought this quality forward now, 
                nor the sagacity of the hare in his flight, nor the cunning with 
                which he suddenly springs aside and doubles, to lead people on 
                a false track, thinking he has concealed himself. No; there is 
                something else on which more stress should be laid, and which 
                ought not be left<br>
                unnoticed. I mean that which mankind call the beautiful. It is 
                on<br>
                the beautiful that I particularly fix my eyes. I observed the<br>
                well-grown ears of the hare; it is a pleasure to me to observe 
                how<br>
                long they are. It seemed as if I saw myself again in the days 
                of my<br>
                childhood; and so I voted for the hare.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Buz,&quot; said the fly; &quot;there, I'm not going to 
                make a long<br>
                speech; but I wish to say something about hares. I have really<br>
                overtaken more than one hare, when I have been seated on the engine 
                in front of a railway train. I often do so. One can then so easily<br>
                judge of one's own swiftness. Not long ago, I crushed the hind 
                legs of a young hare. He had been running a long time before the 
                engine; he had no idea that I was travelling there. At last he 
                had to stop in his<br>
                career, and the engine ran over his hind legs, and crushed them; 
                for I<br>
                set upon it. I left him lying there, and rode on farther. I call<br>
                that conquering him; but I do not want the prize.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It really seems to me,&quot; thought the wild rose, though 
                she did not<br>
                express her opinion aloud- it is not in her nature to do so,- 
                though<br>
                it would have been quite as well if she had; &quot;it certainly 
                seems to me<br>
                that the sunbeam ought to have had the honor of receiving the 
                first<br>
                prize. The sunbeam flies in a few minutes along the immeasurable<br>
                path from the sun to us. It arrives in such strength, that all<br>
                nature awakes to loveliness and beauty; we roses blush and exhale<br>
                fragrance in its presence. Our worshipful judges don't appear 
                to<br>
                have noticed this at all. Were I the sunbeam, I would give each 
                one of<br>
                them a sun stroke; but that would only make them mad, and they 
                are mad enough already. I only hope,&quot; continued the rose, 
                &quot;that peace may reign in the wood. It is glorious to bloom, 
                to be fragrant, and to<br>
                live; to live in story and in song. The sunbeam will outlive us 
                all.&quot;<br>
                &quot;What is the first prize?&quot; asked the earthworm, who 
                had<br>
                overslept the time, and only now came up.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It contains a free admission to a cabbage-garden,&quot; 
                replied the<br>
                mule. &quot;I proposed that as one of the prizes. The hare most 
                decidedly<br>
                must have it; and I, as an active and thoughtful member of the<br>
                committee, took especial care that the prize should be one of<br>
                advantage to him; so now he is provided for. The snail can now 
                sit<br>
                on the fence, and lick up moss and sunshine. He has also been<br>
                appointed one of the first judges of swiftness in racing. It is<br>
                worth much to know that one of the numbers is a man of talent 
                in the<br>
                thing men call a 'committee.' I must say I expect much in the<br>
                future; we have already made such a good beginning.&quot;</p>

              <p class="h" align="center"> THE BIRD OF POPULAR SONG</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> IT is winter-time. The earth wears a snowy garment, and looks 
                like<br>
                marble hewn out of the rock; the air is bright and clear; the 
                wind<br>
                is sharp as a well-tempered sword, and the trees stand like branches<br>
                of white coral or blooming almond twigs, and here it is keen as 
                on the<br>
                lofty Alps.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The night is splendid in the gleam of the Northern Lights, and<br>
                in the glitter of innumerable twinkling stars.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But we sit in the warm room, by the hot stove, and talk about<br>
                the old times. And we listen to this story:<br>
              </p>
              <p>By the open sea was a giant's grave; and on the grave-mound sat 
                at<br>
                midnight the spirit of the buried hero, who had been a king. The<br>
                golden circlet gleamed on his brow, his hair fluttered in the 
                wind,<br>
                and he was clad in steel and iron. He bent his head mournfully, 
                and<br>
                sighed in deep sorrow, as an unquiet spirit might sigh.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And a ship came sailing by. Presently the sailors lowered the<br>
                anchor and landed. Among them was a singer, and he approached 
                the<br>
                royal spirit, and said,<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Why mournest thou, and wherefore dost thou suffer thus?&quot;<br>
                And the dead man answered,<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No one has sung the deeds of my life; they are dead and<br>
                forgotten. Song doth not carry them forth over the lands, nor 
                into the<br>
                hearts of men; therefore I have no rest and no peace.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And he spoke of his works, and of his warlike deeds, which his<br>
                contemporaries had known, but which had not been sung, because 
                there was no singer among his companions.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the old bard struck the strings of his harp, and sang of<br>
                the youthful courage of the hero, of the strength of the man, 
                and of<br>
                the greatness of his good deeds. Then the face of the dead one 
                gleamed like the margin of the cloud in the moonlight. Gladly 
                and of good courage, the form arose in splendor and in majesty, 
                and vanished like the glancing of the northern light. Nought was 
                to be seen but the green tufy mound, with the stones on which 
                no Runic record has been graven; but at the last sound of the 
                harp there soared over the hill, as though he had fluttered from 
                the harp, a little bird, a<br>
                charming singing-bird, with ringing voice of the thrush, with 
                the<br>
                moving voice pathos of the human heart, with a voice that told 
                of<br>
                home, like the voice that is heard by the bird of passage. The<br>
                singing-bird soared away, over mountain and valley, over field 
                and<br>
                wood- he was the Bird of Popular Song, who never dies.<br>
              </p>
              <p>We hear his song- we hear it now in the room while the white<br>
                bees are swarming without, and the storm clutches the windows. 
                The<br>
                bird sings not alone the requiem of heroes; he sings also sweet 
                gentle<br>
                songs of love, so many and so warm, of Northern fidelity and truth. 
              </p>
              <p>He has stories in words and in tones; he has proverbs and snatches 
                of proverbs; songs which, like Runes laid under a dead man's tongue,<br>
                force him to speak; and thus Popular Song tells of the land of 
                his<br>
                birth.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the old heathen days, in the times of the Vikings, the popular 
                speech was enshrined in the harp of the bard.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the days of knightly castles, when the strongest fist held<br>
                the scales of justice, when only might was right, and a peasant 
                and<br>
                a dog were of equal importance, where did the Bird of Song find<br>
                shelter and protection? Neither violence nor stupidity gave him 
                a<br>
                thought.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But in the gabled window of the knightly castle, the lady of 
                the<br>
                castle sat with the parchment roll before her, and wrote down 
                the<br>
                old recollections in song and legend, while near her stood the 
                old<br>
                woman from the wood, and the travelling peddler who went wandering 
                through the country. As these told their tales, there fluttered 
                around them, with twittering and song, the Bird of Popular Song, 
                who never dies so long as the earth has a hill upon which his 
                foot may rest.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And now he looks in upon us and sings. Without are the night 
                and<br>
                the snow-storm. He lays the Runes beneath our tongues, and we 
                know the land of our home. Heaven speaks to us in our native tongue, 
                in the voice of the Bird of Popular Song. The old remembrances 
                awake, the faded colors glow with a fresh lustre, and story and 
                song pour us a blessed draught which lifts up our minds and our 
                thoughts, so that the evening becomes as a Christmas festival.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The snow-flakes chase each other, the ice cracks, the storm<br>
                rules without, for he has the might, he is lord- but not the LORD 
                OF<br>
                ALL.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It is winter time. The wind is sharp as a two-edged sword, the<br>
                snow-flakes chase each other; it seems as though it had been snowing<br>
                for days and weeks, and the snow lies like a great mountain over 
                the<br>
                whole town, like a heavy dream of the winter night. Everything 
                on<br>
                the earth is hidden away, only the golden cross of the church, 
                the<br>
                symbol of faith, arises over the snow grave, and gleams in the 
                blue<br>
                air and in the bright sunshine.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And over the buried town fly the birds of heaven, the small and<br>
                the great; they twitter and they sing as best they may, each bird 
                with<br>
                his beak.<br>
              </p>
              <p>First comes the band of sparrows: they pipe at every trifle in 
                the<br>
                streets and lanes, in the nests and the houses; they have stories 
                to<br>
                tell about the front buildings and the back buildings.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We know the buried town,&quot; they say; &quot;everything 
                living in it is<br>
                piep! piep! piep!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The black ravens and crows flew on over the white snow.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Grub, grub!&quot; they cried. &quot;There's something to 
                be got down there;<br>
                something to swallow, and that's most important. That's the opinion 
                of most of them down there, and the opinion is goo-goo-good!&quot;<br>
                The wild swans come flying on whirring pinions, and sing of the<br>
                noble and the great, that will still sprout in the hearts of men, 
                down<br>
                in the town which is resting beneath its snowy veil.<br>
              </p>
              <p>No death is there- life reigns yonder; we hear it on the notes<br>
                that swell onward like the tones of the church organ, which seize 
                us<br>
                like sounds from the elf-hill, like the songs of Ossian, like 
                the<br>
                rushing swoop of the wandering spirits' wings. What harmony! That<br>
                harmony speaks to our hearts, and lifts up our souls! It is the 
                Bird<br>
                of Popular Song whom we hear.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And at this moment the warm breath of heaven blows down from 
                the<br>
                sky. There are gaps in the snowy mountains, the sun shines into 
                the<br>
                clefts; spring is coming, the birds are returning, and new races 
                are<br>
                coming with the same home sounds in their hearts.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Hear the story of the year: &quot;The night of the snow-storm, 
                the<br>
                heavy dream of the winter night, all shall be dissolved, all shall<br>
                rise again in the beauteous notes of the Bird of Popular Song, 
                who<br>
                never dies!&quot;</p>

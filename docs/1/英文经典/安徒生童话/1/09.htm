              <p class="h" align="center"> BY THE ALMSHOUSE WINDOW</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> NEAR the grass-covered rampart which encircles Copenhagen lies 
                a<br>
                great red house. Balsams and other flowers greet us from the long 
                rows of windows in the house, whose interior is sufficiently<br>
                poverty-stricken; and poor and old are the people who inhabit 
                it.<br>
                The building is the Warton Almshouse.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Look! at the window there leans an old maid. She plucks the<br>
                withered leaf from the balsam, and looks at the grass-covered 
                rampart, on which many children are playing. What is the old maid 
                thinking of? A whole life drama is unfolding itself before her 
                inward gaze. &quot;The poor little children, how happy they are- 
                how merrily they<br>
                play and romp together! What red cheeks and what angels' eyes! 
                but<br>
                they have no shoes nor stockings. They dance on the green rampart,<br>
                just on the place where, according to the old story, the ground 
                always<br>
                sank in, and where a sportive, frolicsome child had been lured 
                by<br>
                means of flowers, toys and sweetmeats into an open grave ready 
                dug for it, and which was afterwards closed over the child; and 
                from that<br>
                moment, the old story says, the ground gave way no longer, the 
                mound remained firm and fast, and was quickly covered with the 
                green turf. The little people who now play on that spot know nothing 
                of the old tale, else would they fancy they heard a child crying 
                deep below the earth, and the dewdrops on each blade of grass 
                would be to them tears of woe. Nor do they know anything of the 
                Danish King who here, in the face of the coming foe, took an oath 
                before all his trembling courtiers that he would hold out with 
                the citizens of his capital, and die here in his nest; they know 
                nothing of the men who have fought here, or of the women who from 
                here have drenched with boiling water the enemy, clad in white, 
                and 'biding in the snow to surprise the city.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No! the poor little ones are playing with light, childish<br>
                spirits. Play on, play on, thou little maiden! Soon the years 
                will<br>
                come- yes, those glorious years. The priestly hands have been 
                laid<br>
                on the candidates for confirmation; hand in hand they walk on 
                the<br>
                green rampart. Thou hast a white frock on; it has cost thy mother 
                much labor, and yet it is only cut down for thee out of an old 
                larger<br>
                dress! You will also wear a red shawl; and what if it hang too 
                far<br>
                down? People will only see how large, how very large it is. You 
                are<br>
                thinking of your dress, and of the Giver of all good- so glorious 
                is<br>
                it to wander on the green rampart!<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And the years roll by; they have no lack of dark days, 
                but you<br>
                have your cheerful young spirit, and you have gained a friend- 
                you<br>
                know not how. You met, oh, how often! You walk together on the 
                rampart in the fresh spring, on the high days and holidays, when 
                all the world come out to walk upon the ramparts, and all the 
                bells of the church steeples seem to be singing a song of praise 
                for the coming spring.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Scarcely have the violets come forth, but there on the 
                rampart,<br>
                just opposite the beautiful Castle of Rosenberg, there is a tree<br>
                bright with the first green buds. Every year this tree sends forth<br>
                fresh green shoots. Alas! It is not so with the human heart! Dark<br>
                mists, more in number than those that cover the northern skies,<br>
                cloud the human heart. Poor child! thy friend's bridal chamber 
                is a<br>
                black coffin, and thou becomest an old maid. From the almshouse<br>
                window, behind the balsams, thou shalt look on the merry children 
                at<br>
                play, and shalt see thine own history renewed.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And that is the life drama that passes before the old maid while<br>
                she looks out upon the rampart, the green, sunny rampart, where 
                the<br>
                children, with their red cheeks and bare shoeless feet, are<br>
                rejoicing merrily, like the other free little birds.</p>

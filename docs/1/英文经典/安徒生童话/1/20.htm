              <p class="h" align="center"> LITTLE CLAUS AND BIG CLAUS</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> IN a village there once lived two men who had the same name.<br>
                They were both called Claus. One of them had four horses, but 
                the<br>
                other had only one; so to distinguish them, people called the 
                owner of<br>
                the four horses, &quot;Great Claus,&quot; and he who had only 
                one, &quot;Little<br>
                Claus.&quot; Now we shall hear what happened to them, for this 
                is a true<br>
                story.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Through the whole week, Little Claus was obliged to plough for<br>
                Great Claus, and lend him his one horse; and once a week, on a 
                Sunday, Great Claus lent him all his four horses. Then how Little 
                Claus would smack his whip over all five horses, they were as 
                good as his own on that one day. The sun shone brightly, and the 
                church bells were ringing merrily as the people passed by, dressed 
                in their best clothes, with their prayer-books under their arms. 
                They were going to hear the clergyman preach. They looked at Little 
                Claus ploughing with his five horses, and he was so proud that 
                he smacked his whip, and said, &quot;Gee-up, my five horses.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You must not say that,&quot; said Big Claus; &quot;for 
                only one of them<br>
                belongs to you.&quot; But Little Claus soon forgot what he ought 
                to say,<br>
                and when any one passed he would call out, &quot;Gee-up, my five 
                horses!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now I must beg you not to say that again,&quot; said Big 
                Claus; &quot;for<br>
                if you do, I shall hit your horse on the head, so that he will 
                drop<br>
                dead on the spot, and there will be an end of him.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I promise you I will not say it any more,&quot; said the 
                other; but as<br>
                soon as people came by, nodding to him, and wishing him &quot;Good 
                day,&quot; he became so pleased, and thought how grand it looked 
                to have five horses ploughing in his field, that he cried out 
                again, &quot;Gee-up, all my horses!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I'll gee-up your horses for you,&quot; said Big Claus; 
                and seizing a<br>
                hammer, he struck the one horse of Little Claus on the head, and 
                he<br>
                fell dead instantly.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, now I have no horse at all, said Little Claus, weeping. 
                But<br>
                after a while he took off the dead horse's skin, and hung the 
                hide<br>
                to dry in the wind. Then he put the dry skin into a bag, and,<br>
                placing it over his shoulder, went out into the next town to sell<br>
                the horse's skin. He had a very long way to go, and had to pass<br>
                through a dark, gloomy forest. Presently a storm arose, and he 
                lost<br>
                his way, and before he discovered the right path, evening came 
                on, and it was still a long way to the town, and too far to return 
                home before night. Near the road stood a large farmhouse. The 
                shutters outside the windows were closed, but lights shone through 
                the crevices at the top.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I might get permission to stay here for the night,&quot; 
                thought Little<br>
                Claus; so he went up to the door and knocked. The farmer's wife 
                opened the door; but when she heard what he wanted, she told him 
                to go away, as her husband would not allow her to admit strangers. 
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Then I shall be obliged to lie out here,&quot; said Little 
                Claus to himself, as the farmer's wife shut the door in his face. 
                Near to the farmhouse<br>
                stood a large haystack, and between it and the house was a small 
                shed, with a thatched roof. &quot;I can lie up there,&quot; said 
                Little Claus, as he<br>
                saw the roof; &quot;it will make a famous bed, but I hope the 
                stork will<br>
                not fly down and bite my legs;&quot; for on it stood a living 
                stork,<br>
                whose nest was in the roof. So Little Claus climbed to the roof 
                of the<br>
                shed, and while he turned himself to get comfortable, he discovered<br>
                that the wooden shutters, which were closed, did not reach to 
                the tops of the windows of the farmhouse, so that he could see 
                into a room, in which a large table was laid out with wine, roast 
                meat, and a<br>
                splendid fish. The farmer's wife and the sexton were sitting at 
                the<br>
                table together; and she filled his glass, and helped him plenteously<br>
                to fish, which appeared to be his favorite dish. &quot;If I could 
                only<br>
                get some, too,&quot; thought Little Claus; and then, as he stretched 
                his<br>
                neck towards the window he spied a large, beautiful pie,- indeed<br>
                they had a glorious feast before them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>At this moment he heard some one riding down the road, towards 
                the<br>
                farmhouse. It was the farmer returning home. He was a good man, 
                but still he had a very strange prejudice,- he could not bear 
                the sight of a sexton. If one appeared before him, he would put 
                himself in a<br>
                terrible rage. In consequence of this dislike, the sexton had 
                gone<br>
                to visit the farmer's wife during her husband's absence from home, 
                and the good woman had placed before him the best she had in the 
                house to eat. When she heard the farmer coming she was frightened, 
                and begged the sexton to hide himself in a large empty chest that 
                stood in the room. He did so, for he knew her husband could not 
                endure the sight of a sexton. The woman then quickly put away 
                the wine, and hid all the rest of the nice things in the oven; 
                for if her husband had seen them he would have asked what they 
                were brought out for. &quot;Oh, dear,&quot; sighed Little Claus 
                from the top of the shed, as he saw all the good things disappear.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Is any one up there?&quot; asked the farmer, looking up 
                and<br>
                discovering Little Claus. &quot;Why are you lying up there? Come 
                down,<br>
                and come into the house with me.&quot; So Little Claus came down 
                and told the farmer how he had lost his way and begged for a night's 
                lodging.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said the farmer; &quot;but we must have 
                something to eat<br>
                first.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The woman received them both very kindly, laid the cloth on a<br>
                large table, and placed before them a dish of porridge. The farmer 
                was very hungry, and ate his porridge with a good appetite, but 
                Little<br>
                Claus could not help thinking of the nice roast meat, fish and 
                pies,<br>
                which he knew were in the oven. Under the table, at his feet, 
                lay<br>
                the sack containing the horse's skin, which he intended to sell 
                at the<br>
                next town. Now Little Claus did not relish the porridge at all, 
                so<br>
                he trod with his foot on the sack under the table, and the dry 
                skin<br>
                squeaked quite loud. &quot;Hush!&quot; said Little Claus to his 
                sack, at the<br>
                same time treading upon it again, till it squeaked louder than 
                before.<br>
                &quot;Hallo! what have you got in your sack!&quot; asked the farmer.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, it is a conjuror,&quot; said Little Claus; &quot;and 
                he says we need<br>
                not eat porridge, for he has conjured the oven full of roast meat,<br>
                fish, and pie.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Wonderful!&quot; cried the farmer, starting up and opening 
                the oven<br>
                door; and there lay all the nice things hidden by the farmer's 
                wife,<br>
                but which he supposed had been conjured there by the wizard under<br>
                the table. The woman dared not say anything; so she placed the<br>
                things before them, and they both ate of the fish, the meat, and 
                the<br>
                pastry.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then Little Claus trod again upon his sack, and it squeaked as<br>
                before. &quot;What does he say now?&quot; asked the farmer.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;He says,&quot; replied Little Claus, &quot;that there are 
                three bottles<br>
                of wine for us, standing in the corner, by the oven.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>So the woman was obliged to bring out the wine also, which she 
                had<br>
                hidden, and the farmer drank it till he became quite merry. He 
                would<br>
                have liked such a conjuror as Little Claus carried in his sack. 
                &quot;Could<br>
                he conjure up the evil one?&quot; asked the farmer. &quot;I should 
                like to see<br>
                him now, while I am so merry.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, yes!&quot; replied Little Claus, &quot;my conjuror 
                can do anything I<br>
                ask him,- can you not?&quot; he asked, treading at the same time 
                on the<br>
                sack till it squeaked. &quot;Do you hear? he answers 'Yes,' but 
                he fears<br>
                that we shall not like to look at him.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, I am not afraid. What will he be like?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well, he is very much like a sexton.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ha!&quot; said the farmer, &quot;then he must be ugly. 
                Do you know I cannot<br>
                endure the sight of a sexton. However, that doesn't matter, I 
                shall<br>
                know who it is; so I shall not mind. Now then, I have got up my<br>
                courage, but don't let him come too near me.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Stop, I must ask the conjuror,&quot; said Little Claus; 
                so he trod<br>
                on the bag, and stooped his ear down to listen.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What does he say?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;He says that you must go and open that large chest which 
                stands<br>
                in the corner, and you will see the evil one crouching down inside;<br>
                but you must hold the lid firmly, that he may not slip out.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Will you come and help me hold it?&quot; said the farmer, 
                going<br>
                towards the chest in which his wife had hidden the sexton, who 
                now lay inside, very much frightened. The farmer opened the lid 
                a very<br>
                little way, and peeped in.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; cried he, springing backwards, &quot;I saw him, 
                and he is exactly<br>
                like our sexton. How dreadful it is!&quot; So after that he was 
                obliged<br>
                to drink again, and they sat and drank till far into the night.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You must sell your conjuror to me,&quot; said the farmer; 
                &quot;ask as much<br>
                as you like, I will pay it; indeed I would give you directly a 
                whole<br>
                bushel of gold.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No, indeed, I cannot,&quot; said Little Claus; &quot;only 
                think how much<br>
                profit I could make out of this conjuror.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But I should like to have him,&quot; said the fanner, still 
                continuing<br>
                his entreaties.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Little Claus at length, &quot;you have 
                been so good as<br>
                to give me a night's lodging, I will not refuse you; you shall 
                have<br>
                the conjuror for a bushel of money, but I will have quite full<br>
                measure.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;So you shall,&quot; said the farmer; &quot;but you must 
                take away the chest<br>
                as well. I would not have it in the house another hour; there 
                is no<br>
                knowing if he may not be still there.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>So Little Claus gave the farmer the sack containing the dried<br>
                horse's skin, and received in exchange a bushel of money- full<br>
                measure. The farmer also gave him a wheelbarrow on which to carry 
                away the chest and the gold.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Farewell,&quot; said Little Claus, as he went off with 
                his money and<br>
                the great chest, in which the sexton lay still concealed. On one<br>
                side of the forest was a broad, deep river, the water flowed so<br>
                rapidly that very few were able to swim against the stream. A 
                new<br>
                bridge had lately been built across it, and in the middle of this<br>
                bridge Little Claus stopped, and said, loud enough to be heard 
                by<br>
                the sexton, &quot;Now what shall I do with this stupid chest; 
                it is as<br>
                heavy as if it were full of stones: I shall be tired if I roll 
                it<br>
                any farther, so I may as well throw it in the river; if it swims 
                after<br>
                me to my house, well and good, and if not, it will not much matter.&quot;<br>
                So he seized the chest in his hand and lifted it up a little, 
                as<br>
                if he were going to throw it into the water.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No, leave it alone,&quot; cried the sexton from within 
                the chest; &quot;let<br>
                me out first.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; exclaimed Little Claus, pretending to be frightened, 
                &quot;he<br>
                is in there still, is he? I must throw him into the river, that 
                he may<br>
                be drowned.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, no; oh, no,&quot; cried the sexton; &quot;I will give 
                you a whole<br>
                bushel full of money if you will let me go.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Why, that is another matter,&quot; said Little Claus, opening 
                the<br>
                chest. The sexton crept out, pushed the empty chest into the water,<br>
                and went to his house, then he measured out a whole bushel full 
                of<br>
                gold for Little Claus, who had already received one from the farmer,<br>
                so that now he had a barrow full.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I have been well paid for my horse,&quot; said he to himself 
                when he<br>
                reached home, entered his own room, and emptied all his money 
                into a heap on the floor. &quot;How vexed Great Claus will be 
                when he finds out how rich I have become all through my one horse; 
                but I shall not<br>
                tell him exactly how it all happened.&quot; Then he sent a boy 
                to Great<br>
                Claus to borrow a bushel measure.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What can he want it for?&quot; thought Great Claus; so 
                he smeared<br>
                the bottom of the measure with tar, that some of whatever was 
                put into it might stick there and remain. And so it happened; 
                for when the<br>
                measure returned, three new silver florins were sticking to it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What does this mean?&quot; said Great Claus; so he ran 
                off directly to<br>
                Little Claus, and asked, &quot;Where did you get so much money?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, for my horse's skin, I sold it yesterday.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It was certainly well paid for then,&quot; said Great Claus; 
                and he<br>
                ran home to his house, seized a hatchet, and knocked all his four<br>
                horses on the head, flayed off their skins, and took them to the<br>
                town to sell. &quot;Skins, skins, who'll buy skins?&quot; he cried, 
                as he went<br>
                through the streets. All the shoemakers and tanners came running,<br>
                and asked how much he wanted for them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;A bushel of money, for each,&quot; replied Great Claus.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Are you mad?&quot; they all cried; &quot;do you think we 
                have money to<br>
                spend by the bushel?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Skins, skins,&quot; he cried again, &quot;who'll buy skins?&quot; 
                but to all who<br>
                inquired the price, his answer was, &quot;a bushel of money.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;He is making fools of us,&quot; said they all; then the 
                shoemakers<br>
                took their straps, and the tanners their leather aprons, and began<br>
                to beat Great Claus.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Skins, skins!&quot; they cried, mocking him; &quot;yes, 
                we'll mark your<br>
                skin for you, till it is black and blue.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Out of the town with him,&quot; said they. And Great Claus 
                was obliged<br>
                to run as fast as he could, he had never before been so thoroughly<br>
                beaten.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ah,&quot; said he, as he came to his house; &quot;Little 
                Claus shall pay me<br>
                for this; I will beat him to death.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Meanwhile the old grandmother of Little Claus died. She had been<br>
                cross, unkind, and really spiteful to him; but he was very sorry,<br>
                and took the dead woman and laid her in his warm bed to see if 
                he<br>
                could bring her to life again. There he determined that she should 
                lie<br>
                the whole night, while he seated himself in a chair in a corner 
                of the<br>
                room as he had often done before. During the night, as he sat 
                there,<br>
                the door opened, and in came Great Claus with a hatchet. He knew<br>
                well where Little Claus's bed stood; so he went right up to it, 
                and<br>
                struck the old grandmother on the head. thinking it must be Little<br>
                Claus.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There,&quot; cried he, &quot;now you cannot make a fool 
                of me again;&quot; and<br>
                then he went home.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That is a very wicked man,&quot; thought Little Claus; 
                &quot;he meant to<br>
                kill me. It is a good thing for my old grandmother that she was<br>
                already dead, or he would have taken her life.&quot; Then he dressed 
                his<br>
                old grandmother in her best clothes, borrowed a horse of his neighbor,and 
                harnessed it to a cart. Then he placed the old woman on the back 
                seat, so that she might not fall out as he drove, and rode away 
                through the wood. By sunrise they reached a large inn, where Little 
                Claus stopped and went to get something to eat. The landlord was 
                a rich man, and a good man too; but as passionate as if he had 
                been made of pepper and snuff.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Good morning,&quot; said he to Little Claus; &quot;you 
                are come betimes<br>
                to-day.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Little Claus; &quot;I am going to the town 
                with my old<br>
                grandmother; she is sitting at the back of the wagon, but I cannot<br>
                bring her into the room. Will you take her a glass of mead? but 
                you<br>
                must speak very loud, for she cannot hear well.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, certainly I will,&quot; replied the landlord; and, 
                pouring out<br>
                a glass of mead, he carried it out to the dead grandmother, who 
                sat<br>
                upright in the cart. &quot;Here is a glass of mead from your grandson,&quot;<br>
                said the landlord. The dead woman did not answer a word, but sat 
                quite still. &quot;Do you not hear?&quot; cried the landlord as 
                loud as he could;<br>
                &quot;here is a glass of mead from your grandson.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Again and again he bawled it out, but as she did not stir he<br>
                flew into a passion, and threw the glass of mead in her face; 
                it<br>
                struck her on the nose, and she fell backwards out of the cart, 
                for<br>
                she was only seated there, not tied in.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Hallo!&quot; cried Little Claus, rushing out of the door, and 
                seizing<br>
                hold of the landlord by the throat; &quot;you have killed my grandmother;<br>
                see, here is a great hole in her forehead.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, how unfortunate,&quot; said the landlord, wringing 
                his hands.<br>
                &quot;This all comes of my fiery temper. Dear Little Claus, I 
                will give you<br>
                a bushel of money; I will bury your grandmother as if she were 
                my own; only keep silent, or else they will cut off my head, and 
                that would be disagreeable.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>So it happened that Little Claus received another bushel of money,<br>
                and the landlord buried his old grandmother as if she had been 
                his<br>
                own. When Little Claus reached home again, he immediately sent 
                a boy to Great Claus, requesting him to lend him a bushel measure. 
                &quot;How is this?&quot; thought Great Claus; &quot;did I not 
                kill him? I must go and see for myself.&quot; So he went to Little 
                Claus, and took the bushel measure with him. &quot;How did you 
                get all this money?&quot; asked Great Claus, staring with wide 
                open eyes at his neighbor's treasures.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You killed my grandmother instead of me,&quot; said Little 
                Claus;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;so I have sold her for a bushel of money.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That is a good price at all events,&quot; said Great Claus. 
                So he went<br>
                home, took a hatchet, and killed his old grandmother with one 
                blow.<br>
                Then he placed her on a cart, and drove into the town to the<br>
                apothecary, and asked him if he would buy a dead body.<br>
                &quot;Whose is it, and where did you get it?&quot; asked the apothecary.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is my grandmother,&quot; he replied; &quot;I killed 
                her with a blow,<br>
                that I might get a bushel of money for her.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Heaven preserve us!&quot; cried the apothecary, &quot;you 
                are out of your<br>
                mind. Don't say such things, or you will lose your head.&quot; 
                And then<br>
                he talked to him seriously about the wicked deed he had done, 
                and told him that such a wicked man would surely be punished. 
                Great Claus got so frightened that he rushed out of the surgery, 
                jumped into the cart, whipped up his horses, and drove home quickly. 
                The apothecary and all the people thought him mad, and let him 
                drive where he liked.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You shall pay for this,&quot; said Great Claus, as soon 
                as he got into<br>
                the highroad, &quot;that you shall, Little Claus.&quot; So as 
                soon as he reached<br>
                home he took the largest sack he could find and went over to Little<br>
                Claus. &quot;You have played me another trick,&quot; said he. 
                &quot;First, I killed<br>
                all my horses, and then my old grandmother, and it is all your<br>
                fault; but you shall not make a fool of me any more.&quot; So 
                he laid<br>
                hold of Little Claus round the body, and pushed him into the sack,<br>
                which he took on his shoulders, saying, &quot;Now I'm going to 
                drown you in the river.<br>
              </p>
              <p>He had a long way to go before he reached the river, and Little<br>
                Claus was not a very light weight to carry. The road led by the<br>
                church, and as they passed he could hear the organ playing and 
                the<br>
                people singing beautifully. Great Claus put down the sack close 
                to the<br>
                church-door, and thought he might as well go in and hear a psalm<br>
                before he went any farther. Little Claus could not possibly get 
                out of<br>
                the sack, and all the people were in church; so in he went.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh dear, oh dear,&quot; sighed Little Claus in the sack, 
                as he turned and twisted about; but he found he could not loosen 
                the string with which it was tied. Presently an old cattle driver, 
                with snowy hair, passed by, carrying a large staff in his hand, 
                with which he drove a large herd of cows and oxen before him. 
                They stumbled against the sack in which lay Little Claus, and 
                turned it over. &quot;Oh dear,&quot; sighed Little Claus, &quot;I 
                am very young, yet I am soon going to heaven.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And I, poor fellow,&quot; said the drover, &quot;I who 
                am so old already,<br>
                cannot get there.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Open the sack,&quot; cried Little Claus; &quot;creep into 
                it instead of me,<br>
                and you will soon be there.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;With all my heart,&quot; replied the drover, opening the 
                sack, from<br>
                which sprung Little Claus as quickly as possible. &quot;Will you 
                take<br>
                care of my cattle?&quot; said the old man, as he crept into the 
                bag.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Little Claus, and he tied up the sack, 
                and then walked<br>
                off with all the cows and oxen.<br>
              </p>
              <p>When Great Claus came out of church, he took up the sack, and<br>
                placed it on his shoulders. It appeared to have become lighter, 
                for<br>
                the old drover was not half so heavy as Little Claus.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;How light he seems now,&quot; said he. &quot;Ah, it is 
                because I have<br>
                been to a church.&quot; So he walked on to the river, which was 
                deep and<br>
                broad, and threw the sack containing the old drover into the water,<br>
                believing it to be Little Claus. &quot;There you may lie!&quot; 
                he exclaimed;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;you will play me no more tricks now.&quot; Then he turned 
                to go home,<br>
                but when he came to a place where two roads crossed, there was<br>
                Little Claus driving the cattle. &quot;How is this?&quot; said 
                Great Claus. &quot;Did<br>
                I not drown you just now?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Little Claus; &quot;you threw me into the 
                river about<br>
                half an hour ago.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But wherever did you get all these fine beasts?&quot; asked 
                Great<br>
                Claus.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;These beasts are sea-cattle,&quot; replied Little Claus. 
                &quot;I'll tell<br>
                you the whole story, and thank you for drowning me; I am above 
                you<br>
                now, I am really very rich. I was frightened, to be sure, while 
                I<br>
                lay tied up in the sack, and the wind whistled in my ears when 
                you<br>
                threw me into the river from the bridge, and I sank to the bottom<br>
                immediately; but I did not hurt myself, for I fell upon beautifully<br>
                soft grass which grows down there; and in a moment, the sack opened, 
                and the sweetest little maiden came towards me. She had snow-white 
                robes, and a wreath of green leaves on her wet hair. She took 
                me by the hand, and said, 'So you are come, Little Claus, and 
                here are some cattle for you to begin with. About a mile farther 
                on the road, there is another herd for you.' Then I saw that the 
                river formed a great highway for the people who live in the sea. 
                They were walking<br>
                and driving here and there from the sea to the land at the, spot 
                where<br>
                the river terminates. The bed of the river was covered with the<br>
                loveliest flowers and sweet fresh grass. The fish swam past me 
                as<br>
                rapidly as the birds do here in the air. How handsome all the 
                people<br>
                were, and what fine cattle were grazing on the hills and in the<br>
                valleys!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But why did you come up again,&quot; said Great Claus, 
                &quot;if it was<br>
                all so beautiful down there? I should not have done so?&quot;<br>
                &quot;Well,&quot; said Little Claus, &quot;it was good policy 
                on my part; you<br>
                heard me say just now that I was told by the sea-maiden to go 
                a mile<br>
                farther on the road, and I should find a whole herd of cattle. 
                By<br>
                the road she meant the river, for she could not travel any other<br>
                way; but I knew the winding of the river, and how it bends,<br>
                sometimes to the right and sometimes to the left, and it seemed 
                a long<br>
                way, so I chose a shorter one; and, by coming up to the land, 
                and then driving across the fields back again to the river, I 
                shall save half a<br>
                mile, and get all my cattle more quickly.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What a lucky fellow you are!&quot; exclaimed Great Claus. 
                &quot;Do you<br>
                think I should get any sea-cattle if I went down to the bottom 
                of<br>
                the river?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, I think so,&quot; said Little Claus; &quot;but I cannot 
                carry you<br>
                there in a sack, you are too heavy. However if you will go there<br>
                first, and then creep into a sack, I will throw you in with the<br>
                greatest pleasure.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Great Claus; &quot;but remember, 
                if I do not get<br>
                any sea-cattle down there I shall come up again and give you a 
                good<br>
                thrashing.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No, now, don't be too fierce about it!&quot; said Little 
                Claus, as<br>
                they walked on towards the river. When they approached it, the 
                cattle,<br>
                who were very thirsty, saw the stream, and ran down to drink.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;See what a hurry they are in,&quot; said Little Claus, 
                &quot;they are<br>
                longing to get down again,&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Come, help me, make haste,&quot; said Great Claus; &quot;or 
                you'll get<br>
                beaten.&quot; So he crept into a large sack, which had been lying 
                across<br>
                the back of one of the oxen.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Put in a stone,&quot; said Great Claus, &quot;or I may 
                not sink.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, there's not much fear of that,&quot; he replied; still 
                he put a<br>
                large stone into the bag, and then tied it tightly, and gave it 
                a<br>
                push.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Plump!&quot; In went Great Claus, and immediately sank 
                to the bottom<br>
                of the river.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I'm afraid he will not find any cattle,&quot; said Little 
                Claus, and<br>
                then he drove his own beasts homewards.</p>

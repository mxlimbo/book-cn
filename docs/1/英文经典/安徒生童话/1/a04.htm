              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> &quot;NEAR the shores of the great Belt, which is one of the 
                straits<br>
                that connect the Cattegat with the Baltic, stands an old mansion<br>
                with thick red walls. I know every stone of it,&quot; says the 
                Wind. &quot;I saw<br>
                it when it was part of the castle of Marck Stig on the promontory. 
                But<br>
                the castle was obliged to be pulled down, and the stone was used 
                again for the walls of a new mansion on another spot- the baronial 
                residence of Borreby, which still stands near the coast. I knew 
                them well, those noble lords and ladies, the successive generations 
                that dwelt there; and now I'm going to tell you of Waldemar Daa 
                and his daughters. How proud was his bearing, for he was of royal 
                blood, and could boast of more noble deeds than merely hunting 
                the stag and emptying the wine-cup. His rule was despotic: 'It 
                shall be,' he was accustomed to say. His wife, in garments embroidered 
                with gold, stepped proudly over the polished marble floors. The 
                tapestries were gorgeous, and the furniture of costly and artistic 
                taste. She had brought gold and plate with her into the house. 
                The cellars were full of wine. Black, fiery horses, neighed in 
                the stables. There was a look of wealth about the house of Borreby 
                at that time. They had three children, daughters, fair and delicate 
                maidens- Ida, Joanna, and Anna Dorothea; I have never forgotten 
                their names. They were a rich, noble family, born in affluence 
                and nurtured in luxury.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Whir-r-r, whir-r-r!&quot; roared the Wind, and went on, 
                &quot;I did not see<br>
                in this house, as in other great houses, the high-born lady sitting<br>
                among her women, turning the spinning-wheel. She could sweep the<br>
                sounding chords of the guitar, and sing to the music, not always<br>
                Danish melodies, but the songs of a strange land. It was 'Live 
                and let<br>
                live,' here. Stranger guests came from far and near, music sounded,<br>
                goblets clashed, and I,&quot; said the Wind, &quot;was not able 
                to drown the<br>
                noise. Ostentation, pride, splendor, and display ruled, but not 
                the<br>
                fear of the Lord.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It was on the evening of the first day of May,&quot; the 
                Wind<br>
                continued, &quot;I came from the west, and had seen the ships 
                overpowered with the waves, when all on board persisted or were 
                cast shipwrecked on the coast of Jutland. I had hurried across 
                the heath and over Jutland's wood-girt eastern coast, and over 
                the island of Funen, and then I drove across the great belt, sighing 
                and moaning. </p>
              <p>At length I lay down to rest on the shores of Zeeland, near to 
                the great house of Borreby, where the splendid forest of oaks 
                still flourished. The young men of the neighborhood were collecting 
                branches and brushwood under the oak-trees. The largest and dryest 
                they could find they carried into the village, and piled them 
                up in a heap and set them on fire. Then the men and maidens danced, 
                and sung in a circle round the blazing pile. I lay quite quiet,&quot; 
                said the Wind, &quot;but I silently touched a branch which had 
                been brought by one of the handsomest of the young men, and the 
                wood blazed up brightly, blazed brighter than all the rest. Then 
                he was chosen as the chief, and received the name of the Shepherd; 
                and might choose his lamb from among the maidens.<br>
              </p>
              <p>There was greater mirth and rejoicing than I had ever heard in 
                the<br>
                halls of the rich baronial house. Then the noble lady drove by 
                towards the baron's mansion with her three daughters, in a gilded 
                carriage drawn by six horses. The daughters were young and beautiful- 
                three charming blossoms- a rose, a lily, and a white hyacinth. 
                The mother was a proud tulip, and never acknowledged the salutations 
                of any of the men or maidens who paused in their sport to do her 
                honor. The gracious lady seemed like a flower that was rather 
                stiff in the stalk.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Rose, lily, and hyacinth- yes, I saw them all three. Whose little<br>
                lambs will they one day become? thought I; their shepherd will 
                be a<br>
                gallant knight, perhaps a prince. The carriage rolled on, and 
                the<br>
                peasants resumed their dancing. They drove about the summer through 
                all the villages near. But one night, when I rose again, the high-born 
                lady lay down to rise again no more; that thing came to her which 
                comes to us all, in which there is nothing new. Waldemar Daa<br>
                remained for a time silent and thoughtful. 'The loftiest tree 
                may be<br>
                bowed without being broken,' said a voice within him. His daughters<br>
                wept; all the people in the mansion wiped their eyes, but Lady 
                Daa had driven away, and I drove away too,&quot; said the Wind. 
                &quot;Whir-r-r,<br>
                whir-r-r-!<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I returned again; I often returned and passed over the 
                island<br>
                of Funen and the shores of the Belt. Then I rested by Borreby, 
                near<br>
                the glorious wood, where the heron made his nest, the haunt of 
                the<br>
                wood-pigeons, the blue-birds, and the black stork. It was yet<br>
                spring, some were sitting on their eggs, others had already hatched<br>
                their young broods; but how they fluttered about and cried out 
                when<br>
                the axe sounded through the forest, blow upon blow! The trees 
                of the<br>
                forest were doomed. Waldemar Daa wanted to build a noble ship, 
                a<br>
                man-of-war, a three-decker, which the king would be sure to buy; 
                and<br>
                these, the trees of the wood, the landmark of the seamen, the 
                refuge<br>
                of the birds, must be felled. The hawk started up and flew away, 
                for<br>
                its nest was destroyed; the heron and all the birds of the forest<br>
                became homeless, and flew about in fear and anger. I could well<br>
                understand how they felt. Crows and ravens croaked, as if in scorn,<br>
                while the trees were cracking and falling around them. Far in 
                the<br>
                interior of the wood, where a noisy swarm of laborers were working,<br>
                stood Waldemar Daa and his three daughters, and all were laughing 
                at<br>
                the wild cries of the birds, excepting one, the youngest, Anna<br>
                Dorothea, who felt grieved to the heart; and when they made<br>
                preparations to fell a tree that was almost dead, and on whose 
                naked<br>
                branches the black stork had built her nest, she saw the poor 
                little<br>
                things stretching out their necks, and she begged for mercy for<br>
                them, with the tears in her eyes. So the tree with the black stork's<br>
                nest was left standing; the tree itself, however, was not worth 
                much<br>
                to speak of. Then there was a great deal of hewing and sawing, 
                and<br>
                at last the three-decker was built. The builder was a man of low<br>
                origin, but possessing great pride; his eyes and forehead spoke 
                of<br>
                large intellect, and Waldemar Daa was fond of listening to him, 
                and so<br>
                was Waldemar's daughter Ida, the eldest, now about fifteen years<br>
                old; and while he was building the ship for the father, he was<br>
                building for himself a castle in the air, in which he and Ida 
                were<br>
                to live when they were married. This might have happened, indeed, 
                if<br>
                there had been a real castle, with stone walls, ramparts, and 
                a<br>
                moat. But in spite of his clever head, the builder was still but 
                a<br>
                poor, inferior bird; and how can a sparrow expect to be admitted<br>
                into the society of peacocks?<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I passed on in my course,&quot; said the Wind, &quot;and 
                he passed away<br>
                also. He was not allowed to remain, and little Ida got over it,<br>
                because she was obliged to do so. Proud, black horses, worth looking 
                at, were neighing in the stable. And they were locked up; for 
                the admiral, who had been sent by the king to inspect the new 
                ship, and make arrangements for its purchase, was loud in admiration 
                of these beautiful horses. I heard it all,&quot; said the Wind, 
                &quot;for I accompanied the gentlemen through the open door of 
                the stable, and strewed stalks of straw, like bars of gold, at 
                their feet. Waldemar Daa wanted gold, and the admiral wished for 
                the proud black horses; therefore he praised them so much. But 
                the hint was not taken, and<br>
                consequently the ship was not bought. It remained on the shore 
                covered with boards,- a Noah's ark that never got to the water- 
                Whir-r-r-r- and that was a pity.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;In the winter, when the fields were covered with snow, 
                and the<br>
                water filled with large blocks of ice which I had blown up to 
                the<br>
                coast,&quot; continued the Wind, &quot;great flocks of crows and 
                ravens, dark<br>
                and black as they usually are, came and alighted on the lonely,<br>
                deserted ship. Then they croaked in harsh accents of the forest 
                that<br>
                now existed no more, of the many pretty birds' nests destroyed 
                and the little ones left without a home; and all for the sake 
                of that great<br>
                bit of lumber, that proud ship, that never sailed forth. I made 
                the<br>
                snowflakes whirl till the snow lay like a great lake round the 
                ship,<br>
                and drifted over it. I let it hear my voice, that it might know 
                what<br>
                the storm has to say. Certainly I did my part towards teaching 
                it<br>
                seamanship.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That winter passed away, and another winter and summer 
                both<br>
                passed, as they are still passing away, even as I pass away. The<br>
                snow drifts onwards, the apple-blossoms are scattered, the leaves<br>
                fall,- everything passes away, and men are passing away too. But 
                the<br>
                great man's daughters are still young, and little Ida is a rose 
                as<br>
                fair to look upon as on the day when the shipbuilder first saw 
                her.<br>
                I often tumbled her long, brown hair, while she stood in the garden 
                by<br>
                the apple-tree, musing, and not heeding how I strewed the blossoms<br>
                on her hair, and dishevelled it; or sometimes, while she stood<br>
                gazing at the red sun and the golden sky through the opening<br>
                branches of the dark, thick foliage of the garden trees. Her sister<br>
                Joanna was bright and slender as a lily; she had a tall and lofty<br>
                carriage and figure, though, like her mother, rather stiff in 
                back.<br>
                She was very fond of walking through the great hall, where hung 
                the<br>
                portraits of her ancestors. The women were represented in dresses 
                of<br>
                velvet and silk, with tiny little hats, embroidered with pearls, 
                on<br>
                their braided hair. They were all handsome women. The gentlemen<br>
                appeared clad in steel, or in rich cloaks lined with squirrel's 
                fur;<br>
                they wore little ruffs, and swords at their sides. Where would<br>
                Joanna's place be on that wall some day? and how would he look,- 
                her noble lord and husband? This is what she thought of, and often 
                spoke of in a low voice to herself. I heard it as I swept into 
                the long<br>
                hall, and turned round to come out again. Anna Dorothea, the pale<br>
                hyacinth, a child of fourteen, was quiet and thoughtful; her large,<br>
                deep, blue eyes had a dreamy look, but a childlike smile still<br>
                played round her mouth. I was not able to blow it away, neither 
                did<br>
                I wish to do so. We have met in the garden, in the hollow lane, 
                in the<br>
                field and meadow, where she gathered herbs and flowers which she<br>
                knew would be useful to her father in preparing the drugs and 
                mixtures he was always concocting. Waldemar Daa was arrogant and 
                proud, but he was also a learned man, and knew a great deal. It 
                was no secret, and many opinions were expressed on what he did. 
                In his fireplace there was a fire, even in summer time. He would 
                lock himself in his room, and for days the fire would be kept 
                burning; but he did not talk much of what he was doing. The secret 
                powers of nature are generally discovered in solitude, and did 
                he not soon expect to find out the art of making the greatest 
                of all good things- the art of making gold?<br>
              </p>
              <p>So he fondly hoped; therefore the chimney smoked and the fire 
                crackled so constantly. Yes, I was there too,&quot; said the Wind. 
                &quot;'Leave it alone,' I sang down the chimney; 'leave it alone, 
                it will all end in<br>
                smoke, air, coals, and ashes, and you will burn your fingers.' 
                But<br>
                Waldemar Daa did not leave it alone, and all he possessed vanished<br>
                like smoke blown by me. The splendid black horses, where are they?<br>
                What became of the cows in the field, the old gold and silver<br>
                vessels in cupboards and chests, and even the house and home itself?<br>
                It was easy to melt all these away in the gold-making crucible, 
                and<br>
                yet obtain no gold. And so it was. Empty are the barns and<br>
                store-rooms, the cellars and cupboards; the servants decreased 
                in<br>
                number, and the mice multiplied. First one window became broken, 
                and then another, so that I could get in at other places besides 
                the door.<br>
              </p>
              <p>'Where the chimney smokes, the meal is being cooked,' says the<br>
                proverb; but here a chimney smoked that devoured all the meals 
                for the sake of gold. I blew round the courtyard,&quot; said the 
                Wind, &quot;like a<br>
                watchman blowing his home, but no watchman was there. I twirled 
                the weather-cock round on the summit of the tower, and it creaked 
                like the snoring of a warder, but no warder was there; nothing 
                but mice and rats. Poverty laid the table-cloth; poverty sat in 
                the wardrobe and in the larder. The door fell off its hinges, 
                cracks and fissures made their appearance everywhere; so that 
                I could go in and out at pleasure, and that is how I know all 
                about it. Amid smoke and ashes, sorrow, and sleepless nights, 
                the hair and beard of the master of the house turned gray, and 
                deep furrows showed themselves around his temples; his skin turned 
                pale and yellow, while his eyes still<br>
                looked eagerly for gold, the longed-for gold, and the result of 
                his<br>
                labor was debt instead of gain. I blew the smoke and ashes into 
                his<br>
                face and beard; I moaned through the broken window-panes, and 
                the<br>
                yawning clefts in the walls; I blew into the chests and drawers<br>
                belonging to his daughters, wherein lay the clothes that had become<br>
                faded and threadbare, from being worn over and over again. Such 
                a song had not been sung, at the children's cradle as I sung now. 
                The<br>
                lordly life had changed to a life of penury. I was the only one 
                who<br>
                rejoiced aloud in that castle,&quot; said the Wind. &quot;At last 
                I snowed<br>
                them up, and they say snow keeps people warm. It was good for 
                them, for they had no wood, and the forest, from which they might 
                have obtained it, had been cut down. The frost was very bitter, 
                and I<br>
                rushed through loop-holes and passages, over gables and roofs 
                with<br>
                keen and cutting swiftness. The three high-born daughters were 
                lying<br>
                in bed because of the cold, and their father crouching beneath 
                his<br>
                leather coverlet. Nothing to eat, nothing to burn, no fire on 
                the<br>
                hearth! Here was a life for high-born people! 'Give it up, give 
                it<br>
                up!' But my Lord Daa would not do that. 'After winter, spring 
                will<br>
                come,' he said, 'after want, good times. We must not lose patience, 
                we must learn to wait. Now my horses and lands are all mortgaged, 
                it is indeed high time; but gold will come at last- at Easter.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I heard him as he thus spoke; he was looking at a spider's 
                web,<br>
                and he continued, 'Thou cunning little weaver, thou dost teach 
                me<br>
                perseverance. Let any one tear thy web, and thou wilt begin again<br>
                and repair it. Let it be entirely destroyed, thou wilt resolutely<br>
                begin to make another till it is completed. So ought we to do, 
                if we<br>
                wish to succeed at last.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It was the morning of Easter-day. The bells sounded from 
                the<br>
                neighboring church, and the sun seemed to rejoice in the sky. 
                The<br>
                master of the castle had watched through the night, in feverish<br>
                excitement, and had been melting and cooling, distilling and mixing. 
                I<br>
                heard him sighing like a soul in despair; I heard him praying, 
                and I<br>
                noticed how he held his breath. The lamp burnt out, but he did 
                not<br>
                observe it. I blew up the fire in the coals on the hearth, and 
                it<br>
                threw a red glow on his ghastly white face, lighting it up with 
                a<br>
                glare, while his sunken eyes looked out wildly from their cavernous<br>
                depths, and appeared to grow larger and more prominent, as if 
                they<br>
                would burst from their sockets. 'Look at the alchymic glass,' 
                he<br>
                cried; 'something glows in the crucible, pure and heavy.' He lifted 
                it<br>
                with a trembling hand, and exclaimed in a voice of agitation, 
                'Gold!<br>
                gold!' He was quite giddy, I could have blown him down,&quot; 
                said the<br>
                Wind; &quot;but I only fanned the glowing coals, and accompanied 
                him<br>
                through the door to the room where his daughter sat shivering. 
                His<br>
                coat was powdered with ashes, and there were ashes in his beard 
                and in his tangled hair. He stood erect, and held high in the 
                air the brittle<br>
                glass that contained his costly treasure. 'Found! found! Gold!<br>
                gold!' he shouted, again holding the glass aloft, that it might<br>
                flash in the sunshine; but his hand trembled, and the alchymic 
                glass<br>
                fell from it, clattering to the ground, and brake in a thousand<br>
                pieces. The last bubble of his happiness had burst, with a whiz 
                and<br>
                a whir, and I rushed away from the gold-maker's house.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Late in the autumn, when the days were short, and the mist<br>
                sprinkled cold drops on the berries and the leafless branches, 
                I<br>
                came back in fresh spirits, rushed through the air, swept the 
                sky<br>
                clear, and snapped off the dry twigs, which is certainly no great<br>
                labor to do, yet it must be done. There was another kind of sweeping<br>
                taking place at Waldemar Daa's, in the castle of Borreby. His 
                enemy,<br>
                Owe Ramel, of Basnas, was there, with the mortgage of the house 
                and everything it contained, in his pocket. I rattled the broken<br>
                windows, beat against the old rotten doors, and whistled through<br>
                cracks and crevices, so that Mr. Owe Ramel did not much like to 
                remain there. Ida and Anna Dorothea wept bitterly, Joanna stood, 
                pale and proud, biting her lips till the blood came; but what 
                could that avail? Owe Ramel offered Waldemar Daa permission to 
                remain in the house till the end of his life. No one thanked him 
                for the offer, and I<br>
                saw the ruined old gentleman lift his head, and throw it back 
                more<br>
                proudly than ever. Then I rushed against the house and the old<br>
                lime-trees with such force, that one of the thickest branches, 
                a<br>
                decayed one, was broken off, and the branch fell at the entrance,<br>
                and remained there. It might have been used as a broom, if any 
                one had wanted to sweep the place out, and a grand sweeping-out 
                there really was; I thought it would be so. It was hard for any 
                one to preserve composure on such a day; but these people had 
                strong wills, as unbending as their hard fortune. There was nothing 
                they could call<br>
                their own, excepting the clothes they wore. Yes, there was one 
                thing<br>
                more, an alchymist's glass, a new one, which had been lately bought,<br>
                and filled with what could be gathered from the ground of the 
                treasure<br>
                which had promised so much but failed in keeping its promise. 
              </p>
              <p>Waldemar Daa hid the glass in his bosom, and, taking his stick 
                in his hand, the once rich gentleman passed with his daughters 
                out of the house of Borreby. I blew coldly upon his flustered 
                cheeks, I stroked his gray beard and his long white hair, and 
                I sang as well as I was able, 'Whir-r-r, whir-r-r. Gone away! 
                Gone away!' Ida walked on one side of the old man, and Anna Dorothea 
                on the other; Joanna turned round, as they left the entrance. 
                Why? Fortune would not turn because she turned. She looked at 
                the stone in the walls which had once formed part of the castle 
                of Marck Stig, and perhaps she thought of his daughters and of 
                the old song,-</p>
              <p> &quot;The eldest and youngest, hand-in-hand,<br>
                Went forth alone to a distant land.&quot;</p>
              <p>These were only two; here there were three, and their father 
                with them<br>
                also. They walked along the high-road, where once they had driven 
                in<br>
                their splendid carriage; they went forth with their father as 
                beggars.<br>
                They wandered across an open field to a mud hut, which they rented 
                for a dollar and a half a year, a new home, with bare walls and 
                empty<br>
                cupboards. Crows and magpies fluttered about them, and cried, 
                as if in contempt, 'Caw, caw, turned out of our nest- caw, caw,' 
                as they had done in the wood at Borreby, when the trees were felled. 
                Daa and his daughters could not help hearing it, so I blew about 
                their ears to<br>
                drown the noise; what use was it that they should listen? So they 
                went<br>
                to live in the mud hut in the open field, and I wandered away, 
                over<br>
                moor and meadow, through bare bushes and leafless forests, to 
                the open sea, to the broad shores in other lands, 'Whir-r-r, whir-r-r! 
                Away, away!' year after year.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And what became of Waldemar Daa and his daughters? Listen; the<br>
                Wind will tell us:<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The last I saw of them was the pale hyacinth, Anna Dorothea. 
                She<br>
                was old and bent then; for fifty years had passed and she had 
                outlived them all. She could relate the history. Yonder, on the 
                heath, near the town of Wiborg, in Jutland, stood the fine new 
                house of the canon. It was built of red brick, with projecting 
                gables. It was inhabited, for the smoke curled up thickly from 
                the chimneys. The canon's gentle lady and her beautiful daughters 
                sat in the bay-window, and looked over the hawthorn hedge of the 
                garden towards the brown heath. What were they looking at? Their 
                glances fell upon a stork's nest, which was built upon an old 
                tumbledown hut. The roof, as far as one existed at all, was covered 
                with moss and lichen. The stork's nest covered the greater part 
                of it, and that alone was in a good condition; for it was kept 
                in order by the stork himself. That is a house to be looked at, 
                and not to be touched,&quot; said the Wind. &quot;For the sake 
                of the stork's nest it had been allowed to remain, although it 
                is a blot on the landscape.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They did not like to drive the stork away; therefore the old 
                shed was<br>
                left standing, and the poor woman who dwelt in it allowed to stay. 
              </p>
              <p>She had the Egyptian bird to thank for that; or was it perchance 
                her<br>
                reward for having once interceded for the preservation of the 
                nest of<br>
                its black brother in the forest of Borreby? At that time she, 
                the<br>
                poor woman, was a young child, a white hyacinth in a rich garden. 
              </p>
              <p>She remembered that time well; for it was Anna Dorothea.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'O-h, o-h,' she sighed; for people can sigh like the moaning 
                of<br>
                the wind among the reeds and rushes. 'O-h, o-h,' she would say, 
                'no<br>
                bell sounded at thy burial, Waldemar Daa. The poor school-boys 
                did not even sing a psalm when the former lord of Borreby was 
                laid in the<br>
                earth to rest. O-h, everything has an end, even misery. Sister 
                Ida<br>
                became the wife of a peasant; that was the hardest trial which<br>
                befell our father, that the husband of his own daughter should 
                be a<br>
                miserable serf, whom his owner could place for punishment on the<br>
                wooden horse. I suppose he is under the ground now; and Ida- alas!<br>
                alas! it is not ended yet; miserable that I am! Kind Heaven, grant<br>
                me that I may die.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That was Anna Dorothea's prayer in the wretched hut that 
                was left<br>
                standing for the sake of the stork. I took pity on the proudest 
                of the<br>
                sisters,&quot; said the Wind. &quot;Her courage was like that 
                of a man; and in<br>
                man's clothes she served as a sailor on board ship. She was of 
                few<br>
                words, and of a dark countenance; but she did not know how to 
                climb, so I blew her overboard before any one found out that she 
                was a woman; and, in my opinion, that was well done,&quot; said 
                the Wind.<br>
              </p>
              <p>On such another Easter morning as that on which Waldemar Daa<br>
                imagined he had discovered the art of making gold, I heard the 
                tones<br>
                of a psalm under the stork's nest, and within the crumbling walls.<br>
                It was Anna Dorothea's last song. There was no window in the hut, 
                only a hole in the wall; and the sun rose like a globe of burnished 
                gold<br>
                and looked through. With what splendor he filled that dismal dwelling!<br>
              </p>
              <p>Her eyes were glazing, and her heart breaking; but so it would 
                have<br>
                been, even had the sun not shone that morning on Anna Dorothea. 
              </p>
              <p>The stork's nest had secured her a home till her death. I sung 
                over her<br>
                grave; I sung at her father's grave. I know where it lies, and 
                where<br>
                her grave is too, but nobody else knows it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;New times now; all is changed. The old high-road is lost 
                amid<br>
                cultivated fields; the new one now winds along over covered graves;<br>
                and soon the railway will come, with its train of carriages, and<br>
                rush over graves where lie those whose very names are forgoten. 
                All<br>
                passed away, passed away!<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;This is the story of Waldemar Daa and his daughters. Tell 
                it<br>
                better, any of you, if you know how,&quot; said the Wind; and 
                he rushed<br>
                away, and was gone.<br>

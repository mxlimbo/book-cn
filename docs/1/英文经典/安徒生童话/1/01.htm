              <p class="h" align="center">A CHEERFUL TEMPER</p>
              <p align="center"> by<i><b> Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> FROM my father I received the best inheritance, namely a &quot;good 
                temper.&quot; &quot;And who was my father?&quot; That has nothing 
                to do with the good temper; but I will say he was lively, good-looking 
                round, and fat; he was both in appearance and character a complete 
                contradiction to his profession. &quot;And pray what was his profession 
                and his standing in respectable society?&quot; Well, perhaps, 
                if in the beginning of a book these were written and printed, 
                many, when they read it, would lay the book down and say, &quot;It 
                seems to me a very miserable title, I don't like things of this 
                sort.&quot; And yet my father was not a skin-dresser nor an executioner; 
                on the contrary, his employment placed him at the head of the 
                grandest people of the town, and it was his place by right. He 
                had to precede the bishop, and even the princes of the blood; 
                he always went first,- he was a hearse driver!</p>
              <p>There, now, the truth is out. And I will own, that when people 
                saw my father perched up in front of the omnibus of death, dressed 
                in his long, wide, black cloak, and his black-edged, three-cornered 
                hat on his head, and then glanced at his round, jocund face, round 
                as the sun, they could not think much of sorrow or the grave. 
                That face said, &quot;It is nothing, it will all end better than 
                people think.&quot; So I have inherited from him, not only my 
                good temper, but a habit of going often to the churchyard, which 
                is good, when done in a proper humor; and then also I take in 
                the Intelligencer, just as he used to do.</p>
              <p> I am not very young, I have neither wife nor children, nor a 
                library, but, as I said, I read the Intelligencer, which is enough 
                for me; it is to me a delightful paper, and so it was to my father. 
                It is of great use, for it contains all that a man requires to 
                know; the names of the preachers at the church, and the new books 
                which are published; where houses, servants, clothes, and provisions 
                may be obtained. And then what a number of subscriptions to charities, 
                and what innocent verses! Persons seeking interviews and engagements, 
                all so plainly and naturally stated. Certainly, a man who takes 
                in the Intelligencer may live merrily and be buried contentedly, 
                and by the end of his life will have such a capital stock of paper 
                that he can lie on a soft bed of it, unless he prefers wood shavings 
                for his resting-place. The newspaper and the churchyard were always 
                exciting objects to me. My walks to the latter were like bathing-places 
                to my good humor. Every one can read the newspaper for himself, 
                but come with me to the churchyard while the sun shines and the 
                trees are green, and let us wander among the graves. Each of them 
                is like a closed book, with the back uppermost, on which we can 
                read the title of what the book contains, but nothing more. I 
                had a great deal of information from my father, and I have noticed 
                a great deal myself. I keep it in my diary, in which I write for 
                my own use and pleasure a history of all who lie here, and a few 
                more beside.<br>
                <br>
                Now we are in the churchyard. Here, behind the white iron railings, 
                once a rose-tree grew; it is gone now, but a little bit of evergreen, 
                from a neighboring grave, stretches out its green tendrils,and 
                makes some appearance; there rests a very unhappy man, and yet 
                while he lived he might be said to occupy a very good position. 
                He had enough to live upon, and something to spare; but owing 
                to his refined tastes the least thing in the world annoyed him. 
                If he went to a theatre of an evening, instead of enjoying himself 
                he would be quite annoyed if the machinist had put too strong 
                a light into one side of the moon, or if the representations of 
                the sky hung over the scenes when they ought to have hung behind 
                them; or if a palm-tree was introduced into a scene representing 
                the Zoological Gardens of Berlin, or a cactus in a view of Tyrol, 
                or a beech-tree in the north of Norway. As if these things were 
                of any consequence! Why did he not leave them alone? Who would 
                trouble themselves about such trifles? especially at a comedy, 
                where every one is expected to be amused. Then sometimes the public 
                applauded too much, or too little, to please him.</p>
              <p>&quot;They are like wet wood,&quot; he would say, looking round 
                to see what sort of people were present, &quot;this evening; nothing 
                fires them.&quot; Then he would vex and fret himself because they 
                did not laugh at the right time, or because they laughed in the 
                wrong places; and so he fretted and worried himself till at last 
                the unhappy man fretted himself into the grave.</p>
              <p> Here rests a happy man, that is to say, a man of high birth 
                and position, which was very lucky for him, otherwise he would 
                have been scarcely worth notice. It is beautiful to observe how 
                wisely nature orders these things. He walked about in a coat embroidered 
                all over,and in the drawing-rooms of society looked just like 
                one of those rich pearl-embroidered bell-pulls, which are only 
                made for show; and behind them always hangs a good thick cord 
                for use. This man also had a stout, useful substitute behind him, 
                who did duty for him, and performed all his dirty work. And there 
                are still, even now, these serviceable cords behind other embroidered 
                bell-ropes. It is all so wisely arranged, that a man may well 
                be in a good humor.</p>
              <p> Here rests,- ah, it makes one feel mournful to think of him!-but 
                here rests a man who, during sixty-seven years, was never remembered 
                to have said a good thing; he lived only in the hope of having 
                a good idea. At last he felt convinced, in his own mind, that 
                he really had one, and was so delighted that he positively died 
                of joy at the thought of having at last caught an idea. Nobody 
                got anything by it; indeed, no one even heard what the good thing 
                was. Now I can imagine that this same idea may prevent him from 
                resting quietly in his grave; for suppose that to produce a good 
                effect, it is necessary to bring out his new idea at breakfast, 
                and that he can only make his appearance on earth at midnight, 
                as ghosts are believed generally to do; why then this good idea 
                would not suit the hour, and the man would have to carry it down 
                again with him into the grave- that must be a troubled grave.</p>
              <p> The woman who lies here was so remarkably stingy, that during 
                her life she would get up in the night and mew, that her neighbors 
                might think she kept a cat. What a miser she was!</p>
              <p> Here rests a young lady, of a good family, who would always 
                make her voice heard in society, and when she sang &quot;Mi manca 
                la voce,&quot;*</p>
              <p>it was the only true thing she ever said in her life.</p>
              <p> * &quot;I want a voice,&quot; or, &quot;I have no voice.&quot;</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> Here lies a maiden of another description. She was engaged to 
                be married,- but, her story is one of every-day life; we will 
                leave her to rest in the grave.</p>
              <p> Here rests a widow, who, with music in her tongue, carried gall 
                in her heart. She used to go round among the families near, and 
                search out their faults, upon which she preyed with all the envy 
                and malice of her nature. This is a family grave. The members 
                of this family held so firmly together in their opinions, that 
                they would believe in no other. If the newspapers, or even the 
                whole world, said of a certain subject, &quot;It is so-and-so;&quot; 
                and a little schoolboy declared he had learned quite differently, 
                they would take his assertion as the only true one, because he 
                belonged to the family. And it is well known that if the yard-cock 
                belonging to this family happened to crow at midnight, they would 
                declare it was morning, although the watchman and all the clocks 
                in the town were proclaiming the hour of twelve at night.</p>
              <p> The great poet Goethe concludes his Faust with the words, &quot;may 
                be continued;&quot; so might our wanderings in the churchyard 
                be continued.</p>
              <p>I come here often, and if any of my friends, or those who are 
                not my friends, are too much for me, I go out and choose a plot 
                of ground in which to bury him or her. Then I bury them, as it 
                were; there they lie, dead and powerless, till they come back 
                new and better characters. Their lives and their deeds, looked 
                at after my own fashion, I write down in my diary, as every one 
                ought to do. Then, if any of our friends act absurdly, no one 
                need to be vexed about it. Let them bury the offenders out of 
                sight, and keep their good temper. They can also read the Intelligencer, 
                which is a paper written by the people, with their hands guided. 
                When the time comes for the history of my life, to be bound by 
                the grave, then they will write upon it as my epitaph- </p>
              <p> &quot;The man with a cheerful temper.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                And this is my story.</p>

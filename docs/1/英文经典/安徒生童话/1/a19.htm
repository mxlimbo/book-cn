              <p class="h" align="center"> THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THAT was a terrible affair!&quot; said a hen, and in a quarter 
                of the<br>
                town, too, where it had not taken place. &quot;That was a terrible 
                affair<br>
                in a hen-roost. I cannot sleep alone to-night. It is a good thing 
                that<br>
                many of us sit on the roost together.&quot; And then she told 
                a story<br>
                that made the feathers on the other hens bristle up, and the cock's<br>
                comb fall. There was no doubt about it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But we will begin at the beginning, and that is to be found in 
                a<br>
                hen-roost in another part of the town. The sun was setting, and 
                the<br>
                fowls were flying on to their roost; one hen, with white feathers<br>
                and short legs, used to lay her eggs according to the regulations, 
                and<br>
                was, as a hen, respectable in every way. As she was flying upon 
                the<br>
                roost, she plucked herself with her beak, and a little feather 
                came<br>
                out.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There it goes,&quot; she said; &quot;the more I pluck, 
                the more beautiful<br>
                do I get.&quot; She said this merrily, for she was the best of 
                the hens,<br>
                and, moreover, as had been said, very respectable. With that she<br>
                went to sleep.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was dark all around, and hen sat close to hen, but the one<br>
                who sat nearest to her merry neighbour did not sleep. She had 
                heard<br>
                and yet not heard, as we are often obliged to do in this world, 
                in<br>
                order to live at peace; but she could not keep it from her neighbour<br>
                on the other side any longer. &quot;Did you hear what was said? 
                I mention<br>
                no names, but there is a hen here who intends to pluck herself 
                in<br>
                order to look well. If I were a cock, I should despise her.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Just over the fowls sat the owl, with father owl and the little<br>
                owls. The family has sharp ears, and they all heard every word 
                that<br>
                their neighbour had said. They rolled their eyes, and mother owl,<br>
                beating her wings, said: &quot;Don't listen to her! But I suppose 
                you heard<br>
                what was said? I heard it with my own ears, and one has to hear 
                a<br>
                great deal before they fall off. There is one among the fowls 
                who<br>
                has so far forgotten what is becoming to a hen that she plucks 
                out all<br>
                her feathers and lets the cock see it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Prenez garde aux enfants!&quot; said father owl; &quot;children 
                should<br>
                not hear such things.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But I must tell our neighbour owl about it; she is such 
                an<br>
                estimable owl to talk to.&quot; And with that she flew away.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Too-whoo! Too-whoo!&quot; they both hooted into the neighbour's<br>
                dove-cot to the doves inside. &quot;Have you heard? Have you heard?<br>
                Too-whoo! There is a hen who has plucked out all her feathers 
                for<br>
                the sake of the cock; she will freeze to death, if she is not 
                frozen<br>
                already. Too-whoo!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Where? where?&quot; cooed the doves.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;In the neighbour's yard. I have as good as seen it myself. 
                It<br>
                is almost unbecoming to tell the story, but there is no doubt 
                about<br>
                it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Believe every word of what we tell you,&quot; said the 
                doves, and<br>
                cooed down into their poultry-yard. &quot;There is a hen- nay, 
                some say<br>
                that there are two- who have plucked out all their feathers, in<br>
                order not to look like the others, and to attract the attention 
                of the<br>
                cock. It is a dangerous game, for one can easily catch cold and 
                die<br>
                from fever, and both of these are dead already.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Wake up! wake up!&quot; crowed the cock, and flew upon 
                his board.<br>
                Sleep was still in his eyes, but yet he crowed out: &quot;Three 
                hens have<br>
                died of their unfortunate love for a cock. They had plucked out 
                all<br>
                their feathers. It is a horrible story: I will not keep it to<br>
                myself, but let it go farther.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Let it go farther,&quot; shrieked the bats, and the hens 
                clucked and<br>
                the cocks crowed, &quot;Let it go farther! Let it go farther!&quot; 
                In this<br>
                way the story travelled from poultry-yard to poultry-yard, and 
                at last<br>
                came back to the place from which it had really started.<br>
                &quot;Five hens,&quot; it now ran, &quot;have plucked out all 
                their feathers to<br>
                show which of them had grown leanest for love of the cock, and 
                then<br>
                they all pecked at each other till the blood ran down and they 
                fell<br>
                down dead, to the derision and shame of their family, and to the 
                great<br>
                loss of their owner.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The hen who had lost the loose little feather naturally did not<br>
                recognise her own story, and being a respectable hen, said: &quot;I 
                despise<br>
                those fowls; but there are more of that kind. Such things ought 
                not to<br>
                be concealed, and I will do my best to get the story into the<br>
                papers, so that it becomes known throughout the land; the hens 
                have<br>
                richly deserved it, and their family too.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>It got into the papers, it was printed; and there is no doubt<br>
                about it, one little feather may easily grow into five hens.</p>

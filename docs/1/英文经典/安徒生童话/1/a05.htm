              <p class="h" align="center"> THE STORY OF THE YEAR</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> IT was near the end of January, and a terrible fall of snow 
                was<br>
                pelting down, and whirling through the streets and lanes; the<br>
                windows were plastered with snow on the outside, snow fell in 
                masses from the roofs. Every one seemed in a great hurry; they 
                ran, they flew, fell into each other's arms, holding fast for 
                a moment as long as they could stand safely. Coaches and horses 
                looked as if they had been frosted with sugar. The footmen stood 
                with their backs against the carriages, so as to turn their faces 
                from the wind. The foot<br>
                passengers kept within the shelter of the carriages, which could<br>
                only move slowly on in the deep snow. At last the storm abated, 
                and<br>
                a narrow path was swept clean in front of the houses; when two 
                persons met in this path they stood still, for neither liked to 
                take the first step on one side into the deep snow to let the 
                other pass him. </p>
              <p>There they stood silent and motionless, till at last, as if by 
                tacit<br>
                consent, they each sacrificed a leg and buried it in the deep 
                snow.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Towards evening, the weather became calm. The sky, cleared from 
                the snow, looked more lofty and transparent, while the stars shone 
                with new brightness and purity. The frozen snow crackled under 
                foot, and was quite firm enough to bear the sparrows, who hopped 
                upon it in the morning dawn. They searched for food in the path 
                which had been swept, but there was very little for them, and 
                they were terribly<br>
                cold. &quot;Tweet, tweet,&quot; said one to another; they call 
                this a new<br>
                year, but I think it is worse than the last. We might just as 
                well<br>
                have kept the old year; I'm quite unhappy, and I have a right 
                to be<br>
                so.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, you have; and yet the people ran about and fired off 
                guns,<br>
                to usher in the new year,&quot; said a little shivering sparrow. 
                &quot;They<br>
                threw things against the doors, and were quite beside themselves<br>
                with joy, because the old year had disappeared. I was glad too, 
                for<br>
                I expected we should have some warm days, but my hopes have come 
                to nothing. It freezes harder than ever; I think mankind have 
                made a mistake in reckoning time.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That they have,&quot; said a third, an old sparrow with 
                a white<br>
                poll; &quot;they have something they call a calendar; it's an 
                invention<br>
                of their own, and everything must be arranged according to it, 
                but<br>
                it won't do. When spring comes, then the year begins. It is the<br>
                voice of nature, and I reckon by that.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But when will spring come?&quot; asked the others.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It will come when the stork returns, but he is very uncertain,<br>
                and here in the town no one knows anything about it. In the country<br>
                they have more knowledge; shall we fly away there and wait? we 
                shall<br>
                be nearer to spring then, certainly.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That may be all very well,&quot; said another sparrow, 
                who had been<br>
                hopping about for a long time, chirping, but not saying anything 
                of<br>
                consequence, &quot;but I have found a few comforts here in town 
                which,<br>
                I'm afraid, I should miss out in the country. Here in this<br>
                neighborhood, there lives a family of people who have been so 
                sensible as to place three or four flower-pots against the wall 
                in the<br>
                court-yard, so that the openings are all turned inward, and the 
                bottom<br>
                of each points outward. In the latter a hole has been cut large 
                enough<br>
                for me to fly in and out. I and my husband have built a nest in 
                one of<br>
                these pots, and all our young ones, who have now flown away, were<br>
                brought up there. The people who live there of course made the 
                whole arrangement that they might have the pleasure of seeing 
                us, or they would not have done it. It pleased them also to strew 
                bread-crumbs for us, and so we have food, and may consider ourselves 
                provided for. So I think my husband and I will stay where we are; 
                although we are not very happy, but we shall stay.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And we will fly into the country,&quot; said the others, 
                &quot;to see if<br>
                spring is coming.&quot; And away they flew.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the country it was really winter, a few degrees colder than<br>
                in the town. The sharp winds blew over the snow-covered fields. 
                The<br>
                farmer, wrapped in warm clothing, sat in his sleigh, and beat 
                his arms<br>
                across his chest to keep off the cold. The whip lay on his lap. 
                The<br>
                horses ran till they smoked. The snow crackled, the sparrows hopped<br>
                about in the wheel-ruts, and shivered, crying, &quot;Tweet, tweet; 
                when<br>
                will spring come? It is very long in coming.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Very long indeed,&quot; sounded over the field, from the 
                nearest<br>
                snow-covered hill. It might have been the echo which people heard,<br>
                or perhaps the words of that wonderful old man, who sat high on 
                a heap of snow, regardless of wind or weather. He was all in white; 
                he had on a peasant's coarse white coat of frieze. He had long 
                white hair, a pale face, and large clear blue eyes. &quot;Who 
                is that old man?&quot; asked the sparrows.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I know who he is,&quot; said an old raven, who sat on the 
                fence, and<br>
                was condescending enough to acknowledge that we are all equal 
                in the sight of Heaven, even as little birds, and therefore he 
                talked with<br>
                the sparrows, and gave them the information they wanted. &quot;I 
                know who the old man is,&quot; he said. &quot;It is Winter, the 
                old man of last year;<br>
                he is not dead yet, as the calendar says, but acts as guardian 
                to<br>
                little Prince Spring who is coming. Winter rules here still. Ugh!<br>
                the cold makes you shiver, little ones, does it not?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There! Did I not tell you so?&quot; said the smallest of 
                the sparrows.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The calendar is only an invention of man, and is not arranged<br>
                according to nature. They should leave these things to us; we 
                are<br>
                created so much more clever than they are.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>One week passed, and then another. The forest looked dark, the<br>
                hard-frozen lake lay like a sheet of lead. The mountains had<br>
                disappeared, for over the land hung damp, icy mists. Large black 
                crows flew about in silence; it was as if nature slept. At length 
                a<br>
                sunbeam glided over the lake, and it shone like burnished silver.<br>
                But the snow on the fields and the hills did not glitter as before.<br>
                The white form of Winter sat there still, with his un-wandering 
                gaze<br>
                fixed on the south. He did not perceive that the snowy carpet 
                seemed<br>
                to sink as it were into the earth; that here and there a little<br>
                green patch of grass appeared, and that these patches were covered<br>
                with sparrows.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Tee-wit, tee-wit; is spring coming at last?&quot;<br>
                Spring! How the cry resounded over field and meadow, and through<br>
                the dark-brown woods, where the fresh green moss still gleamed 
                on<br>
                the trunks of the trees, and from the south came the two first<br>
                storks flying through the air, and on the back of each sat a lovely<br>
                little child, a boy and a girl. They greeted the earth with a 
                kiss,<br>
                and wherever they placed their feet white flowers sprung up from<br>
                beneath the snow. Hand in hand they approached the old ice-man,<br>
                Winter, embraced him and clung to his breast; and as they did 
                so, in a<br>
                moment all three were enveloped in a thick, damp mist, dark and 
                heavy, that closed over them like a veil. The wind arose with 
                mighty rustling tone, and cleared away the mist. Then the sun 
                shone out warmly. Winter had vanished away, and the beautiful 
                children of Spring sat on the throne of the year.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;This is really a new year,&quot; cried all the sparrows, 
                &quot;now we shall<br>
                get our rights, and have some return for what we suffered in winter.&quot;<br>
                Wherever the two children wandered, green buds burst forth on 
                bush<br>
                and tree, the grass grew higher, and the corn-fields became lovely<br>
                in delicate green.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The little maiden strewed flowers in her path. She held her<br>
                apron before her: it was full of flowers; it was as if they sprung<br>
                into life there, for the more she scattered around her, the more<br>
                flowers did her apron contain. Eagerly she showered snowy blossoms 
                over apple and peach-trees, so that they stood in full beauty 
                before even their green leaves had burst from the bud. Then the 
                boy and the girl clapped their hands, and troops of birds came 
                flying by, no one knew from whence, and they all twittered and 
                chirped, singing &quot;Spring has come!&quot; How beautiful everything 
                was! </p>
              <p>Many an old dame came forth from her door into the sunshine, 
                and shuffled about with great delight, glancing at the golden 
                flowers which glittered everywhere in the fields, as they used 
                to do in her young days. The world grew young again to her, as 
                she said, &quot;It is a blessed time out here to-day.&quot; The 
                forest already wore its dress of dark-green buds. The thyme blossomed 
                in fresh fragrance. Primroses and anemones sprung forth, and violets 
                bloomed in the shade, while every blade of grass was full of strength 
                and sap. Who could resist sitting down on such a beautiful carpet? 
                and then the young children of Spring seated themselves, holding 
                each other's hands, and sang, and laughed, and grew. A gentle 
                rain fell upon them from the sky, but they did not notice it, 
                for the rain-drops were their own tears of joy. They kissed each 
                other, and were betrothed; and in the same moment the buds of 
                the trees unfolded, and when the sun rose, the forest was green. 
                Hand in hand the two wandered beneath the fresh pendant canopy 
                of foliage, while the sun's rays gleamed through the opening of 
                the shade, in changing and varied colors. The delicate young leaves 
                filled the air with refreshing odor. Merrily rippled the clear 
                brooks and rivulets between the green, velvety rushes, and over 
                the many-colored pebbles beneath. All nature spoke of abundance 
                and plenty. The cuckoo sang, and the lark carolled, for it was 
                now beautiful spring. </p>
              <p>The careful willows had, however, covered their blossoms with 
                woolly gloves; and this carefulness is rather tedious. Days and 
                weeks went by, and the heat increased. Warm air waved the corn 
                as it grew golden in the sun. The white northern lily spread its 
                large green leaves over the glossy mirror of the woodland lake, 
                and the fishes sought the<br>
                shadows beneath them. In a sheltered part of the wood, the sun 
                shone<br>
                upon the walls of a farm-house, brightening the blooming roses, 
                and<br>
                ripening the black juicy berries, which hung on the loaded<br>
                cherry-trees, with his hot beams. Here sat the lovely wife of<br>
                Summer, the same whom we have seen as a child and a bride; her 
                eyes were fixed on dark gathering clouds, which in wavy outlines 
                of black and indigo were piling themselves up like mountains, 
                higher and<br>
                higher. They came from every side, always increasing like a rising,<br>
                rolling sea. Then they swooped towards the forest, where every 
                sound had been silenced as if by magic, every breath hushed, every 
                bird mute. All nature stood still in grave suspense. But in the 
                lanes and the highways, passengers on foot or in carriages were 
                hurrying to find a place of shelter. Then came a flash of light, 
                as if the sun had<br>
                rushed forth from the sky, flaming, burning, all-devouring, and<br>
                darkness returned amid a rolling crash of thunder. The rain poured<br>
                down in streams,- now there was darkness, then blinding light,- 
                now<br>
                thrilling silence, then deafening din. The young brown reeds on 
                the<br>
                moor waved to and fro in feathery billows; the forest boughs were<br>
                hidden in a watery mist, and still light and darkness followed 
                each<br>
                other, still came the silence after the roar, while the corn and 
                the<br>
                blades of grass lay beaten down and swamped, so that it seemed<br>
                impossible they could ever raise themselves again. But after a 
                while<br>
                the rain began to fall gently, the sun's rays pierced the clouds,<br>
                and the water-drops glittered like pearls on leaf and stem. The<br>
                birds sang, the fishes leaped up to the surface of the water, 
                the<br>
                gnats danced in the sunshine, and yonder, on a rock by the heaving<br>
                salt sea, sat Summer himself, a strong man with sturdy limbs and 
                long, dripping hair. Strengthened by the cool bath, he sat in 
                the warm<br>
                sunshine, while all around him renewed nature bloomed strong,<br>
                luxuriant, and beautiful: it was summer, warm, lovely summer. 
                Sweet<br>
                and pleasant was the fragrance wafted from the clover-field, where 
                the<br>
                bees swarmed round the ruined tower, the bramble twined itself 
                over<br>
                the old altar, which, washed by the rain, glittered in the sunshine;<br>
                and thither flew the queen bee with her swarm, and prepared wax 
                and<br>
                honey. But Summer and his bosom-wife saw it with different eyes, 
                to<br>
                them the altar-table was covered with the offerings of nature. 
                The<br>
                evening sky shone like gold, no church dome could ever gleam so<br>
                brightly, and between the golden evening and the blushing morning<br>
                there was moonlight. It was indeed summer. And days and weeks<br>
                passed, the bright scythes of the reapers glittered in the<br>
                corn-fields, the branches of the apple-trees bent low, heavy with<br>
                the red and golden fruit. The hop, hanging in clusters, filled 
                the air<br>
                with sweet fragrance, and beneath the hazel-bushes, where the 
                nuts<br>
                hung in great bunches, rested a man and a woman- Summer and his<br>
                grave consort.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;See,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;what wealth, what blessings 
                surround us.<br>
                Everything is home-like and good, and yet, I know not why, I long<br>
                for rest and peace; I can scarcely express what I feel. They are<br>
                already ploughing the fields again; more and more the people wish<br>
                for gain. See, the storks are flocking together, and following 
                the<br>
                plough at a short distance. They are the birds from Egypt, who 
                carried us through the air. Do you remember how we came as children 
                to this land of the north; we brought with us flowers and bright 
                sunshine, and green to the forests, but the wind has been rough 
                with them, and they are now become dark and brown, like the trees 
                of the south, but they do not, like them, bear golden fruit.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Do you wish to see golden fruit?&quot; said the man, &quot;then 
                rejoice,&quot;<br>
                and he lifted his arm. The leaves of the forest put on colors 
                of red<br>
                and gold, and bright tints covered the woodlands. The rose-bushes<br>
                gleamed with scarlet hips, and the branches of the elder-trees 
                hung<br>
                down with the weight of the full, dark berries. The wild chestnuts<br>
                fell ripe from their dark, green shells, and in the forests the<br>
                violets bloomed for the second time. But the queen of the year<br>
                became more and more silent and pale.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It blows cold,&quot; she said, &quot;and night brings the 
                damp mist; I long<br>
                for the land of my childhood.&quot; Then she saw the storks fly 
                away<br>
                every one, and she stretched out her hands towards them. She looked 
                at the empty nests; in one of them grew a long-stalked corn flower, 
                in<br>
                another the yellow mustard seed, as if the nest had been placed<br>
                there only for its comfort and protection, and the sparrows were<br>
                flying round them all.</p>
              <p> &quot;Tweet, where has the master of the nest gone?&quot; cried 
                one, &quot;I<br>
                suppose he could not bear it when the wind blew, and therefore 
                he<br>
                has left this country. I wish him a pleasant journey.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The forest leaves became more and more yellow, leaf after leaf<br>
                fell, and the stormy winds of Autumn howled. The year was now 
                far<br>
                advanced, and upon the fallen, yellow leaves, lay the queen of 
                the<br>
                year, looking up with mild eyes at a gleaming star, and her husband<br>
                stood by her. A gust of wind swept through the foliage, and the 
                leaves fell in a shower. The summer queen was gone, but a butterfly, 
                the last of the year, flew through the cold air. Damp fogs came, 
                icy winds blew, and the long, dark nights of winter approached. 
                The ruler of the year appeared with hair white as snow, but he 
                knew it not; he<br>
                thought snow-flakes falling from the sky covered his head, as 
                they<br>
                decked the green fields with a thin, white covering of snow. And<br>
                then the church bells rang out for Christmas time.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The bells are ringing for the new-born year,&quot; said 
                the ruler,<br>
                &quot;soon will a new ruler and his bride be born, and. I shall 
                go to<br>
                rest with my wife in yonder light-giving star.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the fresh, green fir-wood, where the snow lay all around, 
                stood<br>
                the angel of Christmas, and consecrated the young trees that were 
                to<br>
                adorn his feast.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;May there be joy in the rooms, and under the green boughs,&quot;<br>
                said the old ruler of the year. In a few weeks he had become a 
                very<br>
                old man, with hair as white as snow. &quot;My resting-time draws 
                near;<br>
                the young pair of the year will soon claim my crown and sceptre.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But the night is still thine,&quot; said the angel of Christmas,<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;for power, but not for rest. Let the snow lie warmly upon 
                the<br>
                tender seed. Learn to endure the thought that another is worshipped<br>
                whilst thou art still lord. Learn to endure being forgotten while<br>
                yet thou livest. The hour of thy freedom will come when Spring<br>
                appears.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And when will Spring come?&quot; asked Winter.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It will come when the stork returns.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And with white locks and snowy beard, cold, bent, and hoary, 
                but<br>
                strong as the wintry storm, and firm as the ice, old Winter sat 
                on the<br>
                snowdrift-covered hill, looking towards the south, where Winter 
                had<br>
                sat before, and gazed. The ice glittered, the snow crackled, the<br>
                skaters skimmed over the polished surface of the lakes; ravens 
                and<br>
                crows formed a pleasing contrast to the white ground, and not 
                a breath of wind stirred, and in the still air old Winter clenched 
                his fists,<br>
                and the ice lay fathoms deep between the lands. Then came the 
                sparrows again out of the town, and asked, &quot;Who is that old 
                man?&quot; </p>
              <p>The raven sat there still, or it might be his son, which is the 
                same thing, and he said to them,-<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is Winter, the old man of the former year; he is not 
                dead,<br>
                as the calendar says, but he is guardian to the spring, which 
                is<br>
                coming.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;When will Spring come?&quot; asked the sparrows, &quot;for 
                we shall have<br>
                better times then, and a better rule. The old times are worth<br>
                nothing.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And in quiet thought old Winter looked at the leafless forest,<br>
                where the graceful form and bends of each tree and branch could 
                be<br>
                seen; and while Winter slept, icy mists came from the clouds, 
                and<br>
                the ruler dreamt of his youthful days and of his manhood, and 
                in the<br>
                morning dawn the whole forest glittered with hoar frost, which 
                the sun<br>
                shook from the branches,- and this was the summer dream of Winter.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;When will Spring come?&quot; asked the sparrows. &quot;Spring!&quot; 
                Again the<br>
                echo sounded from the hills on which the snow lay. The sunshine 
                became warmer, the snow melted, and the birds twittered, &quot;Spring 
                is<br>
                coming!&quot; And high in the air flew the first stork, and the 
                second<br>
                followed; a lovely child sat on the back of each, and they sank 
                down<br>
                on the open field, kissed the earth, and kissed the quiet old 
                man;<br>
                and, as the mist from the mountain top, he vanished away and<br>
                disappeared. And the story of the year was finished.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;This is all very fine, no doubt,&quot; said the sparrows, 
                &quot;and it is<br>
                very beautiful; but it is not according to the calendar, therefore, 
                it<br>
                must be all wrong.&quot;</p>

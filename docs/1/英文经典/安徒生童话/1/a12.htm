              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THE well was deep, and therefore the rope had to be a long one; 
                it<br>
                was heavy work turning the handle when any one had to raise a<br>
                bucketful of water over the edge of the well. Though the water 
                was<br>
                clear, the sun never looked down far enough into the well to mirror<br>
                itself in the waters; but as far as its beams could reach, green<br>
                things grew forth between the stones in the sides of the well.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Down below dwelt a family of the Toad race. They had, in fact,<br>
                come head-over-heels down the well, in the person of the old<br>
                Mother-Toad, who was still alive. The green Frogs, who had been<br>
                established there a long time, and swam about in the water, called<br>
                them &quot;well-guests.&quot; But the new-comers seemed determined 
                to stay where they were, for they found it very agreeable living 
                &quot;in a dry place,&quot; as they called the wet stones.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Mother-Frog had once been a traveller. She happened to be 
                in<br>
                the water-bucket when it was drawn up, but the light became too 
                strong for her, and she got a pain in her eyes. Fortunately she 
                scrambled out of the bucket; but she fell into the water with 
                a terrible flop, and had to lie sick for three days with pains 
                in her back. She certainly had not much to tell of the things 
                up above, but she knew this, and all the Frogs knew it, that the 
                well was not all the world. The<br>
                Mother-Toad might have told this and that, if she had chosen, 
                but<br>
                she never answered when they asked her anything, and so they left<br>
                off asking.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;She's thick, and fat and ugly,&quot; said the young green 
                Frogs;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;and her children will be just as ugly as she is.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That may be,&quot; retorted the mother-Toad, &quot;but 
                one of them has a<br>
                jewel in his head, or else I have the jewel.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The young frogs listened and stared; and as these words did not<br>
                please them, they made grimaces and dived down under the water. 
              </p>
              <p>But the little Toads kicked up their hind legs from mere pride, 
                for each of them thought that he must have the jewel; and then 
                they sat and held their heads quite still. But at length they 
                asked what it was<br>
                that made them so proud, and what kind of a thing a jewel might 
                be.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, it is such a splendid and precious thing, that I cannot<br>
                describe it,&quot; said the Mother-Toad. &quot;It's something 
                which one<br>
                carries about for one's own pleasure, and that makes other people<br>
                angry. But don't ask me any questions, for I shan't answer you.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well, I haven't got the jewel,&quot; said the smallest 
                of the Toads;<br>
                she was as ugly as a toad can be. &quot;Why should I have such 
                a precious thing? And if it makes others angry, it can't give 
                me any pleasure.<br>
              </p>
              <p>No, I only wish I could get to the edge of the well, and look 
                out;<br>
                it must be beautiful up there.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You'd better stay where you are,&quot; said the old Mother-Toad,<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;for you know everything here, and you can tell what you 
                have. Take<br>
                care of the bucket, for it will crush you to death; and even if 
                you<br>
                get into it safely, you may fall out. And it's not every one who 
                falls<br>
                so cleverly as I did, and gets away with whole legs and whole 
                bones.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Quack!&quot; said the little Toad; and that's just as if 
                one of us<br>
                were to say, &quot;Aha!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>She had an immense desire to get to the edge of the well, and 
                to<br>
                look over; she felt such a longing for the green, up there; and 
                the<br>
                next morning, when it chanced that the bucket was being drawn 
                up,<br>
                filled with water, and stopped for a moment just in front of the 
                stone<br>
                on which the Toad sat, the little creature's heart moved within 
                it,<br>
                and our Toad jumped into the filled bucket, which presently was<br>
                drawn to the top, and emptied out.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ugh, you beast!&quot; said the farm laborer who emptied 
                the bucket,<br>
                when he saw the toad. &quot;You're the ugliest thing I've seen 
                for one<br>
                while.&quot; And he made a kick with his wooden shoe at the toad, 
                which<br>
                just escaped being crushed by managing to scramble into the nettles<br>
                which grew high by the well's brink. Here she saw stem by stem, 
                but<br>
                she looked up also; the sun shone through the leaves, which were 
                quite transparent; and she felt as a person would feel who steps 
                suddenly into a great forest, where the sun looks in between the 
                branches and leaves.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It's much nicer here than down in the well! I should like 
                to stay<br>
                here my whole life long!&quot; said the little Toad. So she lay 
                there for<br>
                an hour, yes, for two hours. &quot;I wonder what is to be found 
                up here? </p>
              <p>As I have come so far, I must try to go still farther.&quot; 
                And so she<br>
                crawled on as fast as she could crawl, and got out upon the highway,<br>
                where the sun shone upon her, and the dust powdered her all over 
                as<br>
                she marched across the way.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I've got to a dry place. now, and no mistake,&quot; said 
                the Toad.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It's almost too much of a good thing here; it tickles one 
                so.&quot;<br>
                She came to the ditch; and forget-me-nots were growing there,<br>
                and meadow-sweet; and a very little way off was a hedge of whitethorn,and 
                elder bushes grew there, too, and bindweed with white flowers. 
                Gay colors were to be seen here, and a butterfly, too, was flitting 
                by.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Toad thought it was a flower which had broken loose that 
                it<br>
                might look about better in the world, which was quite a natural<br>
                thing to do.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;If one could only make such a journey as that!&quot; said 
                the Toad.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Croak! how capital that would be.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Eight days and eight nights she stayed by the well, and<br>
                experienced no want of provisions. On the ninth day she thought,<br>
                &quot;Forward! onward!&quot; But what could she find more charming 
                and<br>
                beautiful? Perhaps a little toad or a few green frogs. During 
                the last<br>
                night there had been a sound borne on the breeze, as if there 
                were<br>
                cousins in the neighborhood.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It's a glorious thing to live! glorious to get out of the 
                well,<br>
                and to lie among the stinging-nettles, and to crawl along the 
                dusty<br>
                road. But onward, onward! that we may find frogs or a little toad.<br>
              </p>
              <p>We can't do without that; nature alone is not enough for one.&quot; 
                And<br>
                so she went forward on her journey.<br>
              </p>
              <p>She came out into the open field, to a great pond, round about<br>
                which grew reeds; and she walked into it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It will be too damp for you here,&quot; said the Frogs; 
                &quot;but you are<br>
                very welcome! Are you a he or a she? But it doesn't matter; you 
                are<br>
                equally welcome.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And she was invited to the concert in the evening- the family<br>
                concert; great enthusiasm and thin voices; we know the sort of<br>
                thing. No refreshments were given, only there was plenty to drink, 
                for<br>
                the whole pond was free.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now I shall resume my journey,&quot; said the little Toad; 
                for she<br>
                always felt a longing for something better.<br>
              </p>
              <p>She saw the stars shining, so large and so bright, and she saw 
                the<br>
                moon gleaming; and then she saw the sun rise, and mount higher 
                and<br>
                higher.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Perhaps after all, I am still in a well, only in a larger 
                well. I<br>
                must get higher yet; I feel a great restlessness and longing.&quot; 
                And<br>
                when the moon became round and full, the poor creature thought, 
                &quot;I<br>
                wonder if that is the bucket which will be let down, and into 
                which<br>
                I must step to get higher up? Or is the sun the great bucket? 
                How<br>
                great it is! how bright it is! It can take up all. I must look 
                out,<br>
                that I may not miss the opportunity. Oh, how it seems to shine 
                in my<br>
                head! I don't think the jewel can shine brighter. But I haven't 
                the<br>
                jewel; not that I cry about that- no, I must go higher up, into<br>
                splendor and joy! I feel so confident, and yet I am afraid. It's 
                a<br>
                difficult step to take, and yet it must be taken. Onward, therefore,<br>
                straight onward!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>She took a few steps, such as a crawling animal may take, and 
                soon<br>
                found herself on a road beside which people dwelt; but there were<br>
                flower gardens as well as kitchen gardens. And she sat down to 
                rest by a kitchen garden.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What a number of different creatures there are that I never 
                knew!<br>
                and how beautiful and great the world is! But one must look round 
                in<br>
                it, and not stay in one spot.&quot; And then she hopped into the 
                kitchen<br>
                garden. &quot;How green it is here! how beautiful it is here!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I know that,&quot; said the Caterpillar, on the leaf, &quot;my 
                leaf is<br>
                the largest here. It hides half the world from me, but I don't 
                care<br>
                for the world.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Cluck, cluck!&quot; And some fowls came. They tripped about 
                in the<br>
                cabbage garden. The Fowl who marched at the head of them had a 
                long sight, and she spied the Caterpillar on the green leaf, and 
                pecked<br>
                at it, so that the Caterpillar fell on the ground, where it twisted<br>
                and writhed.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Fowl looked at it first with one eye and then with the<br>
                other, for she did not know what the end of this writhing would 
                be.<br>
                &quot;It doesn't do that with a good will,&quot; thought the Fowl, 
                and<br>
                lifted up her head to peck at the Caterpillar.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Toad was so horrified at this, that she came crawling straight<br>
                up towards the Fowl.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Aha, it has allies,&quot; quoth the Fowl. &quot;Just look 
                at the crawling<br>
                thing!&quot; And then the Fowl turned away. &quot;I don't care 
                for the little<br>
                green morsel; it would only tickle my throat.&quot; The other 
                fowls took<br>
                the same view of it, and they all turned away together.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I writhed myself free,&quot; said the Caterpillar. &quot;What 
                a good<br>
                thing it is when one has presence of mind! But the hardest thing<br>
                remains to be done, and that is to get on my leaf again. Where 
                is it?&quot;<br>
                And the little Toad came up and expressed her sympathy. She was<br>
                glad that in her ugliness she had frightened the fowls.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; cried the Caterpillar. 
                &quot;I wriggled<br>
                myself free from the Fowl. You are very disagreeable to look at.<br>
                Cannot I be left in peace on my own property? Now I smell cabbage; 
                now I am near my leaf. Nothing is so beautiful as property. But 
                I must<br>
                go higher up.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, higher up,&quot; said the little Toad; &quot;higher-up! 
                She feels just<br>
                as I do; but she's not in a good humor to-day. That's because 
                of the<br>
                fright. We all want to go higher up.&quot; And she looked up as 
                high as<br>
                ever she could.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The stork sat in his nest on the roof of the farm-house. He<br>
                clapped with his beak, and the Mother-stork clapped with hers.<br>
                &quot;How high up they live!&quot; thought the Toad. &quot;If 
                one could only<br>
                get as high as that!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the farm-house lived two young students; the one was a poet 
                and<br>
                the other a scientific searcher into the secrets of nature. The 
                one<br>
                sang and wrote joyously of everything that God had created, and 
                how it was mirrored in his heart. He sang it out clearly, sweetly, 
                richly, in<br>
                well-sounding verses; while the other investigated created matter<br>
                itself, and even cut it open where need was. He looked upon God's<br>
                creation as a great sum in arithmetic- subtracted, multiplied, 
                and<br>
                tried to know it within and without, and to talk with understanding<br>
                concerning it; and that was a very sensible thing; and he spoke<br>
                joyously and cleverly of it. They were good, joyful men, those 
                two,<br>
                &quot;There sits a good specimen of a toad,&quot; said the naturalist. 
                &quot;I<br>
                must have that fellow in a bottle of spirits.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You have two of them already,&quot; replied the poet. &quot;Let 
                the thing<br>
                sit there and enjoy its life.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But it's so wonderfully ugly,&quot; persisted the first.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, if we could find the jewel in its head,&quot; said 
                the poet, &quot;I<br>
                too should be for cutting it open.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;A jewel!&quot; cried the naturalist. &quot;You seem to 
                know a great deal<br>
                about natural history.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But is there not something beautiful in the popular belief 
                that<br>
                just as the toad is the ugliest of animals, it should often carry<br>
                the most precious jewel in its head? Is it not just the same thing<br>
                with men? What a jewel that was that Aesop had, and still more,<br>
                Socrates!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Toad did not hear any more, nor did she understand half of<br>
                what she had heard. The two friends walked on, and thus she escaped 
                the fate of being bottled up in spirits.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Those two also were speaking of the jewel,&quot; said the 
                Toad to<br>
                herself. &quot;What a good thing that I have not got it! I might 
                have<br>
                been in a very disagreeable position.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Now there was a clapping on the roof of the farm-house.<br>
                Father-Stork was making a speech to his family, and his family 
                was<br>
                glancing down at the two young men in the kitchen garden.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Man is the most conceited creature!&quot; said the Stork. 
                &quot;Listen<br>
                how their jaws are wagging; and for all that they can't clap properly.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They boast of their gifts of eloquence and their language! Yes, 
                a fine<br>
                language truly! Why, it changes in every day's journey we make. 
                One of them doesn't understand another. Now, we can speak our 
                language over the whole earth- up in the North and in Egypt. And 
                then men are not able to fly, moreover. They rush along by means 
                of an invention they call 'railway;' but they often break their 
                necks over it. It makes<br>
                my beak turn cold when I think of it. The world could get on without<br>
                men. We could do without them very well, so long as we only keep 
                frogs and earth-worms.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That was a powerful speech,&quot; thought the little Toad. 
                &quot;What a<br>
                great man that is yonder! and how high he sits! Higher than ever 
                I saw<br>
                any one sit yet; and how he can swim!&quot; she cried, as the 
                Stork<br>
                soared away through the air with outspread pinions.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the Mother-Stork began talking in the nest, and told about<br>
                Egypt and the waters of the Nile, and the incomparable mud that 
                was to be found in that strange land; and all this sounded new 
                and very<br>
                charming to the little Toad.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I must go to Egypt!&quot; said she. &quot;If the Stork 
                or one of his<br>
                young ones would only take me! I would oblige him in return. Yes, 
                I<br>
                shall get to Egypt, for I feel so happy! All the longing and all 
                the<br>
                pleasure that I feel is much better than having a jewel in one's<br>
                head.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And it was just she who had the jewel. That jewel was the<br>
                continual striving and desire to go upward- ever upward. It gleamed 
                in<br>
                her head, gleamed in joy, beamed brightly in her longing.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then, suddenly, up came the Stork. He had seen the Toad in the<br>
                grass, and stooped down and seized the little creature anything 
                but<br>
                gently. The Stork's beak pinched her, and the wind whistled; it 
                was<br>
                not exactly agreeable, but she was going upward- upward towards 
                Egypt- and she knew it; and that was why her eyes gleamed, and 
                a spark seemed to fly out of them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Quunk!- ah!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The body was dead- the Toad was killed! But the spark that had<br>
                shot forth from her eyes; what became of that?<br>
              </p>
              <p>The sunbeam took it up; the sunbeam carried the jewel from the<br>
                head of the toad. Whither?<br>
              </p>
              <p>Ask not the naturalist; rather ask the poet. He will tell it<br>
                thee under the guise of a fairy tale; and the Caterpillar on the<br>
                cabbage, and the Stork family belong to the story. Think! the<br>
                Caterpillar is changed, and turns into a beautiful butterfly; 
                the<br>
                Stork family flies over mountains and seas, to the distant Africa, 
                and<br>
                yet finds the shortest way home to the same country- to the same 
                roof.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Nay, that is almost too improbable; and yet it is true. You may 
                ask<br>
                the naturalist, he will confess it is so; and you know it yourself,<br>
                for you have seen it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the jewel in the head of the toad?<br>
                Seek it in the sun; see it there if you can.<br>
                The brightness is too dazzling there. We have not yet such eyes 
                as<br>
                can see into the glories which God has created, but we shall receive<br>
                them by-and-by; and that will be the most beautiful story of all,<br>
                and we shall all have our share in it.</p>

              <p class="h" align="center"> THE BELL-DEEP</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> &quot;DING-DONG! ding-dong!&quot; It sounds up from the &quot;bell-deep&quot; 
                in the<br>
                Odense-Au. Every child in the old town of Odense, on the island 
                of<br>
                Funen, knows the Au, which washes the gardens round about the 
                town, and flows on under the wooden bridges from the dam to the<br>
                water-mill. In the Au grow the yellow water-lilies and brown<br>
                feathery reeds; the dark velvety flag grows there, high and thick; 
                old<br>
                and decayed willows, slanting and tottering, hang far out over 
                the<br>
                stream beside the monk's meadow and by the bleaching ground; but<br>
                opposite there are gardens upon gardens, each different from the 
                rest,<br>
                some with pretty flowers and bowers like little dolls' pleasure<br>
                grounds, often displaying cabbage and other kitchen plants; and 
                here<br>
                and there the gardens cannot be seen at all, for the great elder 
                trees<br>
                that spread themselves out by the bank, and hang far out over 
                the<br>
                streaming waters, which are deeper here and there than an oar 
                can<br>
                fathom. Opposite the old nunnery is the deepest place, which is 
                called<br>
                the &quot;bell-deep,&quot; and there dwells the old water spirit, 
                the &quot;Au-mann.&quot;<br>
                This spirit sleeps through the day while the sun shines down upon<br>
                the water; but in starry and moonlit nights he shows himself. 
                He is<br>
                very old. Grandmother says that she has heard her own grandmother 
                tell of him; he is said to lead a solitary life, and to have nobody 
                with<br>
                whom he can converse save the great old church Bell. Once the 
                Bell<br>
                hung in the church tower; but now there is no trace left of the<br>
                tower or of the church, which was called St. Alban's.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ding-dong! ding-dong!&quot; sounded the Bell, when the 
                tower still<br>
                stood there; and one evening, while the sun was setting, and the<br>
                Bell was swinging away bravely, it broke loose and came flying 
                down<br>
                through the air, the brilliant metal shining in the ruddy beam.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ding-dong! ding-dong! Now I'll retire to rest!&quot; sang 
                the Bell,<br>
                and flew down into the Odense-Au, where it is deepest; and that 
                is why the place is called the &quot;bell-deep.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the Bell got neither rest nor sleep. Down in the Au-mann's<br>
                haunt it sounds and rings, so that the tones sometimes pierce 
                upward<br>
                through the waters; and many people maintain that its strains 
                forebode<br>
                the death of some one; but that is not true, for the Bell is only<br>
                talking with the Au-mann, who is now no longer alone.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And what is the Bell telling? It is old, very old, as we have<br>
                already observed; it was there long before grandmother's grandmother 
                was born; and yet it is but a child in comparison with the Au-mann, 
                who is quite an old quiet personage, an oddity, with his hose 
                of eel-skin, and his scaly Jacket with the yellow lilies for buttons, 
                and a wreath of reed in his hair and seaweed in his beard; but 
                he looks very pretty for all that.<br>
              </p>
              <p>What the Bell tells? To repeat it all would require years and<br>
                days; for year by year it is telling the old stories, sometimes<br>
                short ones, sometimes long ones, according to its whim; it tells 
                of<br>
                old times, of the dark hard times, thus:<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;In the church of St. Alban, the monk had mounted up into 
                the<br>
                tower. He was young and handsome, but thoughtful exceedingly. 
                He<br>
                looked through the loophole out upon the Odense-Au, when the bed 
                of the water was yet broad, and the monks' meadow was still a 
                lake. He looked out over it, and over the rampart, and over the 
                nuns' hill<br>
                opposite, where the convent lay, and the light gleamed forth from<br>
                the nun's cell. He had known the nun right well, and he thought 
                of<br>
                her, and his heart beat quicker as he thought. Ding-dong! ding-dong!&quot;<br>
                Yes, this was the story the Bell told.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Into the tower came also the dapper man-servant of the 
                bishop;<br>
                and when I, the Bell, who am made of metal, rang hard and loud, 
                and<br>
                swung to and fro, I might have beaten out his brains. He sat down<br>
                close under me, and played with two little sticks as if they had<br>
                been a stringed instrument; and he sang to it. 'Now I may sing 
                it<br>
                out aloud, though at other times I may not whisper it. I may sing 
                of<br>
                everything that is kept concealed behind lock and bars. Yonder 
                it is<br>
                cold and wet. The rats are eating her up alive! Nobody knows of 
                it!<br>
                Nobody hears of it! Not even now, for the bell is ringing and<br>
                singing its loud Ding-dong, ding-dong!'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There was a King in those days. They called him Canute. 
                He<br>
                bowed himself before bishop and monk; but when he offended the 
                free peasants with heavy taxes and hard words, they seized their 
                weapons and put him to flight like a wild beast. He sought shelter 
                in the church, and shut gate and door behind him. The violent 
                band surrounded the church; I heard tell of it. The crows, ravens 
                and magpies started up in terror at the yelling and shouting that 
                sounded<br>
                around. They flew into the tower and out again, they looked down<br>
                upon the throng below, and they also looked into the windows of 
                the<br>
                church, and screamed out aloud what they saw there. King Canute<br>
                knelt before the altar in prayer; his brothers Eric and Benedict 
                stood<br>
                by him as a guard with drawn swords; but the King's servant, the<br>
                treacherous Blake, betrayed his master. The throng in front of 
                the<br>
                church knew where they could hit the King, and one of them flung 
                a<br>
                stone through a pane of glass, and the King lay there dead! The<br>
                cries and screams of the savage horde and of the birds sounded 
                through the air, and I joined in it also; for I sang 'Ding-dong! 
                ding-dong!' &quot;The church bell hangs high, and looks far around, 
                and sees the birds around it, and understands their language. 
                The wind roars in<br>
                upon it through windows and loopholes; and the wind knows<br>
                everything, for he gets it from the air, which encircles all things,<br>
                and the church bell understands his tongue, and rings it out into<br>
                the world, 'Ding-dong! ding-dong!'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But it was too much for me to hear and to know; I was not 
                able<br>
                any longer to ring it out. I became so tired, so heavy, that the<br>
                beam broke, and I flew out into the gleaming Au, where the water 
                is<br>
                deepest, and where the Au-mann lives, solitary and alone; and 
                year<br>
                by year I tell him what I have heard and what I know. Ding-dong!<br>
                ding-dong&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Thus it sounds complainingly out of the bell-deep in the<br>
                Odense-Au. That is what grandmother told us.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the schoolmaster says that there was not any bell that rung<br>
                down there, for that it could not do so; and that no Au-mann dwelt<br>
                yonder, for there was no Au-mann at all! And when all the other 
                church bells are sounding sweetly, he says that it is not really 
                the bells<br>
                that are sounding, but that it is the air itself which sends forth 
                the<br>
                notes; and grandmother said to us that the Bell itself said it 
                was the<br>
                air who told it to him, consequently they are agreed on that point,<br>
                and this much is sure.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Be cautious, cautious, and take good heed to thyself,&quot; 
                they<br>
                both say.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The air knows everything. It is around us, it is in us, it talks<br>
                of our thoughts and of our deeds, and it speaks longer of them 
                than<br>
                does the Bell down in the depths of the Odense-Au where the Au-mann 
                dwells. It rings it out in the vault of heaven, far, far out,<br>
                forever and ever, till the heaven bells sound &quot;Ding-dong! 
                ding-dong!&quot;</p>

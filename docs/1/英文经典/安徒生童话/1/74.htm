              <p class="h" align="center"> THE NIGHTINGALE</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> IN China, you know, the emperor is a Chinese, and all those<br>
                about him are Chinamen also. The story I am going to tell you 
                happened a great many years ago, so it is well to hear it now 
                before it is forgotten. The emperor's palace was the most beautiful 
                in the world.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was built entirely of porcelain, and very costly, but so delicate<br>
                and brittle that whoever touched it was obliged to be careful. 
                In<br>
                the garden could be seen the most singular flowers, with pretty 
                silver<br>
                bells tied to them, which tinkled so that every one who passed 
                could<br>
                not help noticing the flowers. Indeed, everything in the emperor's<br>
                garden was remarkable, and it extended so far that the gardener<br>
                himself did not know where it ended. Those who travelled beyond 
                its<br>
                limits knew that there was a noble forest, with lofty trees, sloping<br>
                down to the deep blue sea, and the great ships sailed under the 
                shadow of its branches. In one of these trees lived a nightingale, 
                who sang so beautifully that even the poor fishermen, who had 
                so many other things to do, would stop and listen. Sometimes, 
                when they went at night to spread their nets, they would hear 
                her sing, and say, &quot;Oh, is not that beautiful?&quot; But 
                when they returned to their fishing, they<br>
                forgot the bird until the next night. Then they would hear it 
                again,<br>
                and exclaim &quot;Oh, how beautiful is the nightingale's song!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Travellers from every country in the world came to the city of 
                the<br>
                emperor, which they admired very much, as well as the palace and<br>
                gardens; but when they heard the nightingale, they all declared 
                it<br>
                to be the best of all. And the travellers, on their return home,<br>
                related what they had seen; and learned men wrote books, containing<br>
                descriptions of the town, the palace, and the gardens; but they 
                did<br>
                not forget the nightingale, which was really the greatest wonder.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And those who could write poetry composed beautiful verses about 
                the nightingale, who lived in a forest near the deep sea. The 
                books<br>
                travelled all over the world, and some of them came into the hands<br>
                of the emperor; and he sat in his golden chair, and, as he read, 
                he<br>
                nodded his approval every moment, for it pleased him to find such 
                a<br>
                beautiful description of his city, his palace, and his gardens. 
                But<br>
                when he came to the words, &quot;the nightingale is the most beautiful 
                of<br>
                all,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;What is this? I know nothing of 
                any<br>
                nightingale. Is there such a bird in my empire? and even in my 
                garden?<br>
                I have never heard of it. Something, it appears, may be learnt 
                from<br>
                books.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then he called one of his lords-in-waiting, who was so<br>
                high-bred, that when any in an inferior rank to himself spoke 
                to<br>
                him, or asked him a question, he would answer, &quot;Pooh,&quot; 
                which means nothing.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There is a very wonderful bird mentioned here, called a<br>
                nightingale,&quot; said the emperor; &quot;they say it is the 
                best thing in my<br>
                large kingdom. Why have I not been told of it?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I have never heard the name,&quot; replied the cavalier; 
                &quot;she has<br>
                not been presented at court.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is my pleasure that she shall appear this evening.&quot; 
                said the<br>
                emperor; the whole world knows what I possess better than I do<br>
                myself.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I have never heard of her,&quot; said the cavalier; &quot;yet 
                I will<br>
                endeavor to find her.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But where was the nightingale to be found? The nobleman went 
                up<br>
                stairs and down, through halls and passages; yet none of those 
                whom he met had heard of the bird. So he returned to the emperor, 
                and said<br>
                that it must be a fable, invented by those who had written the 
                book.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Your imperial majesty,&quot; said he, &quot;cannot believe 
                everything contained in books; sometimes they are only fiction, 
                or what is called the black art.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But the book in which I have read this account,&quot; said 
                the<br>
                emperor, &quot;was sent to me by the great and mighty emperor 
                of Japan, and therefore it cannot contain a falsehood. I will 
                hear the<br>
                nightingale, she must be here this evening; she has my highest<br>
                favor; and if she does not come, the whole court shall be trampled<br>
                upon after supper is ended.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Tsing-pe!&quot; cried the lord-in-waiting, and again he 
                ran up and<br>
                down stairs, through all the halls and corridors; and half the 
                court<br>
                ran with him, for they did not like the idea of being trampled 
                upon.<br>
              </p>
              <p>There was a great inquiry about this wonderful nightingale, whom 
                all<br>
                the world knew, but who was unknown to the court.<br>
              </p>
              <p>At last they met with a poor little girl in the kitchen, who 
                said,<br>
                &quot;Oh, yes, I know the nightingale quite well; indeed, she 
                can sing.<br>
                Every evening I have permission to take home to my poor sick mother 
                the scraps from the table; she lives down by the sea-shore, and 
                as I come back I feel tired, and I sit down in the wood to rest, 
                and listen to the nightingale's song. Then the tears come into 
                my eyes, and it is just as if my mother kissed me.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Little maiden,&quot; said the lord-in-waiting, &quot;I 
                will obtain for<br>
                you constant employment in the kitchen, and you shall have<br>
                permission to see the emperor dine, if you will lead us to the<br>
                nightingale; for she is invited for this evening to the palace.&quot; 
                So<br>
                she went into the wood where the nightingale sang, and half the<br>
                court followed her. As they went along, a cow began lowing.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said a young courtier, &quot;now we have found 
                her; what<br>
                wonderful power for such a small creature; I have certainly heard 
                it<br>
                before.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No, that is only a cow lowing,&quot; said the little girl; 
                &quot;we are a<br>
                long way from the place yet.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then some frogs began to croak in the marsh.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Beautiful,&quot; said the young courtier again. &quot;Now 
                I hear it,<br>
                tinkling like little church bells.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No, those are frogs,&quot; said the little maiden; &quot;but 
                I think we<br>
                shall soon hear her now:&quot; and presently the nightingale began 
                to sing.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Hark, hark! there she is,&quot; said the girl, &quot;and 
                there she sits,&quot;<br>
                she added, pointing to a little gray bird who was perched on a 
                bough.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Is it possible?&quot; said the lord-in-waiting, &quot;I 
                never imagined it<br>
                would be a little, plain, simple thing like that. She has certainly<br>
                changed color at seeing so many grand people around her.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Little nightingale,&quot; cried the girl, raising her voice, 
                &quot;our most<br>
                gracious emperor wishes you to sing before him.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;With the greatest pleasure,&quot; said the nightingale, 
                and began to<br>
                sing most delightfully.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It sounds like tiny glass bells,&quot; said the lord-in-waiting,<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;and see how her little throat works. It is surprising that 
                we have<br>
                never heard this before; she will be a great success at court.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Shall I sing once more before the emperor?&quot; asked 
                the<br>
                nightingale, who thought he was present.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;My excellent little nightingale,&quot; said the courtier, 
                &quot;I have<br>
                the great pleasure of inviting you to a court festival this evening,<br>
                where you will gain imperial favor by your charming song.&quot;<br>
                &quot;My song sounds best in the green wood,&quot; said the bird; 
                but<br>
                still she came willingly when she heard the emperor's wish.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The palace was elegantly decorated for the occasion. The walls 
                and<br>
                floors of porcelain glittered in the light of a thousand lamps.<br>
                Beautiful flowers, round which little bells were tied, stood in 
                the<br>
                corridors: what with the running to and fro and the draught, these<br>
                bells tinkled so loudly that no one could speak to be heard. In 
                the<br>
                centre of the great hall, a golden perch had been fixed for the<br>
                nightingale to sit on. The whole court was present, and the little<br>
                kitchen-maid had received permission to stand by the door. She 
                was not installed as a real court cook. All were in full dress, 
                and every<br>
                eye was turned to the little gray bird when the emperor nodded 
                to<br>
                her to begin. The nightingale sang so sweetly that the tears came 
                into<br>
                the emperor's eyes, and then rolled down his cheeks, as her song<br>
                became still more touching and went to every one's heart. The<br>
                emperor was so delighted that he declared the nightingale should<br>
                have his gold slipper to wear round her neck, but she declined 
                the<br>
                honor with thanks: she had been sufficiently rewarded already. 
                &quot;I have<br>
                seen tears in an emperor's eyes,&quot; she said, &quot;that is 
                my richest<br>
                reward. An emperor's tears have wonderful power, and are quite<br>
                sufficient honor for me;&quot; and then she sang again more enchantingly<br>
                than ever.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That singing is a lovely gift;&quot; said the ladies of 
                the court to<br>
                each other; and then they took water in their mouths to make them<br>
                utter the gurgling sounds of the nightingale when they spoke to 
                any<br>
                one, so thay they might fancy themselves nightingales. And the 
                footmen and chambermaids also expressed their satisfaction, which 
                is saying a great deal, for they are very difficult to please. 
                In fact the<br>
                nightingale's visit was most successful. She was now to remain 
                at<br>
                court, to have her own cage, with liberty to go out twice a day, 
                and<br>
                once during the night. Twelve servants were appointed to attend 
                her on these occasions, who each held her by a silken string fastened 
                to<br>
                her leg. There was certainly not much pleasure in this kind of 
                flying.<br>
                The whole city spoke of the wonderful bird, and when two people<br>
                met, one said &quot;nightin,&quot; and the other said &quot;gale,&quot; 
                and they<br>
                understood what was meant, for nothing else was talked of. Eleven<br>
                peddlers' children were named after her, but not of them could 
                sing<br>
                a note.<br>
              </p>
              <p>One day the emperor received a large packet on which was written<br>
                &quot;The Nightingale.&quot; &quot;Here is no doubt a new book 
                about our celebrated bird,&quot; said the emperor. But instead 
                of a book, it was a work of art contained in a casket, an artificial 
                nightingale made to look like a living one, and covered all over 
                with diamonds, rubies, and sapphires.<br>
              </p>
              <p>As soon as the artificial bird was wound up, it could sing like 
                the<br>
                real one, and could move its tail up and down, which sparkled 
                with<br>
                silver and gold. Round its neck hung a piece of ribbon, on which 
                was<br>
                written &quot;The Emperor of China's nightingale is poor compared 
                with that of the Emperor of Japan's.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;This is very beautiful,&quot; exclaimed all who saw it, 
                and he who had<br>
                brought the artificial bird received the title of &quot;Imperial<br>
                nightingale-bringer-in-chief.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now they must sing together,&quot; said the court, &quot;and 
                what a duet it<br>
                will be.&quot; But they did not get on well, for the real nightingale<br>
                sang in its own natural way, but the artificial bird sang only<br>
                waltzes.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That is not a fault,&quot; said the music-master, &quot;it 
                is quite perfect<br>
                to my taste,&quot; so then it had to sing alone, and was as successful 
                as<br>
                the real bird; besides, it was so much prettier to look at, for 
                it<br>
                sparkled like bracelets and breast-pins. Three and thirty times 
                did it<br>
                sing the same tunes without being tired; the people would gladly<br>
                have heard it again, but the emperor said the living nightingale 
                ought<br>
                to sing something. But where was she? No one had noticed her when<br>
                she flew out at the open window, back to her own green woods.<br>
                &quot;What strange conduct,&quot; said the emperor, when her flight 
                had been<br>
                discovered; and all the courtiers blamed her, and said she was 
                a<br>
                very ungrateful creature.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But we have the best bird after all,&quot; said one, and 
                then they<br>
                would have the bird sing again, although it was the thirty-fourth 
                time<br>
                they had listened to the same piece, and even then they had not 
                learnt<br>
                it, for it was rather difficult. But the music-master praised 
                the bird<br>
                in the highest degree, and even asserted that it was better than 
                a<br>
                real nightingale, not only in its dress and the beautiful diamonds,<br>
                but also in its musical power. &quot;For you must perceive, my 
                chief lord<br>
                and emperor, that with a real nightingale we can never tell what 
                is<br>
                going to be sung, but with this bird everything is settled. It 
                can<br>
                be opened and explained, so that people may understand how the 
                waltzes are formed, and why one note follows upon another.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;This is exactly what we think,&quot; they all replied, 
                and then the<br>
                music-master received permission to exhibit the bird to the people<br>
                on the following Sunday, and the emperor commanded that they should 
                be present to hear it sing. When they heard it they were like 
                people intoxicated; however it must have been with drinking tea, 
                which is quite a Chinese custom. They all said &quot;Oh!&quot; 
                and held up their forefingers and nodded, but a poor fisherman, 
                who had heard the real nightingale, said, &quot;it sounds prettily 
                enough, and the melodies are all alike; yet there seems something 
                wanting, I cannot exactly tell<br>
                what.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And after this the real nightingale was banished from the<br>
                empire, and the artificial bird placed on a silk cushion close 
                to<br>
                the emperor's bed. The presents of gold and precious stones which<br>
                had been received with it were round the bird, and it was now 
                advanced to the title of &quot;Little Imperial Toilet Singer,&quot; 
                and to the rank of No. 1 on the left hand; for the emperor considered 
                the left side, on<br>
                which the heart lies, as the most noble, and the heart of an emperor<br>
                is in the same place as that of other people.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The music-master wrote a work, in twenty-five volumes, about 
                the<br>
                artificial bird, which was very learned and very long, and full 
                of the<br>
                most difficult Chinese words; yet all the people said they had 
                read<br>
                it, and understood it, for fear of being thought stupid and having<br>
                their bodies trampled upon.<br>
              </p>
              <p>So a year passed, and the emperor, the court, and all the other<br>
                Chinese knew every little turn in the artificial bird's song; 
                and<br>
                for that same reason it pleased them better. They could sing with<br>
                the bird, which they often did. The street-boys sang, &quot;Zi-zi-zi,<br>
                cluck, cluck, cluck,&quot; and the emperor himself could sing 
                it also. It<br>
                was really most amusing.<br>
              </p>
              <p>One evening, when the artificial bird was singing its best, and<br>
                the emperor lay in bed listening to it, something inside the bird<br>
                sounded &quot;whizz.&quot; Then a spring cracked. &quot;Whir-r-r-r&quot; 
                went all the<br>
                wheels, running round, and then the music stopped. The emperor<br>
                immediately sprang out of bed, and called for his physician; but<br>
                what could he do? Then they sent for a watchmaker; and, after 
                a<br>
                great deal of talking and examination, the bird was put into something<br>
                like order; but he said that it must be used very carefully, as 
                the<br>
                barrels were worn, and it would be impossible to put in new ones<br>
                without injuring the music. Now there was great sorrow, as the 
                bird<br>
                could only be allowed to play once a year; and even that was dangerous 
                for the works inside it. Then the music-master made a little speech, 
                full of hard words, and declared that the bird was as good as 
                ever; and, of course no one contradicted him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Five years passed, and then a real grief came upon the land. 
                The<br>
                Chinese really were fond of their emperor, and he now lay so ill<br>
                that he was not expected to live. Already a new emperor had been<br>
                chosen and the people who stood in the street asked the<br>
                lord-in-waiting how the old emperor was; but he only said, &quot;Pooh!&quot; 
                and shook his head.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Cold and pale lay the emperor in his royal bed; the whole court<br>
                thought he was dead, and every one ran away to pay homage to his<br>
                successor. The chamberlains went out to have a talk on the matter, 
                and the ladies'-maids invited company to take coffee. Cloth had 
                been<br>
                laid down on the halls and passages, so that not a footstep should<br>
                be heard, and all was silent and still. But the emperor was not 
                yet<br>
                dead, although he lay white and stiff on his gorgeous bed, with 
                the<br>
                long velvet curtains and heavy gold tassels. A window stood open,<br>
                and the moon shone in upon the emperor and the artificial bird. 
                The<br>
                poor emperor, finding he could scarcely breathe with a strange<br>
                weight on his chest, opened his eyes, and saw Death sitting there.<br>
                He had put on the emperor's golden crown, and held in one hand 
                his<br>
                sword of state, and in the other his beautiful banner. All around<br>
                the bed and peeping through the long velvet curtains, were a number 
                of strange heads, some very ugly, and others lovely and gentle-looking.<br>
              </p>
              <p>These were the emperor's good and bad deeds, which stared him 
                in the face now Death sat at his heart.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Do you remember this?&quot; &quot;Do you recollect that?&quot; 
                they asked one<br>
                after another, thus bringing to his remembrance circumstances 
                that<br>
                made the perspiration stand on his brow.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I know nothing about it,&quot; said the emperor. &quot;Music! 
                music!&quot; he<br>
                cried; &quot;the large Chinese drum! that I may not hear what 
                they say.&quot;<br>
                But they still went on, and Death nodded like a Chinaman to all 
                they<br>
                said. &quot;Music! music!&quot; shouted the emperor. &quot;You 
                little precious golden bird, sing, pray sing! I have given you 
                gold and costly presens; I have even hung my golden slipper round 
                your neck. Sing! sing!&quot; But the bird remained silent. There 
                was no one to wind it up, and therefore it could not sing a note.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Death continued to stare at the emperor with his cold, hollow<br>
                eyes, and the room was fearfully still. Suddenly there came through<br>
                the open window the sound of sweet music. Outside, on the bough 
                of a tree, sat the living nightingale. She had heard of the emperor's<br>
                illness, and was therefore come to sing to him of hope and trust.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And as she sung, the shadows grew paler and paler; the blood 
                in the<br>
                emperor's veins flowed more rapidly, and gave life to his weak<br>
                limbs; and even Death himself listened, and said, &quot;Go on, 
                little<br>
                nightingale, go on.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Then will you give me the beautiful golden sword and that 
                rich<br>
                banner? and will you give me the emperor's crown?&quot; said the 
                bird.<br>
                So Death gave up each of these treasures for a song; and the<br>
                nightingale continued her singing. She sung of the quiet churchyard,<br>
                where the white roses grow, where the elder-tree wafts its perfume<br>
                on the breeze, and the fresh, sweet grass is moistened by the<br>
                mourners' tears. Then Death longed to go and see his garden, and<br>
                floated out through the window in the form of a cold, white mist.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Thanks, thanks, you heavenly little bird. I know you well. 
                I<br>
                banished you from my kingdom once, and yet you have charmed away 
                the evil faces from my bed, and banished Death from my heart, 
                with your sweet song. How can I reward you?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You have already rewarded me,&quot; said the nightingale. 
                &quot;I shall<br>
                never forget that I drew tears from your eyes the first time I 
                sang to<br>
                you. These are the jewels that rejoice a singer's heart. But now<br>
                sleep, and grow strong and well again. I will sing to you again.&quot;<br>
                And as she sung, the emperor fell into a sweet sleep; and how 
                mild<br>
                and refreshing that slumber was! When he awoke, strengthened and<br>
                restored, the sun shone brightly through the window; but not one 
                of<br>
                his servants had returned- they all believed he was dead; only 
                the<br>
                nightingale still sat beside him, and sang.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You must always remain with me,&quot; said the emperor. 
                &quot;You shall<br>
                sing only when it pleases you; and I will break the artificial 
                bird<br>
                into a thousand pieces.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No; do not do that,&quot; replied the nightingale; &quot;the 
                bird did<br>
                very well as long as it could. Keep it here still. I cannot live 
                in<br>
                the palace, and build my nest; but let me come when I like. I 
                will sit<br>
                on a bough outside your window, in the evening, and sing to you, 
                so<br>
                that you may be happy, and have thoughts full of joy. I will sing 
                to<br>
                you of those who are happy, and those who suffer; of the good 
                and<br>
                the evil, who are hidden around you. The little singing bird flies 
                far<br>
                from you and your court to the home of the fisherman and the peasant's 
                cot. I love your heart better than your crown; and yet something 
                holy lingers round that also. I will come, I will sing to you; 
                but you must promise me one thing.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Everything,&quot; said the emperor, who, having dressed 
                himself in his<br>
                imperial robes, stood with the hand that held the heavy golden 
                sword<br>
                pressed to his heart.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I only ask one thing,&quot; she replied; &quot;let no one 
                know that you<br>
                have a little bird who tells you everything. It will be best to<br>
                conceal it.&quot; So saying, the nightingale flew away.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The servants now came in to look after the dead emperor; when, 
                lo!<br>
                there he stood, and, to their astonishment, said, &quot;Good morning.&quot;</p>

              <p class="h" align="center"> LITTLE TINY OR THUMBELINA</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THERE was once a woman who wished very much to have a little<br>
                child, but she could not obtain her wish. At last she went to 
                a fairy,<br>
                and said, &quot;I should so very much like to have a little child; 
                can<br>
                you tell me where I can find one?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, that can be easily managed,&quot; said the fairy. &quot;Here 
                is a<br>
                barleycorn of a different kind to those which grow in the farmer's<br>
                fields, and which the chickens eat; put it into a flower-pot, 
                and<br>
                see what will happen.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said the woman, and she gave the fairy 
                twelve<br>
                shillings, which was the price of the barleycorn. Then she went 
                home<br>
                and planted it, and immediately there grew up a large handsome 
                flower, something like a tulip in appearance, but with its leaves 
                tightly<br>
                closed as if it were still a bud. &quot;It is a beautiful flower,&quot; 
                said the<br>
                woman, and she kissed the red and golden-colored leaves, and while 
                she did so the flower opened, and she could see that it was a 
                real<br>
                tulip. Within the flower, upon the green velvet stamens, sat a 
                very<br>
                delicate and graceful little maiden. She was scarcely half as 
                long<br>
                as a thumb, and they gave her the name of &quot;Thumbelina,&quot; 
                or Tiny,<br>
                because she was so small. A walnut-shell, elegantly polished, 
                served<br>
                her for a cradle; her bed was formed of blue violet-leaves, with 
                a<br>
                rose-leaf for a counterpane. Here she slept at night, but during 
                the<br>
                day she amused herself on a table, where the woman had placed 
                a<br>
                plateful of water. Round this plate were wreaths of flowers with 
                their<br>
                stems in the water, and upon it floated a large tulip-leaf, which<br>
                served Tiny for a boat. Here the little maiden sat and rowed herself<br>
                from side to side, with two oars made of white horse-hair. It 
                really<br>
                was a very pretty sight. Tiny could, also, sing so softly and<br>
                sweetly that nothing like her singing had ever before been heard.<br>
                One night, while she lay in her pretty bed, a large, ugly, wet 
                toad<br>
                crept through a broken pane of glass in the window, and leaped 
                right<br>
                upon the table where Tiny lay sleeping under her rose-leaf quilt.<br>
                &quot;What a pretty little wife this would make for my son, said 
                the<br>
                toad, and she took up the walnut-shell in which little Tiny lay<br>
                asleep, and jumped through the window with it into the garden.<br>
                In the swampy margin of a broad stream in the garden lived the<br>
                toad, with her son. He was uglier even than his mother, and when 
                he<br>
                saw the pretty little maiden in her elegant bed, he could only 
                cry,<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Croak, croak, croak.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Don't speak so loud, or she will wake,&quot; said the toad, 
                &quot;and<br>
                then she might run away, for she is as light as swan's down. We 
                will<br>
                place her on one of the water-lily leaves out in the stream; it 
                will<br>
                be like an island to her, she is so light and small, and then 
                she<br>
                cannot escape; and, while she is away, we will make haste and<br>
                prepare the state-room under the marsh, in which you are to live<br>
                when you are married.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Far out in the stream grew a number of water-lilies, with broad<br>
                green leaves, which seemed to float on the top of the water. The<br>
                largest of these leaves appeared farther off than the rest, and 
                the<br>
                old toad swam out to it with the walnut-shell, in which little 
                Tiny<br>
                lay still asleep. The tiny little creature woke very early in 
                the<br>
                morning, and began to cry bitterly when she found where she was, 
                for<br>
                she could see nothing but water on every side of the large green 
                leaf,<br>
                and no way of reaching the land. Meanwhile the old toad was very<br>
                busy under the marsh, decking her room with rushes and wild yellow<br>
                flowers, to make it look pretty for her new daughter-in-law. Then<br>
                she swam out with her ugly son to the leaf on which she had placed<br>
                poor little Tiny. She wanted to fetch the pretty bed, that she 
                might<br>
                put it in the bridal chamber to be ready for her. The old toad 
                bowed<br>
                low to her in the water, and said, &quot;Here is my son, he will 
                be your<br>
                husband, and you will live happily in the marsh by the stream.&quot;<br>
                &quot;Croak, croak, croak,&quot; was all her son could say for 
                himself; so<br>
                the toad took up the elegant little bed, and swam away with it,<br>
                leaving Tiny all alone on the green leaf, where she sat and wept.<br>
                She could not bear to think of living with the old toad, and having<br>
                her ugly son for a husband. The little fishes, who swam about 
                in the<br>
                water beneath, had seen the toad, and heard what she said, so 
                they<br>
                lifted their heads above the water to look at the little maiden. 
                As<br>
                soon as they caught sight of her, they saw she was very pretty, 
                and it<br>
                made them very sorry to think that she must go and live with the<br>
                ugly toads. &quot;No, it must never be!&quot; so they assembled 
                together in<br>
                the water, round the green stalk which held the leaf on which 
                the<br>
                little maiden stood, and gnawed it away at the root with their<br>
                teeth. Then the leaf floated down the stream, carrying Tiny far 
                away<br>
                out of reach of land.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Tiny sailed past many towns, and the little birds in the bushes<br>
                saw her, and sang, &quot;What a lovely little creature;&quot; 
                so the leaf swam<br>
                away with her farther and farther, till it brought her to other 
                lands.<br>
              </p>
              <p>A graceful little white butterfly constantly fluttered round 
                her,<br>
                and at last alighted on the leaf. Tiny pleased him, and she was 
                glad<br>
                of it, for now the toad could not possibly reach her, and the<br>
                country through which she sailed was beautiful, and the sun shone 
                upon the water, till it glittered like liquid gold. She took off 
                her girdle<br>
                and tied one end of it round the butterfly, and the other end 
                of the<br>
                ribbon she fastened to the leaf, which now glided on much faster<br>
                than ever, taking little Tiny with it as she stood. Presently 
                a<br>
                large cockchafer flew by; the moment he caught sight of her, he 
                seized her round her delicate waist with his claws, and flew with 
                her into a tree. The green leaf floated away on the brook, and 
                the butterfly<br>
                flew with it, for he was fastened to it, and could not get away.<br>
                Oh, how frightened little Tiny felt when the cockchafer flew<br>
                with her to the tree! But especially was she sorry for the beautiful<br>
                white butterfly which she had fastened to the leaf, for if he 
                could<br>
                not free himself he would die of hunger. But the cockchafer did 
                not<br>
                trouble himself at all about the matter. He seated himself by 
                her side<br>
                on a large green leaf, gave her some honey from the flowers to 
                eat,<br>
                and told her she was very pretty, though not in the least like 
                a<br>
                cockchafer. After a time, all the cockchafers turned up their 
                feelers,<br>
                and said, &quot;She has only two legs! how ugly that looks.&quot; 
                &quot;She has no<br>
                feelers,&quot; said another. &quot;Her waist is quite slim. Pooh! 
                she is like<br>
                a human being.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh! she is ugly,&quot; said all the lady cockchafers, although 
                Tiny<br>
                was very pretty. Then the cockchafer who had run away with her,<br>
                believed all the others when they said she was ugly, and would 
                have<br>
                nothing more to say to her, and told her she might go where she 
                liked.<br>
                Then he flew down with her from the tree, and placed her on a 
                daisy,<br>
                and she wept at the thought that she was so ugly that even the<br>
                cockchafers would have nothing to say to her. And all the while 
                she<br>
                was really the loveliest creature that one could imagine, and 
                as<br>
                tender and delicate as a beautiful rose-leaf. During the whole<br>
                summer poor little Tiny lived quite alone in the wide forest. 
                She wove<br>
                herself a bed with blades of grass, and hung it up under a broad 
                leaf,<br>
                to protect herself from the rain. She sucked the honey from the<br>
                flowers for food, and drank the dew from their leaves every morning.<br>
                So passed away the summer and the autumn, and then came the winter,- 
                the long, cold winter. All the birds who had sung to her so sweetly 
                were flown away, and the trees and the flowers had withered. </p>
              <p>The large clover leaf under the shelter of which she had lived, 
                was now rolled together and shrivelled up, nothing remained but 
                a yellow withered stalk. She felt dreadfully cold, for her clothes 
                were torn, and she was herself so frail and delicate, that poor 
                little Tiny was nearly<br>
                frozen to death. It began to snow too; and the snow-flakes, as 
                they<br>
                fell upon her, were like a whole shovelful falling upon one of 
                us, for<br>
                we are tall, but she was only an inch high. Then she wrapped herself<br>
                up in a dry leaf, but it cracked in the middle and could not keep<br>
                her warm, and she shivered with cold. Near the wood in which she 
                had been living lay a corn-field, but the corn had been cut a 
                long time;<br>
                nothing remained but the bare dry stubble standing up out of the<br>
                frozen ground. It was to her like struggling through a large wood. 
                Oh!<br>
                how she shivered with the cold. She came at last to the door of 
                a<br>
                field-mouse, who had a little den under the corn-stubble. There<br>
                dwelt the field-mouse in warmth and comfort, with a whole roomful 
                of corn, a kitchen, and a beautiful dining room. Poor little Tiny 
                stood<br>
                before the door just like a little beggar-girl, and begged for 
                a small<br>
                piece of barley-corn, for she had been without a morsel to eat 
                for two<br>
                days.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You poor little creature,&quot; said the field-mouse, who 
                was really a<br>
                good old field-mouse, &quot;come into my warm room and dine with 
                me.&quot; She was very pleased with Tiny, so she said, &quot;You 
                are quite welcome to stay with me all the winter, if you like; 
                but you must keep my rooms clean and neat, and tell me stories, 
                for I shall like to hear them<br>
                very much.&quot; And Tiny did all the field-mouse asked her, and 
                found<br>
                herself very comfortable.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We shall have a visitor soon,&quot; said the field-mouse 
                one day;<br>
                &quot;my neighbor pays me a visit once a week. He is better off 
                than I<br>
                am; he has large rooms, and wears a beautiful black velvet coat. 
                If<br>
                you could only have him for a husband, you would be well provided<br>
                for indeed. But he is blind, so you must tell him some of your<br>
                prettiest stories.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But Tiny did not feel at all interested about this neighbor, 
                for<br>
                he was a mole. However, he came and paid his visit dressed in 
                his<br>
                black velvet coat.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;He is very rich and learned, and his house is twenty times 
                larger<br>
                than mine,&quot; said the field-mouse.<br>
              </p>
              <p>He was rich and learned, no doubt, but he always spoke slightingly<br>
                of the sun and the pretty flowers, because he had never seen them.<br>
                Tiny was obliged to sing to him, &quot;Lady-bird, lady-bird, fly 
                away<br>
                home,&quot; and many other pretty songs. And the mole fell in 
                love with her because she had such a sweet voice; but he said 
                nothing yet, for he was very cautious. A short time before, the 
                mole had dug a long<br>
                passage under the earth, which led from the dwelling of the<br>
                field-mouse to his own, and here she had permission to walk with<br>
                Tiny whenever she liked. But he warned them not to be alarmed 
                at the<br>
                sight of a dead bird which lay in the passage. It was a perfect<br>
                bird, with a beak and feathers, and could not have been dead long, 
                and was lying just where the mole had made his passage. The mole 
                took a piece of phosphorescent wood in his mouth, and it glittered 
                like fire in the dark; then he went before them to light them 
                through the<br>
                long, dark passage. When they came to the spot where lay the dead<br>
                bird, the mole pushed his broad nose through the ceiling, the 
                earth<br>
                gave way, so that there was a large hole, and the daylight shone<br>
                into the passage. In the middle of the floor lay a dead swallow, 
                his<br>
                beautiful wings pulled close to his sides, his feet and his head 
                drawn<br>
                up under his feathers; the poor bird had evidently died of the 
                cold.<br>
                It made little Tiny very sad to see it, she did so love the little<br>
                birds; all the summer they had sung and twittered for her so<br>
                beautifully. But the mole pushed it aside with his crooked legs, 
                and<br>
                said, &quot;He will sing no more now. How miserable it must be 
                to be born a little bird! I am thankful that none of my children 
                will ever be<br>
                birds, for they can do nothing but cry, 'Tweet, tweet,' and always 
                die<br>
                of hunger in the winter.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, you may well say that, as a clever man!&quot; exclaimed 
                the<br>
                field-mouse, &quot;What is the use of his twittering, for when 
                winter comes<br>
                he must either starve or be frozen to death. Still birds are very 
                high<br>
                bred.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Tiny said nothing; but when the two others had turned their<br>
                backs on the bird, she stooped down and stroked aside the soft<br>
                feathers which covered the head, and kissed the closed eyelids.<br>
                &quot;Perhaps this was the one who sang to me so sweetly in the 
                summer,&quot;<br>
                she said; &quot;and how much pleasure it gave me, you dear, pretty 
                bird.&quot;<br>
                The mole now stopped up the hole through which the daylight shone,<br>
                and then accompanied the lady home. But during the night Tiny 
                could<br>
                not sleep; so she got out of bed and wove a large, beautiful carpet 
                of<br>
                hay; then she carried it to the dead bird, and spread it over 
                him;<br>
                with some down from the flowers which she had found in the<br>
                field-mouse's room. It was as soft as wool, and she spread some 
                of<br>
                it on each side of the bird, so that he might lie warmly in the 
                cold<br>
                earth. &quot;Farewell, you pretty little bird,&quot; said she, 
                &quot;farewell;<br>
                thank you for your delightful singing during the summer, when 
                all<br>
                the trees were green, and the warm sun shone upon us. Then she 
                laid<br>
                her head on the bird's breast, but she was alarmed immediately, 
                for it<br>
                seemed as if something inside the bird went &quot;thump, thump.&quot; 
                It was the bird's heart; he was not really dead, only benumbed 
                with the cold, and the warmth had restored him to life. In autumn, 
                all the swallows fly away into warm countries, but if one happens 
                to linger, the cold<br>
                seizes it, it becomes frozen, and falls down as if dead; it remains<br>
                where it fell, and the cold snow covers it. Tiny trembled very 
                much;<br>
                she was quite frightened, for the bird was large, a great deal<br>
                larger than herself,- she was only an inch high. But she took 
                courage,<br>
                laid the wool more thickly over the poor swallow, and then took 
                a leaf<br>
                which she had used for her own counterpane, and laid it over the<br>
                head of the poor bird. The next morning she again stole out to 
                see<br>
                him. He was alive but very weak; he could only open his eyes for 
                a<br>
                moment to look at Tiny, who stood by holding a piece of decayed 
                wood in her hand, for she had no other lantern. &quot;Thank you, 
                pretty little maiden,&quot; said the sick swallow; &quot;I have 
                been so nicely warmed, that I shall soon regain my strength, and 
                be able to fly about again in the warm sunshine.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said she, &quot;it is cold out of doors now; 
                it snows and<br>
                freezes. Stay in your warm bed; I will take care of you.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then she brought the swallow some water in a flower-leaf, and<br>
                after he had drank, he told her that he had wounded one of his 
                wings<br>
                in a thorn-bush, and could not fly as fast as the others, who 
                were<br>
                soon far away on their journey to warm countries. Then at last 
                he<br>
                had fallen to the earth, and could remember no more, nor how he 
                came to be where she had found him. The whole winter the swallow 
                remained underground, and Tiny nursed him with care and love. 
              </p>
              <p>Neither the mole nor the field-mouse knew anything about it, 
                for they did not like swallows. Very soon the spring time came, 
                and the sun warmed the earth. Then the swallow bade farewell to 
                Tiny, and she opened the hole in the ceiling which the mole had 
                made. The sun shone in upon them so beautifully, that the swallow 
                asked her if she would go with him; she could sit on his back, 
                he said, and he would fly away with her into the green woods. 
                But Tiny knew it would make the field-mouse very grieved if she 
                left her in that manner, so she said, &quot;No, I cannot.&quot; 
                &quot;Farewell, then, farewell, you good, pretty little maiden,&quot; 
                said the swallow; and he flew out into the sunshine.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Tiny looked after him, and the tears rose in her eyes. She was<br>
                very fond of the poor swallow.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Tweet, tweet,&quot; sang the bird, as he flew out into 
                the green<br>
                woods, and Tiny felt very sad. She was not allowed to go out into<br>
                the warm sunshine. The corn which had been sown in the field over<br>
                the house of the field-mouse had grown up high into the air, and<br>
                formed a thick wood to Tiny, who was only an inch in height.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You are going to be married, Tiny,&quot; said the field-mouse. 
                &quot;My<br>
                neighbor has asked for you. What good fortune for a poor child 
                like<br>
                you. Now we will prepare your wedding clothes. They must be both<br>
                woollen and linen. Nothing must be wanting when you are the mole's<br>
                wife.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Tiny had to turn the spindle, and the field-mouse hired four<br>
                spiders, who were to weave day and night. Every evening the mole<br>
                visited her, and was continually speaking of the time when the<br>
                summer would be over. Then he would keep his wedding-day with 
                Tiny; but now the heat of the sun was so great that it burned 
                the earth, and made it quite hard, like a stone. As soon, as the 
                summer was over, the wedding should take place. But Tiny was not 
                at all pleased; for she did not like the tiresome mole. Every 
                morning when the sun rose, and every evening when it went down, 
                she would creep out at the door, and as the wind blew aside the 
                ears of corn, so that she could see the blue sky, she thought 
                how beautiful and bright it seemed out there, and wished so much 
                to see her dear swallow again. But he never returned; for by this 
                time he had flown far away into the lovely green forest.<br>
              </p>
              <p>When autumn arrived, Tiny had her outfit quite ready; and the<br>
                field-mouse said to her, &quot;In four weeks the wedding must 
                take place.&quot;<br>
                Then Tiny wept, and said she would not marry the disagreeable<br>
                mole.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Nonsense,&quot; replied the field-mouse. &quot;Now don't 
                be obstinate, or I<br>
                shall bite you with my white teeth. He is a very handsome mole; 
                the<br>
                queen herself does not wear more beautiful velvets and furs. His<br>
                kitchen and cellars are quite full. You ought to be very thankful<br>
                for such good fortune.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>So the wedding-day was fixed, on which the mole was to fetch<br>
                Tiny away to live with him, deep under the earth, and never again 
                to<br>
                see the warm sun, because he did not like it. The poor child was<br>
                very unhappy at the thought of saying farewell to the beautiful 
                sun,<br>
                and as the field-mouse had given her permission to stand at the<br>
                door, she went to look at it once more.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Farewell bright sun,&quot; she cried, stretching out her 
                arm towards<br>
                it; and then she walked a short distance from the house; for the<br>
                corn had been cut, and only the dry stubble remained in the fields.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Farewell, farewell,&quot; she repeated, twining her arm 
                round a little red<br>
                flower that grew just by her side. &quot;Greet the little swallow 
                from<br>
                me, if you should see him again.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Tweet, tweet,&quot; sounded over her head suddenly. She 
                looked up, and<br>
                there was the swallow himself flying close by. As soon as he spied<br>
                Tiny, he was delighted; and then she told him how unwilling she 
                felt<br>
                to marry the ugly mole, and to live always beneath the earth, 
                and<br>
                never to see the bright sun any more. And as she told him she 
                wept.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Cold winter is coming,&quot; said the swallow, &quot;and 
                I am going to<br>
                fly away into warmer countries. Will you go with me? You can sit 
                on my back, and fasten yourself on with your sash. Then we can 
                fly away from the ugly mole and his gloomy rooms,- far away, over 
                the mountains, into warmer countries, where the sun shines more 
                brightly- than here; where it is always summer, and the flowers 
                bloom in greater beauty. Fly now with me, dear little Tiny; you 
                saved my life when I lay frozen in that dark passage.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, I will go with you,&quot; said Tiny; and she seated 
                herself on<br>
                the bird's back, with her feet on his outstretched wings, and 
                tied her<br>
                girdle to one of his strongest feathers.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the swallow rose in the air, and flew over forest and over<br>
                sea, high above the highest mountains, covered with eternal snow. 
                Tiny would have been frozen in the cold air, but she crept under 
                the bird's warm feathers, keeping her little head uncovered, so 
                that she might admire the beautiful lands over which they passed. 
                At length they reached the warm countries, where the sun shines 
                brightly, and the sky seems so much higher above the earth. Here, 
                on the hedges, and by the wayside, grew purple, green, and white 
                grapes; lemons and oranges hung from trees in the woods; and the 
                air was fragrant with myrtles and orange blossoms. Beautiful children 
                ran along the<br>
                country lanes, playing with large gay butterflies; and as the<br>
                swallow flew farther and farther, every place appeared still more<br>
                lovely.<br>
              </p>
              <p>At last they came to a blue lake, and by the side of it, shaded 
                by<br>
                trees of the deepest green, stood a palace of dazzling white marble,<br>
                built in the olden times. Vines clustered round its lofty pillars, 
                and<br>
                at the top were many swallows' nests, and one of these was the 
                home of the swallow who carried Tiny.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;This is my house,&quot; said the swallow; &quot;but it 
                would not do for you<br>
                to live there- you would not be comfortable. You must choose for<br>
                yourself one of those lovely flowers, and I will put you down 
                upon it,<br>
                and then you shall have everything that you can wish to make you<br>
                happy.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That will be delightful,&quot; she said, and clapped her 
                little hands for joy.<br>
              </p>
              <p>A large marble pillar lay on the ground, which, in falling, had<br>
                been broken into three pieces. Between these pieces grew the most<br>
                beautiful large white flowers; so the swallow flew down with Tiny, 
                and placed her on one of the broad leaves. But how surprised she 
                was to see in the middle of the flower, a tiny little man, as 
                white and<br>
                transparent as if he had been made of crystal! He had a gold crown<br>
                on his head, and delicate wings at his shoulders, and was not 
                much<br>
                larger than Tiny herself. He was the angel of the flower; for 
                a tiny<br>
                man and a tiny woman dwell in every flower; and this was the king 
                of<br>
                them all.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, how beautiful he is!&quot; whispered Tiny to the swallow.<br>
                The little prince was at first quite frightened at the bird, who<br>
                was like a giant, compared to such a delicate little creature 
                as<br>
                himself; but when he saw Tiny, he was delighted, and thought her 
                the<br>
                prettiest little maiden he had ever seen. He took the gold crown<br>
                from his head, and placed it on hers, and asked her name, and 
                if she<br>
                would be his wife, and queen over all the flowers.<br>
              </p>
              <p>This certainly was a very different sort of husband to the son<br>
                of a toad, or the mole, with my black velvet and fur; so she said,<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; to the handsome prince. Then all the flowers 
                opened, and out of each came a little lady or a tiny lord, all 
                so pretty it was quite a<br>
                pleasure to look at them. Each of them brought Tiny a present; 
                but the best gift was a pair of beautiful wings, which had belonged 
                to a large white fly and they fastened them to Tiny's shoulders, 
                so that she<br>
                might fly from flower to flower. Then there was much rejoicing, 
                and<br>
                the little swallow who sat above them, in his nest, was asked 
                to<br>
                sing a wedding song, which he did as well as he could; but in 
                his<br>
                heart he felt sad for he was very fond of Tiny, and would have 
                liked<br>
                never to part from her again.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You must not be called Tiny any more,&quot; said the spirit 
                of the<br>
                flowers to her. &quot;It is an ugly name, and you are so very 
                pretty. We<br>
                will call you Maia.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Farewell, farewell,&quot; said the swallow, with a heavy 
                heart as he<br>
                left the warm countries to fly back into Denmark. There he had 
                a<br>
                nest over the window of a house in which dwelt the writer of fairy<br>
                tales. The swallow sang, &quot;Tweet, tweet,&quot; and from his 
                song came the<br>
                whole story.</p>

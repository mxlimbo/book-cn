              <p class="h" align="center"> THE STORKS</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> ON the last house in a little village the storks had built a 
                nest,<br>
                and the mother stork sat in it with her four young ones, who stretched<br>
                out their necks and pointed their black beaks, which had not yet<br>
                turned red like those of the parent birds. A little way off, on 
                the<br>
                edge of the roof, stood the father stork, quite upright and stiff; 
                not<br>
                liking to be quite idle, he drew up one leg, and stood on the 
                other,<br>
                so still that it seemed almost as if he were carved in wood. &quot;It<br>
                must look very grand,&quot; thought he, &quot;for my wife to have 
                a sentry<br>
                guarding her nest. They do not know that I am her husband; they 
                will<br>
                think I have been commanded to stand here, which is quite<br>
                aristocratic;&quot; and so he continued standing on one leg.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the street below were a number of children at play, and when<br>
                they caught sight of the storks, one of the boldest amongst the 
                boys<br>
                began to sing a song about them, and very soon he was joined by 
                the<br>
                rest. These are the words of the song, but each only sang what 
                he<br>
                could remember of them in his own way.</p>
              <p> &quot;Stork, stork, fly away,<br>
                Stand not on one leg, I pray,<br>
                See your wife is in her nest,<br>
                With her little ones at rest.<br>
                They will hang one,<br>
                And fry another;<br>
                They will shoot a third,<br>
                And roast his brother.&quot;</p>
              <p> &quot;Just hear what those boys are singing,&quot; said the 
                young storks;<br>
                &quot;they say we shall be hanged and roasted.&quot;<br>
                &quot;Never mind what they say; you need not listen,&quot; said 
                the<br>
                mother. &quot;They can do no harm.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the boys went on singing and pointing at the storks, and<br>
                mocking at them, excepting one of the boys whose name was Peter; 
                he said it was a shame to make fun of animals, and would not join 
                with them at all. The mother stork comforted her young ones, and 
                told them not to mind. &quot;See,&quot; she said, &quot;How quiet 
                your father stands, although he is only on one leg.&quot;<br>
                &quot;But we are very much frightened,&quot; said the young storks, 
                and they<br>
                drew back their heads into the nests.<br>
                The next day when the children were playing together, and saw<br>
                the storks, they sang the song again-</p>
              <p> &quot;They will hang one,<br>
                And roast another.&quot;</p>
              <p> &quot;Shall we be hanged and roasted?&quot; asked the young 
                storks.<br>
                &quot;No, certainly not,&quot; said the mother. &quot;I will teach 
                you to fly,<br>
                and when you have learnt, we will fly into the meadows, and pay 
                a<br>
                visit to the frogs, who will bow themselves to us in the water, 
                and<br>
                cry 'Croak, croak,' and then we shall eat them up; that will be 
                fun.&quot;<br>
                &quot;And what next?&quot; asked the young storks.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Then,&quot; replied the mother, &quot;all the storks in 
                the country will<br>
                assemble together, and go through their autumn manoeuvres, so 
                that<br>
                it is very important for every one to know how to fly properly. 
                If<br>
                they do not, the general will thrust them through with his beak, 
                and<br>
                kill them. Therefore you must take pains and learn, so as to be<br>
                ready when the drilling begins.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Then we may be killed after all, as the boys say; and hark!<br>
                they are singing again.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Listen to me, and not to them,&quot; said the mother stork. 
                &quot;After the<br>
                great review is over, we shall fly away to warm countries far 
                from<br>
                hence, where there are mountains and forests. To Egypt, where 
                we shall see three-cornered houses built of stone, with pointed 
                tops that reach nearly to the clouds. They are called Pyramids, 
                and are older than a stork could imagine; and in that country, 
                there is a river that<br>
                overflows its banks, and then goes back, leaving nothing but mire;<br>
                there we can walk about, and eat frogs in abundance.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, o- h!&quot; cried the young storks.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, it is a delightful place; there is nothing to do all 
                day<br>
                long but eat, and while we are so well off out there, in this<br>
                country there will not be a single green leaf on the trees, and 
                the<br>
                weather will be so cold that the clouds will freeze, and fall 
                on the<br>
                earth in little white rags.&quot; The stork meant snow, but she 
                could not<br>
                explain it in any other way.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Will the naughty boys freeze and fall in pieces?&quot; 
                asked the young<br>
                storks.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No, they will not freeze and fall into pieces,&quot; said 
                the<br>
                mother, &quot;but they will be very cold, and be obliged to sit 
                all day<br>
                in a dark, gloomy room, while we shall be flying about in foreign<br>
                lands, where there are blooming flowers and warm sunshine.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Time passed on, and the young storks grew so large that they 
                could<br>
                stand upright in the nest and look about them. The father brought<br>
                them, every day, beautiful frogs, little snakes, and all kinds 
                of<br>
                stork-dainties that he could find. And then, how funny it was 
                to see<br>
                the tricks he would perform to amuse them. He would lay his head 
                quite round over his tail, and clatter with his beak, as if it 
                had been a<br>
                rattle; and then he would tell them stories all about the marshes<br>
                and fens.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Come,&quot; said the mother one day, &quot;Now you must 
                learn to fly.&quot;<br>
                And all the four young ones were obliged to come out on the top 
                of the roof. Oh, how they tottered at first, and were obliged 
                to balance<br>
                themselves with their wings, or they would have fallen to the 
                ground<br>
                below.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Look at me,&quot; said the mother, &quot;you must hold 
                your heads in this<br>
                way, and place your feet so. Once, twice, once, twice- that is 
                it. Now<br>
                you will be able to take care of yourselves in the world.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then she flew a little distance from them, and the young ones 
                made<br>
                a spring to follow her; but down they fell plump, for their bodies<br>
                were still too heavy.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I don't want to fly,&quot; said one of the young storks, 
                creeping back<br>
                into the nest. &quot;I don't care about going to warm countries.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Would you like to stay here and freeze when the winter 
                comes?&quot;<br>
                said the mother, &quot;or till the boys comes to hang you, or 
                to roast<br>
                you?- Well then, I'll call them.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh no, no,&quot; said the young stork, jumping out on the 
                roof with<br>
                the others; and now they were all attentive, and by the third 
                day<br>
                could fly a little. Then they began to fancy they could soar, 
                so<br>
                they tried to do so, resting on their wings, but they soon found<br>
                themselves falling, and had to flap their wings as quickly as<br>
                possible. The boys came again in the street singing their song:-</p>
              <p> &quot;Stork, stork, fly away.&quot;</p>
              <p> &quot;Shall we fly down, and pick their eyes out?&quot; asked 
                the young<br>
                storks.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No; leave them alone,&quot; said the mother. &quot;Listen 
                to me; that is<br>
                much more important. Now then. One-two-three. Now to the right.<br>
                One-two-three. Now to the left, round the chimney. There now, 
                that was very good. That last flap of the wings was so easy and 
                graceful,<br>
                that I shall give you permission to fly with me to-morrow to the<br>
                marshes. There will be a number of very superior storks there 
                with<br>
                their families, and I expect you to show them that my children 
                are the<br>
                best brought up of any who may be present. You must strut about<br>
                proudly- it will look well and make you respected.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But may we not punish those naughty boys?&quot; asked the 
                young<br>
                storks.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No; let them scream away as much as they like. You can 
                fly from<br>
                them now up high amid the clouds, and will be in the land of the<br>
                pyramids when they are freezing, and have not a green leaf on 
                the<br>
                trees or an apple to eat.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We will revenge ourselves,&quot; whispered the young storks 
                to each<br>
                other, as they again joined the exercising.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Of all the boys in the street who sang the mocking song about<br>
                the storks, not one was so determined to go on with it as he who 
                first<br>
                began it. Yet he was a little fellow not more than six years old. 
                To<br>
                the young storks he appeared at least a hundred, for he was so 
                much<br>
                bigger than their father and mother. To be sure, storks cannot 
                be<br>
                expected to know how old children and grown-up people are. So 
                they determined to have their revenge on this boy, because he 
                began the song first and would keep on with it. The young storks 
                were very<br>
                angry, and grew worse as they grew older; so at last their mother<br>
                was obliged to promise that they should be revenged, but not until 
                the<br>
                day of their departure.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We must see first, how you acquit yourselves at the grand<br>
                review,&quot; said she. &quot;If you get on badly there, the general 
                will thrust<br>
                his beak through you, and you will be killed, as the boys said, 
                though<br>
                not exactly in the same manner. So we must wait and see.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You shall see,&quot; said the young birds, and then they 
                took such<br>
                pains and practised so well every day, that at last it was quite 
                a<br>
                pleasure to see them fly so lightly and prettily. As soon as the<br>
                autumn arrived, all the storks began to assemble together before<br>
                taking their departure for warm countries during the winter. Then<br>
                the review commenced. They flew over forests and villages to show 
                what they could do, for they had a long journey before them. The 
                young storks performed their part so well that they received a 
                mark of<br>
                honor, with frogs and snakes as a present. These presents were 
                the<br>
                best part of the affair, for they could eat the frogs and snakes,<br>
                which they very quickly did.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now let us have our revenge,&quot; they cried.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, certainly,&quot; cried the mother stork. &quot;I have 
                thought upon the<br>
                best way to be revenged. I know the pond in which all the little<br>
                children lie, waiting till the storks come to take them to their<br>
                parents. The prettiest little babies lie there dreaming more sweetly<br>
                than they will ever dream in the time to come. All parents are 
                glad to<br>
                have a little child, and children are so pleased with a little 
                brother<br>
                or sister. Now we will fly to the pond and fetch a little baby 
                for<br>
                each of the children who did not sing that naughty song to make 
                game<br>
                of the storks.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But the naughty boy, who began the song first, what shall 
                we do<br>
                to him?&quot; cried the young storks.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There lies in the pond a little dead baby who has dreamed<br>
                itself to death,&quot; said the mother. &quot;We will take it 
                to the naughty<br>
                boy, and he will cry because we have brought him a little dead<br>
                brother. But you have not forgotten the good boy who said it was 
                a<br>
                shame to laugh at animals: we will take him a little brother and<br>
                sister too, because he was good. He is called Peter, and you shall 
                all<br>
                be called Peter in future.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>So they all did what their mother had arranged, and from that 
                day,<br>
                even till now, all the storks have been called Peter.</p>

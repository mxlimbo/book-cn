              <p class="h" align="center"> A GREAT GRIEF</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> THIS story really consists of two parts. The first part might 
                be left out, but it gives us a few particulars, and these are 
                useful We were staying in the country at a gentleman's seat, where 
                it happened that the master was absent for a few days. In the 
                meantime, there arrived from the next town a lady; she had a pug 
                dog with her, and came, she said, to dispose of shares in her 
                tan-yard. She had her papers with her, and we advised her to put 
                them in an envelope, and to write thereon the address of the proprietor 
                of the estate,&quot;General War-Commissary Knight,&quot; &amp;c.</p>
              <p> She listened to us attentively, seized the pen, paused, and 
                begged us to repeat the direction slowly. We complied, and she 
                wrote; but in the midst of the &quot;General War-&quot; she struck 
                fast, sighed deeply, and said, &quot;I am only a woman!&quot; 
                Her Puggie had seated itself on the ground while she wrote, and 
                growled; for the dog had come with her for amusement and for the 
                sake of its health; and then the bare floor ought not to be offered 
                to a visitor. His outward appearance was characterized by a snub 
                nose and a very fat back.</p>
              <p> &quot;He doesn't bite,&quot; said the lady; &quot;he has no 
                teeth. He is like one of the family, faithful and grumpy; but 
                the latter is my grandchildren's fault, for they have teased him; 
                they play at wedding, and want to give him the part of the bridesmaid, 
                and that's too much for him, poor old fellow.&quot; And she delivered 
                her papers, and took Puggie upon her arm. And this is the first 
                part of the story which might have been left out.</p>
              <p> PUGGIE DIED!! That's the second part. It was about a week afterwards 
                we arrived in the town, and put up at the inn. Our windows looked 
                into the tan-yard, which was divided into two parts by a partition 
                of planks; in one half were many skins and hides, raw and tanned. 
                Here was all the apparatus necessary to carry on a tannery, and 
                it belonged to the widow. Puggie had died in the morning, and 
                was to be buried in this part of the yard; the grandchildren of 
                the widow (that is, of the tanner's widow, for Puggie had never 
                been married) filled up the grave, and it was a beautiful grave- 
                it must have been quite pleasant to lie there. The grave was bordered 
                with pieces of flower-pots and strewn over with sand; quite at 
                the top they had stuck up half a beer bottle, with the neck upwards, 
                and that was not at all allegorical. </p>
              <p> The children danced round the grave, and the eldest of the boys 
                among them, a practical youngster of seven years, made the proposition 
                that there should be an exhibition of Puggie's burial-place for 
                all who lived in the lane; the price of admission was to be a 
                trouser button, for every boy would be sure to have one, and each 
                might also give one for a little girl. This proposal was adopted 
                by acclamation.</p>
              <p> And all the children out of the lane- yes, even out of the little 
                lane at the back- flocked to the place, and each gave a button.</p>
              <p>Many were noticed to go about on that afternoon with only one 
                suspender; but then they had seen Puggie's grave, and the sight 
                was worth much more.</p>
              <p> But in front of the tan-yard, close to the entrance, stood a 
                little girl clothed in rags, very pretty to look at, with curly 
                hair, and eyes so blue and clear that it was a pleasure to look 
                into them. The child said not a word, nor did she cry; but each 
                time the little door was opened she gave a long, long look into 
                the yard. She had not a button- that she knew right well, and 
                therefore she remained standing sorrowfully outside, till all 
                the others had seen the grave and had gone away; then she sat 
                down, held her little brown hands before her eyes, and burst into 
                tears; this girl alone had not seen Puggie's grave. It was a grief 
                as great to her as any grown person can experience.</p>
              <p> We saw this from above; and looked at from above, how many a 
                grief of our own and of others can make us smile! That is the 
                story, and whoever does not understand it may go and purchase 
                a share in the tan-yard from the window.</p>

              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THERE is nobody in the world who knows so many stories as<br>
                Ole-Luk-Oie, or who can relate them so nicely. In the evening, 
                while<br>
                the children are seated at the table or in their little chairs, 
                he<br>
                comes up the stairs very softly, for he walks in his socks, then 
                he<br>
                opens the doors without the slightest noise, and throws a small<br>
                quantity of very fine dust in their eyes, just enough to prevent<br>
                them from keeping them open, and so they do not see him. Then 
                he<br>
                creeps behind them, and blows softly upon their necks, till their<br>
                heads begin to droop. But Ole-Luk-Oie does not wish to hurt them,<br>
                for he is very fond of children, and only wants them to be quiet<br>
                that he may relate to them pretty stories, and they never are 
                quiet<br>
                until they are in bed and asleep. As soon as they are asleep,<br>
                Ole-Luk-Oie seats himself upon the bed. He is nicely dressed; 
                his coat is made of silken stuff; it is impossible to say of what 
                color, for it changes from green to red, and from red to blue 
                as he turns from<br>
                side to side. Under each arm he carries an umbrella; one of them, 
                with<br>
                pictures on the inside, he spreads over the good children, and 
                then<br>
                they dream the most beautiful stories the whole night. But the 
                other<br>
                umbrella has no pictures, and this he holds over the naughty<br>
                children so that they sleep heavily, and wake in the morning without<br>
                having dreamed at all.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Now we shall hear how Ole-Luk-Oie came every night during a<br>
                whole week to the little boy named Hjalmar, and what he told him.<br>
                There were seven stories, as there are seven days in the week.<br>
              </p>
              <p> MONDAY</p>
              <p> &quot;Now pay attention,&quot; said Ole-Luk-Oie, in the evening, 
                when<br>
                Hjalmar was in bed, &quot;and I will decorate the room.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Immediately all the flowers in the flower-pots became large trees,<br>
                with long branches reaching to the ceiling, and stretching along 
                the<br>
                walls, so that the whole room was like a greenhouse. All the<br>
                branches were loaded with flowers, each flower as beautiful and 
                as<br>
                fragrant as a rose; and, had any one tasted them, he would have<br>
                found them sweeter even than jam. The fruit glittered like gold, 
                and<br>
                there were cakes so full of plums that they were nearly bursting. 
                It<br>
                was incomparably beautiful. At the same time sounded dismal moans 
                from the table-drawer in which lay Hjalmar's school books.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What can that be now?&quot; said Ole-Luk-Oie, going to 
                the table and<br>
                pulling out the drawer.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was a slate, in such distress because of a false number in<br>
                the sum, that it had almost broken itself to pieces. The pencil 
                pulled<br>
                and tugged at its string as if it were a little dog that wanted 
                to<br>
                help, but could not.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And then came a moan from Hjalmar's copy-book. Oh, it was quite<br>
                terrible to hear! On each leaf stood a row of capital letters, 
                every<br>
                one having a small letter by its side. This formed a copy; under 
                these<br>
                were other letters, which Hjalmar had written: they fancied they<br>
                looked like the copy, but they were mistaken; for they were leaning 
                on<br>
                one side as if they intended to fall over the pencil-lines.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;See, this is the way you should hold yourselves,&quot; 
                said the<br>
                copy. &quot;Look here, you should slope thus, with a graceful 
                curve.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, we are very willing to do so, but we cannot,&quot; 
                said<br>
                Hjalmar's letters; &quot;we are so wretchedly made.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You must be scratched out, then,&quot; said Ole-Luk-Oie.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, no!&quot; they cried, and then they stood up so gracefully 
                it<br>
                was quite a pleasure to look at them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now we must give up our stories, and exercise these letters,&quot;<br>
                said Ole-Luk-Oie; &quot;One, two- one, two- &quot; So he drilled 
                them till<br>
                they stood up gracefully, and looked as beautiful as a copy could<br>
                look. But after Ole-Luk-Oie was gone, and Hjalmar looked at them 
                in<br>
                the morning, they were as wretched and as awkward as ever.<br>
              </p>
              <p> TUESDAY</p>
              <p> As soon as Hjalmar was in bed, Ole-Luk-Oie touched, with his<br>
                little magic wand, all the furniture in the room, which immediately<br>
                began to chatter, and each article only talked of itself.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Over the chest of drawers hung a large picture in a gilt frame,<br>
                representing a landscape, with fine old trees, flowers in the 
                grass,<br>
                and a broad stream, which flowed through the wood, past several<br>
                castles, far out into the wild ocean. Ole-Luk-Oie touched the<br>
                picture with his magic wand, and immediately the birds commenced<br>
                singing, the branches of the trees rustled, and the clouds moved<br>
                across the sky, casting their shadows on the landscape beneath 
                them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then Ole-Luk-Oie lifted little Hjalmar up to the frame, and placed 
                his<br>
                feet in the picture, just on the high grass, and there he stood 
                with<br>
                the sun shining down upon him through the branches of the trees. 
                He<br>
                ran to the water, and seated himself in a little boat which lay 
                there,<br>
                and which was painted red and white. The sails glittered like<br>
                silver, and six swans, each with a golden circlet round its neck,<br>
                and a bright blue star on its forehead, drew the boat past the 
                green<br>
                wood, where the trees talked of robbers and witches, and the flowers<br>
                of beautiful little elves and fairies, whose histories the butterflies<br>
                had related to them. Brilliant fish, with scales like silver and 
                gold,<br>
                swam after the boat, sometimes making a spring and splashing the 
                water round them, while birds, red and blue, small and great, 
                flew after him in two long lines. The gnats danced round them, 
                and the cockchafers cried &quot;Buz, buz.&quot; They all wanted 
                to follow Hjalmar, and all had some story to tell him. It was 
                a most pleasant sail. Sometimes the forests were thick and dark, 
                sometimes like a beautiful garden, gay<br>
                with sunshine and flowers; then he passed great palaces of glass 
                and<br>
                of marble, and on the balconies stood princesses, whose faces 
                were<br>
                those of little girls whom Hjalmar knew well, and had often played<br>
                with. One of them held out her hand, in which was a heart made 
                of<br>
                sugar, more beautiful than any confectioner ever sold. As Hjalmar<br>
                sailed by, he caught hold of one side of the sugar heart, and 
                held<br>
                it fast, and the princess held fast also, so that it broke in 
                two<br>
                pieces. Hjalmar had one piece, and the princess the other, but<br>
                Hjalmar's was the largest. At each castle stood little princes<br>
                acting as sentinels. They presented arms, and had golden swords, 
                and<br>
                made it rain plums and tin soldiers, so that they must have been<br>
                real princes.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Hjalmar continued to sail, sometimes through woods, sometimes 
                as<br>
                it were through large halls, and then by large cities. At last 
                he came<br>
                to the town where his nurse lived, who had carried him in her 
                arms<br>
                when he was a very little boy, and had always been kind to him. 
                She<br>
                nodded and beckoned to him, and then sang the little verses she 
                had<br>
                herself composed and set to him,-</p>
              <p> &quot;How oft my memory turns to thee,<br>
                My own Hjalmar, ever dear!<br>
                When I could watch thy infant glee,<br>
                Or kiss away a pearly tear.<br>
                'Twas in my arms thy lisping tongue<br>
                First spoke the half-remembered word,<br>
                While o'er thy tottering steps I hung,<br>
                My fond protection to afford.<br>
                Farewell! I pray the Heavenly Power<br>
                To keep thee till thy dying hour.&quot;</p>
              <p>And all the birds sang the same tune, the flowers danced on their<br>
                stems, and the old trees nodded as if Ole-Luk-Oie had been telling<br>
                them stories as well.<br>
                <br>
                WEDNESDAY</p>
              <p> How the rain did pour down! Hjalmar could hear it in his sleep;.<br>
                and when Ole-Luk-Oie opened the window, the water flowed quite 
                up to the window-sill. It had the appearance of a large lake outside, 
                and<br>
                a beautiful ship lay close to the house.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Wilt thou sail with me to-night, little Hjalmar?&quot; 
                said<br>
                Ole-Luk-Oie; &quot;then we shall see foreign countries, and thou 
                shalt<br>
                return here in the morning.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>All in a moment, there stood Hjalmar, in his best clothes, on<br>
                the deck of the noble ship; and immediately the weather became 
                fine.<br>
                They sailed through the streets, round by the church, and on every<br>
                side rolled the wide, great sea. They sailed till the land disappeared, 
                and then they saw a flock of storks, who had left their own country, 
                and were travelling to warmer climates. The storks flew one behind 
                the other, and had already been a long, long time on the wing. 
                One of them seemed so tired that his wings could scarcely carry 
                him. He was the last of the row, and was soon left very far behind. 
                At length he sunk lower and lower, with outstretched wings, flapping 
                them in vain, till his feet touched the rigging of the ship, and 
                he slided from the sails to the deck, and stood before them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then a sailor-boy caught him, and put him in the hen-house, with 
                the<br>
                fowls, the ducks, and the turkeys, while the poor stork stood 
                quite<br>
                bewildered amongst them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Just look at that fellow,&quot; said the chickens.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the turkey-cock puffed himself out as large as he could,<br>
                and inquired who he was; and the ducks waddled backwards, crying,<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Quack, quack.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the stork told them all about warm Africa, of the pyramids,<br>
                and of the ostrich, which, like a wild horse, runs across the<br>
                desert. But the ducks did not understand what he said, and quacked<br>
                amongst themselves, &quot;We are all of the same opinion; namely, 
                that he<br>
                is stupid.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, to be sure, he is stupid,&quot; said the turkey-cock; 
                and gobbled.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the stork remained quite silent, and thought of his home 
                in<br>
                Africa.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Those are handsome thin legs of yours,&quot; said the turkey-cock.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What do they cost a yard?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Quack, quack, quack,&quot; grinned the ducks; but, the 
                stork pretended<br>
                not to hear.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You may as well laugh,&quot; said the turkey; &quot;for 
                that remark was<br>
                rather witty, or perhaps it was above you. Ah, ah, is he not clever?<br>
                He will be a great amusement to us while he remains here.&quot; 
                And then he gobbled, and the ducks quacked, &quot;Gobble, gobble; 
                Quack, quack.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>What a terrible uproar they made, while they were having such<br>
                fun among themselves!<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then Hjalmar went to the hen-house; and, opening the door,<br>
                called to the stork. Then he hopped out on the deck. He had rested<br>
                himself now, and he looked happy, and seemed as if he nodded to<br>
                Hjalmar, as if to thank him. Then he spread his wings, and flew 
                away<br>
                to warmer countries, while the hens clucked, the ducks quacked, 
                and<br>
                the turkey-cock turned quite scarlet in the head.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;To-morrow you shall be made into soup,&quot; said Hjalmar 
                to the<br>
                fowls; and then he awoke, and found himself lying in his little 
                bed.<br>
                It was a wonderful journey which Ole-Luk-Oie had made him take<br>
                this night.<br>
                <br>
                THURSDAY</p>
              <p> &quot;What do you think I have got here?&quot; said Ole-Luk-Oie, 
                &quot;Do not<br>
                be frightened, and you shall see a little mouse.&quot; And then 
                he held out<br>
                his hand to him, in which lay a lovely little creature. &quot;It 
                has come<br>
                to invite you to a wedding. Two little mice are going to enter 
                into<br>
                the marriage state tonight. They reside under the floor of your<br>
                mother's store-room, and that must be a fine dwelling-place.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But how can I get through the little mouse-hole in the 
                floor?&quot;<br>
                asked Hjalmar.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Leave me to manage that,&quot; said Ole-Luk-Oie. &quot;I 
                will soon make you<br>
                small enough.&quot; And then he touched Hjalmar with his magic 
                wand,<br>
                whereupon he became less and less, until at last he was not longer<br>
                than a little finger. &quot;Now you can borrow the dress of the 
                tin<br>
                soldier. I think it will just fit you. It looks well to wear a 
                uniform<br>
                when you go into company.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, certainly,&quot; said Hjalmar; and in a moment he 
                was dressed<br>
                as neatly as the neatest of all tin soldiers.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Will you be so good as to seat yourself in your mamma's 
                thimble,&quot;<br>
                said the little mouse, &quot;that I may have the pleasure of drawing 
                you to<br>
                the wedding.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Will you really take so much trouble, young lady?&quot; 
                said<br>
                Hjalmar. And so in this way he rode to the mouse's wedding.<br>
                First they went under the floor, and then passed through a long<br>
                passage, which was scarcely high enough to allow the thimble to<br>
                drive under, and the whole passage was lit up with the<br>
                phosphorescent light of rotten wood.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Does it not smell delicious?&quot; asked the mouse, as 
                she drew him<br>
                along. &quot;The wall and the floor have been smeared with bacon-rind;<br>
                nothing can be nicer.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Very soon they arrived at the bridal hall. On the right stood<br>
                all the little lady-mice, whispering and giggling, as if they 
                were<br>
                making game of each other. To the left were the gentlemen-mice,<br>
                stroking their whiskers with their fore-paws; and in the centre 
                of the<br>
                hall could be seen the bridal pair, standing side by side, in 
                a hollow<br>
                cheese-rind, and kissing each other, while all eyes were upon 
                them;<br>
                for they had already been betrothed, and were soon to be married. 
                More and more friends kept arriving, till the mice were nearly 
                treading<br>
                each other to death; for the bridal pair now stood in the doorway, 
                and<br>
                none could pass in or out.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The room had been rubbed over with bacon-rind, like the passage,<br>
                which was all the refreshment offered to the guests. But for dessert<br>
                they produced a pea, on which a mouse belonging to the bridal 
                pair had bitten the first letters of their names. This was something 
                quite<br>
                uncommon. All the mice said it was a very beautiful wedding, and<br>
                that they had been very agreeably entertained.<br>
              </p>
              <p>After this, Hjalmar returned home. He had certainly been in<br>
                grand society; but he had been obliged to creep under a room, 
                and to<br>
                make himself small enough to wear the uniform of a tin soldier.<br>
                <br>
                FRIDAY</p>
              <p> &quot;It is incredible how many old people there are who would 
                be<br>
                glad to have me at night,&quot; said Ole-Luk-Oie, &quot;especially 
                those who<br>
                have done something wrong. 'Good little Ole,' say they to me, 
                'we<br>
                cannot close our eyes, and we lie awake the whole night and see 
                all<br>
                our evil deeds sitting on our beds like little imps, and sprinkling 
                us<br>
                with hot water. Will you come and drive them away, that we may 
                have<br>
                a good night's rest?' and then they sigh so deeply and say, 'We<br>
                would gladly pay you for it. Good-night, Ole-Luk, the money lies 
                on<br>
                the window.' But I never do anything for gold.&quot; &quot;What 
                shall we do<br>
                to-night?&quot; asked Hjalmar. &quot;I do not know whether you 
                would care to<br>
                go to another wedding,&quot; he replied, &quot;although it is 
                quite a different affair to the one we saw last night. Your sister's 
                large doll, that is dressed like a man, and is called Herman, 
                intends to marry the doll Bertha. It is also the dolls' birthday, 
                and they will receive many presents.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, I know that already,&quot; said Hjalmar, &quot;my 
                sister always allows<br>
                her dolls to keep their birthdays or to have a wedding when they<br>
                require new clothes; that has happened already a hundred times, 
                I am<br>
                quite sure.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, so it may; but to-night is the hundred and first wedding,<br>
                and when that has taken place it must be the last, therefore this 
                is<br>
                to be extremely beautiful. Only look.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Hjalmar looked at the table, and there stood the little card-board<br>
                doll's house, with lights in all the windows, and drawn up before 
                it<br>
                were the tin soldiers presenting arms. The bridal pair were seated<br>
                on the floor, leaning against the leg of the table, looking very<br>
                thoughtful, and with good reason. Then Ole-Luk-Oie dressed up 
                in<br>
                grandmother's black gown married them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>As soon as the ceremony was concluded, all the furniture in the<br>
                room joined in singing a beautiful song, which had been composed 
                by the lead pencil, and which went to the melody of a military 
                tattoo.</p>
              <p> &quot;What merry sounds are on the wind,<br>
                As marriage rites together bind<br>
                A quiet and a loving pair,<br>
                Though formed of kid, yet smooth and fair!<br>
                Hurrah! If they are deaf and blind,<br>
                We'll sing, though weather prove unkind.&quot;</p>
              <p> And now came the present; but the bridal pair had nothing to<br>
                eat, for love was to be their food.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Shall we go to a country house, or travel?&quot; asked 
                the bridegroom.<br>
                Then they consulted the swallow who had travelled so far, and<br>
                the old hen in the yard, who had brought up five broods of chickens.<br>
                And the swallow talked to them of warm countries, where the grapes<br>
                hang in large clusters on the vines, and the air is soft and mild, 
                and<br>
                about the mountains glowing with colors more beautiful than we 
                can<br>
                think of.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But they have no red cabbage like we have,&quot; said the 
                hen, &quot;I<br>
                was once in the country with my chickens for a whole summer, there 
                was a large sand-pit, in which we could walk about and scratch 
                as we<br>
                liked. Then we got into a garden in which grew red cabbage; oh, 
                how<br>
                nice it was, I cannot think of anything more delicious.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But one cabbage stalk is exactly like another,&quot; said 
                the swallow;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;and here we have often bad weather.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, but we are accustomed to it,&quot; said the hen.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But it is so cold here, and freezes sometimes.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Cold weather is good for cabbages,&quot; said the hen; 
                &quot;besides we<br>
                do have it warm here sometimes. Four years ago, we had a summer 
                that lasted more than five weeks, and it was so hot one could 
                scarcely<br>
                breathe. And then in this country we have no poisonous animals, 
                and we are free from robbers. He must be wicked who does not consider 
                our country the finest of all lands. He ought not to be allowed 
                to live<br>
                here.&quot; And then the hen wept very much and said, &quot;I 
                have also<br>
                travelled. I once went twelve miles in a coop, and it was not 
                pleasant<br>
                travelling at all.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The hen is a sensible woman,&quot; said the doll Bertha. 
                &quot;I don't care<br>
                for travelling over mountains, just to go up and come down again.<br>
                No, let us go to the sand-pit in front of the gate, and then take 
                a<br>
                walk in the cabbage garden.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And so they settled it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>SATURDAY<br>
                SATURDAY</p>
              <p> &quot;Am I to hear any more stories?&quot; asked little Hjalmar, 
                as soon<br>
                as Ole-Luk-Oie had sent him to sleep.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We shall have no time this evening,&quot; said he, spreading 
                out his<br>
                prettiest umbrella over the child. &quot;Look at these Chinese,&quot; 
                and then<br>
                the whole umbrella appeared like a large china bowl, with blue 
                trees<br>
                and pointed bridges, upon which stood little Chinamen nodding 
                their<br>
                heads. &quot;We must make all the world beautiful for to-morrow 
                morning,&quot;said Ole-Luk-Oie, &quot;for it will be a holiday, 
                it is Sunday. I must now go to the church steeple and see if the 
                little sprites who live<br>
                there have polished the bells, so that they may sound sweetly. 
                Then<br>
                I must go into the fields and see if the wind has blown the dust<br>
                from the grass and the leaves, and the most difficult task of 
                all<br>
                which I have to do, is to take down all the stars and brighten 
                them<br>
                up. I have to number them first before I put them in my apron, 
                and<br>
                also to number the places from which I take them, so that they 
                may<br>
                go back into the right holes, or else they would not remain, and 
                we<br>
                should have a number of falling stars, for they would all tumble<br>
                down one after the other.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Hark ye! Mr. Luk-Oie,&quot; said an old portrait which 
                hung on the<br>
                wall of Hjalmar's bedroom. &quot;Do you know me? I am Hjalmar's<br>
                great-grandfather. I thank you for telling the boy stories, but 
                you<br>
                must not confuse his ideas. The stars cannot be taken down from 
                the<br>
                sky and polished; they are spheres like our earth, which is a 
                good<br>
                thing for them.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Thank you, old great-grandfather,&quot; said Ole-Luk-Oie. 
                &quot;I thank<br>
                you; you may be the head of the family, as no doubt you are, but 
                I<br>
                am older than you. I am an ancient heathen. The old Romans and<br>
                Greeks named me the Dream-god. I have visited the noblest houses,<br>
                and continue to do so; still I know how to conduct myself both 
                to high and low, and now you may tell the stories yourself:&quot; 
                and so<br>
                Ole-Luk-Oie walked off, taking his umbrellas with him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well, well, one is never to give an opinion, I suppose,&quot; 
                grumbled<br>
                the portrait. And it woke Hjalmar.<br>
                <br>
                SUNDAY</p>
              <p> &quot;Good evening,&quot; said Ole-Luk-Oie.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Hjalmar nodded, and then sprang out of bed, and turned his<br>
                great-grandfather's portrait to the wall, so that it might not<br>
                interrupt them as it had done yesterday. &quot;Now,&quot; said 
                he, &quot;you must<br>
                tell me some stories about five green peas that lived in one pod; 
                or<br>
                of the chickseed that courted the chickweed; or of the darning 
                needle,<br>
                who acted so proudly because she fancied herself an embroidery<br>
                needle.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You may have too much of a good thing,&quot; said Ole-Luk-Oie. 
                &quot;You<br>
                know that I like best to show you something, so I will show you 
                my<br>
                brother. He is also called Ole-Luk-Oie but he never visits any 
                one but<br>
                once, and when he does come, he takes him away on his horse, and 
                tells him stories as they ride along. He knows only two stories. 
                One of these is so wonderfully beautiful, that no one in the world 
                can<br>
                imagine anything at all like it; but the other is just as ugly 
                and<br>
                frightful, so that it would be impossible to describe it.&quot; 
                Then<br>
                Ole-Luk-Oie lifted Hjalmar up to the window. &quot;There now, 
                you can see my brother, the other Ole-Luk-Oie; he is also called 
                Death. You<br>
                perceive he is not so bad as they represent him in picture books;<br>
                there he is a skeleton, but now his coat is embroidered with silver,<br>
                and he wears the splendid uniform of a hussar, and a mantle of 
                black<br>
                velvet flies behind him, over the horse. Look, how he gallops<br>
                along.&quot; Hjalmar saw that as this Ole-Luk-Oie rode on, he 
                lifted up old<br>
                and young, and carried them away on his horse. Some he seated 
                in front of him, and some behind, but always inquired first, &quot;How 
                stands the mark-book?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Good,&quot; they all answered.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, but let me see for myself,&quot; he replied; and they 
                were<br>
                obliged to give him the books. Then all those who had &quot;Very 
                good,&quot;<br>
                or &quot;Exceedingly good,&quot; came in front of the horse, and 
                heard the<br>
                beautiful story; while those who had &quot;Middling,&quot; or 
                &quot;Tolerably<br>
                good,&quot; in their books, were obliged to sit behind, and listen 
                to the<br>
                frightful tale. They trembled and cried, and wanted to jump down<br>
                from the horse, but they could not get free, for they seemed<br>
                fastened to the seat.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Why, Death is a most splendid Luk-Oie,&quot; said Hjalmar. 
                &quot;I am not<br>
                in the least afraid of him.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You need have no fear of him,&quot; said Ole-Luk-Oie, &quot;if 
                you take<br>
                care and keep a good conduct book.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now I call that very instructive,&quot; murmured the great-grandfather's 
                portrait. &quot;It is useful sometimes to express an opinion;&quot; 
                so he was quite satisfied.<br>
              </p>
              <p>These are some of the doings and sayings of Ole-Luk-Oie. I hope 
                he<br>
                may visit you himself this evening, and relate some more.</p>

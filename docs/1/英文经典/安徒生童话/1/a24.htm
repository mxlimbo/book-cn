              <p class="h" align="center"> WHAT THE MOON SAW</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> INTRODUCTION</p>
              <p> IT is a strange thing, when I feel most fervently and most deeply,<br>
                my hands and my tongue seem alike tied, so that I cannot rightly<br>
                describe or accurately portray the thoughts that are rising within 
                me;<br>
                and yet I am a painter; my eye tells me as much as that, and all 
                my<br>
                friends who have seen my sketches and fancies say the same.<br>
                I am a poor lad, and live in one of the narrowest of lanes; but<br>
                I do not want for light, as my room is high up in the house, with 
                an<br>
                extensive prospect over the neighbouring roofs. During the first 
                few<br>
                days I went to live in the town, I felt low-spirited and solitary<br>
                enough. Instead of the forest and the green hills of former days, 
                I<br>
                had here only a forest of chimney-pots to look out upon. And then 
                I<br>
                had not a single friend; not one familiar face greeted me.<br>
                So one evening I sat at the window, in a desponding mood; and<br>
                presently I opened the casement and looked out. Oh, how my heart<br>
                leaped up with joy! Here was a well-known face at last- a round,<br>
                friendly countenance, the face of a good friend I had known at 
                home.<br>
                In, fact, it was the MOON that looked in upon me. He was quite<br>
                unchanged, the dear old Moon, and had the same face exactly that 
                he<br>
                used to show when he peered down upon me through the willow trees 
                on the moor. I kissed my hand to him over and over again, as he 
                shone far into my little room; and he, for his part, promised 
                me that every evening, when he came abroad, he would look in upon 
                me for a few moments. This promise he has faithfully kept. It 
                is a pity that he can only stay such a short time when he comes. 
                Whenever he appears, he tells me of one thing or another that 
                he has seen on the previous night, or on that same evening. &quot;Just 
                paint the scenes I describe to you&quot;- this is what he said 
                to me- &quot;and you will have a very pretty picture-book.&quot; 
                I have followed his injunction for many evenings. I could make 
                up a new &quot;Thousand and One Nights,&quot; in my own way, out 
                of these pictures, but the number might be too great, after all. 
                The pictures I have here given have not been chosen at random, 
                but follow in their proper order, just as they were described 
                to me.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Some great gifted painter, or some poet or musician, may make<br>
                something more of them if he likes; what I have given here are 
                only<br>
                hasty sketches, hurriedly put upon the paper, with some of my 
                own<br>
                thoughts, interspersed; for the Moon did not come to me every 
                evening- a cloud sometimes hid his face from me.<br>
              </p>
              <p>FIRST EVENING</p>
              <p> &quot;Last night&quot;- I am quoting the Moon's own words- &quot;last 
                night I was<br>
                gliding through the cloudless Indian sky. My face was mirrored 
                in<br>
                the waters of the Ganges, and my beams strove to pierce through 
                the<br>
                thick intertwining boughs of the bananas, arching beneath me like<br>
                the tortoise's shell. Forth from the thicket tripped a Hindoo 
                maid,<br>
                light as a gazelle, beautiful as Eve. Airy and etherial as a vision,<br>
                and yet sharply defined amid the surrounding shadows, stood this<br>
                daughter of Hindostan: I could read on her delicate brow the thought<br>
                that had brought her hither. The thorny creeping plants tore her<br>
                sandals, but for all that she came rapidly forward. The deer that<br>
                had come down to the river to quench her thirst, sprang by with 
                a<br>
                startled bound, for in her hand the maiden bore a lighted lamp. 
                I<br>
                could see the blood in her delicate finger tips, as she spread 
                them<br>
                for a screen before the dancing flame. She came down to the stream,<br>
                and set the lamp upon the water, and let it float away. The flame<br>
                flickered to and fro, and seemed ready to expire; but still the 
                lamp<br>
                burned on, and the girl's black sparkling eyes, half veiled behind<br>
                their long silken lashes, followed it with a gaze of earnest<br>
                intensity. She knew that if the lamp continued to burn so long 
                as<br>
                she could keep it in sight, her betrothed was still alive; but 
                if<br>
                the lamp was suddenly extinguished, he was dead. And the lamp 
                burned bravely on, and she fell on her knees, and prayed. Near 
                her in the grass lay a speckled snake, but she heeded it not- 
                she thought only of Bramah and of her betrothed. 'He lives!' she 
                shouted joyfully, 'he lives!' And from the mountains the echo 
                came back upon her, 'he<br>
                lives!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>SECOND EVENING</p>
              <p> &quot;Yesterday,&quot; said the Moon to me, &quot;I looked down 
                upon a small<br>
                courtyard surrounded on all sides by houses. In the courtyard 
                sat a<br>
                clucking hen with eleven chickens; and a pretty little girl was<br>
                running and jumping around them. The hen was frightened, and screamed, 
                and spread out her wings over the little brood. Then the girl's 
                father came out and scolded her; and I glided away and thought 
                no more of the matter.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But this evening, only a few minutes ago, I looked down 
                into<br>
                the same courtyard. Everything was quiet. But presently the little<br>
                girl came forth again, crept quietly to the hen-house, pushed 
                back the<br>
                bolt, and slipped into the apartment of the hen and chickens. 
                They<br>
                cried out loudly, and came fluttering down from their perches, 
                and ran about in dismay, and the little girl ran after them. I 
                saw it quite<br>
                plainly, for I looked through a hole in the hen-house wall. I 
                was<br>
                angry with the willful child, and felt glad when her father came 
                out<br>
                and scolded her more violently than yesterday, holding her roughly<br>
                by the arm; she held down her head, and her blue eyes were full 
                of<br>
                large tears. 'What are you about here?' he asked. She wept and 
                said,<br>
                'I wanted to kiss the hen and beg her pardon for frightening her<br>
                yesterday; but I was afraid to tell you.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And the father kissed the innocent child's forehead, and 
                I kissed<br>
                her on the mouth and eyes.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>THIRD EVENING</p>
              <p> &quot;In the narrow street round the corner yonder- it is so 
                narrow<br>
                that my beams can only glide for a minute along the walls of the<br>
                house, but in that minute I see enough to learn what the world 
                is made<br>
                of- in that narrow street I saw a woman. Sixteen years ago that<br>
                woman was a child, playing in the garden of the old parsonage, 
                in<br>
                the country. The hedges of rose-bush were old, and the flowers 
                were<br>
                faded. They straggled wild over the paths, and the ragged branches<br>
                grew up among the boughs of the apple trees; here and there were 
                a few roses still in bloom- not so fair as the queen of flowers 
                generally<br>
                appears, but still they had colour and scent too. The clergyman's<br>
                little daughter appeared to me a far lovelier rose, as she sat 
                on<br>
                her stool under the straggling hedge, hugging and caressing her 
                doll<br>
                with the battered pasteboard cheeks.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ten years afterwards I saw her again. I beheld her in a<br>
                splendid ballroom: she was the beautiful bride of a rich merchant. 
                I<br>
                rejoiced at her happiness, and sought her on calm quiet evenings-<br>
                ah, nobody thinks of my clear eye and my silent glance! Alas! 
                my<br>
                rose ran wild, like the rose bushes in the garden of the parsonage.<br>
              </p>
              <p>There are tragedies in every-day life, and tonight I saw the 
                last<br>
                act of one.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;She was lying in bed in a house in that narrow street: 
                she was<br>
                sick unto death, and the cruel landlord came up, and tore away 
                the<br>
                thin coverlet, her only protection against the cold. 'Get up!' 
                said<br>
                he; 'your face is enough to frighten one. Get up and dress yourself,<br>
                give me money, or I'll turn you out into the street! Quick- get 
                up!'<br>
                She answered, 'Alas! death is gnawing at my heart. Let me rest.' 
                But<br>
                he forced her to get up and bathe her face, and put a wreath of<br>
                roses in her hair; and he placed her in a chair at the window, 
                with<br>
                a candle burning beside her, and went away.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I looked at her, and she was sitting motionless, with her 
                hands<br>
                in her lap. The wind caught the open window and shut it with a<br>
                crash, so that a pane came clattering down in fragments; but still 
                she<br>
                never moved. The curtain caught fire, and the flames played about<br>
                her face; and I saw that she was dead. There at the open window 
                sat<br>
                the dead woman, preaching a sermon against sin- my poor faded 
                rose out of the parsonage garden!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>FOURTH EVENING</p>
              <p> &quot;This evening I saw a German play acted,&quot; said the 
                Moon. &quot;It was<br>
                in a little town. A stable had been turned into a theatre; that 
                is<br>
                to say, the stable had been left standing, and had been turned 
                into<br>
                private boxes, and all the timber work had been covered with<br>
                coloured paper. A little iron chandelier hung beneath the ceiling, 
                and<br>
                that it might be made to disappear into the ceiling, as it does 
                in<br>
                great theatres, when the ting-ting of the prompter's bell is heard,<br>
                a great inverted tub has been placed just above it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Ting-ting!' and the little iron chandelier suddenly rose 
                at<br>
                least half a yard and disappeared in the tub; and that was the 
                sign<br>
                that the play was going to begin. A young nobleman and his lady, 
                who happened to be passing through the little town, were present 
                at the performance, and consequently the house was crowded. But 
                under the chandelier was a vacant space like a little crater: 
                not a single<br>
                soul sat there, for the tallow was dropping, drip, drip! I saw<br>
                everything, for it was so warm in there that every loophole had 
                been<br>
                opened. The male and female servants stood outside, peeping through 
                the chinks, although a real policeman was inside, threatening 
                them with a stick. Close by the orchestra could be seen the noble 
                young couple in two old arm-chairs, which were usually occupied 
                by his worship the mayor and his lady; but these latter were to-day 
                obliged to content themselves with wooden forms, just as if they 
                had been ordinary citizens; and the lady observed quietly to herself, 
                'One<br>
                sees, now, that there is rank above rank;' and this incident gave 
                an<br>
                air of extra festivity to the whole proceedings. The chandelier 
                gave<br>
                little leaps, the crowd got their knuckles rapped, and I, the 
                Moon,<br>
                was present at the performance from beginning to end.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>FIFTH EVENING</p>
              <p> &quot;Yesterday,&quot; began the Moon, &quot;I looked down upon 
                the turmoil of<br>
                Paris. My eye penetrated into an apartment of the Louvre. An old<br>
                grandmother, poorly clad- she belonged to the working class- was<br>
                following one of the under-servants into the great empty<br>
                throne-room, for this was the apartment she wanted to see- that 
                she<br>
                was resolved to see; it had cost her many a little sacrifice, 
                and many<br>
                a coaxing word, to penetrate thus far. She folded her thin hands,<br>
                and looked round with an air of reverence, as if she had been 
                in a<br>
                church.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Here it was!' she said, 'here!' and she approached the 
                throne,<br>
                from which hung the rich velvet fringed with gold lace. 'There,' 
                she<br>
                exclaimed, 'there!' and she knelt and kissed the purple carpet. 
                I<br>
                think she was actually weeping.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'But it was not this very velvet!' observed the footman, 
                and a<br>
                smile played about his mouth. 'True, but it was this very place,'<br>
                replied the woman, 'and it must have looked just like this. 'It 
                looked<br>
                so, and yet it did not,' observed the man: 'the windows were beaten<br>
                in, and the doors were off their hinges, and there was blood upon<br>
                the floor.' 'But for all that you can say, my grandson died upon 
                the<br>
                throne of France. Died!' mournfully repeated the old woman. I 
                do not<br>
                think another word was spoken, and they soon quitted the hall. 
                The<br>
                evening twilight faded and my light shone doubly vivid upon the 
                rich<br>
                velvet that covered the throne of France.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now who do you think this poor woman was? Listen, I will 
                tell you<br>
                a story.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It happened, in the Revolution of July, on the evening 
                of the<br>
                most brilliantly victorious day, when every house was a fortress,<br>
                every window a breastwork. The people stormed the Tuileries. Even<br>
                women and children were to be found among the combatants. They<br>
                penetrated into the apartments and halls of the palace. A poor<br>
                half-grown boy in a ragged blouse fought among the older insurgents.<br>
                Mortally wounded with several bayonet thrusts, he sank down. This<br>
                happened in the throne-room. They laid the bleeding youth upon 
                the<br>
                throne of France, wrapped the velvet around his wounds, and his<br>
                blood streamed forth upon the imperial purple. There was a picture!<br>
                The splendid hall, the fighting groups! A torn flag upon the ground,<br>
                the tricolor was waving above the bayonets, and on the throne 
                lay<br>
                the poor lad with the pale glorified countenance, his eyes turned<br>
                towards the sky, his limbs writhing in the death agony, his breast<br>
                bare, and his poor tattered clothing half hidden by the rich velvet<br>
                embroidered with silver lilies. At the boy's cradle a prophecy 
                had<br>
                been spoken: 'He will die on the throne of France!' The mother's 
                heart<br>
                dreamt of a second Napoleon.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;My beams have kissed the wreath of immortelles on his grave,<br>
                and this night they kissed the forehead of the old grandame, while<br>
                in a dream the picture floated before her which thou mayest draw-<br>
                the poor boy on the throne of France.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>SIXTH EVENING</p>
              <p> &quot;I've been in Upsala,&quot; said the Moon: &quot;I looked 
                down upon the<br>
                great plain covered with coarse grass, and upon the barren fields. 
                I<br>
                mirrored my face in the Tyris river, while the steamboat drove 
                the<br>
                fish into the rushes. Beneath me floated the waves, throwing long<br>
                shadows on the so-called graves of Odin, Thor, and Friga. In the<br>
                scanty turf that covers the hill-side names have been cut. There 
                is no<br>
                monument here, no memorial on which the traveller can have his 
                name<br>
                carved, no rocky wall on whose surface he can get it painted; 
                so<br>
                visitors have the turf cut away for that purpose. The naked earth<br>
                peers through in the form of great letters and names; these form 
                a<br>
                network over the whole hill. Here is an immortality, which lasts<br>
                till the fresh turf grows!<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Up on the hill stood a man, a poet. He emptied the mead 
                horn with<br>
                the broad silver rim, and murmured a name. He begged the winds 
                not<br>
                to betray him, but I heard the name. I knew it. A count's coronet<br>
                sparkles above it, and therefore he did not speak it out. I smiled,<br>
                for I knew that a poet's crown adorns his own name. The nobility 
                of<br>
                Eleanora d'Este is attached to the name of Tasso. And I also know<br>
                where the Rose of Beauty blooms!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Thus spake the Moon, and a cloud came between us. May no cloud<br>
                separate the poet from the rose!<br>
              </p>
              <p>SEVENTH EVENING</p>
              <p> &quot;Along the margin of the shore stretches a forest of firs 
                and<br>
                beeches, and fresh and fragrant is this wood; hundreds of nightingales<br>
                visit it every spring. Close beside it is the sea, the ever-changing<br>
                sea, and between the two is placed the broad high-road. One carriage<br>
                after another rolls over it; but I did not follow them, for my 
                eye<br>
                loves best to rest upon one point. A Hun's Grave lies there, and 
                the<br>
                sloe and blackthorn grow luxuriantly among the stones. Here is 
                true<br>
                poetry in nature.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And how do you think men appreciate this poetry? I will 
                tell<br>
                you what I heard there last evening and during the night.<br>
                &quot;First, two rich landed proprietors came driving by. 'Those 
                are<br>
                glorious trees!' said the first. 'Certainly; there are ten loads 
                of<br>
                firewood in each,' observed the other: 'it will be a hard winter,<br>
                and last year we got fourteen dollars a load'- and they were gone.<br>
                'The road here is wretched,' observed another man who drove past.<br>
                'That's the fault of those horrible trees,' replied his neighbour;<br>
                'there is no free current of air; the wind can only come from 
                the<br>
                sea'- and they were gone. The stage coach went rattling past. 
                All<br>
                the passengers were asleep at this beautiful spot. The postillion 
                blew<br>
                his horn, but he only thought, 'I can play capitally. It sounds 
                well<br>
                here. I wonder if those in there like it?'- and the stage coach<br>
                vanished. Then two young fellows came gallopping up on horseback.<br>
                There's youth and spirit in the blood here! thought I; and, indeed,<br>
                they looked with a smile at the moss-grown hill and thick forest. 
                'I<br>
                should not dislike a walk here with the miller's Christine,' said 
                one-<br>
                and they flew past.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The flowers scented the air; every breath of air was hushed; 
                it<br>
                seemed as if the sea were a part of the sky that stretched above 
                the<br>
                deep valley. A carriage rolled by. Six people were sitting in 
                it. Four<br>
                of them were asleep; the fifth was thinking of his new summer 
                coat,<br>
                which would suit him admirably; the sixth turned to the coachman 
                and<br>
                asked him if there were anything remarkable connected with yonder 
                heap of stones. 'No,' replied the coachman, 'it's only a heap 
                of stones; but the trees are remarkable.' 'How so?' 'Why I'll 
                tell you how they are very remarkable. You see, in winter, when 
                the snow lies very deep, and has hidden the whole road so that 
                nothing is to be seen, those trees serve me for a landmark. I 
                steer by them, so as not to drive into the sea; and you see that 
                is why the trees are remarkable.'<br>
                &quot;Now came a painter. He spoke not a word, but his eyes sparkled.<br>
                He began to whistle. At this the nightingales sang louder than 
                ever.<br>
                'Hold your tongues!' he cried testily; and he made accurate notes 
                of<br>
                all the colours and transitions- blue, and lilac, and dark brown.<br>
                'That will make a beautiful picture,' he said. He took it in just 
                as a<br>
                mirror takes in a view; and as he worked he whistled a march of<br>
                Rossini. And last of all came a poor girl. She laid aside the 
                burden<br>
                she carried, and sat down to rest upon the Hun's Grave. Her pale<br>
                handsome face was bent in a listening attitude towards the forest. 
                Her<br>
                eyes brightened, she gazed earnestly at the sea and the sky, her 
                hands<br>
                were folded, and I think she prayed, 'Our Father.' She herself 
                could<br>
                not understand the feeling that swept through her, but I know 
                that<br>
                this minute, and the beautiful natural scene, will live within 
                her<br>
                memory for years, far more vividly and more truly than the painter<br>
                could portray it with his colours on paper. My rays followed her<br>
                till the morning dawn kissed her brow.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>EIGHTH EVENING</p>
              <p> Heavy clouds obscured the sky, and the Moon did not make his<br>
                appearance at all. I stood in my little room, more lonely than 
                ever,<br>
                and looked up at the sky where he ought to have shown himself. 
                My<br>
                thoughts flew far away, up to my great friend, who every evening<br>
                told me such pretty tales, and showed me pictures. Yes, he has 
                had<br>
                an experience indeed. He glided over the waters of the Deluge, 
                and<br>
                smiled on Noah's ark just as he lately glanced down upon me, and<br>
                brought comfort and promise of a new world that was to spring 
                forth<br>
                from the old. When the Children of Israel sat weeping by the waters 
                of Babylon, he glanced mournfully upon the willows where hung 
                the<br>
                silent harps. When Romeo climbed the balcony, and the promise 
                of<br>
                true love fluttered like a cherub toward heaven, the round Moon<br>
                hung, half hidden among the dark cypresses, in the lucid air. 
                He saw<br>
                the captive giant at St. Helena, looking from the lonely rock 
                across<br>
                the wide ocean, while great thoughts swept through his soul. Ah!<br>
                what tales the Moon can tell. Human life is like a story to him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>To-night I shall not see thee again, old friend. Tonight I can 
                draw no<br>
                picture of the memories of thy visit. And, as I looked dreamily<br>
                towards the clouds, the sky became bright. There was a glancing 
                light, and a beam from the Moon fell upon me. It vanished again, 
                and dark clouds flew past: but still it was a greeting, a friendly 
                good-night<br>
                offered to me by the Moon.<br>
              </p>
              <p>NINTH EVENING</p>
              <p> The air was clear again. Several evenings had passed, and the 
                Moon<br>
                was in the first quarter. Again he gave me an outline for a sketch.<br>
                Listen to what he told me.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I have followed the polar bird and the swimming whale to 
                the<br>
                eastern coast of Greenland. Gaunt ice-covered rocks and dark clouds<br>
                hung over a valley, where dwarf willows and barberry bushes stood<br>
                clothed in green. The blooming lychnis exhaled sweet odours. My<br>
                light was faint, my face pale as the water lily that, torn from 
                its<br>
                stem, has been drifting for weeks with the tide. The crown-shaped<br>
                Northern Light burned fiercely in the sky. Its ring was broad, 
                and<br>
                from its circumference the rays shot like whirling shafts of fire<br>
                across the whole sky, flashing in changing radiance from green 
                to red.<br>
                The inhabitants of that icy region were assembling for dance and<br>
                festivity; but, accustomed to this glorious spectacle, they scarcely<br>
                deigned to glance at it. 'Let us leave the soul of the dead to 
                their<br>
                ball-play with the heads of the walruses,' they thought in their<br>
                superstition, and they turned their whole attention to the song 
                and<br>
                dance. In the midst of the circle, and divested of his furry cloak,<br>
                stood a Greenlander, with a small pipe, and he played and sang 
                a<br>
                song about catching the seal, and the chorus around chimed in 
                with,<br>
                'Eia, Eia, Ah.' And in their white furs they danced about in the<br>
                circle, till you might fancy it was a polar bear's ball.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And now a Court of Judgment was opened. Those Greenlanders 
                who had quarrelled stepped forward, and the offended person chanted 
                forth the faults of his adversary in an extempore song, turning 
                them sharply into ridicule, to the sound of the pipe and the measure 
                of the dance. The defendant replied with satire as keen, while 
                the audience laughed, and gave their verdict. The rocks heaved, 
                the glaciers melted, and great masses of ice and snow came crashing 
                down, shivering to fragments as they fall; it was a glorious Greenland 
                summer night. A hundred paces away, under the open tent of hides, 
                lay a sick man. Life still flowed through his warm blood, but 
                still he was to die- he himself felt it, and all who stood round 
                him knew it also; therefore his wife was already sewing round 
                him the shroud of furs, that she might not afterwards be obliged 
                to touch the dead body. And she asked,<br>
              </p>
              <p>'Wilt thou be buried on the rock, in the firm snow? I will deck 
                the<br>
                spot with thy kayak, and thy arrows, and the angekokk shall dance 
                over it. Or wouldst thou rather be buried in the sea?' 'In the 
                sea,' he<br>
                whispered, and nodded with a mournful smile. 'Yes, it is a pleasant<br>
                summer tent, the sea,' observed the wife. 'Thousands of seals 
                sport<br>
                there, the walrus shall lie at thy feet, and the hunt will be 
                safe and<br>
                merry!' And the yelling children tore the outspread hide from 
                the<br>
                window-hole, that the dead man might be carried to the ocean, 
                the<br>
                billowy ocean, that had given him food in life, and that now, 
                in<br>
                death, was to afford him a place of rest. For his monument, he 
                had the floating, ever-changing icebergs, whereon the seal sleeps, 
                while the storm bird flies round their gleaming summits!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>TENTH EVENING</p>
              <p> &quot;I knew an old maid,&quot; said the Moon. &quot;Every winter 
                she wore a<br>
                wrapper of yellow satin, and it always remained new, and was the<br>
                only fashion she followed. In summer she always wore the same 
                straw hat, and I verily believe the very same gray-blue dress.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;She never went out, except across the street to an old 
                female<br>
                friend; and in later years she did not even take this walk, for 
                the<br>
                old friend was dead. In her solitude my old maid was always busy 
                at<br>
                the window, which was adorned in summer with pretty flowers, and 
                in winter with cress, grown upon felt. During the last months 
                I saw her no more at the window, but she was still alive. I knew 
                that, for I had not yet seen her begin the 'long journey,' of 
                which she often spoke with her friend. 'Yes, yes,' she was in 
                the habit of saying, when I come to die I shall take a longer 
                journey than I have made my whole<br>
                life long. Our family vault is six miles from here. I shall be 
                carried<br>
                there, and shall sleep there among my family and relatives.' Last<br>
                night a van stopped at the house. A coffin was carried out, and 
                then I<br>
                knew that she was dead. They placed straw round the coffin, and 
                the<br>
                van drove away. There slept the quiet old lady, who had not gone 
                out<br>
                of her house once for the last year. The van rolled out through 
                the<br>
                town-gate as briskly as if it were going for a pleasant excursion.<br>
                On the high-road the pace was quicker yet. The coachman looked<br>
                nervously round every now and then- I fancy he half expected to 
                see<br>
                her sitting on the coffin, in her yellow satin wrapper. And because 
                he<br>
                was startled, he foolishly lashed his horses, while he held the<br>
                reins so tightly that the poor beasts were in a foam: they were<br>
                young and fiery. A hare jumped across the road and startled them,<br>
                and they fairly ran away. The old sober maiden, who had for years<br>
                and years moved quietly round and round in a dull circle, was 
                now,<br>
                in death, rattled over stock and stone on the public highway. 
                The<br>
                coffin in its covering of straw tumbled out of the van, and was 
                left<br>
                on the high-road, while horses, coachman, and carriage flew past 
                in<br>
                wild career. The lark rose up carolling from the field, twittering 
                her<br>
                morning lay over the coffin, and presently perched upon it, picking<br>
                with her beak at the straw covering, as though she would tear 
                it up.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The lark rose up again, singing gaily, and I withdrew behind 
                the red<br>
                morning clouds.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>ELEVENTH EVENING</p>
              <p> &quot;I will give you a picture of Pompeii,&quot; said the Moon. 
                &quot;I was in<br>
                the suburb in the Street of Tombs, as they call it, where the 
                fair<br>
                monuments stand, in the spot where, ages ago, the merry youths,<br>
                their temples bound with rosy wreaths, danced with the fair sisters 
                of<br>
                Lais. Now, the stillness of death reigned around. German<br>
                mercenaries, in the Neapolitan service, kept guard, played cards,<br>
                and diced; and a troop of strangers from beyond the mountains 
                came<br>
                into the town, accompanied by a sentry. They wanted to see the 
                city<br>
                that had risen from the grave illumined by my beams; and I showed 
                them the wheel-ruts in the streets paved with broad lava slabs; 
                I showed them the names on the doors, and the signs that hung 
                there yet: they saw in the little courtyard the basins of the 
                fountains, ornamented with shells; but no jet of water gushed 
                upwards, no songs sounded forth from the richly-painted chambers, 
                where the bronze dog kept the door.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It was the City of the Dead; only Vesuvius thundered forth 
                his<br>
                everlasting hymn, each separate verse of which is called by men 
                an<br>
                eruption. We went to the temple of Venus, built of snow-white<br>
                marble, with its high altar in front of the broad steps, and the<br>
                weeping willows sprouting freshly forth among the pillars. The 
                air was<br>
                transparent and blue, and black Vesuvius formed the background, 
                with fire ever shooting forth from it, like the stem of the pine 
                tree.<br>
                Above it stretched the smoky cloud in the silence of the night, 
                like<br>
                the crown of the pine, but in a blood-red illumination. Among 
                the<br>
                company was a lady singer, a real and great singer. I have witnessed<br>
                the homage paid to her in the greatest cities of Europe. When 
                they<br>
                came to the tragic theatre, they all sat down on the amphitheatre<br>
                steps, and thus a small part of the house was occupied by an audience, 
                as it had been many centuries ago. The stage still stood unchanged, 
                with its walled side-scenes, and the two arches in the background, 
                through which the beholders saw the same scene that had been exhibited 
                in the old times- a scene painted by nature herself, namely, the 
                mountains between Sorento and Amalfi. The singer gaily mounted 
                the ancient stage, and sang. The place inspired her, and she reminded 
                me of a wild Arab horse, that rushes headlong on with snorting 
                nostrils and flying mane- her song was so light and yet so firm. 
                Anon I thought of the mourning mother beneath the cross at Golgotha, 
                so deep was the expression of pain. And, just as it had done thousands 
                of years ago, the sound of applause and delight now filled the 
                theatre. 'Happy, gifted creature!' all the hearers exclaimed. 
                Five minutes more, and the stage was empty, the company had vanished, 
                and not a sound more was heard- all were gone. But the ruins stood 
                unchanged, as they will stand when centuries shall have gone by, 
                and when none shall know of the momentary applause and of the 
                triumph of the fair songstress; when all will be forgotten and 
                gone, and even for me this hour will be but a dream of the past.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>TWELFTH EVENING</p>
              <p> &quot;I looked through the windows of an editor's house,&quot; 
                said the<br>
                Moon. &quot;It was somewhere in Germany. I saw handsome furniture, 
                many books, and a chaos of newspapers. Several young men were 
                present: the editor himself stood at his desk, and two little 
                books, both by young authors, were to be noticed. 'This one has 
                been sent to me,' said he. 'I have not read it yet; what think 
                you of the contents?' 'Oh,' said the person addressed- he was 
                a poet himself- 'it is good enough; a little broad, certainly; 
                but, you see, the author is still young. The verses might be better, 
                to be sure; the thoughts are sound, though there is certainly 
                a good deal of common-place among them. But what will you have? 
                You can't be always getting something new.<br>
              </p>
              <p>That he'll turn out anything great I don't believe, but you may 
                safely<br>
                praise him. He is well read, a remarkable Oriental scholar, and 
                has<br>
                a good judgment. It was he who wrote that nice review of my<br>
                'Reflections on Domestic Life.' We must be lenient towards the 
                young man.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'But he is a complete hack!' objected another of the gentlemen.<br>
                'Nothing worse in poetry than mediocrity, and he certainly does 
                not go beyond this.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Poor fellow,' observed a third, 'and his aunt is so happy<br>
                about him. It was she, Mr. Editor, who got together so many<br>
                subscribers for your last translation.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Ah, the good woman! Well, I have noticed the book briefly.<br>
                Undoubted talent- a welcome offering- a flower in the garden of<br>
                poetry- prettily brought out- and so on. But this other book- 
                I<br>
                suppose the author expects me to purchase it? I hear it is praised. 
                He<br>
                has genius, certainly: don't you think so?'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Yes, all the world declares as much,' replied the poet, 
                'but<br>
                it has turned out rather wildly. The punctuation of the book, 
                in<br>
                particular, is very eccentric.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'It will be good for him if we pull him to pieces, and 
                anger<br>
                him a little, otherwise he will get too good an opinion of himself.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'But that would be unfair,' objected the fourth. 'Let us 
                not carp<br>
                at little faults, but rejoice over the real and abundant good 
                that<br>
                we find here: he surpasses all the rest.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Not so. If he is a true genius, he can bear the sharp 
                voice of<br>
                censure. There are people enough to praise him. Don't let us quite<br>
                turn his head.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Decided talent,' wrote the editor, 'with the usual carelessness.<br>
                that he can write incorrect verses may be seen in page 25, where 
                there<br>
                are two false quantities. We recommend him to study the ancients,<br>
                etc.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I went away,&quot; continued the Moon, &quot;and looked 
                through the windows in the aunt's house. There sat the be-praised 
                poet, the tame one; all the guests paid homage to him, and he 
                was happy.<br>
                &quot;I sought the other poet out, the wild one; him also I found 
                in<br>
                a great assembly at his patron's, where the tame poet's book was 
                being discussed.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'I shall read yours also,' said Maecenas; 'but to speak 
                honestly-<br>
                you know I never hide my opinion from you- I don't expect much 
                from it, for you are much too wild, too fantastic. But it must 
                be allowed that, as a man, you are highly respectable.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;A young girl sat in a corner; and she read in a book these 
                words:</p>
              <p> &quot;'In the dust lies genius and glory,<br>
                But ev'ry-day talent will pay.<br>
                It's only the old, old story,<br>
                But the piece is repeated each day.'&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>THIRTEENTH EVENING</p>
              <p> The Moon said, &quot;Beside the woodland path there are two 
                small<br>
                farm-houses. The doors are low, and some of the windows are placed 
                quite high, and others close to the ground; and whitethorn and<br>
                barberry bushes grow around them. The roof of each house is<br>
                overgrown with moss and with yellow flowers and houseleek. Cabbage 
                and potatoes are the only plants cultivated in the gardens, but 
                out of the hedge there grows a willow tree, and under this willow 
                tree sat a little girl, and she sat with her eyes fixed upon the 
                old oak tree between the two huts.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It was an old withered stem. It had been sawn off at the 
                top, and<br>
                a stork had built his nest upon it; and he stood in this nest 
                clapping<br>
                with his beak. A little boy came and stood by the girl's side: 
                they<br>
                were brother and sister.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'What are you looking at?' he asked.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'I'm watching the stork,' she replied: 'our neighbors told 
                me<br>
                that he would bring us a little brother or sister to-day; let 
                us watch<br>
                to see it come!'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'The stork brings no such things,' the boy declared, 'you 
                may<br>
                be sure of that. Our neighbor told me the same thing, but she<br>
                laughed when she said it, and so I asked her if she could say 
                'On my<br>
                honor,' and she could not; and I know by that the story about 
                the<br>
                storks is not true, and that they only tell it to us children 
                for<br>
                fun.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'But where do babies come from, then?' asked the girl.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Why, an angel from heaven brings them under his cloak, 
                but no<br>
                man can see him; and that's why we never know when he brings them.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;At that moment there was a rustling in the branches of 
                the willow<br>
                tree, and the children folded their hands and looked at one another:<br>
                it was certainly the angel coming with the baby. They took each<br>
                other's hand, and at that moment the door of one of the houses 
                opened, and the neighbour appeared.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Come in, you two,' she said. 'See what the stork has brought. 
                It<br>
                is a little brother.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And the children nodded gravely at one another, for they 
                had felt<br>
                quite sure already that the baby was come.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>FOURTEENTH EVENING</p>
              <p> &quot;I was gliding over the Luneburg Heath,&quot; the Moon 
                said. &quot;A<br>
                lonely hut stood by the wayside, a few scanty bushes grew near 
                it, and a nightingale who had lost his way sang sweetly. He died 
                in the<br>
                coldness of the night: it was his farewell song that I heard.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The morning dawn came glimmering red. I saw a caravan of 
                emigrant peasant families who were bound to Hamburgh, there to 
                take ship for America, where fancied prosperity would bloom for 
                them. </p>
              <p>The mothers carried their little children at their backs, the 
                elder ones<br>
                tottered by their sides, and a poor starved horse tugged at a 
                cart<br>
                that bore their scanty effects. The cold wind whistled, and<br>
                therefore the little girl nestled closer to the mother, who, looking<br>
                up at my decreasing disc, thought of the bitter want at home, 
                and<br>
                spoke of the heavy taxes they had not been able to raise. The 
                whole<br>
                caravan thought of the same thing; therefore, the rising dawn 
                seemed<br>
                to them a message from the sun, of fortune that was to gleam<br>
                brightly upon them. They heard the dying nightingale sing; it 
                was no<br>
                false prophet, but a harbinger of fortune. The wind whistled,<br>
                therefore they did not understand that the nightingale sung, 'Fare<br>
                away over the sea! Thou hast paid the long passage with all that 
                was<br>
                thine, and poor and helpless shalt thou enter Canaan. Thou must 
                sell<br>
                thyself, thy wife, and thy children. But your griefs shall not 
                last<br>
                long. Behind the broad fragrant leaves lurks the goddess of Death, 
                and her welcome kiss shall breathe fever into thy blood. Fare 
                away, fare away, over the heaving billows.' And the caravan listened 
                well pleased to the song of the nightingale, which seemed to promise 
                good<br>
                fortune. Day broke through the light clouds; country people went<br>
                across the heath to church; the black-gowned women with their 
                white<br>
                head-dresses looked like ghosts that had stepped forth from the 
                church pictures. All around lay a wide dead plain, covered with 
                faded brown heath, and black charred spaces between the white 
                sand hills. </p>
              <p>The women carried hymn books, and walked into the church. Oh, 
                pray, pray for those who are wandering to find graves beyond the 
                foaming billows.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>FIFTEENTH EVENING</p>
              <p> &quot;I know a Pulcinella,&quot; the Moon told me. &quot;The 
                public applaud<br>
                vociferously directly they see him. Every one of his movements 
                is<br>
                comic, and is sure to throw the house into convulsions of laughter;<br>
                and yet there is no art in it all- it is complete nature. When 
                he<br>
                was yet a little boy, playing about with other boys, he was already<br>
                Punch. Nature had intended him for it, and had provided him with 
                a<br>
                hump on his back, and another on his breast; but his inward man, 
                his<br>
                mind, on the contrary, was richly furnished. No one could surpass<br>
                him in depth of feeling or in readiness of intellect. The theatre<br>
                was his ideal world. If he had possessed a slender well-shaped 
                figure,<br>
                he might have been the first tragedian on any stage; the heroic, 
                the<br>
                great, filled his soul; and yet he had to become a Pulcinella. 
                His<br>
                very sorrow and melancholy did but increase the comic dryness 
                of his sharply-cut features, and increased the laughter of the 
                audience,<br>
                who showered plaudits on their favourite. The lovely Columbine 
                was<br>
                indeed kind and cordial to him; but she preferred to marry the<br>
                Harlequin. It would have been too ridiculous if beauty and ugliness<br>
                had in reality paired together.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;When Pulcinella was in very bad spirits, she was the only 
                one who<br>
                could force a hearty burst of laughter, or even a smile from him:<br>
                first she would be melancholy with him, then quieter, and at last<br>
                quite cheerful and happy. 'I know very well what is the matter 
                with<br>
                you,' she said; 'yes, you're in love!' And he could not help laughing.<br>
                'I and Love,&quot; he cried, &quot;that would have an absurd look. 
                How the<br>
                public would shout!' 'Certainly, you are in love,' she continued;<br>
                and added with a comic pathos, 'and I am the person you are in 
                love<br>
                with.' You see, such a thing may be said when it is quite out 
                of the<br>
                question- and, indeed, Pulcinella burst out laughing, and gave 
                a<br>
                leap into the air, and his melancholy was forgotten.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And yet she had only spoken the truth. He did love her, 
                love<br>
                her adoringly, as he loved what was great and lofty in art. At 
                her<br>
                wedding he was the merriest among the guests, but in the stillness<br>
                of night he wept: if the public had seen his distorted face then, 
                they<br>
                would have applauded rapturously.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And a few days ago, Columbine died. On the day of the funeral,<br>
                Harlequin was not required to show himself on the boards, for 
                he was a disconsolate widower. The director had to give a very 
                merry piece,<br>
                that the public might not too painfully miss the pretty Columbine<br>
                and the agile Harlequin. Therefore Pulcinella had to be more<br>
                boisterous and extravagant than ever; and he danced and capered,<br>
                with despair in his heart; and the audience yelled, and shouted<br>
                'bravo, bravissimo!' Pulcinella was actually called before the<br>
                curtain. He was pronounced inimitable.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But last night the hideous little fellow went out of the 
                town,<br>
                quite alone, to the deserted churchyard. The wreath of flowers 
                on<br>
                Columbine's grave was already faded, and he sat down there. It 
                was a<br>
                study for a painter. As he sat with his chin on his hands, his 
                eyes<br>
                turned up towards me, he looked like a grotesque monument- a Punch 
                on a grave- peculiar and whimsical! If the people could have seen 
                their favourite, they would have cried as usual, 'Bravo, Pulcinella; 
                bravo, bravissimo!'&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>SIXTEENTH EVENING</p>
              <p> Hear what the Moon told me. &quot;I have seen the cadet who 
                had just<br>
                been made an officer put on his handsome uniform for the first 
                time; I<br>
                have seen the young bride in her wedding dress, and the princess<br>
                girl-wife happy in her gorgeous robes; but never have I seen a<br>
                felicity equal to that of a little girl of four years old, whom 
                I<br>
                watched this evening. She had received a new blue dress, and a 
                new<br>
                pink hat, the splendid attire had just been put on, and all were<br>
                calling for a candle, for my rays, shining in through the windows 
                of<br>
                the room, were not bright enough for the occasion, and further<br>
                illumination was required. There stood the little maid, stiff 
                and<br>
                upright as a doll, her arms stretched painfully straight out away 
                from<br>
                the dress, and her fingers apart; and oh, what happiness beamed 
                from<br>
                her eyes, and from her whole countenance! 'To-morrow you shall 
                go<br>
                out in your new clothes,' said her mother; and the little one 
                looked<br>
                up at her hat, and down at her frock, and smiled brightly. 'Mother,'<br>
                she cried, 'what will the little dogs think, when they see me 
                in these<br>
                splendid new things?'&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>SEVENTEENTH EVENING</p>
              <p> &quot;I have spoken to you of Pompeii,&quot; said the Moon; 
                &quot;that corpse<br>
                of a city, exposed in the view of living towns: I know another 
                sight<br>
                still more strange, and this is not the corpse, but the spectre 
                of a<br>
                city. Whenever the jetty fountains splash into the marble basins, 
                they<br>
                seem to me to be telling the story of the floating city. Yes, 
                the<br>
                spouting water may tell of her, the waves of the sea may sing 
                of her<br>
                fame! On the surface of the ocean a mist often rests, and that 
                is<br>
                her widow's veil. The bridegroom of the sea is dead, his palace 
                and<br>
                his city are his mausoleum! Dost thou know this city? She has 
                never<br>
                heard the rolling of wheels or the hoof-tread of horses in her<br>
                streets, through which the fish swim, while the black gondola 
                glides<br>
                spectrally over the green water. I will show you the place,&quot; 
                continued<br>
                the Moon, &quot;the largest square in it, and you will fancy yourself<br>
                transported into the city of a fairy tale. The grass grows rank<br>
                among the broad flagstones, and in the morning twilight thousands 
                of<br>
                tame pigeons flutter around the solitary lofty tower. On three 
                sides<br>
                you find yourself surrounded by cloistered walks. In these the<br>
                silent Turk sits smoking his long pipe, the handsome Greek leans<br>
                against the pillar and gazes at the upraised trophies and lofty 
                masts,<br>
                memorials of power that is gone. The flags hang down like mourning<br>
                scarves. A girl rests there: she has put down her heavy pails 
                filled<br>
                with water, the yoke with which she has carried them rests on 
                one of<br>
                her shoulders, and she leans against the mast of victory. That 
                is<br>
                not a fairy palace you see before you yonder, but a church: the 
                gilded<br>
                domes and shining orbs flash back my beams; the glorious bronze 
                horses up yonder have made journeys, like the bronze horse in 
                the fairy tale: they have come hither, and gone hence, and have 
                returned again. Do you notice the variegated splendour of the 
                walls and windows? It looks as if Genius had followed the caprices 
                of a child, in the adornment of these singular temples. Do you 
                see the winged lion on the pillar?<br>
              </p>
              <p>The gold glitters still, but his wings are tied- the lion is 
                dead, for<br>
                the king of the sea is dead; the great halls stand desolate, and 
                where<br>
                gorgeous paintings hung of yore, the naked wall now peers through. 
              </p>
              <p>The lazzarone sleeps under the arcade, whose pavement in old 
                times was to be trodden only by the feet of high nobility. From 
                the deep<br>
                wells, and perhaps from the prisons by the Bridge of Sighs, rise 
                the<br>
                accents of woe, as at the time when the tambourine was heard in 
                the<br>
                gay gondolas, and the golden ring was cast from the Bucentaur 
                to<br>
                Adria, the queen of the seas. Adria! shroud thyself in mists; 
                let<br>
                the veil of thy widowhood shroud thy form, and clothe in the weeds<br>
                of woe the mausoleum of thy bridegroom- the marble, spectral Venice.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>EIGHTEENTH EVENING</p>
              <p> &quot;I looked down upon a great theatre,&quot; said the Moon. 
                &quot;The house<br>
                was crowded, for a new actor was to make his first appearance 
                that<br>
                night. My rays glided over a little window in the wall, and I 
                saw a<br>
                painted face with the forehead pressed against the panes. It was 
                the<br>
                hero of the evening. The knighly beard curled crisply about the<br>
                chin; but there were tears in the man's eyes, for he had been 
                hissed<br>
                off, and indeed with reason. The poor Incapable! But Incapables 
                cannot be admitted into the empire of Art. He had deep feeling, 
                and loved his art enthusiastically, but the art loved not him. 
                The prompter's bell sounded; 'the hero enters with a determined 
                air,' so ran the stage direction in his part, and he had to appear 
                before an audience who turned him into ridicule. When the piece 
                was over, I saw a form wrapped in a mantle, creeping down the 
                steps: it was the vanquished knight of the evening. The scene-shifters 
                whispered to one another, and I followed the poor fellow home 
                to his room. To hang one's self is to die a mean death, and poison 
                is not always at hand, I know; but he thought of both. I saw how 
                he looked at his pale face in the glass, with eyes half closed, 
                to see if he should look well as a corpse. A man may be very unhappy, 
                and yet exceedingly affected. He thought of death, of suicide; 
                I believe he pitied himself, for he wept bitterly, and when a 
                man has had his cry out he doesn't kill himself.</p>
              <p> &quot;Since that time a year had rolled by. Again a play was 
                to be<br>
                acted, but in a little theatre, and by a poor strolling company. 
                Again<br>
                I saw the well-remembered face, with the painted cheeks and the<br>
                crisp beard. He looked up at me and smiled; and yet he had been 
                hissed off only a minute before- hissed off from a wretched theatre, 
                by a miserable audience. And tonight a shabby hearse rolled out 
                of the town-gate. It was a suicide- our painted, despised hero. 
                The driver of the hearse was the only person present, for no one 
                followed except my beams. In a corner of the churchyard the corpse 
                of the suicide was shovelled into the earth, and nettles will 
                soon be growing<br>
                rankly over his grave, and the sexton will throw thorns and weeds 
                from the other graves upon it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>NINETEENTH EVENING</p>
              <p> &quot;I come from Rome,&quot; said the Moon. &quot;In the midst 
                of the city, upon<br>
                one of the seven hills, lie the ruins of the imperial palace. 
                The wild<br>
                fig tree grows in the clefts of the wall, and covers the nakedness<br>
                thereof with its broad grey-green leaves; trampling among heaps 
                of<br>
                rubbish, the ass treads upon green laurels, and rejoices over 
                the rank<br>
                thistles. From this spot, whence the eagles of Rome once flew<br>
                abroad, whence they 'came, saw, and conquered,' our door leads 
                into<br>
                a little mean house, built of clay between two pillars; the wild<br>
                vine hangs like a mourning garland over the crooked window. An 
                old<br>
                woman and her little granddaughter live there: they rule now in 
                the<br>
                palace of the Caesars, and show to strangers the remains of its 
                past<br>
                glories. Of the splendid throne-hall only a naked wall yet stands, 
                and<br>
                a black cypress throws its dark shadow on the spot where the throne<br>
                once stood. The dust lies several feet deep on the broken pavement;<br>
                and the little maiden, now the daughter of the imperial palace,<br>
                often sits there on her stool when the evening bells ring. The 
                keyhole<br>
                of the door close by she calls her turret window; through this 
                she can<br>
                see half Rome, as far as the mighty cupola of St. Peter's.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;On this evening, as usual, stillness reigned around; and 
                in the<br>
                full beam of my light came the little granddaughter. On her head 
                she<br>
                carried an earthen pitcher of antique shape filled with water. 
                Her<br>
                feet were bare, her short frock and her white sleeves were torn. 
                I<br>
                kissed her pretty round shoulders, her dark eyes, and black shining<br>
                hair. She mounted the stairs; they were steep, having been made 
                up<br>
                of rough blocks of broken marble and the capital of a fallen pillar.<br>
                The coloured lizards slipped away, startled, from before her feet, 
                but<br>
                she was not frightened at them. Already she lifted her hand to 
                pull<br>
                the door-bell- a hare's foot fastened to a string formed the<br>
                bell-handle of the imperial palace. She paused for a moment- of 
                what<br>
                might she be thinking? Perhaps of the beautiful Christ-child,<br>
                dressed in gold and silver, which was down below in the chapel,<br>
                where the silver candlesticks gleamed so bright, and where her<br>
                little friends sung the hymns in which she also could join? I 
                know<br>
                not. Presently she moved again- she stumbled: the earthen vessel<br>
                fell from her head, and broke on the marble steps. She burst into<br>
                tears. The beautiful daughter of the imperial palace wept over 
                the<br>
                worthless broken pitcher; with her bare feet she stood there<br>
                weeping; and dared not pull the string, the bell-rope of the<br>
                imperial palace!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>TWENTIETH EVENING</p>
              <p> It was more than a fortnight since the Moon had shone. Now he<br>
                stood once more, round and bright, above the clouds, moving slowly<br>
                onward. Hear what the Moon told me.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;From a town in Fezzan I followed a caravan. On the margin 
                of<br>
                the sandy desert, in a salt plain, that shone like a frozen lake,<br>
                and was only covered in spots with light drifting sand, a halt 
                was<br>
                made. The eldest of the company- the water gourd hung at his girdle,<br>
                and on his head was a little bag of unleavened bread- drew a square 
                in<br>
                the sand with his staff, and wrote in it a few words out of the 
                Koran,<br>
                and then the whole caravan passed over the consecrated spot. A 
                young merchant, a child of the East, as I could tell by his eye 
                and his<br>
                figure, rode pensively forward on his white snorting steed. Was 
                he<br>
                thinking, perchance, of his fair young wife? It was only two days<br>
                ago that the camel, adorned with furs and with costly shawls, 
                had<br>
                carried her, the beauteous bride, round the walls of the city, 
                while<br>
                drums and cymbals had sounded, the women sang, and festive shots, 
                of which the bridegroom fired the greatest number, resounded round 
                the camel; and now he was journeying with the caravan across the 
                desert.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;For many nights I followed the train. I saw them rest by 
                the<br>
                wellside among the stunted palms; they thrust the knife into the<br>
                breast of the camel that had fallen, and roasted its flesh by 
                the<br>
                fire. My beams cooled the glowing sands, and showed them the black<br>
                rocks, dead islands in the immense ocean of sand. No hostile tribes<br>
                met them in their pathless route, no storms arose, no columns 
                of<br>
                sand whirled destruction over the journeying caravan. At home 
                the<br>
                beautiful wife prayed for her husband and her father. 'Are they 
                dead?'<br>
                she asked of my golden crescent; 'Are they dead?' she cried to 
                my full disc. Now the desert lies behind them. This evening they 
                sit beneath the lofty palm trees, where the crane flutters round 
                them with its long wings, and the pelican watches them from the 
                branches of the<br>
                mimosa. The luxuriant herbage is trampled down, crushed by the 
                feet of elephants. A troop of negroes are returning from a market 
                in the<br>
                interior of the land: the women, with copper buttons in their 
                black<br>
                hair, and decked out in clothes dyed with indigo, drive the<br>
                heavily-laden oxen, on whose backs slumber the naked black children. 
                A negro leads a young lion which he has brought, by a string. 
                They approach the caravan; the young merchant sits pensive and 
                motionless, thinking of his beautiful wife, dreaming, in the land 
                of<br>
                the blacks, of his white lily beyond the desert. He raises his 
                head,<br>
                and- &quot; But at this moment a cloud passed before the Moon, 
                and then<br>
                another. I heard nothing more from him this evening.<br>
              </p>
              <p>TWENTY-FIRST EVENING</p>
              <p> &quot;I saw a little girl weeping,&quot; said the Moon; &quot;she 
                was weeping<br>
                over the depravity of the world. She had received a most beautiful<br>
                doll as a present. Oh, that was a glorious doll, so fair and delicate!<br>
                She did not seem created for the sorrows of this world. But the<br>
                brothers of the little girl, those great naughty boys, had set 
                the<br>
                doll high up in the branches of a tree and had run away.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The little girl could not reach up to the doll, and could 
                not<br>
                help her down, and that is why she was crying. The doll must certainly 
                have been crying too, for she stretched out her arms among the 
                green branches, and looked quite mournful. Yes, these are the 
                troubles of life of which the little girl had often heard tell. 
                Alas, poor doll! it began to grow dark already; and suppose night 
                were to come on completely! Was she to be left sitting on the 
                bough all night long?<br>
                No, the little maid could not make up her mind to that. 'I'll 
                stay<br>
                with you,' she said, although she felt anything but happy in her 
                mind.<br>
                She could almost fancy she distinctly saw little gnomes, with 
                their<br>
                high-crowned hats, sitting in the bushes; and further back in 
                the long<br>
                walk, tall spectres appeared to be dancing. They came nearer and<br>
                nearer, and stretched out their hands towards the tree on which 
                the<br>
                doll sat; they laughed scornfully, and pointed at her with their<br>
                fingers. Oh, how frightened the little maid was! 'But if one has 
                not<br>
                done anything wrong,' she thought, 'nothing evil can harm one. 
                I<br>
                wonder if I have done anything wrong?' And she considered. 'Oh, 
                yes! I laughed at the poor duck with the red rag on her leg; she 
                limped along so funnily, I could not help laughing; but it's a 
                sin to laugh at<br>
                animals.' And she looked up at the doll. 'Did you laugh at the 
                duck<br>
                too?' she asked; and it seemed as if the doll shook her head.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>TWENTY-SECOND EVENING</p>
              <p> &quot;I looked down upon Tyrol,&quot; said the Moon, &quot;and 
                my beams caused<br>
                the dark pines to throw long shadows upon the rocks. I looked 
                at the<br>
                pictures of St. Christopher carrying the Infant Jesus that are 
                painted<br>
                there upon the walls of the houses, colossal figures reaching 
                from the<br>
                ground to the roof. St. Florian was represented pouring water 
                on the<br>
                burning house, and the Lord hung bleeding on the great cross by 
                the<br>
                wayside. To the present generation these are old pictures, but 
                I saw<br>
                when they were put up, and marked how one followed the other. 
                On the brow of the mountain yonder is perched, like a swallow's 
                nest, a<br>
                lonely convent of nuns. Two of the sisters stood up in the tower<br>
                tolling the bell; they were both young, and therefore their glances<br>
                flew over the mountain out into the world. A travelling coach 
                passed<br>
                by below, the postillion wound his horn, and the poor nuns looked<br>
                after the carriage for a moment with a mournful glance, and a 
                tear<br>
                gleamed in the eyes of the younger one. And the horn sounded faint 
                and more faintly, and the convent bell drowned its expiring echoes.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>TWENTY-THIRD EVENING</p>
              <p> Hear what the Moon told me. &quot;Some years ago, here in Copenhagen, 
                I looked through the window of a mean little room. The father 
                and mother slept, but the little son was not asleep. I saw the 
                flowered cotton curtains of the bed move, and the child peep forth. 
                At first I thought he was looking at the great clock, which was 
                gaily painted in red and green. At the top sat a cuckoo, below 
                hung the heavy leaden<br>
                weights, and the pendulum with the polished disc of metal went 
                to<br>
                and fro, and said 'tick, tick.' But no, he was not looking at 
                the<br>
                clock, but at his mother's spinning wheel, that stood just<br>
                underneath it. That was the boy's favourite piece of furniture, 
                but he<br>
                dared not touch it, for if he meddled with it he got a rap on 
                the<br>
                knuckles. For hours together, when his mother was spinning, he 
                would sit quietly by her side, watching the murmuring spindle 
                and the<br>
                revolving wheel, and as he sat he thought of many things. Oh, 
                if he<br>
                might only turn the wheel himself! Father and mother were asleep; 
                he<br>
                looked at them, and looked at the spinning wheel, and presently 
                a<br>
                little naked foot peered out of the bed, and then a second foot, 
                and<br>
                then two little white legs. There he stood. He looked round once 
                more, to see if father and mother were still asleep- yes, they 
                slept; and<br>
                now he crept softly, softly, in his short little nightgown, to 
                the<br>
                spinning wheel, and began to spin. The thread flew from the wheel, 
                and the wheel whirled faster and faster. I kissed his fair hair 
                and his<br>
                blue eyes, it was such a pretty picture.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;At that moment the mother awoke. The curtain shook, she 
                looked<br>
                forth, and fancied she saw a gnome or some other kind of little<br>
                spectre. 'In Heaven's name!' she cried, and aroused her husband 
                in a<br>
                frightened way. He opened his eyes, rubbed them with his hands, 
                and<br>
                looked at the brisk little lad. 'Why, that is Bertel,' said he. 
                And my<br>
                eye quitted the poor room, for I have so much to see. At the same<br>
                moment I looked at the halls of the Vatican, where the marble 
                gods are enthroned. I shone upon the group of the Laocoon; the 
                stone seemed to sigh. I pressed a silent kiss on the lips of the 
                Muses, and they seemed to stir and move. But my rays lingered 
                longest about the Nile group with the colossal god. Leaning against 
                the Sphinx, he lies there thoughtful and meditative, as if he 
                were thinking on the rolling<br>
                centuries; and little love-gods sport with him and with the<br>
                crocodiles. In the horn of plenty sat with folded arms a little 
                tiny<br>
                love-god, contemplating the great solemn river-god, a true picture<br>
                of the boy at the spinning wheel- the features were exactly the<br>
                same. Charming and life-like stood the little marble form, and 
                yet the<br>
                wheel of the year has turned more than a thousand times since 
                the time when it sprang forth from the stone. Just as often as 
                the boy in the little room turned the spinning wheel had the great 
                wheel murmured, before the age could again call forth marble gods 
                equal to those he afterwards formed.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Years have passed since all this happened,&quot; the Moon 
                went on to<br>
                say. &quot;Yesterday I looked upon a bay on the eastern coast 
                of Denmark.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Glorious woods are there, and high trees, an old knightly castle<br>
                with red walls, swans floating in the ponds, and in the background<br>
                appears, among orchards, a little town with a church. Many boats,<br>
                the crews all furnished with torches, glided over the silent<br>
                expanse- but these fires had not been kindled for catching fish, 
                for<br>
                everything had a festive look. Music sounded, a song was sung, 
                and<br>
                in one of the boats the man stood erect to whom homage was paid 
                by the rest, a tall sturdy man, wrapped in a cloak. He had blue 
                eyes and long white hair. I knew him, and thought of the Vatican, 
                and of the group of the Nile, and the old marble gods. I thought 
                of the simple little room where little Bertel sat in his night-shirt 
                by the spinning wheel.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The wheel of time has turned, and new gods have come forth from 
                the stone. From the boats there arose a shout: 'Hurrah, hurrah 
                for<br>
                Bertel Thorwaldsen!'&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>TWENTY-FOURTH EVENING</p>
              <p> &quot;I will now give you a picture from Frankfort,&quot; said 
                the Moon.<br>
                &quot;I especially noticed one building there. It was not the 
                house in<br>
                which Goethe was born, nor the old Council House, through whose 
                grated windows peered the horns of the oxen that were roasted 
                and given to the people when the emperors were crowned. No, it 
                was a private house, plain in appearance, and painted green. It 
                stood near the old Jews' Street. It was Rothschild's house.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I looked through the open door. The staircase was brilliantly<br>
                lighted: servants carrying wax candles in massive silver<br>
                candlesticks stood there, and bowed low before an old woman, who 
                was being brought downstairs in a litter. The proprietor of the 
                house<br>
                stood bare-headed, and respectfully imprinted a kiss on the hand 
                of<br>
                the old woman. She was his mother. She nodded in a friendly manner<br>
                to him and to the servants, and they carried her into the dark<br>
                narrow street, into a little house, that was her dwelling. Here 
                her<br>
                children had been born, from hence the fortune of the family had<br>
                arisen. If she deserted the despised street and the little house,<br>
                fortune would also desert her children. That was her firm belief.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Moon told me no more; his visit this evening was far too<br>
                short. But I thought of the old woman in the narrow despised street.<br>
                It would have cost her but a word, and a brilliant house would 
                have<br>
                arisen for her on the banks of the Thames- a word, and a villa 
                would<br>
                have been prepared in the Bay of Naples.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;If I deserted the lowly house, where the fortunes of my 
                sons<br>
                first began to bloom, fortune would desert them!&quot; It was 
                a<br>
                superstition, but a superstition of such a class, that he who 
                knows<br>
                the story and has seen this picture, need have only two words 
                placed<br>
                under the picture to make him understand it; and these two words<br>
                are: &quot;A mother.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>TWENTY-FIFTH EVENING</p>
              <p> &quot;It was yesterday, in the morning twilight&quot;- these 
                are the words<br>
                the Moon told me- &quot;in the great city no chimney was yet smoking- 
                and it was just at the chimneys that I was looking. Suddenly a 
                little head emerged from one of them, and then half a body, the 
                arms resting on the rim of the chimney-pot. 'Ya-hip! ya-hip!' 
                cried a voice. It was the little chimney-sweeper, who had for 
                the first time in his life<br>
                crept through a chimney, and stuck out his head at the top. 'Ya-hip!<br>
                ya-hip' Yes, certainly that was a very different thing to creeping<br>
                about in the dark narrow chimneys! the air blew so fresh, and 
                he could look over the whole city towards the green wood. The 
                sun was just rising. It shone round and great, just in his face, 
                that beamed with<br>
                triumph, though it was very prettily blacked with soot.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'The whole town can see me now,' he exclaimed, 'and the 
                moon<br>
                can see me now, and the sun too. Ya-hip! ya-hip!' And he flourished<br>
                his broom in triumph.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>TWENTY-SIXTH EVENING</p>
              <p> &quot;Last night I looked down upon a town in China,&quot; said 
                the Moon.<br>
                &quot;My beams irradiated the naked walls that form the streets 
                there.<br>
                Now and then, certainly, a door is seen; but it is locked, for 
                what<br>
                does the Chinaman care about the outer world? Close wooden shutters 
                covered the windows behind the walls of the houses; but through 
                the windows of the temple a faint light glimmered. I looked in, 
                and saw the quaint decorations within. From the floor to the ceiling<br>
                pictures are painted, in the most glaring colours, and richly 
                gilt-<br>
                pictures representing the deeds of the gods here on earth. In 
                each<br>
                niche statues are placed, but they are almost entirely hidden 
                by the<br>
                coloured drapery and the banners that hang down. Before each idol 
                (and they are all made of tin) stood a little altar of holy water, 
                with<br>
                flowers and burning wax lights on it. Above all the rest stood 
                Fo, the<br>
                chief deity, clad in a garment of yellow silk, for yellow is here<br>
                the sacred colour. At the foot of the altar sat a living being, 
                a<br>
                young priest. He appeared to be praying, but in the midst of his<br>
                prayer he seemed to fall into deep thought, and this must have 
                been<br>
                wrong, for his cheeks glowed and he held down his head. Poor<br>
                Soui-Hong! Was he, perhaps, dreaming of working in the little 
                flower<br>
                garden behind the high street wall? And did that occupation seem<br>
                more agreeable to him than watching the wax lights in the temple? 
                Or<br>
                did he wish to sit at the rich feast, wiping his mouth with silver<br>
                paper between each course? Or was his sin so great that, if he 
                dared<br>
                utter it, the Celestial Empire would punish it with death? Had 
                his<br>
                thoughts ventured to fly with the ships of the barbarians, to 
                their<br>
                homes in far distant England? No, his thoughts did not fly so 
                far, and<br>
                yet they were sinful, sinful as thoughts born of young hearts,<br>
                sinful here in the temple, in the presence of Fo and the other 
                holy<br>
                gods.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I know whither his thoughts had strayed. At the farther 
                end of<br>
                the city, on the flat roof paved with porcelain, on which stood 
                the<br>
                handsome vases covered with painted flowers, sat the beauteous 
                Pu,<br>
                of the little roguish eyes, of the full lips, and of the tiny 
                feet.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The tight shoe pained her, but her heart pained her still more. 
                She<br>
                lifted her graceful round arm, and her satin dress rustled. Before 
                her<br>
                stood a glass bowl containing four gold-fish. She stirred the 
                bowl<br>
                carefully with a slender lacquered stick, very slowly, for she, 
                too,<br>
                was lost in thought. Was she thinking, perchance, how the fishes<br>
                were richly clothed in gold, how they lived calmly and peacefully 
                in<br>
                their crystal world, how they were regularly fed, and yet how 
                much<br>
                happier they might be if they were free? Yes, that she could well<br>
                understand, the beautiful Pu. Her thoughts wandered away from 
                her<br>
                home, wandered to the temple, but not for the sake of holy things.<br>
                Poor Pu! Poor Soui-hong!<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Their earthly thoughts met, but my cold beam lay between 
                the two,<br>
                like the sword of the cherub.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>TWENTY-SEVENTH EVENING</p>
              <p> &quot;The air was calm,&quot; said the Moon; &quot;the water 
                was transparent as<br>
                the purest ether through which I was gliding, and deep below the<br>
                surface I could see the strange plants that stretched up their 
                long<br>
                arms towards me like the gigantic trees of the forest. The fishes 
                swam<br>
                to and fro above their tops. High in the air a flight of wild 
                swans<br>
                were winging their way, one of which sank lower and lower, with<br>
                wearied pinions, his eyes following the airy caravan, that melted<br>
                farther and farther into the distance. With outspread wings he 
                sank<br>
                slowly, as a soap bubble sinks in the still air, till he touched 
                the<br>
                water. At length his head lay back between his wings, and silently<br>
                he lay there, like a white lotus flower upon the quiet lake. And 
                a<br>
                gentle wind arose, and crisped the quiet surface, which gleamed 
                like<br>
                the clouds that poured along in great broad waves; and the swan 
                raised his head, and the glowing water splashed like blue fire 
                over his<br>
                breast and back. The morning dawn illuminated the red clouds, 
                the swan rose strengthened, and flew towards the rising sun, towards 
                the bluish coast whither the caravan had gone; but he flew alone, 
                with a<br>
                longing in his breast. Lonely he flew over the blue swelling billows.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>TWENTY-EIGHTH EVENING</p>
              <p> &quot;I will give you another picture of Sweden,&quot; said 
                the Moon. &quot;Among<br>
                dark pine woods, near the melancholy banks of the Stoxen, lies 
                the old convent church of Wreta. My rays glided through the grating 
                into the roomy vaults, where kings sleep tranquilly in great stone 
                coffins.<br>
                On the wall, above the grave of each, is placed the emblem of<br>
                earthly grandeur, a kingly crown; but it is made only of wood, 
                painted<br>
                and gilt, and is hung on a wooden peg driven into the wall. The<br>
                worms have gnawed the gilded wood, the spider has spun her web 
                from the crown down to the sand, like a mourning banner, frail 
                and<br>
                transient as the grief of mortals. How quietly they sleep! I can<br>
                remember them quite plainly. I still see the bold smile on their 
                lips,<br>
                that so strongly and plainly expressed joy or grief. When the<br>
                steamboat winds along like a magic snail over the lakes, a stranger<br>
                often comes to the church, and visits the burial vault; he asks 
                the<br>
                names of the kings, and they have a dead and forgotten sound. 
                He<br>
                glances with a smile at the worm-eaten crowns, and if he happens 
                to be a pious, thoughtful man, something of melancholy mingles 
                with the<br>
                smile. Slumber on, ye dead ones! The Moon thinks of you, the Moon 
                at night sends down his rays into your silent kingdom, over which 
                hangs the crown of pine wood.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>TWENTY-NINTH EVENING</p>
              <p> &quot;Close by the high-road,&quot; said the Moon, &quot;is 
                an inn, and<br>
                opposite to it is a great waggon-shed, whose straw roof was just 
                being re-thatched. I looked down between the bare rafters and 
                through the open loft into the comfortless space below. The turkey-cock 
                slept on the beam, and the saddle rested in the empty crib. In 
                the middle of the shed stood a travelling carriage; the proprietor 
                was inside, fast asleep, while the horses were being watered. 
                The coachman stretched himself, though I am very sure that he 
                had been most comfortably asleep half the last stage. The door 
                of the servants' room stood open, and the bed looked as if it 
                had been turned over and over; the candle stood on the floor, 
                and had burnt deep down into the socket. The wind blew cold through 
                the shed: it was nearer to the dawn than to midnight. In the wooden 
                frame on the ground slept a wandering family of musicians. The 
                father and mother seemed to be dreaming of the burning liquor 
                that remained in the bottle. The little pale daughter was dreaming 
                too, for her eyes were wet with tears. The harp stood at their 
                heads, and the dog lay stretched at their feet.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>THIRTIETH EVENING</p>
              <p> &quot;It was in a little provincial town,&quot; the Moon said; 
                &quot;it certainly<br>
                happened last year, but that has nothing to do with the matter. 
                I<br>
                saw it quite plainly. To-day I read about it in the papers, but<br>
                there it was not half so clearly expressed. In the taproom of 
                the<br>
                little inn sat the bear leader, eating his supper; the bear was 
                tied<br>
                up outside, behind the wood pile- poor Bruin, who did nobody any 
                harm, though he looked grim enough. Up in the garret three little 
                children were playing by the light of my beams; the eldest was 
                perhaps six years old, the youngest certainly not more than two. 
                'Tramp, tramp'- somebody was coming upstairs: who might it be? 
                The door was thrust open- it was Bruin, the great, shaggy Bruin! 
                He had got tired of waiting down in the courtyard, and had found 
                his way to the stairs.<br>
              </p>
              <p>I saw it all,&quot; said the Moon. &quot;The children were very 
                much<br>
                frightened at first at the great shaggy animal; each of them crept<br>
                into a corner, but he found them all out, and smelt at them, but 
                did<br>
                them no harm. 'This must be a great dog,' they said, and began 
                to<br>
                stroke him. He lay down upon the ground, the youngest boy clambered 
                on his back, and bending down a little head of golden curls, played 
                at hiding in the beast's shaggy skin. Presently the eldest boy 
                took his drum, and beat upon it till it rattled again; the bear 
                rose upon his hind legs, and began to dance. It was a charming 
                sight to behold. Each boy now took his gun, and the bear was obliged 
                to have one too, and he held it up quite properly. Here was a 
                capital playmate they had found; and they began marching- one, 
                two; one, two.<br>
                &quot;Suddenly some one came to the door, which opened, and the<br>
                mother of the children appeared. You should have seen her in her<br>
                dumb terror, with her face as white as chalk, her mouth half open, 
                and<br>
                her eyes fixed in a horrified stare. But the youngest boy nodded 
                to<br>
                her in great glee, and called out in his infantile prattle, 'We're<br>
                playing at soldiers.' And then the bear leader came running up.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>THIRTY-FIRST EVENING</p>
              <p> The wind blew stormy and cold, the clouds flew hurriedly past;<br>
                only for a moment now and then did the Moon become visible. He 
                said, &quot;I looked down from the silent sky upon the driving 
                clouds, and saw the great shadows chasing each other across the 
                earth. I looked upon a prison. A closed carriage stood before 
                it; a prisoner was to be<br>
                carried away. My rays pierced through the grated window towards 
                the wall; the prisoner was scratching a few lines upon it, as 
                a parting<br>
                token; but he did not write words, but a melody, the outpouring 
                of his<br>
                heart. The door was opened, and he was led forth, and fixed his 
                eyes<br>
                upon my round disc. Clouds passed between us, as if he were not 
                to see his face, nor I his. He stepped into the carriage, the 
                door was<br>
                closed, the whip cracked, and the horses gallopped off into the<br>
                thick forest, whither my rays were not able to follow him; but 
                as I<br>
                glanced through the grated window, my rays glided over the notes,<br>
                his last farewell engraved on the prison wall- where words fail,<br>
                sounds can often speak. My rays could only light up isolated notes, 
                so the greater part of what was written there will ever remain 
                dark to<br>
                me. Was it the death-hymn he wrote there? Were these the glad 
                notes of joy? Did he drive away to meet death, or hasten to the 
                embraces of his beloved? The rays of the Moon do not read all 
                that is written by<br>
                mortals.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>THIRTY-SECOND EVENING</p>
              <p> &quot;I love the children,&quot; said the Moon, &quot;especially 
                the quite little<br>
                ones- they are so droll. Sometimes I peep into the room, between 
                the<br>
                curtain and the window frame, when they are not thinking of me. 
                It<br>
                gives me pleasure to see them dressing and undressing. First, 
                the<br>
                little round naked shoulder comes creeping out of the frock, then<br>
                the arm; or I see how the stocking is drawn off, and a plump little<br>
                white leg makes its appearance, and a white little foot that is 
                fit to<br>
                be kissed, and I kiss it too.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But about what I was going to tell you. This evening I 
                looked<br>
                through a window, before which no curtain was drawn, for nobody<br>
                lives opposite. I saw a whole troop of little ones, all of one 
                family,<br>
                and among them was a little sister. She is only four years old, 
                but<br>
                can say her prayers as well as any of the rest. The mother sits 
                by her<br>
                bed every evening, and hears her say her prayers; and then she 
                has a<br>
                kiss, and the mother sits by the bed till the little one has gone 
                to<br>
                sleep, which generally happens as soon as ever she can close her 
                eyes.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;This evening the two elder children were a little boisterous. 
                One<br>
                of them hopped about on one leg in his long white nightgown, and 
                the<br>
                other stood on a chair surrounded by the clothes of all the<br>
                children, and declared he was acting Grecian statues. The third 
                and<br>
                fourth laid the clean linen carefully in the box, for that is 
                a<br>
                thing that has to be done; and the mother sat by the bed of the<br>
                youngest, and announced to all the rest that they were to be quiet,<br>
                for little sister was going to say her prayers.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I looked in, over the lamp, into the little maiden's bed, 
                where<br>
                she lay under the neat white coverlet, her hands folded demurely 
                and<br>
                her little face quite grave and serious. She was praying the Lord's<br>
                prayer aloud. But her mother interrupted her in the middle of 
                her<br>
                prayer. 'How is it,' she asked, 'that when you have prayed for 
                daily<br>
                bread, you always add something I cannot understand? You must 
                tell<br>
                me what that is.' The little one lay silent, and looked at her<br>
                mother in embarrassment. 'What is it you say after our daily bread?'<br>
                'Dear mother, don't be angry: I only said, and plenty of butter 
                on<br>
                it.'&quot;</p>

              <p class="h" align="center"> THE JEWISH MAIDEN</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> IN a charity school, among the children, sat a little Jewish 
                girl.<br>
                She was a good, intelligent child, and very quick at her lessons;<br>
                but the Scripture-lesson class she was not allowed to join, for 
                this<br>
                was a Christian school. During the hour of this lesson, the Jewish<br>
                girl was allowed to learn her geography, or to work her sum for 
                the<br>
                next day; and when her geography lesson was perfect, the book 
                remained<br>
                open before her, but she read not another word, for she sat silently<br>
                listening to the words of the Christian teacher. He soon became<br>
                aware that the little one was paying more attention to what he 
                said<br>
                than most of the other children. &quot;Read your book, Sarah,&quot; 
                he said to<br>
                her gently.<br>
                But again and again he saw her dark, beaming eyes fixed upon<br>
                him; and once, when he asked her a question, she could answer 
                him even<br>
                better than the other children. She had not only heard, but understood<br>
                his words, and pondered them in her heart. Her father, a poor 
                but<br>
                honest man, had placed his daughter at the school on the conditions<br>
                that she should not be instructed in the Christian faith. But 
                it might<br>
                have caused confusion, or raised discontent in the minds of the<br>
                other children if she had been sent out of the room, so she<br>
                remained; and now it was evident this could not go on. The teacher<br>
                went to her father, and advised him to remove his daughter from 
                the<br>
                school, or to allow her to become a Christian. &quot;I cannot 
                any longer be<br>
                an idle spectator of those beaming eyes, which express such a 
                deep and<br>
                earnest longing for the words of the gospel,&quot; said he.<br>
                Then the father burst into tears. &quot;I know very little of 
                the law<br>
                of my fathers,&quot; said he; &quot;but Sarah's mother was firm 
                in her belief as<br>
                a daughter of Israel, and I vowed to her on her deathbed that 
                our<br>
                child should never be baptized. I must keep my vow: it is to me 
                even<br>
                as a covenant with God Himself.&quot; And so the little Jewish 
                girl left<br>
                the Christian school.<br>
                Years rolled by. In one of the smallest provincial towns, in a<br>
                humble household, lived a poor maiden of the Jewish faith, as 
                a<br>
                servant. Her hair was black as ebony, her eye dark as night, yet<br>
                full of light and brilliancy so peculiar to the daughters of the 
                east.<br>
                It was Sarah. The expression in the face of the grown-up maiden 
                was<br>
                still the same as when, a child, she sat on the schoolroom form<br>
                listening with thoughtful eyes to the words of the Christian<br>
                teacher. Every Sunday there sounded forth from a church close 
                by the<br>
                tones of an organ and the singing of the congregation. The Jewish 
                girl<br>
                heard them in the house where, industrious and faithful in all 
                things,<br>
                she performed her household duties. &quot;Thou shalt keep the 
                Sabbath<br>
                holy,&quot; said the voice of the law in her heart; but her Sabbath 
                was a<br>
                working day among the Christians, which was a great trouble to 
                her.<br>
                And then as the thought arose in her mind, &quot;Does God reckon 
                by days<br>
                and hours?&quot; her conscience felt satisfied on this question, 
                and she<br>
                found it a comfort to her, that on the Christian Sabbath she could<br>
                have an hour for her own prayers undisturbed. The music and singing 
                of<br>
                the congregation sounded in her ears while at work in her kitchen,<br>
                till the place itself became sacred to her. Then she would read 
                in the<br>
                Old Testament, that treasure and comfort to her people, and it 
                was<br>
                indeed the only Scriptures she could read. Faithfully in her inmost<br>
                thoughts had she kept the words of her father to her teacher when<br>
                she left the school, and the vow he had made to her dying mother<br>
                that she should never receive Christian baptism. The New Testament<br>
                must remain to her a sealed book, and yet she knew a great deal 
                of its<br>
                teaching, and the sound of the gospel truths still lingered among<br>
                the recollections of her childhood.<br>
                One evening she was sitting in a corner of the dining-room,<br>
                while her master read aloud. It was not the gospel he read, but 
                an old<br>
                story-book; therefore she might stay and listen to him. The story<br>
                related that a Hungarian knight, who had been taken prisoner by 
                a<br>
                Turkish pasha, was most cruelly treated by him. He caused him 
                to be<br>
                yoked with his oxen to the plough, and driven with blows from 
                the whip<br>
                till the blood flowed, and he almost sunk with exhaustion and 
                pain.<br>
                The faithful wife of the knight at home gave up all her jewels,<br>
                mortgaged her castle and land, and his friends raised large sums 
                to<br>
                make up the ransom demanded for his release, which was most enormously<br>
                high. It was collected at last, and the knight released from slavery<br>
                and misery. Sick and exhausted, he reached home.<br>
                Ere long came another summons to a struggle with the foes of<br>
                Christianity. The still living knight heard the sound; he could 
                endure<br>
                no more, he had neither peace nor rest. He caused himself to be 
                lifted<br>
                on his war-horse; the color came into his cheeks, and his strength<br>
                returned to him again as he went forth to battle and to victory. 
                The<br>
                very same pasha who had yoked him to the plough, became his<br>
                prisoner, and was dragged to a dungeon in the castle. But an hour<br>
                had scarcely passed, when the knight stood before the captive 
                pasha,<br>
                and inquired, &quot;What do you suppose awaiteth thee?&quot;<br>
                &quot;I know,&quot; replied the pasha; &quot;retribution.&quot;<br>
                &quot;Yes, the retribution of a Christian,&quot; replied the knight. 
                &quot;The<br>
                teaching of Christ, the Teacher, commands us to forgive our enemies,<br>
                to love our neighbors; for God is love. Depart in peace: return 
                to thy<br>
                home. I give thee back to thy loved ones. But in future be mild 
                and<br>
                humane to all who are in trouble.&quot;<br>
                Then the prisoner burst into tears, and exclaimed, &quot;Oh how 
                could I<br>
                imagine such mercy and forgiveness! I expected pain and torment. 
                It<br>
                seemed to me so sure that I took poison, which I secretly carried<br>
                about me; and in a few hours its effects will destroy me. I must<br>
                die! Nothing can save me! But before I die, explain to me the 
                teaching<br>
                which is so full of love and mercy, so great and God-like. Oh, 
                that<br>
                I may hear his teaching, and die a Christian!&quot; And his prayer 
                was<br>
                granted.<br>
                This was the legend which the master read out of the old<br>
                story-book. Every one in the house who was present listened, and<br>
                shared the pleasure; but Sarah, the Jewish girl, sitting so still 
                in a<br>
                corner, felt her heart burn with excitement. Great tears came 
                into her<br>
                shining dark eyes; and with the same gentle piety with which she 
                had<br>
                once listened to the gospel while sitting on the form at school, 
                she<br>
                felt its grandeur now, and the tears rolled down her cheeks. Then<br>
                the last words of her dying mother rose before her, &quot;Let 
                not my<br>
                child become a Christian;&quot; and with them sounded in her heart 
                the<br>
                words of the law, &quot;Honor thy father and thy mother.&quot;<br>
                &quot;I am not admitted among the Christians,&quot; she said; 
                &quot;they mock<br>
                me as a Jewish girl; the neighbors' boys did so last Sunday when 
                I<br>
                stood looking in through the open church door at the candles burning<br>
                on the altar, and listening to the singing. Ever since I sat on 
                the<br>
                school-bench I have felt the power of Christianity; a power which,<br>
                like a sunbeam, streams into my heart, however closely I may close<br>
                my eyes against it. But I will not grieve thee, my mother, in 
                thy<br>
                grave. I will not be unfaithful to my father's vow. I will not 
                read<br>
                the Bible of the Christian. I have the God of my fathers, and 
                in Him I<br>
                will trust.&quot;<br>
                And again years passed by. Sarah's master died, and his widow<br>
                found herself in such reduced circumstances that she wished to 
                dismiss<br>
                her servant maid; but Sarah refused to leave the house, and she 
                became<br>
                a true support in time of trouble, and kept the household together<br>
                by working till late at night, with her busy hands, to earn their<br>
                daily bread. Not a relative came forward to assist them, and the 
                widow<br>
                was confined to a sick bed for months and grew weaker from day 
                to day.<br>
                Sarah worked hard, but contrived to spare time to amuse her and<br>
                watch by the sick bed. She was gentle and pious, an angel of<br>
                blessing in that house of poverty.<br>
                &quot;My Bible lies on the table yonder,&quot; said the sick woman 
                one day<br>
                to Sarah. &quot;Read me something from it; the night appears so 
                long, and<br>
                my spirit thirsts to hear the word of God.&quot;<br>
                And Sarah bowed her head. She took the book, and folded her hand<br>
                over the Bible of the Christians, and at last opened it, and read 
                to<br>
                the sick woman. Tears stood in her eyes as she read, and they 
                shone<br>
                with brightness, for in her heart it was light.<br>
                &quot;Mother,&quot; she murmured, &quot;thy child may not receive 
                Christian<br>
                baptism, nor be admitted into the congregation of Christian people.<br>
                Thou hast so willed it, and I will respect thy command. We are<br>
                therefore still united here on earth; but in the next world there 
                will<br>
                be a higher union, even with God Himself, who leads and guides 
                His<br>
                people till death. He came down from heaven to earth to suffer 
                for us,<br>
                that we should bring forth the fruits of repentance. I understand 
                it<br>
                now. I know not how I learnt this truth, unless it is through 
                the name<br>
                of Christ.&quot; Yet she trembled as she pronounced the holy name. 
                She<br>
                struggled against these convictions of the truth of Christianity 
                for<br>
                some days, till one evening while watching her mistress she was<br>
                suddenly taken very ill; her limbs tottered under her, and she 
                sank<br>
                fainting by the bedside of the sick woman.<br>
                &quot;Poor Sarah,&quot; said the neighbors; &quot;she is overcome 
                with hard<br>
                work and night watching.&quot; And then they carried her to the 
                hospital<br>
                for the sick poor. There she died; and they bore her to her<br>
                resting-place in the earth, but not to the churchyard of the<br>
                Christians. There was no place for the Jewish girl; but they dug 
                a<br>
                grave for her outside the wall. And God's sun, which shines upon 
                the<br>
                graves of the churchyard of the Christians, also throws its beams 
                on<br>
                the grave of the Jewish maiden beyond the wall. And when the psalms 
                of<br>
                the Christians sound across the churchyard, their echo reaches 
                her<br>
                lonely resting-place; and she who sleeps there will be counted<br>
                worthy at the resurrection, through the name of Christ the Lord, 
                who<br>
                said to His disciples, &quot;John baptized you with water, but 
                I will<br>
                baptize you with the Holy Ghost.&quot;</p>
              <p><br>

              <p  align="center"> FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN</p>
              <p class="h" align="center"> ANNE LISBETH</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> ANNE LISBETH was a beautiful young woman, with a red and white<br>
                complexion, glittering white teeth, and clear soft eyes; and her<br>
                footstep was light in the dance, but her mind was lighter still. 
                She<br>
                had a little child, not at all pretty; so he was put out to be<br>
                nursed by a laborer's wife, and his mother went to the count's 
                castle.<br>
                She sat in splendid rooms, richly decorated with silk and velvet;<br>
                not a breath of air was allowed to blow upon her, and no one was<br>
                allowed to speak to her harshly, for she was nurse to the count's<br>
                child. He was fair and delicate as a prince, and beautiful as 
                an<br>
                angel; and how she loved this child! Her own boy was provided 
                for by being at the laborer's where the mouth watered more frequently 
                than the pot boiled, and where in general no one was at home to 
                take care of the child. Then he would cry, but what nobody knows 
                nobody cares for; so he would cry till he was tired, and then 
                fall asleep; and while we are asleep we can feel neither hunger 
                nor thirst. Ah, yes; sleep is a capital invention.<br>
                <br>
                As years went on, Anne Lisbeth's child grew apace like weeds,<br>
                although they said his growth had been stunted. He had become 
                quite<br>
                a member of the family in which he dwelt; they received money 
                to<br>
                keep him, so that his mother got rid of him altogether. She had 
                become quite a lady; she had a comfortable home of her own in 
                the town; and out of doors, when she went for a walk, she wore 
                a bonnet; but she never walked out to see the laborer: that was 
                too far from the town, and, indeed, she had nothing to go for, 
                the boy now belonged to these laboring people. He had food, and 
                he could also do something towards earning his living; he took 
                care of Mary's red cow, for he knew how to tend cattle and make 
                himself useful.<br>
                <br>
                The great dog by the yard gate of a nobleman's mansion sits<br>
                proudly on the top of his kennel when the sun shines, and barks 
                at<br>
                every one that passes; but if it rains, he creeps into his house,<br>
                and there he is warm and dry. Anne Lisbeth's boy also sat in the<br>
                sunshine on the top of the fence, cutting out a little toy. If 
                it<br>
                was spring-time, he knew of three strawberry-plants in blossom,<br>
                which would certainly bear fruit. This was his most hopeful thought,<br>
                though it often came to nothing. And he had to sit out in the 
                rain<br>
                in the worst weather, and get wet to the skin, and let the cold 
                wind<br>
                dry the clothes on his back afterwards. If he went near the farmyard<br>
                belonging to the count, he was pushed and knocked about, for the 
                men and the maids said he was so horrible ugly; but he was used 
                to all this, for nobody loved him. This was how the world treated 
                Anne<br>
                Lisbeth's boy, and how could it be otherwise. It was his fate 
                to be<br>
                beloved by no one. Hitherto he had been a land crab; the land 
                at<br>
                last cast him adrift. He went to sea in a wretched vessel, and 
                sat<br>
                at the helm, while the skipper sat over the grog-can. He was dirty 
                and<br>
                ugly, half-frozen and half-starved; he always looked as if he 
                never<br>
                had enough to eat, which was really the case.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Late in the autumn, when the weather was rough, windy, and wet,<br>
                and the cold penetrated through the thickest clothing, especially 
                at<br>
                sea, a wretched boat went out to sea with only two men on board, 
                or,<br>
                more correctly, a man and a half, for it was the skipper and his<br>
                boy. There had only been a kind of twilight all day, and it soon<br>
                grew quite dark, and so bitterly cold, that the skipper took a 
                dram to<br>
                warm him. The bottle was old, and the glass too. It was perfect 
                in the<br>
                upper part, but the foot was broken off, and it had therefore 
                been<br>
                fixed upon a little carved block of wood, painted blue. A dram 
                is a<br>
                great comfort, and two are better still, thought the skipper, 
                while<br>
                the boy sat at the helm, which he held fast in his hard seamed<br>
                hands. He was ugly, and his hair was matted, and he looked crippled<br>
                and stunted; they called him the field-laborer's boy, though in 
                the<br>
                church register he was entered as Anne Lisbeth's son. The wind 
                cut<br>
                through the rigging, and the boat cut through the sea. The sails,<br>
                filled by the wind, swelled out and carried them along in wild 
                career.<br>
                It was wet and rough above and below, and might still be worse.<br>
                Hold! what is that? What has struck the boat? Was it a waterspout,<br>
                or a heavy sea rolling suddenly upon them?<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Heaven help us!&quot; cried the boy at the helm, as the 
                boat heeled<br>
                over and lay on its beam ends. It had struck on a rock, which 
                rose<br>
                from the depths of the sea, and sank at once, like an old shoe 
                in a<br>
                puddle. &quot;It sank at once with mouse and man,&quot; as the 
                saying is.<br>
                There might have been mice on board, but only one man and a half,<br>
                the skipper and the laborer's boy. No one saw it but the skimming<br>
                sea-gulls and the fishes beneath the water; and even they did 
                not<br>
                see it properly, for they darted back with terror as the boat 
                filled<br>
                with water and sank. There it lay, scarcely a fathom below the<br>
                surface, and those two were provided for, buried, and forgotten. 
                The<br>
                glass with the foot of blue wood was the only thing that did not 
                sink,<br>
                for the wood floated and the glass drifted away to be cast upon 
                the<br>
                shore and broken; where and when, is indeed of no consequence. 
                It<br>
                had served its purpose, and it had been loved, which Anne Lisbeth's<br>
                boy had not been. But in heaven no soul will be able to say, &quot;Never<br>
                loved.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Anne Lisbeth had now lived in the town many years; she was<br>
                called &quot;Madame,&quot; and felt dignified in consequence; 
                she remembered the old, noble days, in which she had driven in 
                the carriage, and had<br>
                associated with countess and baroness. Her beautiful, noble child<br>
                had been a dear angel, and possessed the kindest heart; he had 
                loved<br>
                her so much, and she had loved him in return; they had kissed 
                and<br>
                loved each other, and the boy had been her joy, her second life. 
                Now<br>
                he was fourteen years of age, tall, handsome, and clever. She 
                had<br>
                not seen him since she carried him in her arms; neither had she 
                been<br>
                for years to the count's palace; it was quite a journey thither 
                from<br>
                the town.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I must make one effort to go,&quot; said Anne Lisbeth, 
                &quot;to see my<br>
                darling, the count's sweet child, and press him to my heart. Certainly<br>
                he must long to see me, too, the young count; no doubt he thinks 
                of me and loves me, as in those days when he would fling his angel-arms<br>
                round my neck, and lisp 'Anne Liz.' It was music to my ears. Yes, 
                I<br>
                must make an effort to see him again.&quot; She drove across the 
                country in a grazier's cart, and then got out, and continued her 
                journey on foot, and thus reached the count's castle. It was as 
                great and magnificent as it had always been, and the garden looked 
                the same as ever; all the servants were strangers to her, not 
                one of them knew Anne Lisbeth, nor of what consequence she had 
                once been there; but she felt sure the countess would soon let 
                them know it, and her darling boy, too: how she longed to see 
                him!<br>
              </p>
              <p>Now that Anne Lisbeth was at her journey's end, she was kept<br>
                waiting a long time; and for those who wait, time passes slowly. 
                But<br>
                before the great people went in to dinner, she was called in and<br>
                spoken to very graciously. She was to go in again after dinner, 
                and<br>
                then she would see her sweet boy once more. How tall, and slender, 
                and thin he had grown; but the eyes and the sweet angel mouth 
                were still beautiful. He looked at her, but he did not speak, 
                he certainly did<br>
                not know who she was. He turned round and was going away, but 
                she seized his hand and pressed it to her lips.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well, well,&quot; he said; and with that he walked out 
                of the room. He<br>
                who filled her every thought! he whom she loved best, and who 
                was<br>
                her whole earthly pride!<br>
              </p>
              <p>Anne Lisbeth went forth from the castle into the public road,<br>
                feeling mournful and sad; he whom she had nursed day and night, 
                and<br>
                even now carried about in her dreams, had been cold and strange, 
                and had not a word or thought respecting her. A great black raven 
                darted down in front of her on the high road, and croaked dismally.<br>
                &quot;Ah,&quot; said she, &quot;what bird of ill omen art thou?&quot; 
                Presently she<br>
                passed the laborer's hut; his wife stood at the door, and the 
                two<br>
                women spoke to each other.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You look well,&quot; said the woman; &quot;you're fat and 
                plump; you are<br>
                well off.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh yes,&quot; answered Anne Lisbeth.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The boat went down with them,&quot; continued the woman; 
                &quot;Hans the<br>
                skipper and the boy were both drowned; so there's an end of them. 
                I<br>
                always thought the boy would be able to help me with a few dollars.<br>
                He'll never cost you anything more, Anne Lisbeth.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;So they were drowned,&quot; repeated Anne Lisbeth; but 
                she said no<br>
                more, and the subject was dropped. She felt very low-spirited, 
                because her count-child had shown no inclination to speak to her 
                who loved him so well, and who had travelled so far to see him. 
                The journey had cost money too, and she had derived no great pleasure 
                from it. Still she said not a word of all this; she could not 
                relieve her heart by telling the laborer's wife, lest the latter 
                should think she did not enjoy her former position at the castle. 
                Then the raven flew over her, screaming again as he flew.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The black wretch!&quot; said Anne Lisbeth, &quot;he will 
                end by frightening<br>
                me today.&quot; She had brought coffee and chicory with her, for 
                she<br>
                thought it would be a charity to the poor woman to give them to 
                her to boil a cup of coffee, and then she would take a cup herself.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The woman prepared the coffee, and in the meantime Anne Lisbeth<br>
                seated her in a chair and fell asleep. Then she dreamed of something<br>
                which she had never dreamed before; singularly enough she dreamed 
                of her own child, who had wept and hungered in the laborer's hut, 
                and had been knocked about in heat and in cold, and who was now 
                lying in the depths of the sea, in a spot only known by God. She 
                fancied she was still sitting in the hut, where the woman was 
                busy preparing the coffee, for she could smell the coffee-berries 
                roasting. But suddenly it seemed to her that there stood on the 
                threshold a<br>
                beautiful young form, as beautiful as the count's child, and this<br>
                apparition said to her, &quot;The world is passing away; hold 
                fast to me,<br>
                for you are my mother after all; you have an angel in heaven, 
                hold<br>
                me fast;&quot; and the child-angel stretched out his hand and 
                seized her.<br>
                Then there was a terrible crash, as of a world crumbling to pieces,<br>
                and the angel-child was rising from the earth, and holding her 
                by<br>
                the sleeve so tightly that she felt herself lifted from the ground;<br>
                but, on the other hand, something heavy hung to her feet and dragged<br>
                her down, and it seemed as if hundreds of women were clinging 
                to<br>
                her, and crying, &quot;If thou art to be saved, we must be saved 
                too.<br>
                Hold fast, hold fast.&quot; And then they all hung on her, but 
                there were<br>
                too many; and as they clung the sleeve was torn, and Anne Lisbeth 
                fell down in horror, and awoke. Indeed she was on the point of 
                falling over in reality with the chair on which she sat; but she 
                was so startled<br>
                and alarmed that she could not remember what she had dreamed, 
                only<br>
                that it was something very dreadful.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They drank their coffee and had a chat together, and then Anne<br>
                Lisbeth went away towards the little town where she was to meet 
                the<br>
                carrier, who was to drive her back to her own home. But when she<br>
                came to him she found that he would not be ready to start till 
                the<br>
                evening of the next day. Then she began to think of the expense, 
                and<br>
                what the distance would be to walk. She remembered that the route 
                by the sea-shore was two miles shorter than by the high road; 
                and as<br>
                the weather was clear, and there would be moonlight, she determined 
                to make her way on foot, and to start at once, that she might 
                reach<br>
                home the next day.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The sun had set, and the evening bells sounded through the air<br>
                from the tower of the village church, but to her it was not the 
                bells,<br>
                but the cry of the frogs in the marshes. Then they ceased, and 
                all<br>
                around became still; not a bird could be heard, they were all 
                at rest,<br>
                even the owl had not left her hiding place; deep silence reigned 
                on<br>
                the margin of the wood by the sea-shore. As Anne Lisbeth walked 
                on she could hear her own footsteps in the sands; even the waves 
                of the sea were at rest, and all in the deep waters had sunk into 
                silence.<br>
              </p>
              <p>There was quiet among the dead and the living in the deep sea. 
                Anne<br>
                Lisbeth walked on, thinking of nothing at all, as people say, 
                or<br>
                rather her thoughts wandered, but not away from her, for thought 
                is<br>
                never absent from us, it only slumbers. Many thoughts that have 
                lain<br>
                dormant are roused at the proper time, and begin to stir in the 
                mind<br>
                and the heart, and seem even to come upon us from above. It is<br>
                written, that a good deed bears a blessing for its fruit; and 
                it is<br>
                also written, that the wages of sin is death. Much has been said 
                and<br>
                much written which we pass over or know nothing of. A light arises<br>
                within us, and then forgotten things make themselves remembered; 
                and thus it was with Anne Lisbeth. The germ of every vice and 
                every virtue lies in our heart, in yours and in mine; they lie 
                like little grains<br>
                of seed, till a ray of sunshine, or the touch of an evil hand, 
                or<br>
                you turn the corner to the right or to the left, and the decision 
                is<br>
                made. The little seed is stirred, it swells and shoots up, and 
                pours<br>
                its sap into your blood, directing your course either for good 
                or<br>
                evil. Troublesome thoughts often exist in the mind, fermenting<br>
                there, which are not realized by us while the senses are as it 
                were<br>
                slumbering; but still they are there. Anne Lisbeth walked on thus 
                with<br>
                her senses half asleep, but the thoughts were fermenting within 
                her.<br>
                From one Shrove Tuesday to another, much may occur to weigh down 
                the heart; it is the reckoning of a whole year; much may be forgotten, 
                sins against heaven in word and thought, sins against our neighbor, 
                and against our own conscience. We are scarcely aware of their 
                existence; and Anne Lisbeth did not think of any of her errors. 
              </p>
              <p>She had committed no crime against the law of the land; she was 
                an<br>
                honorable person, in a good position- that she knew.<br>
              </p>
              <p>She continued her walk along by the margin of the sea. What was 
                it<br>
                she saw lying there? An old hat; a man's hat. Now when might that 
                have been washed overboard? She drew nearer, she stopped to look 
                at the hat; &quot;Ha! what was lying yonder?&quot; She shuddered; 
                yet it was nothing save a heap of grass and tangled seaweed flung 
                across a long stone, but it looked like a corpse. Only tangled 
                grass, and yet she was<br>
                frightened at it. As she turned to walk away, much came into her<br>
                mind that she had heard in her childhood: old superstitions of<br>
                spectres by the sea-shore; of the ghosts of drowned but unburied<br>
                people, whose corpses had been washed up on the desolate beach. 
              </p>
              <p>The body, she knew, could do no harm to any one, but the spirit 
                could pursue the lonely wanderer, attach itself to him, and demand 
                to be carried to the churchyard, that it might rest in consecrated 
                ground.<br>
                &quot;Hold fast! hold fast!&quot; the spectre would cry; and as 
                Anne Lisbeth<br>
                murmured these words to herself, the whole of her dream was suddenly 
                recalled to her memory, when the mother had clung to her, and 
                uttered these words, when, amid the crashing of worlds, her sleeve 
                had been torn, and she had slipped from the grasp of her child, 
                who wanted to hold her up in that terrible hour. Her child, her 
                own child, which she had never loved, lay now buried in the sea, 
                and might rise up, like a spectre, from the waters, and cry, &quot;Hold 
                fast; carry me<br>
                to consecrated ground!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>As these thoughts passed through her mind, fear gave speed to<br>
                her feet, so that she walked faster and faster. Fear came upon 
                her<br>
                as if a cold, clammy hand had been laid upon her heart, so that 
                she<br>
                almost fainted. As she looked across the sea, all there grew darker; 
                a<br>
                heavy mist came rolling onwards, and clung to bush and tree,<br>
                distorting them into fantastic shapes. She turned and glanced 
                at the<br>
                moon, which had risen behind her. It looked like a pale, rayless<br>
                surface, and a deadly weight seemed to hang upon her limbs. &quot;Hold,&quot;<br>
                thought she; and then she turned round a second time to look at 
                the<br>
                moon. A white face appeared quite close to her, with a mist, hanging<br>
                like a garment from its shoulders. &quot;Stop! carry me to consecrated<br>
                earth,&quot; sounded in her ears, in strange, hollow tones. The 
                sound did<br>
                not come from frogs or ravens; she saw no sign of such creatures. 
              </p>
              <p>&quot;A grave! dig me a grave!&quot; was repeated quite loud. 
                Yes, it was indeed the spectre of her child. The child that lay 
                beneath the ocean, and whose spirit could have no rest until it 
                was carried to the<br>
                churchyard, and until a grave had been dug for it in consecrated<br>
                ground. She would go there at once, and there she would dig. She<br>
                turned in the direction of the church, and the weight on her heart<br>
                seemed to grow lighter, and even to vanish altogether; but when 
                she<br>
                turned to go home by the shortest way, it returned. &quot;Stop! 
                stop!&quot;<br>
                and the words came quite clear, though they were like the croak 
                of a<br>
                frog, or the wail of a bird. &quot;A grave! dig me a grave!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The mist was cold and damp, her hands and face were moist and<br>
                clammy with horror, a heavy weight again seized her and clung 
                to<br>
                her, her mind became clear for thoughts that had never before 
                been<br>
                there.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In these northern regions, a beech-wood often buds in a single<br>
                night and appears in the morning sunlight in its full glory of<br>
                youthful green. So, in a single instant, can the consciousness 
                of<br>
                the sin that has been committed in thoughts, words, and actions 
                of our past life, be unfolded to us. When once the conscience 
                is awakened, it springs up in the heart spontaneously, and God 
                awakens the conscience when we least expect it. Then we can find 
                no excuse for ourselves; the deed is there and bears witness against 
                us. The<br>
                thoughts seem to become words, and to sound far out into the world. 
              </p>
              <p>We are horrified at the thought of what we have carried within 
                us, and at the consciousness that we have not overcome the evil 
                which has its<br>
                origin in thoughtlessness and pride. The heart conceals within<br>
                itself the vices as well as the virtues, and they grow in the 
                shallowest ground. Anne Lisbeth now experienced in thought what 
                we have clothed in words. She was overpowered by them, and sank 
                down<br>
                and crept along for some distance on the ground. &quot;A grave! 
                dig me a<br>
                grave!&quot; sounded again in her ears, and she would have gladly 
                buried<br>
                herself, if in the grave she could have found forgetfulness of 
                her<br>
                actions.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was the first hour of her awakening, full of anguish and<br>
                horror. Superstition made her alternately shudder with cold or 
                burn<br>
                with the heat of fever. Many things, of which she had feared even 
                to<br>
                speak, came into her mind. Silently, as the cloud-shadows in the<br>
                moonshine, a spectral apparition flitted by her; she had heard 
                of it<br>
                before. Close by her galloped four snorting steeds, with fire 
                flashing<br>
                from their eyes and nostrils. They dragged a burning coach, and 
                within it sat the wicked lord of the manor, who had ruled there 
                a hundred years before. The legend says that every night, at twelve 
                o'clock, he drove into his castleyard and out again. He was not 
                as pale as dead men are, but black as a coal. He nodded, and pointed 
                to </p>
              <p>Anne Lisbeth, crying out, &quot;Hold fast! hold fast! and then 
                you may ride again in a nobleman's carriage, and forget your child.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>She gathered herself up, and hastened to the churchyard; but 
                black<br>
                crosses and black ravens danced before her eyes, and she could 
                not<br>
                distinguish one from the other. The ravens croaked as the raven 
                had<br>
                done which she saw in the daytime, but now she understood what 
                they said. &quot;I am the raven-mother; I am the raven-mother,&quot; 
                each raven<br>
                croaked, and Anne Lisbeth felt that the name also applied to her;<br>
                and she fancied she should be transformed into a black bird, and<br>
                have to cry as they cried, if she did not dig the grave. And she 
                threw<br>
                herself upon the earth, and with her hands dug a grave in the 
                hard<br>
                ground, so that the blood ran from her fingers. &quot;A grave! 
                dig me a<br>
                grave!&quot; still sounded in her ears; she was fearful that the 
                cock might<br>
                crow, and the first red streak appear in the east, before she 
                had<br>
                finished her work; and then she would be lost. And the cock crowed,<br>
                and the day dawned in the east, and the grave was only half dug. 
                An<br>
                icy hand passed over her head and face, and down towards her heart.<br>
                &quot;Only half a grave,&quot; a voice wailed, and fled away. 
                Yes, it fled<br>
                away over the sea; it was the ocean spectre; and, exhausted and<br>
                overpowered, Anne Lisbeth sunk to the ground, and her senses left 
                her.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was a bright day when she came to herself, and two men were<br>
                raising her up; but she was not lying in the churchyard, but on 
                the<br>
                sea-shore, where she had dug a deep hole in the sand, and cut 
                her hand with a piece of broken glass, whose sharp stern was stuck 
                in a<br>
                little block of painted wood. Anne Lisbeth was in a fever.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Conscience had roused the memories of superstitions, and had 
                so<br>
                acted upon her mind, that she fancied she had only half a soul, 
                and<br>
                that her child had taken the other half down into the sea. Never 
                would<br>
                she be able to cling to the mercy of Heaven till she had recovered<br>
                this other half which was now held fast in the deep water.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Anne Lisbeth returned to her home, but she was no longer the 
                woman<br>
                she had been. Her thoughts were like a confused, tangled skein; 
                only<br>
                one thread, only one thought was clear to her, namely that she 
                must<br>
                carry the spectre of the sea-shore to the churchyard, and dig 
                a<br>
                grave for him there; that by so doing she might win back her soul.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Many a night she was missed from her home, and was always found 
                on the sea-shore waiting for the spectre.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In this way a whole year passed; and then one night she vanished<br>
                again, and was not to be found. The whole of the next day was 
                spent in a useless search after her.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Towards evening, when the clerk entered the church to toll the<br>
                vesper bell, he saw by the altar Anne Lisbeth, who had spent the 
                whole day there. Her powers of body were almost exhausted, but 
                her eyes flashed brightly, and on her cheeks was a rosy flush. 
                The last rays of the setting sun shone upon her, and gleamed over 
                the altar upon the shining clasps of the Bible, which lay open 
                at the words of the prophet Joel, &quot;Rend your hearts and not 
                your garments, and turn unto the Lord.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That was just a chance,&quot; people said; but do things 
                happen by<br>
                chance? In the face of Anne Lisbeth, lighted up by the evening 
                sun,<br>
                could be seen peace and rest. She said she was happy now, for 
                she<br>
                had conquered. The spectre of the shore, her own child, had come 
                to<br>
                her the night before, and had said to her, &quot;Thou hast dug 
                me only half<br>
                a grave: but thou hast now, for a year and a day, buried me altogether<br>
                in thy heart, and it is there a mother can best hide her child!&quot; 
                And<br>
                then he gave her back her lost soul, and brought her into the 
                church. &quot;Now I am in the house of God,&quot; she said, &quot;and 
                in that house<br>
                we are happy.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>When the sun set, Anne Lisbeth's soul had risen to that region<br>
                where there is no more pain; and Anne Lisbeth's troubles were 
                at an<br>
                end.</p>

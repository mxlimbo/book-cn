              <p class="h" align="center"> THE TINDER-BOX</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> A SOLDIER came marching along the high road: &quot;Left, right- 
                left,<br>
                right.&quot; He had his knapsack on his back, and a sword at his 
                side; he<br>
                had been to the wars, and was now returning home.<br>
              </p>
              <p>As he walked on, he met a very frightful-looking old witch in<br>
                the road. Her under-lip hung quite down on her breast, and she 
                stopped and said, &quot;Good evening, soldier; you have a very 
                fine sword, and a large knapsack, and you are a real soldier; 
                so you shall have as much money as ever you like.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Thank you, old witch,&quot; said the soldier.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Do you see that large tree,&quot; said the witch, pointing 
                to a tree<br>
                which stood beside them. &quot;Well, it is quite hollow inside, 
                and you<br>
                must climb to the top, when you will see a hole, through which 
                you can let yourself down into the tree to a great depth. I will 
                tie a rope<br>
                round your body, so that I can pull you up again when you call 
                out<br>
                to me.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But what am I to do, down there in the tree?&quot; asked 
                the soldier.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Get money,&quot; she replied; &quot;for you must know that 
                when you reach<br>
                the ground under the tree, you will find yourself in a large hall,<br>
                lighted up by three hundred lamps; you will then see three doors,<br>
                which can be easily opened, for the keys are in all the locks. 
                On<br>
                entering the first of the chambers, to which these doors lead, 
                you<br>
                will see a large chest, standing in the middle of the floor, and<br>
                upon it a dog seated, with a pair of eyes as large as teacups. 
                But you<br>
                need not be at all afraid of him; I will give you my blue checked<br>
                apron, which you must spread upon the floor, and then boldly seize<br>
                hold of the dog, and place him upon it. You can then open the 
                chest,<br>
                and take from it as many pence as you please, they are only copper<br>
                pence; but if you would rather have silver money, you must go 
                into the second chamber. Here you will find another dog, with 
                eyes as big as mill-wheels; but do not let that trouble you. Place 
                him upon my apron, and then take what money you please. If, however, 
                you like gold best, enter the third chamber, where there is another 
                chest full of<br>
                it. The dog who sits on this chest is very dreadful; his eyes 
                are as<br>
                big as a tower, but do not mind him. If he also is placed upon 
                my<br>
                apron, he cannot hurt you, and you may take from the chest what 
                gold you will.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;This is not a bad story,&quot; said the soldier; &quot;but 
                what am I to<br>
                give you, you old witch? for, of course, you do not mean to tell 
                me<br>
                all this for nothing.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No,&quot; said the witch; &quot;but I do not ask for a 
                single penny. Only<br>
                promise to bring me an old tinder-box, which my grandmother left<br>
                behind the last time she went down there.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Very well; I promise. Now tie the rope round my body.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Here it is,&quot; replied the witch; &quot;and here is 
                my blue checked<br>
                apron.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>As soon as the rope was tied, the soldier climbed up the tree, 
                and<br>
                let himself down through the hollow to the ground beneath; and 
                here he found, as the witch had told him, a large hall, in which 
                many<br>
                hundred lamps were all burning. Then he opened the first door. 
                &quot;Ah!&quot;<br>
                there sat the dog, with the eyes as large as teacups, staring 
                at him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You're a pretty fellow,&quot; said the soldier, seizing 
                him, and<br>
                placing him on the witch's apron, while he filled his pockets 
                from the<br>
                chest with as many pieces as they would hold. Then he closed the<br>
                lid, seated the dog upon it again, and walked into another chamber,<br>
                And, sure enough, there sat the dog with eyes as big as mill-wheels.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You had better not look at me in that way,&quot; said the 
                soldier;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;you will make your eyes water;&quot; and then he seated 
                him also upon<br>
                the apron, and opened the chest. But when he saw what a quantity 
                of<br>
                silver money it contained, he very quickly threw away all the<br>
                coppers he had taken, and filled his pockets and his knapsack 
                with<br>
                nothing but silver.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then he went into the third room, and there the dog was really<br>
                hideous; his eyes were, truly, as big as towers, and they turned 
                round<br>
                and round in his head like wheels.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Good morning,&quot; said the soldier, touching his cap, 
                for he had<br>
                never seen such a dog in his life. But after looking at him more<br>
                closely, he thought he had been civil enough, so he placed him 
                on<br>
                the floor, and opened the chest. Good gracious, what a quantity 
                of<br>
                gold there was! enough to buy all the sugar-sticks of the<br>
                sweet-stuff women; all the tin soldiers, whips, and rocking-horses<br>
                in the world, or even the whole town itself There was, indeed, 
                an<br>
                immense quantity. So the soldier now threw away all the silver 
                money<br>
                he had taken, and filled his pockets and his knapsack with gold<br>
                instead; and not only his pockets and his knapsack, but even his 
                cap<br>
                and boots, so that he could scarcely walk.<br>
              </p>
              <p>He was really rich now; so he replaced the dog on the chest,<br>
                closed the door, and called up through the tree, &quot;Now pull 
                me out, you old witch.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Have you got the tinder-box?&quot; asked the witch.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No; I declare I quite forgot it.&quot; So he went back 
                and fetched the<br>
                tinderbox, and then the witch drew him up out of the tree, and 
                he<br>
                stood again in the high road, with his pockets, his knapsack, 
                his cap,<br>
                and his boots full of gold.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What are you going to do with the tinder-box?&quot; asked 
                the soldier.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That is nothing to you,&quot; replied the witch; &quot;you 
                have the<br>
                money, now give me the tinder-box.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I tell you what,&quot; said the soldier, &quot;if you don't 
                tell me what<br>
                you are going to do with it, I will draw my sword and cut off 
                your<br>
                head.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No,&quot; said the witch.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The soldier immediately cut off her head, and there she lay on 
                the<br>
                ground. Then he tied up all his money in her apron. and slung 
                it on<br>
                his back like a bundle, put the tinderbox in his pocket, and walked<br>
                off to the nearest town. It was a very nice town, and he put up 
                at the<br>
                best inn, and ordered a dinner of all his favorite dishes, for 
                now<br>
                he was rich and had plenty of money.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The servant, who cleaned his boots, thought they certainly were<br>
                a shabby pair to be worn by such a rich gentleman, for he had 
                not<br>
                yet bought any new ones. The next day, however, he procured some<br>
                good clothes and proper boots, so that our soldier soon became 
                known as a fine gentleman, and the people visited him, and told 
                him all the wonders that were to be seen in the town, and of the 
                king's<br>
                beautiful daughter, the princess.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Where can I see her?&quot; asked the soldier.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;She is not to be seen at all,&quot; they said; &quot;she 
                lives in a large<br>
                copper castle, surrounded by walls and towers. No one but the 
                king<br>
                himself can pass in or out, for there has been a prophecy that 
                she<br>
                will marry a common soldier, and the king cannot bear to think 
                of such a marriage.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I should like very much to see her,&quot; thought the soldier; 
                but<br>
                he could not obtain permission to do so. However, he passed a 
                very<br>
                pleasant time; went to the theatre, drove in the king's garden, 
                and<br>
                gave a great deal of money to the poor, which was very good of 
                him; he remembered what it had been in olden times to be without 
                a shilling.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Now he was rich, had fine clothes, and many friends, who all<br>
                declared he was a fine fellow and a real gentleman, and all this<br>
                gratified him exceedingly. But his money would not last forever; 
                and<br>
                as he spent and gave away a great deal daily, and received none, 
                he<br>
                found himself at last with only two shillings left. So he was<br>
                obliged to leave his elegant rooms, and live in a little garret<br>
                under the roof, where he had to clean his own boots, and even 
                mend<br>
                them with a large needle. None of his friends came to see him, 
                there<br>
                were too many stairs to mount up. One dark evening, he had not 
                even<br>
                a penny to buy a candle; then all at once he remembered that there 
                was a piece of candle stuck in the tinder-box, which he had brought 
                from the old tree, into which the witch had helped him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>He found the tinder-box, but no sooner had he struck a few<br>
                sparks from the flint and steel, than the door flew open and the 
                dog<br>
                with eyes as big as teacups, whom he had seen while down in the<br>
                tree, stood before him, and said, &quot;What orders, master?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Hallo,&quot; said the soldier; &quot;well this is a pleasant 
                tinderbox,<br>
                if it brings me all I wish for.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Bring me some money,&quot; said he to the dog.<br>
                He was gone in a moment, and presently returned, carrying a<br>
                large bag of coppers in his month. The soldier very soon discovered<br>
                after this the value of the tinder-box. If he struck the flint 
                once,<br>
                the dog who sat on the chest of copper money made his appearance; 
                if twice, the dog came from the chest of silver; and if three 
                times,<br>
                the dog with eyes like towers, who watched over the gold. The<br>
                soldier had now plenty of money; he returned to his elegant rooms, 
                and reappeared in his fine clothes, so that his friends knew him 
                again<br>
                directly, and made as much of him as before.<br>
              </p>
              <p>After a while he began to think it was very strange that no one<br>
                could get a look at the princess. &quot;Every one says she is 
                very<br>
                beautiful,&quot; thought he to himself; &quot;but what is the 
                use of that if she<br>
                is to be shut up in a copper castle surrounded by so many towers.<br>
                Can I by any means get to see her. Stop! where is my tinder-box?&quot; 
                Then he struck a light, and in a moment the dog, with eyes as 
                big as<br>
                teacups, stood before him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is midnight,&quot; said the soldier, &quot;yet I should 
                very much like<br>
                to see the princess, if only for a moment.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The dog disappeared instantly, and before the soldier could even<br>
                look round, he returned with the princess. She was lying on the<br>
                dog's back asleep, and looked so lovely, that every one who saw 
                her<br>
                would know she was a real princess. The soldier could not help 
                kissing her, true soldier as he was. Then the dog ran back with 
                the<br>
                princess; but in the morning, while at breakfast with the king 
                and<br>
                queen, she told them what a singular dream she had had during 
                the<br>
                night, of a dog and a soldier, that she had ridden on the dog's<br>
                back, and been kissed by the soldier.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That is a very pretty story, indeed,&quot; said the queen. 
                So the next<br>
                night one of the old ladies of the court was set to watch by the<br>
                princess's bed, to discover whether it really was a dream, or 
                what<br>
                else it might be.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The soldier longed very much to see the princess once more, so<br>
                he sent for the dog again in the night to fetch her, and to run 
                with<br>
                her as fast as ever he could. But the old lady put on water boots, 
                and<br>
                ran after him as quickly as he did, and found that he carried 
                the<br>
                princess into a large house. She thought it would help her to 
                remember the place if she made a large cross on the door with 
                a piece of chalk.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then she went home to bed, and the dog presently returned with 
                the<br>
                princess. But when he saw that a cross had been made on the door 
                of<br>
                the house, where the soldier lived, he took another piece of chalk 
                and<br>
                made crosses on all the doors in the town, so that the lady-in-waiting<br>
                might not be able to find out the right door.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Early the next morning the king and queen accompanied the lady 
                and<br>
                all the officers of the household, to see where the princess had 
                been.<br>
                &quot;Here it is,&quot; said the king, when they came to the first 
                door with<br>
                a cross on it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>No, my dear husband, it must be that one,&quot; said the queen,<br>
                pointing to a second door having a cross also.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And here is one, and there is another!&quot; they all exclaimed; 
                for<br>
                there were crosses on all the doors in every direction.<br>
              </p>
              <p>So they felt it would be useless to search any farther. But the<br>
                queen was a very clever woman; she could do a great deal more 
                than<br>
                merely ride in a carriage. She took her large gold scissors, cut 
                a<br>
                piece of silk into squares, and made a neat little bag. This bag 
                she<br>
                filled with buckwheat flour, and tied it round the princess's 
                neck;<br>
                and then she cut a small hole in the bag, so that the flour might 
                be<br>
                scattered on the ground as the princess went along. During the<br>
                night, the dog came again and carried the princess on his back, 
                and<br>
                ran with her to the soldier, who loved her very much, and wished<br>
                that he had been a prince, so that he might have her for a wife. 
                The<br>
                dog did not observe how the flour ran out of the bag all the way<br>
                from the castle wall to the soldier's house, and even up to the<br>
                window, where he had climbed with the princess. Therefore in the<br>
                morning the king and queen found out where their daughter had 
                been,<br>
                and the soldier was taken up and put in prison. Oh, how dark and<br>
                disagreeable it was as he sat there, and the people said to him,<br>
                &quot;To-morrow you will be hanged.&quot; It was not very pleasant 
                news, and<br>
                besides, he had left the tinder-box at the inn. In the morning 
                he<br>
                could see through the iron grating of the little window how the 
                people<br>
                were hastening out of the town to see him hanged; he heard the 
                drums<br>
                beating, and saw the soldiers marching. Every one ran out to look 
                at<br>
                them. and a shoemaker's boy, with a leather apron and slippers 
                on,<br>
                galloped by so fast, that one of his slippers flew off and struck<br>
                against the wall where the soldier sat looking through the iron<br>
                grating. &quot;Hallo, you shoemaker's boy, you need not be in 
                such a<br>
                hurry,&quot; cried the soldier to him. &quot;There will be nothing 
                to see till I<br>
                come; but if you will run to the house where I have been living, 
                and<br>
                bring me my tinder-box, you shall have four shillings, but you 
                must<br>
                put your best foot foremost.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The shoemaker's boy liked the idea of getting the four<br>
                shillings, so he ran very fast and fetched the tinder-box, and 
                gave it<br>
                to the soldier. And now we shall see what happened. Outside the 
                town a large gibbet had been erected, round which stood the soldiers 
                and several thousands of people. The king and the queen sat on 
                splendid thrones opposite to the judges and the whole council. 
                The soldier already stood on the ladder; but as they were about 
                to place the rope around his neck, he said that an innocent request 
                was often<br>
                granted to a poor criminal before he suffered death. He wished 
                very<br>
                much to smoke a pipe, as it would be the last pipe he should ever<br>
                smoke in the world. The king could not refuse this request, so 
                the<br>
                soldier took his tinder-box, and struck fire, once, twice, thrice,-<br>
                and there in a moment stood all the dogs;- the one with eyes as 
                big as<br>
                teacups, the one with eyes as large as mill-wheels, and the third,<br>
                whose eyes were like towers. &quot;Help me now, that I may not 
                be<br>
                hanged,&quot; cried the soldier.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the dogs fell upon the judges and all the councillors;<br>
                seized one by the legs, and another by the nose, and tossed them<br>
                many feet high in the air, so that they fell down and were dashed 
                to<br>
                pieces.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I will not be touched,&quot; said the king. But the largest 
                dog seized<br>
                him, as well as the queen, and threw them after the others. Then 
                the<br>
                soldiers and all the people were afraid, and cried, &quot;Good 
                soldier, you<br>
                shall be our king, and you shall marry the beautiful princess.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>So they placed the soldier in the king's carriage, and the three<br>
                dogs ran on in front and cried &quot;Hurrah!&quot; and the little 
                boys<br>
                whistled through their fingers, and the soldiers presented arms. 
                The<br>
                princess came out of the copper castle, and became queen, which 
                was very pleasing to her. The wedding festivities lasted a whole 
                week, and the dogs sat at the table, and stared with all their 
                eyes.</p>

              <p class="h" align="center"> HOLGER DANSKE</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> IN Denmark there stands an old castle named Kronenburg, close 
                by<br>
                the Sound of Elsinore, where large ships, both English, Russian, 
                and<br>
                Prussian, pass by hundreds every day. And they salute the old 
                castle<br>
                with cannons, &quot;Boom, boom,&quot; which is as if they said, 
                &quot;Good-day.&quot;<br>
                And the cannons of the old castle answer &quot;Boom,&quot; which 
                means &quot;Many thanks.&quot; In winter no ships sail by, for 
                the whole Sound is covered with ice as far as the Swedish coast, 
                and has quite the appearance of a high-road. The Danish and the 
                Swedish flags wave, and Danes and Swedes say, &quot;Good-day,&quot; 
                and &quot;Thank you&quot; to each other, not with cannons, but 
                with a friendly shake of the hand; and they exchange white bread 
                and biscuits with each other, because foreign articles taste the 
                best.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the most beautiful sight of all is the old castle of Kronenburg, 
                where Holger Danske sits in the deep, dark cellar, into which 
                no one goes. He is clad in iron and steel, and rests his head 
                on his strong arm; his long beard hangs down upon the marble table, 
                into which it has become firmly rooted; he sleeps and dreams, 
                but in his dreams he sees everything that happens in Denmark. 
                On each Christmas-eve an angel comes to him and tells him that 
                all he has dreamed is true, and that he may go to sleep again 
                in peace, as Denmark is not yet in any real danger; but should 
                danger ever come, then Holger Danske will rouse himself, and the 
                table will burst asunder as he draws out his beard. Then he will 
                come forth in his strength, and strike a blow that shall sound 
                in all the countries of the world.<br>
              </p>
              <p>An old grandfather sat and told his little grandson all this 
                about<br>
                Holger Danske, and the boy knew that what his grandfather told 
                him<br>
                must be true. As the old man related this story, he was carving 
                an<br>
                image in wood to represent Holger Danske, to be fastened to the 
                prow of a ship; for the old grandfather was a carver in wood, 
                that is,<br>
                one who carved figures for the heads of ships, according to the<br>
                names given to them. And now he had carved Holger Danske, who 
                stood there erect and proud, with his long beard, holding in one 
                hand his broad battle-axe, while with the other he leaned on the 
                Danish arms.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The old grandfather told the little boy a great deal about Danish<br>
                men and women who had distinguished themselves in olden times, 
                so that he fancied he knew as much even as Holger Danske himself, 
                who, after all, could only dream; and when the little fellow went 
                to bed, he thought so much about it that he actually pressed his 
                chin against the counterpane, and imagined that he had a long 
                beard which had become rooted to it. But the old grandfather remained 
                sitting at his work and carving away at the last part of it, which 
                was the Danish arms. And when he had finished he looked at the 
                whole figure, and thought of all he had heard and read, and what 
                he had that evening related to his little grandson. Then he nodded 
                his head, wiped his spectacles and put them on, and said, &quot;Ah, 
                yes; Holger Danske will not appear in my lifetime, but the boy 
                who is in bed there may very likely live to see him when the event 
                really comes to pass.&quot; And the old grandfather nodded again; 
                and the more he looked at Holger Danske, the more satisfied he 
                felt that he had carved a good image of him. It seemed to glow 
                with the color of life; the armor glittered like iron and steel. 
                The hearts in the Danish arms grew more and more red; while the 
                lions, with gold crowns on their heads, were leaping up. </p>
              <p>&quot;That is the most beautiful coat of arms in the world,&quot; 
                said the old man.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The lions represent strength; and the hearts, gentleness 
                and love.&quot;<br>
                And as he gazed on the uppermost lion, he thought of King Canute,<br>
                who chained great England to Denmark's throne; and he looked at 
                the<br>
                second lion, and thought of Waldemar, who untied Denmark and conquered 
                the Vandals. The third lion reminded him of Margaret, who united 
                Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. But when he gazed at the red hearts, 
                their colors glowed more deeply, even as flames, and his memory 
                followed each in turn. The first led him to a dark, narrow prison, 
                in which sat a prisoner, a beautiful woman, daughter of Christian 
                the Fourth, Eleanor Ulfeld, and the flame became a rose on her 
                bosom, and its blossoms were not more pure than the heart of this 
                noblest and best of all Danish women. &quot;Ah, yes; that is indeed 
                a noble heart in the Danish arms,&quot; said the grandfather. 
                and his spirit<br>
                followed the second flame, which carried him out to sea, where 
                cannons roared and the ships lay shrouded in smoke, and the flaming 
                heart attached itself to the breast of Hvitfeldt in the form of 
                the ribbon<br>
                of an order, as he blew himself and his ship into the air in order<br>
                to save the fleet. And the third flame led him to Greenland's 
                wretched<br>
                huts, where the preacher, Hans Egede, ruled with love in every 
                word<br>
                and action. The flame was as a star on his breast, and added another<br>
                heart to the Danish arms. And as the old grandfather's spirit 
                followed<br>
                the next hovering flame, he knew whither it would lead him. In 
                a<br>
                peasant woman's humble room stood Frederick the Sixth, writing 
                his<br>
                name with chalk on the beam. The flame trembled on his breast 
                and in<br>
                his heart, and it was in the peasant's room that his heart became<br>
                one for the Danish arms. The old grandfather wiped his eyes, for 
                he<br>
                had known King Frederick, with his silvery locks and his honest 
                blue<br>
                eyes, and had lived for him, and he folded his hands and remained<br>
                for some time silent. Then his daughter came to him and said it 
                was<br>
                getting late, that he ought to rest for a while, and that the 
                supper<br>
                was on the table.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What you have been carving is very beautiful, grandfather,&quot;<br>
                said she. &quot;Holger Danske and the old coat of arms; it seems 
                to me as<br>
                if I have seen the face somewhere.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No, that is impossible,&quot; replied the old grandfather; 
                &quot;but I have<br>
                seen it, and I have tried to carve it in wood, as I have retained 
                it<br>
                in my memory. It was a long time ago, while the English fleet 
                lay in<br>
                the roads, on the second of April, when we showed that we were 
                true, ancient Danes. I was on board the Denmark, in Steene Bille's 
                squadron; I had a man by my side whom even the cannon balls seemed 
                to fear. He sung old songs in a merry voice, and fired and fought 
                as if he were something more than a man. I still remember his 
                face, but from whence he came, or whither he went, I know not; 
                no one knows. I have often thought it might have been Holger Danske 
                himself, who had swam down to us from Kronenburg to help us in 
                the hour of danger. That was my idea, and there stands his likeness.&quot;<br>
                The wooden figure threw a gigantic shadow on the wall, and even 
                on<br>
                part of the ceiling; it seemed as if the real Holger Danske stood<br>
                behind it, for the shadow moved; but this was no doubt caused 
                by the flame of the lamp not burning steadily. Then the daughter-in-law<br>
                kissed the old grandfather, and led him to a large arm-chair by 
                the<br>
                table; and she, and her husband, who was the son of the old man 
                and<br>
                the father of the little boy who lay in bed, sat down to supper 
                with<br>
                him. And the old grandfather talked of the Danish lions and the 
                Danish hearts, emblems of strength and gentleness, and explained 
                quite clearly that there is another strength than that which lies 
                in a<br>
                sword, and he pointed to a shelf where lay a number of old books,<br>
                and amongst them a collection of Holberg's plays, which are much<br>
                read and are so clever and amusing that it is easy to fancy we 
                have<br>
                known the people of those days, who are described in them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;He knew how to fight also,&quot; said the old man; &quot;for 
                he lashed<br>
                the follies and prejudices of people during his whole life.&quot;<br>
                Then the grandfather nodded to a place above the looking-glass,<br>
                where hung an almanac, with a representation of the Round Tower 
                upon it, and said &quot;Tycho Brahe was another of those who used 
                a sword, but not one to cut into the flesh and bone, but to make 
                the way of the stars of heaven clear, and plain to be understood. 
                And then he whose father belonged to my calling,- yes, he, the 
                son of the old image-carver, he whom we ourselves have seen, with 
                his silvery locks and his broad shoulders, whose name is known 
                in all lands;- yes, he was a sculptor, while I am only a carver. 
                Holger Danske can appear in marble, so that people in all countries 
                of the world may hear of the strength of Denmark. Now let us drink 
                the health of Bertel.&quot;<br>
                But the little boy in bed saw plainly the old castle of Kronenburg, 
                and the Sound of Elsinore, and Holger Danske, far down in the 
                cellar, with his beard rooted to the table, and dreaming of everything 
                that was passing above him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And Holger Danske did dream of the little humble room in which 
                the<br>
                image-carver sat; he heard all that had been said, and he nodded 
                in<br>
                his dream, saying, &quot;Ah, yes, remember me, you Danish people, 
                keep me in your memory, I will come to you in the hour of need.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The bright morning light shone over Kronenburg, and the wind<br>
                brought the sound of the hunting-horn across from the neighboring<br>
                shores. The ships sailed by and saluted the castle with the boom 
                of<br>
                the cannon, and Kronenburg returned the salute, &quot;Boom, boom.&quot; 
                But<br>
                the roaring cannons did not awake Holger Danske, for they meant 
                only &quot;Good morning,&quot; and &quot;Thank you.&quot; They 
                must fire in another fashion before he awakes; but wake he will, 
                for there is energy yet in<br>
                Holger Danske.</p>

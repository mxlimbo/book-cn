              <p class="h" align="center"> THE PEN AND THE INKSTAND</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> IN a poet's room, where his inkstand stood on the table, the<br>
                remark was once made, &quot;It is wonderful what can be brought 
                out of an inkstand. What will come next? It is indeed wonderful.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, certainly,&quot; said the inkstand to the pen, and 
                to the other<br>
                articles that stood on the table; &quot;that's what I always say. 
                It is<br>
                wonderful and extraordinary what a number of things come out of 
                me.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It's quite incredible, and I really don't know what is coming 
                next<br>
                when that man dips his pen into me. One drop out of me is enough 
                for half a page of paper, and what cannot half a page contain? 
                From me, all the works of a poet are produced; all those imaginary 
                characters whom people fancy they have known or met. All the deep 
                feeling, the humor, and the vivid pictures of nature. I myself 
                don't understand how it is, for I am not acquainted with nature, 
                but it is certainly in me.<br>
              </p>
              <p>From me have gone forth to the world those wonderful descriptions 
                of troops of charming maidens, and of brave knights on prancing 
                steeds; of the halt and the blind, and I know not what more, for 
                I assure you I never think of these things.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There you are right,&quot; said the pen, &quot;for you 
                don't think at<br>
                all; if you did, you would see that you can only provide the means.<br>
                You give the fluid that I may place upon the paper what dwells 
                in<br>
                me, and what I wish to bring to light. It is the pen that writes: 
                no<br>
                man doubts that; and, indeed, most people understand as much about<br>
                poetry as an old inkstand.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You have had very little experience,&quot; replied the 
                inkstand.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You have hardly been in service a week, and are already 
                half worn<br>
                out. Do you imagine you are a poet? You are only a servant, and 
                before you came I had many like you, some of the goose family, 
                and others of English manufacture. I know a quill pen as well 
                as I know a steel one. I have had both sorts in my service, and 
                I shall have many more when he comes- the man who performs the 
                mechanical part- and writes down what he obtains from me. I should 
                like to know what will be the next thing he gets out of me.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Inkpot!&quot; exclaimed the pen contemptuously.<br>
                Late in the evening the poet came home. He had been to a<br>
                concert, and had been quite enchanted with the admirable performance 
                of a famous violin player whom he had heard there. The performer 
                had produced from his instrument a richness of tone that sometimes 
                sounded like tinkling waterdrops or rolling pearls; sometimes 
                like the birds twittering in chorus, and then rising and swelling 
                in sound like the wind through the fir-trees. The poet felt as 
                if his own heart were weeping, but in tones of melody like the 
                sound of a woman's voice.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It seemed not only the strings, but every part of the instrument<br>
                from which these sounds were produced. It was a wonderful<br>
                performance and a difficult piece, and yet the bow seemed to glide<br>
                across the strings so easily that it was as if any one could do 
                it who<br>
                tried. Even the violin and the bow appeared to perform independently<br>
                of their master who guided them; it was as if soul and spirit 
                had been<br>
                breathed into the instrument, so the audience forgot the performer<br>
                in the beautiful sounds he produced. Not so the poet; he remembered<br>
                him, and named him, and wrote down his thoughts on the subject. 
              </p>
              <p>&quot;How foolish it would be for the violin and the bow to boast 
                of their<br>
                performance, and yet we men often commit that folly. The poet, 
                the<br>
                artist, the man of science in his laboratory, the general,- we 
                all<br>
                do it; and yet we are only the instruments which the Almighty 
                uses; to<br>
                Him alone the honor is due. We have nothing of ourselves of which 
                we should be proud.&quot; Yes, this is what the poet wrote down. 
                He wrote it in the form of a parable, and called it &quot;The 
                Master and the<br>
                Instruments.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That is what you have got, madam,&quot; said the pen to 
                the<br>
                inkstand, when the two were alone again. &quot;Did you hear him 
                read<br>
                aloud what I had written down?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, what I gave you to write,&quot; retorted the inkstand. 
                &quot;That<br>
                was a cut at you because of your conceit. To think that you could<br>
                not understand that you were being quizzed. I gave you a cut from<br>
                within me. Surely I must know my own satire.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ink-pitcher!&quot; cried the pen.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Writing-stick!&quot; retorted the inkstand. And each of 
                them felt<br>
                satisfied that he had given a good answer. It is pleasing to be<br>
                convinced that you have settled a matter by your reply; it is<br>
                something to make you sleep well, and they both slept well upon 
                it.<br>
                But the poet did not sleep. Thoughts rose up within him like the<br>
                tones of the violin, falling like pearls, or rushing like the 
                strong<br>
                wind through the forest. He understood his own heart in these<br>
                thoughts; they were as a ray from the mind of the Great Master 
                of all<br>
                minds.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;To Him be all the honor.&quot;</p>

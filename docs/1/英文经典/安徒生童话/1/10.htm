              <p class="h" align="center"> CHILDREN'S PRATTLE</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> AT a rich merchant's house there was a children's party, and 
                the<br>
                children of rich and great people were there. The merchant was 
                a<br>
                learned man, for his father had sent him to college, and he had 
                passed<br>
                his examination. His father had been at first only a cattle dealer,<br>
                but always honest and industrious, so that he had made money, 
                and<br>
                his son, the merchant, had managed to increase his store. Clever 
                as he<br>
                was, he had also a heart; but there was less said of his heart 
                than of<br>
                his money. All descriptions of people visited at the merchant's 
                house,<br>
                well born, as well as intellectual, and some who possessed neither<br>
                of these recommendations.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Now it was a children's party, and there was children's prattle,<br>
                which always is spoken freely from the heart. Among them was a<br>
                beautiful little girl, who was terribly proud; but this had been<br>
                taught her by the servants, and not by her parents, who were far 
                too<br>
                sensible people.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Her father was groom of the Chambers, which is a high office 
                at<br>
                court, and she knew it. &quot;I am a child of the court,&quot; 
                she said; now she<br>
                might just as well have been a child of the cellar, for no one 
                can<br>
                help his birth; and then she told the other children that she 
                was<br>
                well-born, and said that no one who was not well-born could rise 
                in<br>
                the world. It was no use to read and be industrious, for if a 
                person<br>
                was not well-born, he could never achieve anything. &quot;And 
                those whose names end with 'sen,'&quot; said she, &quot;can never 
                be anything at all. We must put our arms akimbo, and make the 
                elbow quite pointed, so as to keep these 'sen' people at a great 
                distance.&quot; And then she stuck out her pretty little arms, 
                and made the elbows quite pointed, to show how it was to be done; 
                and her little arms were very pretty, for she was a sweet-looking 
                child.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the little daughter of the merchant became very angry at<br>
                this speech, for her father's name was Petersen, and she knew 
                that the<br>
                name ended in &quot;sen,&quot; and therefore she said as proudly 
                as she could,<br>
                &quot;But my papa can buy a hundred dollars' worth of bonbons, 
                and give<br>
                them away to children. Can your papa do that?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes; and my papa,&quot; said the little daughter of the 
                editor of a<br>
                paper, &quot;my papa can put your papa and everybody's papa into 
                the<br>
                newspaper. All sorts of people are afraid of him, my mamma says, 
                for he can do as he likes with the paper.&quot; And the little 
                maiden looked<br>
                exceedingly proud, as if she had been a real princess, who may 
                be<br>
                expected to look proud.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But outside the door, which stood ajar, was a poor boy, peeping<br>
                through the crack of the door. He was of such a lowly station 
                that<br>
                he had not been allowed even to enter the room. He had been turning<br>
                the spit for the cook, and she had given him permission to stand<br>
                behind the door and peep in at the well-dressed children, who 
                were<br>
                having such a merry time within; and for him that was a great 
                deal.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, if I could be one of them,&quot; thought he, and then 
                he heard what<br>
                was said about names, which was quite enough to make him more 
                unhappy.<br>
              </p>
              <p>His parents at home had not even a penny to spare to buy a<br>
                newspaper, much less could they write in one; and worse than all,<br>
                his father's name, and of course his own, ended in &quot;sen,&quot; 
                and<br>
                therefore he could never turn out well, which was a very sad<br>
                thought. But after all, he had been born into the world, and the<br>
                station of life had been chosen for him, therefore he must be 
                content.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And this is what happened on that evening.</p>
              <p> Many years passed, and most of the children became grown-up<br>
                persons.<br>
              </p>
              <p>There stood a splendid house in the town, filled with all kinds 
                of<br>
                beautiful and valuable objects. Everybody wished to see it, and 
                people even came in from the country round to be permitted to 
                view the treasures it contained.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Which of the children whose prattle we have described, could<br>
                call this house his own? One would suppose it very easy to guess.<br>
                No, no; it is not so very easy. The house belonged to the poor<br>
                little boy who had stood on that night behind the door. He had<br>
                really become something great, although his name ended in &quot;sen,&quot;-<br>
                for it was Thorwaldsen.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the three other children- the children of good birth, of<br>
                money, and of intellectual pride,- well, they were respected and<br>
                honored in the world, for they had been well provided for by birth 
                and position, and they had no cause to reproach themselves with 
                what they had thought and spoken on that evening long ago, for, 
                after<br>
                all, it was mere &quot;children's prattle.&quot;</p>

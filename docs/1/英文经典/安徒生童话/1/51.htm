              <p class="h" align="center"> THE FARM-YARD COCK AND THE WEATHER-COCK</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THERE were two cocks- one on the dung-hill, the other on the 
                roof.<br>
                They were both arrogant, but which of the two rendered most service?<br>
              </p>
              <p>Tell us your opinion- we'll keep to ours just the same though.<br>
                The poultry yard was divided by some planks from another yard 
                in<br>
                which there was a dung-hill, and on the dung-hill lay and grew 
                a large<br>
                cucumber which was conscious of being a hot-bed plant.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;One is born to that,&quot; said the cucumber to itself. 
                &quot;Not all can<br>
                be born cucumbers; there must be other things, too. The hens, 
                the<br>
                ducks, and all the animals in the next yard are creatures too. 
                Now I<br>
                have a great opinion of the yard cock on the plank; he is certainly 
                of<br>
                much more importance than the weather-cock who is placed so high 
                and can't even creak, much less crow. The latter has neither hens 
                nor<br>
                chicks, and only thinks of himself and perspires verdigris. No, 
                the<br>
                yard cock is really a cock! His step is a dance! His crowing is 
                music,<br>
                and wherever he goes one knows what a trumpeter is like! If he 
                would<br>
                only come in here! Even if he ate me up stump, stalk, and all, 
                and I<br>
                had to dissolve in his body, it would be a happy death,&quot; 
                said the<br>
                cucumber.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the night there was a terrible storm. The hens, chicks, and<br>
                even the cock sought shelter; the wind tore down the planks between<br>
                the two yards with a crash; the tiles came tumbling down, but 
                the<br>
                weather-cock sat firm. He did not even turn round, for he could 
                not;<br>
                and yet he was young and freshly cast, but prudent and sedate. 
                He<br>
                had been born old, and did not at all resemble the birds flying 
                in the<br>
                air- the sparrows, and the swallows; no, he despised them, these<br>
                mean little piping birds, these common whistlers. He admitted 
                that the<br>
                pigeons, large and white and shining like mother-o'-pearl, looked 
                like<br>
                a kind of weather-cock; but they were fat and stupid, and all 
                their<br>
                thoughts and endeavours were directed to filling themselves with 
                food, and besides, they were tiresome things to converse with. 
                The birds of passage had also paid the weather-cock a visit and 
                told him of foreign countries, of airy caravans and robber stories 
                that made one's hair stand on end. All this was new and interesting; 
                that is, for<br>
                the first time, but afterwards, as the weather-cock found out, 
                they<br>
                repeated themselves and always told the same stories, and that's<br>
                very tedious, and there was no one with whom one could associate,<br>
                for one and all were stale and small-minded.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The world is no good!&quot; he said. &quot;Everything in 
                it is so stupid.&quot;<br>
                The weather-cock was puffed up, and that quality would have made<br>
                him interesting in the eyes of the cucumber if it had known it, 
                but it<br>
                had eyes only for the yard cock, who was now in the yard with 
                it.<br>
                The wind had blown the planks, but the storm was over.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What do you think of that crowing?&quot; said the yard 
                cock to the<br>
                hens and chickens. &quot;It was a little rough- it wanted elegance.&quot;<br>
                And the hens and chickens came up on the dung-hill, and the cock<br>
                strutted about like a lord.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Garden plant!&quot; he said to the cucumber, and in that 
                one word<br>
                his deep learning showed itself, and it forgot that he was pecking<br>
                at her and eating it up. &quot;A happy death!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The hens and the chickens came, for where one runs the others<br>
                run too; they clucked, and chirped, and looked at the cock, and 
                were<br>
                proud that he was of their kind.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Cock-a-doodle-doo!&quot; he crowed, &quot;the chickens 
                will grow up into<br>
                great hens at once, if I cry it out in the poultry-yard of the 
                world!&quot;<br>
                And hens and chicks clucked and chirped, and the cock announced<br>
                a great piece of news.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;A cock can lay an egg! And do you know what's in that egg? 
                A<br>
                basilisk. No one can stand the sight of such a thing; people know<br>
                that, and now you know it too- you know what is in me, and what 
                a<br>
                champion of all cocks I am!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>With that the yard cock flapped his wings, made his comb swell 
                up,<br>
                and crowed again; and they all shuddered, the hens and the little<br>
                chicks- but they were very proud that one of their number was 
                such a<br>
                champion of all cocks. They clucked and chirped till the<br>
                weather-cock heard; he heard it; but he did not stir.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Everything is very stupid,&quot; the weather-cock said 
                to himself.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The yard cock lays no eggs, and I am too lazy to do so; 
                if I liked, I<br>
                could lay a wind-egg. But the world is not worth even a wind-egg.<br>
                Everything is so stupid! I don't want to sit here any longer.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>With that the weather-cock broke off; but he did not kill the 
                yard<br>
                cock, although the hens said that had been his intention. And 
                what<br>
                is the moral? &quot;Better to crow than to be puffed up and break 
                off!</p>

              <p class="h" align="center"> THE DROP OF WATER</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> OF course you know what is meant by a magnifying glass- one 
                of<br>
                those round spectacle-glasses that make everything look a hundred<br>
                times bigger than it is? When any one takes one of these and holds<br>
                it to his eye, and looks at a drop of water from the pond yonder, 
                he<br>
                sees above a thousand wonderful creatures that are otherwise never<br>
                discerned in the water. But there they are, and it is no delusion.<br>
                It almost looks like a great plateful of spiders jumping about 
                in a<br>
                crowd. And how fierce they are! They tear off each other's legs. 
                and<br>
                arms and bodies, before and behind; and yet they are merry and<br>
                joyful in their way.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Now, there once was an old man whom all the people called<br>
                Kribble-Krabble, for that was his name. He always wanted the best 
                of<br>
                everything, and when he could not manage it otherwise, he did 
                it by<br>
                magic.<br>
              </p>
              <p>There he sat one day, and held his magnifying-glass to his eye,<br>
                and looked at a drop of water that had been taken out of a puddle 
                by<br>
                the ditch. But what a kribbling and krabbling was there! All the<br>
                thousands of little creatures hopped and sprang and tugged at 
                one<br>
                another, and ate each other up.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That is horrible!&quot; said old Kribble-Krabble. &quot;Can 
                one not<br>
                persuade them to live in peace and quietness, so that each one 
                may<br>
                mind his own business?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And he thought it over and over, but it would not do, and so 
                he<br>
                had recourse to magic.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I must give them color, that they may be seen more plainly,&quot; 
                said<br>
                he; and he poured something like a little drop of red wine into 
                the<br>
                drop of water, but it was witches' blood from the lobes of the 
                ear,<br>
                the finest kind, at ninepence a drop. And now the wonderful little<br>
                creatures were pink all over. It looked like a whole town of naked<br>
                wild men.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What have you there?&quot; asked another old magician, 
                who had no<br>
                name- and that was the best thing about him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, if you can guess what it is,&quot; said Kribble-Krabble, 
                &quot;I'll<br>
                make you a present of it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But it is not so easy to find out if one does not know.<br>
                And the magician who had no name looked through the<br>
                magnifying-glass.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It looked really like a great town reflected there, in which 
                all<br>
                the people were running about without clothes. It was terrible! 
                But it<br>
                was still more terrible to see how one beat and pushed the other,<br>
                and bit and hacked, and tugged and mauled him. Those at the top 
                were being pulled down, and those at the bottom were struggling 
                upwards.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Look! look! his leg is longer than mine! Bah! Away with 
                it! There<br>
                is one who has a little bruise. It hurts him, but it shall hurt 
                him<br>
                still more.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And they hacked away at him, and they pulled at him, and ate 
                him<br>
                up, because of the little bruise. And there was one sitting as 
                still<br>
                as any little maiden, and wishing only for peace and quietness. 
                But<br>
                now she had to come out, and they tugged at her, and pulled her 
                about, and ate her up.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That's funny!&quot; said the magician.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes; but what do you think it is?&quot; said Kribble-Krabble. 
                &quot;Can you<br>
                find that out?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Why, one can see that easily enough,&quot; said the other. 
                &quot;That's Paris,<br>
                or some other great city, for they're all alike. It's a great 
                city!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It's a drop of puddle water!&quot; said Kribble-Krabble.</p>

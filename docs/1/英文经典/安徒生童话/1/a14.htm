              <p class="h" align="center"> THE TRAVELLING COMPANION</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> POOR John was very sad; for his father was so ill, he had no<br>
                hope of his recovery. John sat alone with the sick man in the 
                little<br>
                room, and the lamp had nearly burnt out; for it was late in the 
                night.<br>
                &quot;You have been a good son, John,&quot; said the sick father, 
                &quot;and God<br>
                will help you on in the world.&quot; He looked at him, as he spoke, 
                with<br>
                mild, earnest eyes, drew a deep sigh, and died; yet it appeared 
                as<br>
                if he still slept.<br>
              </p>
              <p>John wept bitterly. He had no one in the wide world now; neither<br>
                father, mother, brother, nor sister. Poor John! he knelt down 
                by the<br>
                bed, kissed his dead father's hand, and wept many, many bitter<br>
                tears. But at last his eyes closed, and he fell asleep with his 
                head<br>
                resting against the hard bedpost. Then he dreamed a strange dream;<br>
                he thought he saw the sun shining upon him, and his father alive 
                and<br>
                well, and even heard him laughing as he used to do when he was 
                very<br>
                happy. A beautiful girl, with a golden crown on her head, and 
                long,<br>
                shining hair, gave him her hand; and his father said, &quot;See 
                what a<br>
                bride you have won. She is the loveliest maiden on the whole earth.&quot;<br>
                Then he awoke, and all the beautiful things vanished before his<br>
                eyes, his father lay dead on the bed, and he was all alone. Poor 
                John!<br>
                During the following week the dead man was buried. The son<br>
                walked behind the coffin which contained his father, whom he so 
                dearly loved, and would never again behold. He heard the earth 
                fall on the coffin-lid, and watched it till only a corner remained 
                in sight, and<br>
                at last that also disappeared. He felt as if his heart would break<br>
                with its weight of sorrow, till those who stood round the grave 
                sang a<br>
                psalm, and the sweet, holy tones brought tears into his eyes, 
                which<br>
                relieved him. The sun shone brightly down on the green trees, 
                as if it<br>
                would say, &quot;You must not be so sorrowful, John. Do you see 
                the<br>
                beautiful blue sky above you? Your father is up there, and he 
                prays to<br>
                the loving Father of all, that you may do well in the future.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I will always be good,&quot; said John, &quot;and then 
                I shall go to be<br>
                with my father in heaven. What joy it will be when we see each 
                other<br>
                again! How much I shall have to relate to him, and how many things<br>
                he will be able to explain to me of the delights of heaven, and<br>
                teach me as he once did on earth. Oh, what joy it will be!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>He pictured it all so plainly to himself, that he smiled even<br>
                while the tears ran down his cheeks.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The little birds in the chestnut-trees twittered, &quot;Tweet,<br>
                tweet;&quot; they were so happy, although they had seen the funeral; 
                but<br>
                they seemed as if they knew that the dead man was now in heaven, 
                and that he had wings much larger and more beautiful than their 
                own; and he was happy now, because he had been good here on earth, 
                and they were glad of it. John saw them fly away out of the green 
                trees into the wide world, and he longed to fly with them; but 
                first he cut out a large wooden cross, to place on his father's 
                grave; and when he<br>
                brought it there in the evening, he found the grave decked out 
                with<br>
                gravel and flowers. Strangers had done this; they who had known 
                the<br>
                good old father who was now dead, and who had loved him very much.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Early the next morning, John packed up his little bundle of<br>
                clothes, and placed all his money, which consisted of fifty dollars<br>
                and a few shillings, in his girdle; with this he determined to 
                try his<br>
                fortune in the world. But first he went into the churchyard; and, 
                by<br>
                his father's grave, he offered up a prayer, and said, &quot;Farewell.&quot;<br>
                As he passed through the fields, all the flowers looked fresh<br>
                and beautiful in the warm sunshine, and nodded in the wind, as 
                if they<br>
                wished to say, &quot;Welcome to the green wood, where all is fresh 
                and<br>
                bright.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then John turned to have one more look at the old church, in 
                which<br>
                he had been christened in his infancy, and where his father had<br>
                taken him every Sunday to hear the service and join in singing 
                the<br>
                psalms. As he looked at the old tower, he espied the ringer standing<br>
                at one of the narrow openings, with his little pointed red cap 
                on<br>
                his head, and shading his eyes from the sun with his bent arm. 
                John<br>
                nodded farewell to him, and the little ringer waved his red cap,<br>
                laid his hand on his heart, and kissed his hand to him a great 
                many<br>
                times, to show that he felt kindly towards him, and wished him 
                a<br>
                prosperous journey.<br>
              </p>
              <p>John continued his journey, and thought of all the wonderful<br>
                things he should see in the large, beautiful world, till he found<br>
                himself farther away from home than ever he had been before. He 
                did<br>
                not even know the names of the places he passed through, and could<br>
                scarcely understand the language of the people he met, for he 
                was<br>
                far away, in a strange land. The first night he slept on a haystack,<br>
                out in the fields, for there was no other bed for him; but it 
                seemed<br>
                to him so nice and comfortable that even a king need not wish 
                for a<br>
                better. The field, the brook, the haystack, with the blue sky 
                above,<br>
                formed a beautiful sleeping-room. The green grass, with the little 
                red<br>
                and white flowers, was the carpet; the elder-bushes and the hedges<br>
                of wild roses looked like garlands on the walls; and for a bath 
                he<br>
                could have the clear, fresh water of the brook; while the rushes 
                bowed their heads to him, to wish him good morning and good evening. 
                The moon, like a large lamp, hung high up in the blue ceiling, 
                and he had no fear of its setting fire to his curtains. John slept 
                here quite safely all night; and when he awoke, the sun was up, 
                and all the<br>
                little birds were singing round him, &quot;Good morning, good 
                morning.<br>
                Are you not up yet?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was Sunday, and the bells were ringing for church. As the<br>
                people went in, John followed them; he heard God's word, joined 
                in<br>
                singing the psalms, and listened to the preacher. It seemed to 
                him<br>
                just as if he were in his own church, where he had been christened,<br>
                and had sung the psalms with his father. Out in the churchyard 
                were<br>
                several graves, and on some of them the grass had grown very high.<br>
                John thought of his father's grave, which he knew at last would 
                look<br>
                like these, as he was not there to weed and attend to it. Then 
                he<br>
                set to work, pulled up the high grass, raised the wooden crosses 
                which had fallen down, and replaced the wreaths which had been 
                blown away from their places by the wind, thinking all the time, 
                &quot;Perhaps some one is doing the same for my father's grave, 
                as I am not there to do it &quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Outside the church door stood an old beggar, leaning on his<br>
                crutch. John gave him his silver shillings, and then he continued<br>
                his journey, feeling lighter and happier than ever. Towards evening,<br>
                the weather became very stormy, and he hastened on as quickly 
                as he<br>
                could, to get shelter; but it was quite dark by the time he reached<br>
                a little lonely church which stood on a hill. &quot;I will go 
                in here,&quot;<br>
                he said, &quot;and sit down in a corner; for I am quite tired, 
                and want<br>
                rest.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>So he went in, and seated himself; then he folded his hands, 
                and<br>
                offered up his evening prayer, and was soon fast asleep and<br>
                dreaming, while the thunder rolled and the lightning flashed<br>
                without. When he awoke, it was still night; but the storm had<br>
                ceased, and the moon shone in upon him through the windows. Then 
                he saw an open coffin standing in the centre of the church, which<br>
                contained a dead man, waiting for burial. John was not at all 
                timid;<br>
                he had a good conscience, and he knew also that the dead can never<br>
                injure any one. It is living wicked men who do harm to others. 
                Two<br>
                such wicked persons stood now by the dead man, who had been brought 
                to the church to be buried. Their evil intentions were to throw 
                the poor dead body outside the church door, and not leave him 
                to rest in his coffin.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Why do you do this?&quot; asked John, when he saw what 
                they were going to do; &quot;it is very wicked. Leave him to rest 
                in peace, in Christ's<br>
                name.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Nonsense,&quot; replied the two dreadful men. &quot;He 
                has cheated us; he<br>
                owed us money which he could not pay, and now he is dead we shall<br>
                not get a penny; so we mean to have our revenge, and let him lie<br>
                like a dog outside the church door.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I have only fifty dollars,&quot; said John, &quot;it is 
                all I possess in<br>
                the world, but I will give it to you if you will promise me faithfully<br>
                to leave the dead man in peace. I shall be able to get on without<br>
                the money; I have strong and healthy limbs, and God will always 
                help<br>
                me.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Why, of course,&quot; said the horrid men, &quot;if you 
                will pay his debt<br>
                we will both promise not to touch him. You may depend upon that;&quot;<br>
                and then they took the money he offered them, laughed at him for 
                his<br>
                good nature, and went their way.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then he laid the dead body back in the coffin, folded the hands,<br>
                and took leave of it; and went away contentedly through the great<br>
                forest. All around him he could see the prettiest little elves 
                dancing<br>
                in the moonlight, which shone through the trees. They were not<br>
                disturbed by his appearance, for they knew he was good and harmless 
                among men. They are wicked people only who can never obtain a 
                glimpse of fairies. Some of them were not taller than the breadth 
                of a finger, and they wore golden combs in their long, yellow 
                hair. They were rocking themselves two together on the large dew-drops 
                with which the leaves and the high grass were sprinkled. Sometimes 
                the dew-drops would roll away, and then they fell down between 
                the stems of the long grass, and caused a great deal of laughing 
                and noise among the other little people. It was quite charming 
                to watch them at play. Then they sang songs, and John remembered 
                that he had learnt those pretty songs when he was a little boy. 
                Large speckled spiders, with silver crowns on their heads, were 
                employed to spin suspension bridges and palaces from one hedge 
                to another, and when the tiny drops fell upon them, they glittered 
                in the moonlight like shining glass.<br>
              </p>
              <p>This continued till sunrise. Then the little elves crept into 
                the<br>
                flower-buds, and the wind seized the bridges and palaces, and<br>
                fluttered them in the air like cobwebs.<br>
              </p>
              <p>As John left the wood, a strong man's voice called after him,<br>
                &quot;Hallo, comrade, where are you travelling?&quot;<br>
                &quot;Into the wide world,&quot; he replied; &quot;I am only a 
                poor lad, I have<br>
                neither father nor mother, but God will help me.&quot;<br>
                &quot;I am going into the wide world also,&quot; replied the stranger;<br>
                &quot;shall we keep each other company?&quot;<br>
                &quot;With all my heart,&quot; he said, and so they went on together. 
                Soon<br>
                they began to like each other very much, for they were both good;<br>
                but John found out that the stranger was much more clever than<br>
                himself. He had travelled all over the world, and could describe<br>
                almost everything. The sun was high in the heavens when they seated<br>
                themselves under a large tree to eat their breakfast, and at the<br>
                same moment an old woman came towards them. She was very old and 
                almost bent double. She leaned upon a stick and carried on her 
                back a bundle of firewood, which she had collected in the forest; 
                her apron was tied round it, and John saw three great stems of 
                fern and some willow twigs peeping out. just as she came close 
                up to them, her foot slipped and she fell to the ground screaming 
                loudly; poor old<br>
                woman, she had broken her leg! John proposed directly that they 
                should carry the old woman home to her cottage; but the stranger 
                opened his knapsack and took out a box, in which he said he had 
                a salve that would quickly make her leg well and strong again, 
                so that she would be able to walk home herself, as if her leg 
                had never been broken. And all that he would ask in return was 
                the three fern stems which she carried in her apron.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That is rather too high a price,&quot; said the old woman, 
                nodding her<br>
                head quite strangely. She did not seem at all inclined to part 
                with<br>
                the fern stems. However, it was not very agreeable to lie there 
                with a<br>
                broken leg, so she gave them to him; and such was the power of 
                the<br>
                ointment, that no sooner had he rubbed her leg with it than the 
                old<br>
                mother rose up and walked even better than she had done before. 
                But<br>
                then this wonderful ointment could not be bought at a chemist's.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What can you want with those three fern rods?&quot; asked 
                John of<br>
                his fellow-traveller.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, they will make capital brooms,&quot; said he; &quot;and 
                I like them<br>
                because I have strange whims sometimes.&quot; Then they walked 
                on<br>
                together for a long distance.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;How dark the sky is becoming,&quot; said John; &quot;and 
                look at those<br>
                thick, heavy clouds.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Those are not clouds,&quot; replied his fellow-traveller; 
                &quot;they are<br>
                mountains- large lofty mountains- on the tops of which we should 
                be<br>
                above the clouds, in the pure, free air. Believe me, it is<br>
                delightful to ascend so high, tomorrow we shall be there.&quot; 
                But the<br>
                mountains were not so near as they appeared; they had to travel 
                a<br>
                whole day before they reached them, and pass through black forests 
                and piles of rock as large as a town. The journey had been so 
                fatiguing that John and his fellow-traveller stopped to rest at 
                a roadside inn, so that they might gain strength for their journey 
                on the morrow.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the large public room of the inn a great many persons were<br>
                assembled to see a comedy performed by dolls. The showman had 
                just erected his little theatre, and the people were sitting round 
                the room to witness the performance. Right in front, in the very 
                best place, sat a stout butcher, with a great bull-dog by his 
                side who seemed very much inclined to bite. He sat staring with 
                all his eyes, and so indeed did every one else in the room. And 
                then the play began. It was a pretty piece, with a king and a 
                queen in it, who sat on a beautiful throne, and had gold crowns 
                on their heads. The trains to their dresses were very long, according 
                to the fashion; while the<br>
                prettiest of wooden dolls, with glass eyes and large mustaches,<br>
                stood at the doors, and opened and shut them, that the fresh air 
                might<br>
                come into the room. It was a very pleasant play, not at all<br>
                mournful; but just as the queen stood up and walked across the<br>
                stage, the great bull-dog, who should have been held back by his<br>
                master, made a spring forward, and caught the queen in the teeth 
                by<br>
                the slender wrist, so that it snapped in two. This was a very 
                dreadful<br>
                disaster. The poor man, who was exhibiting the dolls, was much<br>
                annoyed, and quite sad about his queen; she was the prettiest 
                doll<br>
                he had, and the bull-dog had broken her head and shoulders off. 
                But<br>
                after all the people were gone away, the stranger, who came with 
                John, said that he could soon set her to rights. And then he brought 
                out his box and rubbed the doll with some of the salve with which 
                he had cured the old woman when she broke her leg. As soon as 
                this was done the doll's back became quite right again; her head 
                and shoulders were fixed on, and she could even move her limbs 
                herself: there was now no occasion to pull the wires, for the 
                doll acted just like a living creature, excepting that she could 
                not speak. The man to whom the show belonged was quite delighted 
                at having a doll who could dance of herself without being pulled 
                by the wires; none of the other dolls could do this.<br>
              </p>
              <p>During the night, when all the people at the inn were gone to 
                bed,<br>
                some one was heard to sigh so deeply and painfully, and the sighing<br>
                continued for so long a time, that every one got up to see what<br>
                could be the matter. The showman went at once to his little theatre<br>
                and found that it proceeded from the dolls, who all lay on the 
                floor<br>
                sighing piteously, and staring with their glass eyes; they all<br>
                wanted to be rubbed with the ointment, so that, like the queen, 
                they<br>
                might be able to move of themselves. The queen threw herself on 
                her<br>
                knees, took off her beautiful crown, and, holding it in her hand,<br>
                cried, &quot;Take this from me, but do rub my husband and his 
                courtiers.&quot;<br>
                The poor man who owned the theatre could scarcely refrain from<br>
                weeping; he was so sorry that he could not help them. Then he<br>
                immediately spoke to John's comrade, and promised him all the 
                money he might receive at the next evening's performance, if he 
                would only rub the ointment on four or five of his dolls. But 
                the<br>
                fellow-traveller said he did not require anything in return, excepting<br>
                the sword which the showman wore by his side. As soon as he received 
                the sword he anointed six of the dolls with the ointment, and 
                they were able immediately to dance so gracefully that all the 
                living girls in the room could not help joining in the dance. 
                The coachman danced with the cook, and the waiters with the chambermaids, 
                and all the strangers joined; even the tongs and the fire-shovel 
                made an<br>
                attempt, but they fell down after the first jump. So after all 
                it<br>
                was a very merry night. The next morning John and his companion 
                left the inn to continue their journey through the great pine-forests 
                and<br>
                over the high mountains. They arrived at last at such a great 
                height<br>
                that towns and villages lay beneath them, and the church steeples<br>
                looked like little specks between the green trees. They could 
                see<br>
                for miles round, far away to places they had never visited, and 
                John<br>
                saw more of the beautiful world than he had ever known before. 
                The sun shone brightly in the blue firmament above, and through 
                the clear<br>
                mountain air came the sound of the huntsman's horn, and the soft,<br>
                sweet notes brought tears into his eyes, and he could not help<br>
                exclaiming, &quot;How good and loving God is to give us all this 
                beauty and loveliness in the world to make us happy!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>His fellow-traveller stood by with folded hands, gazing on the<br>
                dark wood and the towns bathed in the warm sunshine. At this moment 
                there sounded over their heads sweet music. They looked up, and 
                discovered a large white swan hovering in the air, and singing 
                as never bird sang before. But the song soon became weaker and 
                weaker, the bird's head drooped, and he sunk slowly down, and 
                lay dead at their feet.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is a beautiful bird,&quot; said the traveller, &quot;and 
                these large<br>
                white wings are worth a great deal of money. I will take them 
                with me.<br>
                You see now that a sword will be very useful.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>So he cut off the wings of the dead swan with one blow, and<br>
                carried them away with him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They now continued their journey over the mountains for many<br>
                miles, till they at length reached a large city, containing hundreds<br>
                of towers, that shone in the sunshine like silver. In the midst 
                of the<br>
                city stood a splendid marble palace, roofed with pure red gold, 
                in<br>
                which dwelt the king. John and his companion would not go into 
                the<br>
                town immediately; so they stopped at an inn outside the town, 
                to<br>
                change their clothes; for they wished to appear respectable as 
                they<br>
                walked through the streets. The landlord told them that the king 
                was a<br>
                very good man, who never injured any one: but as to his daughter,<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Heaven defend us!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>She was indeed a wicked princess. She possessed beauty enough-<br>
                nobody could be more elegant or prettier than she was; but what 
                of<br>
                that? for she was a wicked witch; and in consequence of her conduct<br>
                many noble young princes had lost their lives. Any one was at<br>
                liberty to make her an offer; were he a prince or a beggar, it<br>
                mattered not to her. She would ask him to guess three things which 
                she had just thought of, and if he succeed, he was to marry her, 
                and be king over all the land when her father died; but if he 
                could not guess these three things, then she ordered him to be 
                hanged or to have his head cut off. The old king, her father, 
                was very much grieved at her conduct, but he could not prevent 
                her from being so wicked, because he once said he would have nothing 
                more to do with her lovers; she might do as she pleased. Each 
                prince who came and tried the three guesses, so that he might 
                marry the princess, had been unable to find them out, and had 
                been hanged or beheaded. They had all been warned in time, and 
                might have left her alone, if they would. The old king became 
                at last so distressed at all these dreadful<br>
                circumstances, that for a whole day every year he and his soldiers<br>
                knelt and prayed that the princess might become good; but she<br>
                continued as wicked as ever. The old women who drank brandy would 
                color it quite black before they drank it, to show how they mourned; 
                and what more could they do?<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What a horrible princess!&quot; said John; &quot;she ought 
                to be well<br>
                flogged. If I were the old king, I would have her punished in 
                some<br>
                way.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Just then they heard the people outside shouting, &quot;Hurrah!&quot; 
                and,<br>
                looking out, they saw the princess passing by; and she was really 
                so<br>
                beautiful that everybody forgot her wickedness, and shouted<br>
                &quot;Hurrah!&quot; Twelve lovely maidens in white silk dresses, 
                holding<br>
                golden tulips in their hands, rode by her side on coal-black horses.<br>
                The princess herself had a snow-white steed, decked with diamonds<br>
                and rubies. Her dress was of cloth of gold, and the whip she held 
                in<br>
                her hand looked like a sunbeam. The golden crown on her head glittered 
                like the stars of heaven, and her mantle was formed of thousands 
                of butterflies' wings sewn together. Yet she herself was more 
                beautiful than all.<br>
              </p>
              <p>When John saw her, his face became as red as a drop of blood,<br>
                and he could scarcely utter a word. The princess looked exactly 
                like<br>
                the beautiful lady with the golden crown, of whom he had dreamed 
                on<br>
                the night his father died. She appeared to him so lovely that 
                he could<br>
                not help loving her.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It could not be true,&quot; he thought, &quot;that she 
                was really a<br>
                wicked witch, who ordered people to be hanged or beheaded, if 
                they<br>
                could not guess her thoughts. Every one has permission to go and 
                ask her hand, even the poorest beggar. I shall pay a visit to 
                the palace,&quot; he said; &quot;I must go, for I cannot help 
                myself.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then they all advised him not to attempt it; for he would be<br>
                sure to share the same fate as the rest. His fellow-traveller 
                also<br>
                tried to persuade him against it; but John seemed quite sure of<br>
                success. He brushed his shoes and his coat, washed his face and 
                his<br>
                hands, combed his soft flaxen hair, and then went out alone into 
                the<br>
                town, and walked to the palace.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Come in,&quot; said the king, as John knocked at the door. 
                John opened<br>
                it, and the old king, in a dressing gown and embroidered slippers,<br>
                came towards him. He had the crown on his head, carried his sceptre 
                in one hand, and the orb in the other. &quot;Wait a bit,&quot; 
                said he, and he<br>
                placed the orb under his arm, so that he could offer the other 
                hand to<br>
                John; but when he found that John was another suitor, he began 
                to weep so violently, that both the sceptre and the orb fell to 
                the floor, and he was obliged to wipe his eyes with his dressing 
                gown. Poor old king!<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Let her alone,&quot; he said; &quot;you will fare as badly 
                as all the others.<br>
                Come, I will show you.&quot; Then he led him out into the princess's<br>
                pleasure gardens, and there he saw a frightful sight. On every 
                tree<br>
                hung three or four king's sons who had wooed the princess, but 
                had not been able to guess the riddles she gave them. Their skeletons<br>
                rattled in every breeze, so that the terrified birds never dared 
                to<br>
                venture into the garden. All the flowers were supported by human 
                bones instead of sticks, and human skulls in the flower-pots grinned<br>
                horribly. It was really a doleful garden for a princess. &quot;Do 
                you see<br>
                all this?&quot; said the old king; &quot;your fate will be the 
                same as those who<br>
                are here, therefore do not attempt it. You really make me very<br>
                unhappy,- I take these things to heart so very much.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>John kissed the good old king's hand, and said he was sure it<br>
                would be all right, for he was quite enchanted with the beautiful<br>
                princess. Then the princess herself came riding into the palace 
                yard<br>
                with all her ladies, and he wished her &quot;Good morning.&quot; 
                She looked<br>
                wonderfully fair and lovely when she offered her hand to John, 
                and<br>
                he loved her more than ever. How could she be a wicked witch, 
                as all<br>
                the people asserted? He accompanied her into the hall, and the<br>
                little pages offered them gingerbread nuts and sweetmeats, but 
                the old<br>
                king was so unhappy he could eat nothing, and besides, gingerbread<br>
                nuts were too hard for him. It was decided that John should come 
                to<br>
                the palace the next day, when the judges and the whole of the<br>
                counsellors would be present, to try if he could guess the first<br>
                riddle. If he succeeded, he would have to come a second time; 
                but if<br>
                not, he would lose his life,- and no one had ever been able to 
                guess<br>
                even one. However, John was not at all anxious about the result 
                of his<br>
                trial; on the contrary, he was very merry. He thought only of 
                the<br>
                beautiful princess, and believed that in some way he should have 
                help,<br>
                but how he knew not, and did not like to think about it; so he<br>
                danced along the high-road as he went back to the inn, where he 
                had<br>
                left his fellow-traveller waiting for him. John could not refrain 
                from<br>
                telling him how gracious the princess had been, and how beautiful<br>
                she looked. He longed for the next day so much, that he might 
                go to<br>
                the palace and try his luck at guessing the riddles. But his comrade<br>
                shook his head, and looked very mournful. &quot;I do so wish you 
                to do<br>
                well,&quot; said he; &quot;we might have continued together much 
                longer, and now I am likely to lose you; you poor dear John! I 
                could shed tears, but I will not make you unhappy on the last 
                night we may be together. We will be merry, really merry this 
                evening; to-morrow, after you are<br>
                gone, shall be able to weep undisturbed.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was very quickly known among the inhabitants of the town that<br>
                another suitor had arrived for the princess, and there was great<br>
                sorrow in consequence. The theatre remained closed, the women 
                who sold sweetmeats tied crape round the sugar-sticks, and the 
                king and the priests were on their knees in the church. There 
                was a great<br>
                lamentation, for no one expected John to succeed better than those 
                who had been suitors before.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the evening John's comrade prepared a large bowl of punch,<br>
                and said, &quot;Now let us be merry, and drink to the health of 
                the<br>
                princess.&quot; But after drinking two glasses, John became so 
                sleepy, that<br>
                he could not keep his eyes open, and fell fast asleep. Then his<br>
                fellow-traveller lifted him gently out of his chair, and laid 
                him on<br>
                the bed; and as soon as it was quite dark, he took the two large 
                wings<br>
                which he had cut from the dead swan, and tied them firmly to his 
                own<br>
                shoulders. Then he put into his pocket the largest of the three 
                rods<br>
                which he had obtained from the old woman who had fallen and broken 
                her leg. After this he opened the window, and flew away over the 
                town, straight towards the palace, and seated himself in a corner, 
                under the window which looked into the bedroom of the princess.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The town was perfectly still when the clocks struck a quarter 
                to<br>
                twelve. Presently the window opened, and the princess, who had 
                large black wings to her shoulders, and a long white mantle, flew 
                away over the city towards a high mountain. The fellow-traveller, 
                who had made himself invisible, so that she could not possibly 
                see him, flew after her through the air, and whipped the princess 
                with his rod, so that the blood came whenever he struck her. Ah, 
                it was a strange<br>
                flight through the air! The wind caught her mantle, so that it<br>
                spread out on all sides, like the large sail of a ship, and the 
                moon<br>
                shone through it. &quot;How it hails, to be sure!&quot; said the 
                princess, at<br>
                each blow she received from the rod; and it served her right to 
                be<br>
                whipped.<br>
              </p>
              <p>At last she reached the side of the mountain, and knocked. The<br>
                mountain opened with a noise like the roll of thunder, and the<br>
                princess went in. The traveller followed her; no one could see 
                him, as<br>
                he had made himself invisible. They went through a long, wide 
                passage.<br>
              </p>
              <p>A thousand gleaming spiders ran here and there on the walls, 
                causing<br>
                them to glitter as if they were illuminated with fire. They next<br>
                entered a large hall built of silver and gold. Large red and blue<br>
                flowers shone on the walls, looking like sunflowers in size, but 
                no<br>
                one could dare to pluck them, for the stems were hideous poisonous<br>
                snakes, and the flowers were flames of fire, darting out of their<br>
                jaws. Shining glow-worms covered the ceiling, and sky-blue bats<br>
                flapped their transparent wings. Altogether the place had a<br>
                frightful appearance. In the middle of the floor stood a throne<br>
                supported by four skeleton horses, whose harness had been made 
                by<br>
                fiery-red spiders. The throne itself was made of milk-white glass, 
                and<br>
                the cushions were little black mice, each biting the other's tail.<br>
                Over it hung a canopy of rose-colored spider's webs, spotted with<br>
                the prettiest little green flies, which sparkled like precious 
                stones.<br>
              </p>
              <p>On the throne sat an old magician with a crown on his ugly head, 
                and a sceptre in his hand. He kissed the princess on the forehead, 
                seated<br>
                her by his side on the splendid throne, and then the music<br>
                commenced. Great black grasshoppers played the mouth organ, and 
                the owl struck herself on the body instead of a drum. It was altogether 
                a ridiculous concert. Little black goblins with false lights in<br>
                their caps danced about the hall; but no one could see the<br>
                traveller, and he had placed himself just behind the throne where 
                he<br>
                could see and hear everything. The courtiers who came in afterwards<br>
                looked noble and grand; but any one with common sense could see 
                what they really were, only broomsticks, with cabbages for heads. 
              </p>
              <p>The magician had given them life, and dressed them in embroidered 
                robes.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It answered very well, as they were only wanted for show. After<br>
                there had been a little dancing, the princess told the magician 
                that<br>
                she had a new suitor, and asked him what she could think of for 
                the<br>
                suitor to guess when he came to the castle the next morning.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Listen to what I say,&quot; said the magician, &quot;you 
                must choose<br>
                something very easy, he is less likely to guess it then. Think 
                of<br>
                one of your shoes, he will never imagine it is that. Then cut 
                his head<br>
                off; and mind you do not forget to bring his eyes with you to-morrow<br>
                night, that I may eat them.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The princess curtsied low, and said she would not forget the 
                eyes.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The magician then opened the mountain and she flew home again, 
                but<br>
                the traveller followed and flogged her so much with the rod, that<br>
                she sighed quite deeply about the heavy hail-storm, and made as 
                much haste as she could to get back to her bedroom through the 
                window.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The traveller then returned to the inn where John still slept, 
                took<br>
                off his wings and laid down on the bed, for he was very tired. 
                Early<br>
                in the morning John awoke, and when his fellow-traveller got up, 
                he<br>
                said that he had a very wonderful dream about the princess and 
                her<br>
                shoe, he therefore advised John to ask her if she had not thought 
                of<br>
                her shoe. Of course the traveller knew this from what the magician<br>
                in the mountain had said.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I may as well say that as anything,&quot; said John. &quot;Perhaps 
                your<br>
                dream may come true; still I will say farewell, for if I guess 
                wrong I<br>
                shall never see you again.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then they embraced each other, and John went into the town and<br>
                walked to the palace. The great hall was full of people, and the<br>
                judges sat in arm-chairs, with eider-down cushions to rest their 
                heads<br>
                upon, because they had so much to think of. The old king stood 
                near,<br>
                wiping his eyes with his white pocket-handkerchief. When the<br>
                princess entered, she looked even more beautiful than she had 
                appeared the day before, and greeted every one present most gracefully; 
                but to John she gave her hand, and said, &quot;Good morning to 
                you.&quot; Now came the time for John to guess what she was thinking 
                of; and oh, how kindly she looked at him as she spoke. But when 
                he uttered the single word shoe, she turned as pale as a ghost; 
                all her wisdom could not help her, for he had guessed rightly. 
                Oh, how pleased the old king was! It was quite amusing to see 
                how he capered about. All the people clapped their hands, both 
                on his account and John's, who had guessed rightly the first time. 
                His fellow-traveller was glad also, when he heard how successful 
                John had been. But John folded his hands, and thanked God, who, 
                he felt quite sure, would help him again; and he knew he had to 
                guess twice more. The evening passed pleasantly like the one preceding. 
                While John slept, his companion flew behind the princess to the 
                mountain, and flogged her even harder than before; this time he 
                had taken two rods with him. No one saw him go in with her, and 
                he heard all that was said. The princess this time was to think 
                of a glove, and he told John as if he had again heard it in a 
                dream. The next day, therefore, he was able to guess correctly 
                the second time, and it caused great rejoicing at the<br>
                palace. The whole court jumped about as they had seen the king 
                do<br>
                the day before, but the princess lay on the sofa, and would not 
                say<br>
                a single word. All now depended upon John. If he only guessed<br>
                rightly the third time, he would marry the princess, and reign 
                over<br>
                the kingdom after the death of the old king: but if he failed, 
                he<br>
                would lose his life, and the magician would have his beautiful 
                blue<br>
                eyes. That evening John said his prayers and went to bed very 
                early,<br>
                and soon fell asleep calmly. But his companion tied on his wings 
                to<br>
                his shoulders, took three rods, and, with his sword at his side,<br>
                flew to the palace. It was a very dark night, and so stormy that 
                the<br>
                tiles flew from the roofs of the houses, and the trees in the 
                garden<br>
                upon which the skeletons hung bent themselves like reeds before 
                the<br>
                wind. The lightning flashed, and the thunder rolled in one<br>
                long-continued peal all night. The window of the castle opened, 
                and<br>
                the princess flew out. She was pale as death, but she laughed 
                at the<br>
                storm as if it were not bad enough. Her white mantle fluttered 
                in<br>
                the wind like a large sail, and the traveller flogged her with 
                the<br>
                three rods till the blood trickled down, and at last she could<br>
                scarcely fly; she contrived, however, to reach the mountain. &quot;What 
                a<br>
                hail-storm!&quot; she said, as she entered; &quot;I have never 
                been out in<br>
                such weather as this.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, there may be too much of a good thing sometimes,&quot; 
                said the<br>
                magician.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the princess told him that John had guessed rightly the<br>
                second time, and if he succeeded the next morning, he would win, 
                and she could never come to the mountain again, or practice magic 
                as she had done, and therefore she was quite unhappy. &quot;I 
                will find out<br>
                something for you to think of which he will never guess, unless 
                he<br>
                is a greater conjuror than myself. But now let us be merry.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then he took the princess by both hands, and they danced with<br>
                all the little goblins and Jack-o'-lanterns in the room. The red<br>
                spiders sprang here and there on the walls quite as merrily, and 
                the<br>
                flowers of fire appeared as if they were throwing out sparks. 
                The<br>
                owl beat the drum, the crickets whistled and the grasshoppers 
                played<br>
                the mouth-organ. It was a very ridiculous ball. After they had<br>
                danced enough, the princess was obliged to go home, for fear she<br>
                should be missed at the palace. The magician offered to go with 
                her,<br>
                that they might be company to each other on the way. Then they 
                flew<br>
                away through the bad weather, and the traveller followed them, 
                and<br>
                broke his three rods across their shoulders. The magician had 
                never<br>
                been out in such a hail-storm as this. Just by the palace the 
                magician<br>
                stopped to wish the princess farewell, and to whisper in her ear,<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;To-morrow think of my head.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the traveller heard it, and just as the princess slipped<br>
                through the window into her bedroom, and the magician turned round<br>
                to fly back to the mountain, he seized him by the long black beard,<br>
                and with his sabre cut off the wicked conjuror's head just behind<br>
                the shoulders, so that he could not even see who it was. He threw<br>
                the body into the sea to the fishes, and after dipping the head 
                into<br>
                the water, he tied it up in a silk handkerchief, took it with 
                him to<br>
                the inn, and then went to bed. The next morning he gave John the<br>
                handkerchief, and told him not to untie it till the princess asked 
                him<br>
                what she was thinking of. There were so many people in the great<br>
                hall of the palace that they stood as thick as radishes tied<br>
                together in a bundle. The council sat in their arm-chairs with 
                the<br>
                white cushions. The old king wore new robes, and the golden crown<br>
                and sceptre had been polished up so that he looked quite smart. 
                But<br>
                the princess was very pale, and wore a black dress as if she were<br>
                going to a funeral.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What have I thought of?&quot; asked the princess, of John. 
                He<br>
                immediately untied the handkerchief, and was himself quite<br>
                frightened when he saw the head of the ugly magician. Every one<br>
                shuddered, for it was terrible to look at; but the princess sat 
                like a<br>
                statue, and could not utter a single word. At length she rose 
                and gave<br>
                John her hand, for he had guessed rightly.<br>
              </p>
              <p>She looked at no one, but sighed deeply, and said, &quot;You 
                are my<br>
                master now; this evening our marriage must take place.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I am very pleased to hear it,&quot; said the old king. 
                &quot;It is just<br>
                what I wish.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then all the people shouted &quot;Hurrah.&quot; The band played 
                music in the<br>
                streets, the bells rang, and the cake-women took the black crape 
                off<br>
                the sugar-sticks. There was universal joy. Three oxen, stuffed 
                with<br>
                ducks and chickens, were roasted whole in the market-place, where<br>
                every one might help himself to a slice. The fountains spouted 
                forth<br>
                the most delicious wine, and whoever bought a penny loaf at the<br>
                baker's received six large buns, full of raisins, as a present. 
                In the<br>
                evening the whole town was illuminated. The soldiers fired off<br>
                cannons, and the boys let off crackers. There was eating and drinking, 
                dancing and jumping everywhere. In the palace, the high-born gentlemen 
                and beautiful ladies danced with each other, and they could be 
                heard at a great distance singing the following song:-</p>
              <p> &quot;Here are maidens, young and fair,<br>
                Dancing in the summer air;<br>
                Like two spinning-wheels at play,<br>
                Pretty maidens dance away-<br>
                Dance the spring and summer through<br>
                Till the sole falls from your shoe.&quot;</p>
              <p> But the princess was still a witch, and she could not love John.<br>
                His fellow-traveller had thought of that, so he gave John three<br>
                feathers out of the swan's wings, and a little bottle with a few 
                drops<br>
                in it. He told him to place a large bath full of water by the<br>
                princess's bed, and put the feathers and the drops into it. Then, 
                at<br>
                the moment she was about to get into bed, he must give her a little<br>
                push, so that she might fall into the water, and then dip her 
                three<br>
                times. This would destroy the power of the magician, and she would<br>
                love him very much. John did all that his companion told him to 
                do.<br>
                The princess shrieked aloud when he dipped her under the water 
                the<br>
                first time, and struggled under his hands in the form of a great 
                black<br>
                swan with fiery eyes. As she rose the second time from the water,<br>
                the swan had become white, with a black ring round its neck. John<br>
                allowed the water to close once more over the bird, and at the 
                same<br>
                time it changed into a most beautiful princess. She was more lovely<br>
                even than before, and thanked him, while her eyes sparkled with 
                tears,<br>
                for having broken the spell of the magician. The next day, the 
                king<br>
                came with the whole court to offer their congratulations, and 
                stayed<br>
                till quite late. Last of all came the travelling companion; he 
                had his<br>
                staff in his hand and his knapsack on his back. John kissed him 
                many<br>
                times and told him he must not go, he must remain with him, for 
                he was the cause of all his good fortune. But the traveller shook 
                his head, and said gently and kindly, &quot;No: my time is up 
                now; I have only paid my debt to you. Do you remember the dead 
                man whom the bad people wished to throw out of his coffin? You 
                gave all you possessed that he might rest in his grave; I am that 
                man.&quot; As he said this, he vanished.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The wedding festivities lasted a whole month. John and his<br>
                princess loved each other dearly, and the old king lived to see 
                many a<br>
                happy day, when he took their little children on his knees and 
                let<br>
                them play with his sceptre. And John became king over the whole<br>
                country.</p>

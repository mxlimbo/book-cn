              <p class="h" align="center"> THE SWAN'S NEST</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> BETWEEN the Baltic and the North Sea there lies an old swan's<br>
                nest, wherein swans are born and have been born that shall never 
                die.<br>
                In olden times a flock of swans flew over the Alps to the green<br>
                plains around Milan, where it was delightful to dwell. This flight<br>
                of swans men called the Lombards.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Another flock, with shining plumage and honest eyes, soared<br>
                southward to Byzantium; the swans established themselves there 
                close by the Emperor's throne, and spread their wings over him 
                as shields to protect him. They received the name of Varangians.<br>
              </p>
              <p>On the coast of France there sounded a cry of fear, for the<br>
                blood-stained swans that came from the North with fire under their<br>
                wings; and the people prayed, &quot;Heaven deliver us from the 
                wild<br>
                Northmen.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>On the fresh sward of England stood the Danish swan by the open<br>
                seashore, with the crown of three kingdoms on his head; and he<br>
                stretched out his golden sceptre over the land. The heathens on 
                the<br>
                Pomerian coast bent the knee, and the Danish swans came with the<br>
                banner of the Cross and with the drawn sword.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That was in the very old times,&quot; you say.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In later days two mighty swans have been seen to fly from the<br>
                nest. A light shone far through the air, far over the lands of 
                the<br>
                earth; the swan, with the strong beating of his wings, scattered 
                the<br>
                twilight mists, and the starry sky was seen, and it was as if 
                it<br>
                came nearer to the earth. That was the swan Tycho Brahe.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, then,&quot; you say; &quot;but in our own days?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>We have seen swan after swan soar by in glorious flight. One 
                let<br>
                his pinions glide over the strings of the golden harp, and it<br>
                resounded through the North. Norway's mountains seemed to rise<br>
                higher in the sunlight of former days; there was a rustling among<br>
                the pine trees and the birches; the gods of the North, the heroes, 
                and<br>
                the noble women, showed themselves in the dark forest depths.<br>
                We have seen a swan beat with his wings upon the marble crag, 
                so<br>
                that it burst, and the forms of beauty imprisoned in the stone 
                stepped<br>
                out to the sunny day, and men in the lands round about lifted 
                up their<br>
                heads to behold these mighty forms.<br>
              </p>
              <p>We have seen a third swan spinning the thread of thought that 
                is<br>
                fastened from country to country round the world, so that the 
                word may fly with lightning speed from land to land.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And our Lord loves the old swan's nest between the Baltic and<br>
                the North Sea. And when the mighty birds come soaring through 
                the<br>
                air to destroy it, even the callow young stand round in a circle 
                on<br>
                the margin of the nest, and though their breasts may be struck 
                so that<br>
                their blood flows, they bear it, and strike with their wings and 
                their<br>
                claws.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Centuries will pass by, swans will fly forth from the nest, men<br>
                will see them and hear them in the world, before it shall be said 
                in<br>
                spirit and in truth, &quot;This is the last swan- the last song 
                from the<br>
                swan's nest.&quot;</p>

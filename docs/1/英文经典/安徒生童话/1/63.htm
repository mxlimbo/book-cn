              <p class="h" align="center"> THE LAST DREAM OF THE OLD OAK</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> IN the forest, high up on the steep shore, and not far from 
                the<br>
                open seacoast, stood a very old oak-tree. It was just three hundred<br>
                and sixty-five years old, but that long time was to the tree as 
                the<br>
                same number of days might be to us; we wake by day and sleep by 
                night, and then we have our dreams. It is different with the tree; 
                it is<br>
                obliged to keep awake through three seasons of the year, and does<br>
                not get any sleep till winter comes. Winter is its time for rest; 
                its night after the long day of spring, summer, and autumn. On 
                many a warm summer, the Ephemera, the flies that exist for only 
                a day, had fluttered about the old oak, enjoyed life and felt 
                happy and if, for a moment, one of the tiny creatures rested on 
                one of his large fresh leaves, the tree would always say, &quot;Poor 
                little creature! your whole life consists only of a single day. 
                How very short. It must be quite melancholy.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Melancholy! what do you mean?&quot; the little creature 
                would always<br>
                reply. &quot;Everything around me is so wonderfully bright and 
                warm, and<br>
                beautiful, that it makes me joyous.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But only for one day, and then it is all over.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Over!&quot; repeated the fly; &quot;what is the meaning 
                of all over? Are<br>
                you all over too?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No; I shall very likely live for thousands of your days, 
                and my<br>
                day is whole seasons long; indeed it is so long that you could 
                never<br>
                reckon it out.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No? then I don't understand you. You may have thousands 
                of my<br>
                days, but I have thousands of moments in which I can be merry 
                and<br>
                happy. Does all the beauty of the world cease when you die?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No,&quot; replied the tree; &quot;it will certainly last 
                much longer,-<br>
                infinitely longer than I can even think of. &quot;Well, then,&quot; 
                said the<br>
                little fly, &quot;we have the same time to live; only we reckon<br>
                differently.&quot; And the little creature danced and floated 
                in the air,<br>
                rejoicing in her delicate wings of gauze and velvet, rejoicing 
                in<br>
                the balmy breezes, laden with the fragrance of clover-fields and<br>
                wild roses, elder-blossoms and honeysuckle, from the garden hedges,<br>
                wild thyme, primroses, and mint, and the scent of all these was 
                so<br>
                strong that the perfume almost intoxicated the little fly. The 
                long<br>
                and beautiful day had been so full of joy and sweet delights, 
                that<br>
                when the sun sank low it felt tired of all its happiness and<br>
                enjoyment. Its wings could sustain it no longer, and gently and 
                slowly<br>
                it glided down upon the soft waving blades of grass, nodded its 
                little<br>
                head as well as it could nod, and slept peacefully and sweetly. 
                The<br>
                fly was dead.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Poor little Ephemera!&quot; said the oak; &quot;what a 
                terribly short<br>
                life!&quot; And so, on every summer day the dance was repeated, 
                the same<br>
                questions asked, and the same answers given. The same thing was<br>
                continued through many generations of Ephemera; all of them felt<br>
                equally merry and equally happy.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The oak remained awake through the morning of spring, the noon<br>
                of summer, and the evening of autumn; its time of rest, its night 
                drew<br>
                nigh- winter was coming. Already the storms were singing, &quot;Good-night, 
                good-night.&quot; Here fell a leaf and there fell a leaf. &quot;We 
                will rock you and lull you. Go to sleep, go to sleep. We will 
                sing you to sleep, and shake you to sleep, and it will do your 
                old twigs good; they will even crackle with pleasure. Sleep sweetly, 
                sleep sweetly, it is your<br>
                three-hundred-and-sixty-fifth night. Correctly speaking, you are 
                but a<br>
                youngster in the world. Sleep sweetly, the clouds will drop snow<br>
                upon you, which will be quite a cover-lid, warm and sheltering 
                to your<br>
                feet. Sweet sleep to you, and pleasant dreams.&quot; And there 
                stood the<br>
                oak, stripped of all its leaves, left to rest during the whole 
                of a<br>
                long winter, and to dream many dreams of events that had happened 
                in its life, as in the dreams of men. The great tree had once 
                been small; indeed, in its cradle it had been an acorn. According 
                to human<br>
                computation, it was now in the fourth century of its existence. 
                It was<br>
                the largest and best tree in the forest. Its summit towered above<br>
                all the other trees, and could be seen far out at sea, so that 
                it<br>
                served as a landmark to the sailors. It had no idea how many eyes<br>
                looked eagerly for it. In its topmost branches the wood-pigeon 
                built<br>
                her nest, and the cuckoo carried out his usual vocal performances, 
                and his well-known notes echoed amid the boughs; and in autumn, 
                when the leaves looked like beaten copper plates, the birds of 
                passage would come and rest upon the branches before taking their 
                flight across the sea. But now it was winter, the tree stood leafless, 
                so that every one could see how crooked and bent were the branches 
                that sprang forth from the trunk. Crows and rooks came by turns 
                and sat on them, and talked of the hard times which were beginning, 
                and how difficult it was in winter to obtain food.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was just about holy Christmas time that the tree dreamed a<br>
                dream. The tree had, doubtless, a kind of feeling that the festive<br>
                time had arrived, and in his dream fancied he heard the bells<br>
                ringing from all the churches round, and yet it seemed to him 
                to be<br>
                a beautiful summer's day, mild and warm. His mighty summits was<br>
                crowned with spreading fresh green foliage; the sunbeams played<br>
                among the leaves and branches, and the air was full of fragrance<br>
                from herb and blossom; painted butterflies chased each other; 
                the<br>
                summer flies danced around him, as if the world had been created<br>
                merely for them to dance and be merry in. All that had happened 
                to the tree during every year of his life seemed to pass before 
                him, as in<br>
                a festive procession. He saw the knights of olden times and noble<br>
                ladies ride by through the wood on their gallant steeds, with 
                plumes<br>
                waving in their hats, and falcons on their wrists. The hunting 
                horn<br>
                sounded, and the dogs barked. He saw hostile warriors, in colored<br>
                dresses and glittering armor, with spear and halberd, pitching 
                their<br>
                tents, and anon striking them. The watchfires again blazed, and 
                men<br>
                sang and slept under the hospitable shelter of the tree. He saw 
                lovers<br>
                meet in quiet happiness near him in the moonshine, and carve the<br>
                initials of their names in the grayish-green bark on his trunk.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Once, but long years had intervened since then, guitars and Eolian<br>
                harps had been hung on his boughs by merry travellers; now they 
                seemed to hang there again, and he could hear their marvellous 
                tones. </p>
              <p>The wood-pigeons cooed as if to explain the feelings of the tree, 
                and<br>
                the cuckoo called out to tell him how many summer days he had 
                yet to live. Then it seemed as if new life was thrilling through 
                every<br>
                fibre of root and stem and leaf, rising even to the highest<br>
                branches. The tree felt itself stretching and spreading out, while 
                through the root beneath the earth ran the warm vigor of life. 
                As he<br>
                grew higher and still higher, with increased strength, his topmost<br>
                boughs became broader and fuller; and in proportion to his growth,<br>
                so was his self-satisfaction increased, and with it arose a joyous<br>
                longing to grow higher and higher, to reach even to the warm, 
                bright<br>
                sun itself. Already had his topmost branches pierced the clouds, 
                which floated beneath them like troops of birds of passage, or 
                large white swans; every leaf seemed gifted with sight, as if 
                it possessed eyes to see. The stars became visible in broad daylight, 
                large and<br>
                sparkling, like clear and gentle eyes. They recalled to the memory 
                the<br>
                well-known look in the eyes of a child, or in the eyes of lovers 
                who<br>
                had once met beneath the branches of the old oak. These were wonderful 
                and happy moments for the old tree, full of peace and joy; and 
                yet, amidst all this happiness, the tree felt a yearning, longing 
                desire that all the other trees, bushes, herbs, and flowers beneath 
                him,<br>
                might be able also to rise higher, as he had done, and to see 
                all this<br>
                splendor, and experience the same happiness. The grand, majestic 
                oak could not be quite happy in the midst of his enjoyment, while 
                all<br>
                the rest, both great and small, were not with him. And this feeling 
                of<br>
                yearning trembled through every branch, through every leaf, as<br>
                warmly and fervently as if they had been the fibres of a human<br>
                heart. The summit of the tree waved to and fro, and bent downwards<br>
                as if in his silent longing he sought for something. Then there 
                came<br>
                to him the fragrance of thyme, followed by the more powerful scent<br>
                of honeysuckle and violets; and he fancied he heard the note of 
                the<br>
                cuckoo. At length his longing was satisfied. Up through the clouds<br>
                came the green summits of the forest trees, and beneath him, the 
                oak<br>
                saw them rising, and growing higher and higher. Bush and herb 
                shot<br>
                upward, and some even tore themselves up by the roots to rise 
                more<br>
                quickly. The birch-tree was the quickest of all. Like a lightning<br>
                flash the slender stem shot upwards in a zigzag line, the branches<br>
                spreading around it like green gauze and banners. Every native 
                of<br>
                the wood, even to the brown and feathery rushes, grew with the 
                rest,<br>
                while the birds ascended with the melody of song. On a blade of 
                grass, that fluttered in the air like a long, green ribbon, sat 
                a<br>
                grasshopper, cleaning his wings with his legs. May beetles hummed, 
                the bees murmured, the birds sang, each in his own way; the air 
                was filled with the sounds of song and gladness.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But where is the little blue flower that grows by the water?&quot;<br>
                asked the oak, &quot;and the purple bell-flower, and the daisy?&quot; 
                You see<br>
                the oak wanted to have them all with him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Here we are, we are here,&quot; sounded in voice and song.<br>
                &quot;But the beautiful thyme of last summer, where is that? and 
                the<br>
                lilies-of-the-valley, which last year covered the earth with their<br>
                bloom? and the wild apple-tree with its lovely blossoms, and all 
                the<br>
                glory of the wood, which has flourished year after year? even 
                what may have but now sprouted forth could be with us here.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We are here, we are here,&quot; sounded voices higher in 
                the air, as<br>
                if they had flown there beforehand.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Why this is beautiful, too beautiful to be believed,&quot; 
                said the<br>
                oak in a joyful tone. &quot;I have them all here, both great and 
                small; not<br>
                one has been forgotten. Can such happiness be imagined?&quot; 
                It seemed<br>
                almost impossible.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;In heaven with the Eternal God, it can be imagined, and 
                it is<br>
                possible,&quot; sounded the reply through the air.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the old tree, as it still grew upwards and onwards, felt<br>
                that his roots were loosening themselves from the earth.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is right so, it is best,&quot; said the tree, &quot;no 
                fetters hold me<br>
                now. I can fly up to the very highest point in light and glory. 
                And<br>
                all I love are with me, both small and great. All- all are here.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Such was the dream of the old oak: and while he dreamed, a<br>
                mighty storm came rushing over land and sea, at the holy Christmas<br>
                time. The sea rolled in great billows towards the shore. There 
                was a<br>
                cracking and crushing heard in the tree. The root was torn from 
                the<br>
                ground just at the moment when in his dream he fancied it was 
                being<br>
                loosened from the earth. He fell- his three hundred and sixty-five<br>
                years were passed as the single day of the Ephemera. On the morning 
                of Christmas-day, when the sun rose, the storm had ceased. From 
                all the churches sounded the festive bells, and from every hearth, 
                even of the smallest hut, rose the smoke into the blue sky, like 
                the smoke from the festive thank-offerings on the Druids' altars. 
                The sea gradually became calm, and on board a great ship that 
                had withstood the tempest during the night, all the flags were 
                displayed, as a token<br>
                of joy and festivity. &quot;The tree is down! The old oak,- our 
                landmark on the coast!&quot; exclaimed the sailors. &quot;It must 
                have fallen in the storm<br>
                of last night. Who can replace it? Alas! no one.&quot; This was 
                a funeral<br>
                oration over the old tree; short, but well-meant. There it lay<br>
                stretched on the snow-covered shore, and over it sounded the notes<br>
                of a song from the ship- a song of Christmas joy, and of the<br>
                redemption of the soul of man, and of eternal life through Christ's<br>
                atoning blood.</p>
              <p> &quot;Sing aloud on the happy morn,<br>
                All is fulfilled, for Christ is born;<br>
                With songs of joy let us loudly sing,<br>
                'Hallelujahs to Christ our King.'&quot;</p>
              <p>Thus sounded the old Christmas carol, and every one on board 
                the<br>
                ship felt his thoughts elevated, through the song and the prayer, 
                even<br>
                as the old tree had felt lifted up in its last, its beautiful 
                dream on<br>
                that Christmas morn.</p>

              <p class="h" align="center"> THE BRAVE TIN SOLDIER</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THERE were once five-and-twenty tin soldiers, who were all<br>
                brothers, for they had been made out of the same old tin spoon. 
                They<br>
                shouldered arms and looked straight before them, and wore a splendid 
                uniform, red and blue. The first thing in the world they ever 
                heard were the words, &quot;Tin soldiers!&quot; uttered by a little 
                boy, who clapped his hands with delight when the lid of the box, 
                in which they lay, was taken off. They were given him for a birthday 
                present, and he stood at the table to set them up. The soldiers 
                were all exactly alike,<br>
                excepting one, who had only one leg; he had been left to the last, 
                and<br>
                then there was not enough of the melted tin to finish him, so 
                they<br>
                made him to stand firmly on one leg, and this caused him to be 
                very<br>
                remarkable.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The table on which the tin soldiers stood, was covered with<br>
                other playthings, but the most attractive to the eye was a pretty<br>
                little paper castle. Through the small windows the rooms could 
                be<br>
                seen. In front of the castle a number of little trees surrounded 
                a<br>
                piece of looking-glass, which was intended to represent a<br>
                transparent lake. Swans, made of wax, swam on the lake, and were<br>
                reflected in it. All this was very pretty, but the prettiest of 
                all<br>
                was a tiny little lady, who stood at the open door of the castle; 
                she,<br>
                also, was made of paper, and she wore a dress of clear muslin, 
                with<br>
                a narrow blue ribbon over her shoulders just like a scarf. In 
                front of<br>
                these was fixed a glittering tinsel rose, as large as her whole<br>
                face. The little lady was a dancer, and she stretched out both 
                her<br>
                arms, and raised one of her legs so high, that the tin soldier 
                could<br>
                not see it at all, and he thought that she, like himself, had 
                only one<br>
                leg. &quot;That is the wife for me,&quot; he thought; &quot;but 
                she is too grand, and<br>
                lives in a castle, while I have only a box to live in, five-and-twenty<br>
                of us altogether, that is no place for her. Still I must try and<br>
                make her acquaintance.&quot; Then he laid himself at full length 
                on the<br>
                table behind a snuff-box that stood upon it, so that he could 
                peep<br>
                at the little delicate lady, who continued to stand on one leg 
                without<br>
                losing her balance. When evening came, the other tin soldiers 
                were all<br>
                placed in the box, and the people of the house went to bed. Then 
                the<br>
                playthings began to have their own games together, to pay visits, 
                to<br>
                have sham fights, and to give balls. The tin soldiers rattled 
                in their<br>
                box; they wanted to get out and join the amusements, but they 
                could<br>
                not open the lid. The nut-crackers played at leap-frog, and the 
                pencil<br>
                jumped about the table. There was such a noise that the canary 
                woke up and began to talk, and in poetry too. Only the tin soldier 
                and the<br>
                dancer remained in their places. She stood on tiptoe, with her 
                legs<br>
                stretched out, as firmly as he did on his one leg. He never took 
                his<br>
                eyes from her for even a moment. The clock struck twelve, and, 
                with<br>
                a bounce, up sprang the lid of the snuff-box; but, instead of 
                snuff,<br>
                there jumped up a little black goblin; for the snuff-box was a 
                toy<br>
                puzzle.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Tin soldier,&quot; said the goblin, &quot;don't wish for 
                what does not<br>
                belong to you.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the tin soldier pretended not to hear.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Very well; wait till to-morrow, then,&quot; said the goblin.<br>
                When the children came in the next morning, they placed the tin<br>
                soldier in the window. Now, whether it was the goblin who did 
                it, or<br>
                the draught, is not known, but the window flew open, and out fell<br>
                the tin soldier, heels over head, from the third story, into the<br>
                street beneath. It was a terrible fall; for he came head downwards,<br>
                his helmet and his bayonet stuck in between the flagstones, and 
                his<br>
                one leg up in the air. The servant maid and the little boy went 
                down<br>
                stairs directly to look for him; but he was nowhere to be seen,<br>
                although once they nearly trod upon him. If he had called out, 
                &quot;Here I<br>
                am,&quot; it would have been all right, but he was too proud to 
                cry out for<br>
                help while he wore a uniform.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Presently it began to rain, and the drops fell faster and<br>
                faster, till there was a heavy shower. When it was over, two boys<br>
                happened to pass by, and one of them said, &quot;Look, there is 
                a tin<br>
                soldier. He ought to have a boat to sail in.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>So they made a boat out of a newspaper, and placed the tin soldier<br>
                in it, and sent him sailing down the gutter, while the two boys 
                ran by<br>
                the side of it, and clapped their hands. Good gracious, what large<br>
                waves arose in that gutter! and how fast the stream rolled on! 
                for the<br>
                rain had been very heavy. The paper boat rocked up and down, and<br>
                turned itself round sometimes so quickly that the tin soldier<br>
                trembled; yet he remained firm; his countenance did not change; 
                he<br>
                looked straight before him, and shouldered his musket. Suddenly 
                the<br>
                boat shot under a bridge which formed a part of a drain, and then 
                it<br>
                was as dark as the tin soldier's box.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Where am I going now?&quot; thought he. &quot;This is the 
                black goblin's<br>
                fault, I am sure. Ah, well, if the little lady were only here 
                with<br>
                me in the boat, I should not care for any darkness.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Suddenly there appeared a great water-rat, who lived in the drain.<br>
                &quot;Have you a passport?&quot; asked the rat, &quot;give it 
                to me at once.&quot; But<br>
                the tin soldier remained silent and held his musket tighter than 
                ever.<br>
                The boat sailed on and the rat followed it. How he did gnash his 
                teeth<br>
                and cry out to the bits of wood and straw, &quot;Stop him, stop 
                him; he has not paid toll, and has not shown his pass.&quot; But 
                the stream rushed on stronger and stronger. The tin soldier could 
                already see daylight<br>
                shining where the arch ended. Then he heard a roaring sound quite<br>
                terrible enough to frighten the bravest man. At the end of the<br>
                tunnel the drain fell into a large canal over a steep place, which<br>
                made it as dangerous for him as a waterfall would be to us. He 
                was too close to it to stop, so the boat rushed on, and the poor 
                tin soldier<br>
                could only hold himself as stiffly as possible, without moving 
                an<br>
                eyelid, to show that he was not afraid. The boat whirled round 
                three<br>
                or four times, and then filled with water to the very edge; nothing<br>
                could save it from sinking. He now stood up to his neck in water,<br>
                while deeper and deeper sank the boat, and the paper became soft 
                and loose with the wet, till at last the water closed over the 
                soldier's<br>
                head. He thought of the elegant little dancer whom he should never 
                see again, and the words of the song sounded in his ears-</p>
              <p>&quot;Farewell, warrior! ever brave,<br>
                Drifting onward to thy grave.&quot;</p>
              <p> Then the paper boat fell to pieces, and the soldier sank into<br>
                the water and immediately afterwards was swallowed up by a great 
                fish.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Oh how dark it was inside the fish! A great deal darker than 
                in the<br>
                tunnel, and narrower too, but the tin soldier continued firm, 
                and<br>
                lay at full length shouldering his musket. The fish swam to and 
                fro,<br>
                making the most wonderful movements, but at last he became quite<br>
                still. After a while, a flash of lightning seemed to pass through 
                him,<br>
                and then the daylight approached, and a voice cried out, &quot;I 
                declare<br>
                here is the tin soldier.&quot; The fish had been caught, taken 
                to the<br>
                market and sold to the cook, who took him into the kitchen and 
                cut him open with a large knife. She picked up the soldier and 
                held him by the waist between her finger and thumb, and carried 
                him into the room.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They were all anxious to see this wonderful soldier who had<br>
                travelled about inside a fish; but he was not at all proud. They<br>
                placed him on the table, and- how many curious things do happen 
                in the world!- there he was in the very same room from the window 
                of which he had fallen, there were the same children, the same 
                playthings, standing on the table, and the pretty castle with 
                the elegant little dancer at the door; she still balanced herself 
                on one leg, and held up the other, so she was as firm as himself. 
                It touched the tin soldier<br>
                so much to see her that he almost wept tin tears, but he kept 
                them<br>
                back. He only looked at her and they both remained silent. Presently<br>
                one of the little boys took up the tin soldier, and threw him 
                into the<br>
                stove. He had no reason for doing so, therefore it must have been<br>
                the fault of the black goblin who lived in the snuff-box. The 
                flames<br>
                lighted up the tin soldier, as he stood, the heat was very terrible,<br>
                but whether it proceeded from the real fire or from the fire of 
                love<br>
                he could not tell. Then he could see that the bright colors were 
                faded<br>
                from his uniform, but whether they had been washed off during 
                his<br>
                journey or from the effects of his sorrow, no one could say. He 
                looked at the little lady, and she looked at him. He felt himself 
                melting<br>
                away, but he still remained firm with his gun on his shoulder.<br>
                Suddenly the door of the room flew open and the draught of air<br>
                caught up the little dancer, she fluttered like a sylph right 
                into the<br>
                stove by the side of the tin soldier, and was instantly in flames<br>
                and was gone. The tin soldier melted down into a lump, and the 
                next<br>
                morning, when the maid servant took the ashes out of the stove, 
                she<br>
                found him in the shape of a little tin heart. But of the little 
                dancer<br>
                nothing remained but the tinsel rose, which was burnt black as 
                a<br>
                cinder.</p>

                SAYS THE MOOR WOMAN</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THERE was a man who once knew many stories, but they had slipped 
                away from him- so he said. The Story that used to visit him of 
                its own accord no longer came and knocked at his door. And why 
                did it come no longer? It is true enough that for days and years 
                the man had not thought of it, had not expected it to come and 
                knock; and if he had expected it, it would certainly not have 
                come; for without there was war, and within was the care and sorrow 
                that war brings with it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The stork and the swallows came back from their long journey,<br>
                for they thought of no danger; and, behold, when they arrived, 
                the<br>
                nest was burnt, the habitations of men were burnt, the hedges 
                were all<br>
                in disorder, and everything seemed gone, and the enemy's horses 
                were stamping in the old graves. Those were hard, gloomy times, 
                but they came to an end.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And now they were past and gone- so people said; yet no Story 
                came<br>
                and knocked at the door, or gave any tidings of its presence.<br>
                &quot;I suppose it must be dead, or gone away with many other<br>
                things,&quot; said the man.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the story never dies. And more than a whole year went by,<br>
                and he longed- oh, so very much!- for the Story.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I wonder if the Story will ever come back again and knock?&quot;<br>
                And he remembered it so well in all the various forms in which<br>
                it had come to him, sometimes young and charming, like spring<br>
                itself, sometimes as a beautiful maiden, with a wreath of thyme 
                in her<br>
                hair, and a beechen branch in her hand, and with eyes that gleamed<br>
                like deep woodland lakes in the bright sunshine.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Sometimes it had come to him in the guise of a peddler, and had<br>
                opened its box and let silver ribbon come fluttering out, with<br>
                verses and inscriptions of old remembrances.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But it was most charming of all when it came as an old<br>
                grandmother, with silvery hair, and such large, sensible eyes. 
                She<br>
                knew so well how to tell about the oldest times, long before the<br>
                princesses spun with the golden spindles, and the dragons lay<br>
                outside the castles, guarding them. She told with such an air 
                of<br>
                truth, that black spots danced before the eyes of all who heard 
                her,<br>
                and the floor became black with human blood; terrible to see and 
                to<br>
                hear, and yet so entertaining, because such a long time had passed<br>
                since it all happened.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Will it ever knock at my door again?&quot; said the man, 
                and he<br>
                gazed at the door, so that black spots came before his eyes and 
                upon<br>
                the floor; he did not know if it was blood, or mourning crape 
                from the dark heavy days.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And as he sat thus, the thought came upon him whether the Story<br>
                might not have hidden itself, like the princess in the old tale. 
                And<br>
                he would now go in search of it; if he found it, it would beam 
                in<br>
                new splendor, lovelier than ever.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Who knows? Perhaps it has hidden itself in the straw that<br>
                balances on the margin of the well. Carefully, carefully! Perhaps 
                it<br>
                lies hidden in a certain flower- that flower in one of the great 
                books<br>
                on the book-shelf.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the man went and opened one of the newest books, to gain<br>
                information on this point; but there was no flower to be found.<br>
                There he read about Holger Danske; and the man read that the tale<br>
                had been invented and put together by a monk in France, that it 
                was<br>
                a romance, &quot;translated into Danish and printed in that language;&quot; 
                that<br>
                Holger Danske had never really lived, and consequently could never<br>
                come again, as we have sung, and have been so glad to believe. 
                And<br>
                William Tell was treated just like Holger Danske. These were all<br>
                only myths- nothing on which we could depend; and yet it is all<br>
                written in a very learned book.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well, I shall believe what I believe!&quot; said the man. 
                &quot;There grows<br>
                no plantain where no foot has trod.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And he closed the book and put it back in its place, and went 
                to<br>
                the fresh flowers at the window. Perhaps the Story might have 
                hidden<br>
                itself in the red tulips, with the golden yellow edges, or in 
                the<br>
                fresh rose, or in the beaming camellia. The sunshine lay among 
                the<br>
                flowers, but no Story.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The flowers which had been here in the dark troublous time had<br>
                been much more beautiful; but they had been cut off, one after<br>
                another, to be woven into wreaths and placed in coffins, and the<br>
                flag had waved over them! Perhaps the Story had been buried with 
                the flowers; but then the flowers would have known of it, and 
                the coffin would have heard it, and every little blade of grass 
                that shot forth would have told of it. The Story never dies.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Perhaps it has been here once, and has knocked; but who had eyes<br>
                or ears for it in those times? People looked darkly, gloomily, 
                and<br>
                almost angrily at the sunshine of spring, at the twittering birds, 
                and<br>
                all the cheerful green; the tongue could not even bear the old<br>
                merry, popular songs, and they were laid in the coffin with so 
                much<br>
                that our heart held dear. The Story may have knocked without obtaining 
                a hearing; there was none to bid it welcome, and so it may have 
                gone away.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I will go forth and seek it. Out in the country! out in 
                the wood!<br>
                and on the open sea beach!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Out in the country lies an old manor house, with red walls,<br>
                pointed gables, and a red flag that floats on the tower. The<br>
                nightingale sings among the finely-fringed beech-leaves, looking 
                at<br>
                the blooming apple trees of the garden, and thinking that they 
                bear<br>
                roses. Here the bees are mightily busy in the summer-time, and 
                hover<br>
                round their queen with their humming song. The autumn has much 
                to tell of the wild chase, of the leaves of the trees, and of 
                the races of men that are passing away together. The wild swans 
                sing at<br>
                Christmas-time on the open water, while in the old hall the guests<br>
                by the fireside gladly listen to songs and to old legends.<br>
                Down into the old part of the garden, where the great avenue of<br>
                wild chestnut trees lures the wanderer to tread its shades, went 
                the<br>
                man who was in search of the Story; for here the wind had once<br>
                murmured something to him of &quot;Waldemar Daa and his Daughters.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>The Dryad in the tree, who was the Story-mother herself, had 
                here told him the &quot;Dream of the Old Oak Tree.&quot; Here, 
                in the time of the ancestra mother, had stood clipped hedges, 
                but now only ferns and stinging nettles grew there, hiding the 
                scattered fragments of old sculptured figures; the moss is growing 
                in their eyes, but they can see as well as ever, which was more 
                than the man could do who was in search of the Story, for he could 
                not find that. Where could it be?<br>
              </p>
              <p>The crows flew past him by hundreds across the old trees, and<br>
                screamed, &quot;Krah! da!- Krah! da!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And he went out of the garden and over the grass-plot of the 
                yard,<br>
                into the alder grove; there stood a little six-sided house, with 
                a<br>
                poultry-yard and a duck-yard. In the middle of the room sat the 
                old<br>
                woman who had the management of the whole, and who knew accurately 
                about every egg that was laid, and about every chicken that could 
                creep out of an egg. But she was not the Story of which the man 
                was in search; that she could attest with a Christian certificate 
                of<br>
                baptism and of vaccination that lay in her drawer.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Without, not far from the house, is a hill covered with<br>
                red-thorn and broom. Here lies an old grave-stone, which was brought 
                here many years ago from the churchyard of the provincial town, 
                a remembrance of one of the most honored councillors of the place; 
                his wife and his five daughters, all with folded hands and stiff 
                ruffs, stand round him. One could look at them so long, that it 
                had an effect upon the thoughts, and these reacted upon the stones, 
                as if they<br>
                were telling of old times; at least it had been so with the man 
                who<br>
                was in search of the Story.<br>
              </p>
              <p>As he came nearer, he noticed a living butterfly sitting on the<br>
                forehead of the sculptured councillor. The butterfly flapped its<br>
                wings, and flew a little bit farther, and then returned fatigued 
                to<br>
                sit upon the grave-stone, as if to point out what grew there.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Four-leaved shamrocks grew there; there were seven specimens 
                close<br>
                to each other. When fortune comes, it comes in a heap. He plucked<br>
                the shamrocks and put them in his pocket.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Fortune is as good as red gold, but a new charming story 
                would be<br>
                better still,&quot; thought the man; but he could not find it 
                here.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the sun went down, round and large; the meadow was covered<br>
                with vapor. The moor-woman was at her brewing.</p>
              <p> It was evening. He stood alone in his room, and looked out upon<br>
                the sea, over the meadow, over moor and coast. The moon shone<br>
                bright, a mist was over the meadow, making it look like a great<br>
                lake; and, indeed, it was once so, as the legend tells- and in 
                the<br>
                moonlight the eye realizes these myths.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the man thought of what he had been reading in the town, 
                that<br>
                William Tell and Holger Danske never really lived, but yet live 
                in<br>
                popular story, like the lake yonder, a living evidence for such 
                myths.<br>
                Yes, Holger Danske will return again!<br>
              </p>
              <p>As he stood thus and thought, something beat quite strongly<br>
                against the window. Was it a bird, a bat or an owl? Those are 
                not<br>
                let in, even when they knock. The window flew open of itself, 
                and an<br>
                old woman looked in at the man.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What's your pleasure?&quot; said he. &quot;Who are you? 
                You're looking in<br>
                at the first floor window. Are you standing on a ladder?&quot;<br>
                &quot;You have a four-leaved shamrock in your pocket,&quot; she 
                replied.<br>
                &quot;Indeed, you have seven, and one of them is a six-leaved 
                one.&quot;<br>
                &quot;Who are you?&quot; asked the man again.<br>
                &quot;The Moor-woman,&quot; she replied. &quot;The Moor-woman 
                who brews. I was at it. The bung was in the cask, but one of the 
                little moor-imps pulled it out in his mischief, and flung it up 
                into the yard, where it beat<br>
                against the window; and now the beer's running out of the cask, 
                and<br>
                that won't do good to anybody.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Pray tell me some more!&quot; said the man.<br>
                &quot;Yes, wait a little,&quot; answered the Moor-woman. &quot;I've 
                something<br>
                else to do just now.&quot; And she was gone.<br>
                The man was going to shut the window, when the woman already stood 
                before him again.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now it's done,&quot; she said; &quot;but I shall have half 
                the beer to brew<br>
                over again to-morrow, if the weather is suitable. Well, what have<br>
                you to ask me? I've come back, for I always keep my word, and 
                you have seven four-leaved shamrocks in your pocket, and one of 
                them is a six-leaved one. That inspires respect, for that's an 
                order that<br>
                grows beside the sandy way; but that every one does not find. 
                What<br>
                have you to ask me? Don't stand there like a ridiculous oaf, for 
                I<br>
                must go back again directly to my bung and my cask.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the man asked about the Story, and inquired if the<br>
                Moor-woman had met it in her journeyings.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;By the big brewing-vat!&quot; exclaimed the woman, &quot;haven't 
                you got<br>
                stories enough? I really believe that most people have enough 
                of them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Here are other things to take notice of, other things to examine. 
                Even<br>
                the children have gone beyond that. Give the little boy a cigar, 
                and<br>
                the little girl a new crinoline; they like that much better. To 
                listen<br>
                to stories! No, indeed, there are more important things to be 
                done<br>
                here, and other things to notice!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; asked the man, &quot;and 
                what do you know of the world? You don't see anything but frogs 
                and Will-o'-the-Wisps!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, beware of the Will-o'-the-Wisps,&quot; said the Moor-woman,<br>
                &quot;for they're out- they're let loose- that's what we must 
                talk about!<br>
                Come to me in the moor, where my presence is necessary, and I 
                will<br>
                tell you all about it; but you must make haste, and come while 
                your<br>
                seven four-leaved shamrocks, for which one has six leaves, are 
                still<br>
                fresh, and the moon stands high!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the Moor-woman was gone.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It struck twelve in the town, and before the last stroke had<br>
                died away, the man was out in the yard, out in the garden, and 
                stood<br>
                in the meadow. The mist had vanished, and the Moor-woman stopped 
                her brewing.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You've been a long time coming!&quot; said the Moor-woman. 
                &quot;Witches<br>
                get forward faster than men, and I'm glad that I belong to the 
                witch<br>
                folk!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What have you to say to me now?&quot; asked the man. &quot;Is 
                it anything<br>
                about the Story?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Can you never get beyond asking about that?&quot; retorted 
                the woman.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Can you tell me anything about the poetry of the future?&quot; 
                resumed<br>
                the man.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Don't get on your stilts,&quot; said the crone, &quot;and 
                I'll answer<br>
                you. You think of nothing but poetry, and only ask about that 
                Story,<br>
                as if she were the lady of the whole troop. She's the oldest of 
                us<br>
                all, but she takes precedence of the youngest. I know her well. 
                I've<br>
                been young, too, and she's no chicken now. I was once quite a 
                pretty<br>
                elf-maiden, and have danced in my time with the others in the<br>
                moonlight, and have heard the nightingale, and have gone into 
                the<br>
                forest and met the Story-maiden, who was always to be found out 
                there, running about. Sometimes she took up her night's lodging 
                in a<br>
                half-blown tulip, or in a field flower; sometimes she would slip<br>
                into the church, and wrap herself in the mourning crape that hung 
                down from the candles on the altar.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You are capitally well-informed,&quot; said the man.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I ought at least to know as much as you,&quot; answered 
                the<br>
                Moor-woman. &quot;Stories and poetry- yes, they're like two yards 
                of the<br>
                same piece of stuff; they can go and lie down where they like, 
                and one can brew all their prattle, and have it all the better 
                and cheaper.<br>
              </p>
              <p>You shall have it from me for nothing. I have a whole cupboard-full 
                of poetry in bottles. It makes essences; and that's the best of 
                it-<br>
                bitter and sweet herbs. I have everything that people want of<br>
                poetry, in bottles, so that I can put a little on my handkerchief,<br>
                on holidays, to smell.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Why, these are wonderful things that you're telling!&quot; 
                said the<br>
                man. &quot;You have poetry in bottles?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;More than you can require,&quot; said the woman. &quot;I 
                suppose you know<br>
                the history of 'the Girl who Trod on the Loaf, so that she might 
                not<br>
                soil her shoes'? That has been written, and printed too.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I told that story myself,&quot; said the man.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, then you must know it; and you must know also that 
                the<br>
                girl sank into the earth directly, to the Moor-woman, just as 
                Old<br>
                Bogey's grandmother was paying her morning visit to inspect the<br>
                brewery. She saw the girl gliding down, and asked to have her 
                as a<br>
                remembrance of her visit, and got her too; while I received a<br>
                present that's of no use to me- a travelling druggist's shop- 
                a<br>
                whole cupboard-full of poetry in bottles. Grandmother told me 
                where<br>
                the cupboard was to be placed, and there it's standing still. 
                Just<br>
                look! You've your seven four-leaved shamrocks in your pocket, 
                one of which is a six-leaved one, and so you will be able to see 
                it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And really in the midst of the moor lay something like a great<br>
                knotted block of alder, and that was the old grandmother's cupboard.<br>
                The Moor-woman said that this was always open to her and to every<br>
                one in the land, if they only knew where the cupboard stood. It<br>
                could be opened either at the front or at the back, and at every<br>
                side and corner- a perfect work of art, and yet only an old alder<br>
                stump in appearance. The poets of all lands, and especially those 
                of<br>
                our own country, had been arranged here; the spirit of them had 
                been<br>
                extracted, refined, criticised and renovated, and then stored 
                up in<br>
                bottles. With what may be called great aptitude, if it was not<br>
                genius the grandmother had taken as it were the flavor of this 
                and<br>
                of that poet, and had added a little devilry, and then corked 
                up the<br>
                bottles for use during all future times.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Pray let me see,&quot; said the man.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, but there are more important things to hear,&quot; 
                replied the<br>
                Moor-woman.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But now we are at the cupboard!&quot; said the man. And 
                he looked<br>
                in. &quot;Here are bottles of all sizes. What is in this one? 
                and what in<br>
                that one yonder?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Here is what they call may-balm,&quot; replied the woman. 
                &quot;I have<br>
                not tried it myself. But I have not yet told you the 'more<br>
                important' thing you were to hear. THE WILL-O'-THE-WISP'S IN THE 
                TOWN!<br>
              </p>
              <p>That's of much more consequence than poetry and stories. I ought,<br>
                indeed, to hold my tongue; but there must be a necessity- a fate- 
                a<br>
                something that sticks in my throat, and that wants to come out. 
                Take<br>
                care, you mortals!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I don't understand a word of all this!&quot; cried the 
                man.<br>
                &quot;Be kind enough to seat yourself on that cupboard,&quot; 
                she<br>
                retorted, &quot;but take care you don't fall through and break 
                the bottles-<br>
                you know what's inside of them. I must tell of the great event. 
                It<br>
                occurred no longer ago than the day before yesterday. It did not<br>
                happen earlier. It has now three hundred and sixty-three days 
                to run<br>
                about. I suppose you know how many days there are in a year?&quot;<br>
                And this is what the Moor-woman told:<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There was a great commotion yesterday out here in the marsh!<br>
                There was a christening feast! A little Will-o'-the-Wisp was born<br>
                here- in fact, twelve of them were born all together; and they 
                have<br>
                permission, if they choose to use it, to go abroad among men, 
                and to<br>
                move about and command among them, just as if they were born<br>
                mortals. That was a great event in the marsh, and accordingly 
                all<br>
                the Will-o'-the-Wisps, male and female, went dancing like little<br>
                lights across the moor. There are some of them of the dog species, 
                but those are not worth mentioning. I sat there on the cupboard, 
                and had all the twelve little new-born Will-o'-the-Wisps upon 
                my lap. </p>
              <p>They shone like glow-worms; they already began to hop, and increased 
                in size every moment, so that before a quarter of an hour had 
                elapsed, each of them looked just as large as his father or his 
                uncle. Now, it's an old-established regulation and favor, that 
                when the moon stands just as it did yesterday, and the wind blows 
                just as it blew then, it is allowed and accorded to all Will-o'-the-Wisps- 
                that is, to all those who are born at that minute of time- to 
                become mortals,<br>
                and individually to exert their power for the space of one year.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The Will-o'-the-Wisp may run about in the country and through 
                the<br>
                world, if it is not afraid of falling into the sea, or of being<br>
                blown out by a heavy storm. It can enter into a person and speak 
                for<br>
                him, and make all the movements it pleases. The Will-o'-the-Wisp 
                may take whatever form he likes, of man or woman, and can act 
                in their spirit and in their disguise in such a way that he can 
                effect whatever he wishes to do. But he must manage, in the course 
                of the year, to lead three hundred and sixty-five people into 
                a bad way, and in a grand style, too. To lead them away from the 
                right and the truth;<br>
                and then he reaches the highest point. Such a Will-o'-the-Wisp 
                can<br>
                attain to the honor of being a runner before the devil's state<br>
                coach; and then he'll wear clothes of fiery yellow, and breathe<br>
                forth flames out of his throat. That's enough to make a simple<br>
                Will-o'-the-Wisp smack his lips. But there's some danger in this,<br>
                and a great deal of work for a Will-o'-the-Wisp who aspires to 
                play so distinguished a part. If the eyes of the man are opened 
                to what he is, and if the man can then blow him away, it's all 
                over with him, and<br>
                he must come back into the marsh; or if, before the year is up, 
                the<br>
                Will-o'-the-Wisp is seized with a longing to see his family, and 
                so<br>
                returns to it and gives the matter up, it is over with him likewise,<br>
                and he can no longer burn clear, and soon becomes extinguished, 
                and<br>
                cannot be lit up again; and when the year has elapsed, and he 
                has<br>
                not led three hundred and sixty-five people away from the truth 
                and<br>
                from all that is grand and noble, he is condemned to be imprisoned<br>
                in decayed wood, and to lie glimmering there, without being able 
                to<br>
                move; and that's the most terrible punishment that can be inflicted 
                on<br>
                a lively Will-o'-the-Wisp.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now, all this I know, and all this I told to the twelve 
                little<br>
                Will-o'-the-Wisps whom I had on my lap, and who seemed quite crazy 
                with joy.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I told them that the safest and most convenient course 
                was to<br>
                give up the honor, and do nothing at all; but the little flames<br>
                would not agree to this, and already fancied themselves clad in<br>
                fiery yellow clothes, breathing flames from their throats.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Stay with us,' said some of the older ones.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Carry on your sport with mortals,' said the others.<br>
                &quot;'The mortals are drying up our meadows; they've taken to<br>
                draining. What will our successors do?'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'We want to flame; we will flame- flame!' cried the new-born<br>
                Will-o'the-Wisps.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And thus the affair was settled.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And now a ball was given, a minute long; it could not well 
                be<br>
                shorter. The little elf-maidens whirled round three times with 
                the<br>
                rest, that they might not appear proud, but they preferred dancing<br>
                with one another.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And now the sponsors' gifts were presented, and presents 
                were<br>
                thrown them. These presents flew like pebbles across the sea-water.<br>
                Each of the elf-maidens gave a little piece of her veil.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Take that,' they said, 'and then you'll know the higher 
                dance,<br>
                the most difficult turns and twists- that is to say, if you should<br>
                find them necessary. You'll know the proper deportment, and then 
                you can show yourself in the very pick of society.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The night raven taught each of the young Will-o'-the-Wisps 
                to<br>
                say, 'Goo-goo-good,' and to say it in the right place; and that's 
                a<br>
                great gift which brings its own reward.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The owl and the stork- but they said it was not worth mentioning,<br>
                and so we won't mention it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;King Waldemar's wild chase was just then rushing over the 
                moor,<br>
                and when the great lords heard of the festivities that were going<br>
                on, they sent a couple of handsome dogs, which hunt on the spoor 
                of<br>
                the wind, as a present; and these might carry two or three of 
                the<br>
                Will-o'-the-Wisps. A couple of old Alpas, spirits who occupy<br>
                themselves with Alp-pressing, were also at the feast; and from 
                these<br>
                the young Will-o'-the-Wisps learned the art of slipping through<br>
                every key-hole, as if the door stood open before them. These Alpas<br>
                offered to carry the youngsters to the town, with which they were 
                well<br>
                acquainted. They usually rode through the atmosphere on their 
                own back hair, which is fastened into a knot, for they love a 
                hard seat; but<br>
                now they sat sideways on the wild hunting dogs, took the young<br>
                Will-o'-the-Wisps in their laps, who wanted to go into the town 
                to<br>
                mislead and entice mortals, and, whisk! away they were. Now, this 
                is<br>
                what happened last night. To-day the Will-o'-the-Wisps are in 
                the<br>
                town, and have taken the matter in hand- but where and how? Ah, 
                can<br>
                you tell me that? Still, I've a lightning conductor in my great 
                toe,<br>
                and that will always tell me something.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Why, this is a complete story,&quot; exclaimed the man.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, but it is only the beginning,&quot; replied the woman. 
                &quot;Can you<br>
                tell me how the Will-o'-the-Wisps deport themselves, and how they<br>
                behave? and in what shapes they have aforetime appeared and led 
                people into crooked paths?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I believe,&quot; replied the man, &quot;that one could 
                tell quite a romance<br>
                about the Will-o'-the-Wisps, in twelve parts; or, better still, 
                one<br>
                might make quite a popular play of them.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You might write that,&quot; said the woman, &quot;but it's 
                best let alone.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, that's better and more agreeable,&quot; the man replied, 
                &quot;for<br>
                then we shall escape from the newspapers, and not be tied up by<br>
                them, which is just as uncomfortable as for a Will-o'-the-Wisp 
                to<br>
                lie in decaying wood, to have to gleam, and not to be able to 
                stir.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I don't care about it either way,&quot; cried the woman. 
                &quot;Let the rest<br>
                write, those who can, and those who cannot likewise. I'll grant 
                you an<br>
                old bung from my cask that will open the cupboard where poetry's<br>
                kept in bottles, and you may take from that whatever may be wanting.<br>
                But you, my good man, seem to have blotted your hands sufficiently<br>
                with ink, and to have come to that age of satiety that you need 
                not be<br>
                running about every year for stories, especially as there are 
                much<br>
                more important things to be done. You must have understood what 
                is<br>
                going on?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The Will-o'-the-Wisp is in town,&quot; said the man. &quot;I've 
                heard it,<br>
                and I have understood it. But what do you think I ought to do? 
                I<br>
                should be thrashed if I were to go to the people and say, 'Look,<br>
                yonder goes a Will-o'-the-Wisp in his best clothes!'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;They also go in undress,&quot; replied the woman. &quot;The<br>
                Will-o'-the-Wisp can assume all kinds of forms, and appear in 
                every<br>
                place. He goes into the church, but not for the sake of the service;<br>
                and perhaps he may enter into one or other of the priests. He 
                speaks<br>
                in the Parliament, not for the benefit of the country, but only 
                for<br>
                himself. He's an artist with the color-pot as well as in the<br>
                theatre; but when he gets all the power into his own hands, then 
                the<br>
                pot's empty! I chatter and chatter, but it must come out, what's<br>
                sticking in my throat, to the disadvantage of my own family. But 
                I<br>
                must now be the woman that will save a good many people. It is 
                not<br>
                done with my good will, or for the sake of a medal. I do the most<br>
                insane things I possibly can, and then I tell a poet about it, 
                and<br>
                thus the whole town gets to know of it directly.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The town will not take that to heart,&quot; observed the 
                man; &quot;that<br>
                will not disturb a single person; for they will all think I'm 
                only<br>
                telling them a story if I say, 'The Will-o'-the-Wisp is in the 
                town,<br>
                says the Moor-woman. Take care of yourselves!'&quot;</p>

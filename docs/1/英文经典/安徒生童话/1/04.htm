              <p class="h" align="center"> A ROSE FROM HOMER'S GRAVE</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> ALL the songs of the east speak of the love of the nightingale 
                for the rose in the silent starlight night. The winged songster 
                serenades the fragrant flowers.<br>
                <br>
                Not far from Smyrna, where the merchant drives his loaded<br>
                camels, proudly arching their long necks as they journey beneath 
                the<br>
                lofty pines over holy ground, I saw a hedge of roses. The<br>
                turtle-dove flew among the branches of the tall trees, and as 
                the<br>
                sunbeams fell upon her wings, they glistened as if they were<br>
                mother-of-pearl. On the rose-bush grew a flower, more beautiful 
                than<br>
                them all, and to her the nightingale sung of his woes; but the 
                rose<br>
                remained silent, not even a dewdrop lay like a tear of sympathy 
                on her<br>
                leaves. At last she bowed her head over a heap of stones, and 
                said,<br>
                &quot;Here rests the greatest singer in the world; over his tomb 
                will I<br>
                spread my fragrance, and on it I will let my leaves fall when 
                the<br>
                storm scatters them. He who sung of Troy became earth, and from 
                that earth I have sprung. I, a rose from the grave of Homer, am 
                too lofty to bloom for a nightingale.&quot; Then the nightingale 
                sung himself to<br>
                death. A camel-driver came by, with his loaded camels and his 
                black<br>
                slaves; his little son found the dead bird, and buried the lovely<br>
                songster in the grave of the great Homer, while the rose trembled 
                in<br>
                the wind.<br>
                <br>
                The evening came, and the rose wrapped her leaves more closely<br>
                round her, and dreamed: and this was her dream.<br>
                <br>
                It was a fair sunshiny day; a crowd of strangers drew near who 
                had<br>
                undertaken a pilgrimage to the grave of Homer. Among the strangers 
                was a minstrel from the north, the home of the clouds and the 
                brilliant<br>
                lights of the aurora borealis. He plucked the rose and placed 
                it in<br>
                a book, and carried it away into a distant part of the world, 
                his<br>
                fatherland. The rose faded with grief, and lay between the leaves 
                of<br>
                the book, which he opened in his own home, saying, &quot;Here 
                is a rose<br>
                from the grave of Homer.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                Then the flower awoke from her dream, and trembled in the wind.<br>
                A drop of dew fell from the leaves upon the singer's grave. The 
                sun<br>
                rose, and the flower bloomed more beautiful than ever. The day 
                was<br>
                hot, and she was still in her own warm Asia. Then footsteps<br>
                approached, strangers, such as the rose had seen in her dream, 
                came<br>
                by, and among them was a poet from the north; he plucked the rose,<br>
                pressed a kiss upon her fresh mouth, and carried her away to the<br>
                home of the clouds and the northern lights. Like a mummy, the 
                flower<br>
                now rests in his &quot;Iliad,&quot; and, as in her dream, she 
                hears him say,<br>
                as he opens the book, &quot;Here is a rose from the grave of Homer.&quot;</p>

              <p class="h" align="center"> THE FLAX</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THE flax was in full bloom; it had pretty little blue flowers 
                as<br>
                delicate as the wings of a moth, or even more so. The sun shone, 
                and<br>
                the showers watered it; and this was just as good for the flax 
                as it<br>
                is for little children to be washed and then kissed by their mother.<br>
                They look much prettier for it, and so did the flax.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;People say that I look exceedingly well,&quot; said the 
                flax, &quot;and<br>
                that I am so fine and long that I shall make a beautiful piece 
                of<br>
                linen. How fortunate I am; it makes me so happy, it is such a 
                pleasant<br>
                thing to know that something can be made of me. How the sunshine<br>
                cheers me, and how sweet and refreshing is the rain; my happiness<br>
                overpowers me, no one in the world can feel happier than I am.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ah, yes, no doubt,&quot; said the fern, &quot;but you do 
                not know the world<br>
                yet as well as I do, for my sticks are knotty;&quot; and then 
                it sung quite<br>
                mournfully-</p>
              <p> &quot;Snip, snap, snurre,<br>
                Basse lurre:<br>
                The song is ended.&quot;</p>
              <p> &quot;No, it is not ended,&quot; said the flax. &quot;To-morrow 
                the sun will<br>
                shine, or the rain descend. I feel that I am growing. I feel that 
                I am<br>
                in full blossom. I am the happiest of all creatures.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Well, one day some people came, who took hold of the flax, and<br>
                pulled it up by the roots; this was painful; then it was laid 
                in water<br>
                as if they intended to drown it; and, after that, placed near 
                a fire<br>
                as if it were to be roasted; all this was very shocking. &quot;We 
                cannot<br>
                expect to be happy always,&quot; said the flax; &quot;by experiencing 
                evil as<br>
                well as good, we become wise.&quot; And certainly there was plenty 
                of<br>
                evil in store for the flax. It was steeped, and roasted, and broken,<br>
                and combed; indeed, it scarcely knew what was done to it. At last 
                it<br>
                was put on the spinning wheel. &quot;Whirr, whirr,&quot; went 
                the wheel so<br>
                quickly that the flax could not collect its thoughts. &quot;Well, 
                I have<br>
                been very happy,&quot; he thought in the midst of his pain, &quot;and 
                must be<br>
                contented with the past;&quot; and contented he remained till 
                he was put on<br>
                the loom, and became a beautiful piece of white linen. All the 
                flax,<br>
                even to the last stalk, was used in making this one piece. &quot;Well, 
                this<br>
                is quite wonderful; I could not have believed that I should be 
                so<br>
                favored by fortune. The fern was not wrong with its song of</p>
              <p> 'Snip, snap, snurre,<br>
                Basse lurre.'</p>
              <p>But the song is not ended yet, I am sure; it is only just beginning.<br>
                How wonderful it is, that after all I have suffered, I am made<br>
                something of at last; I am the luckiest person in the world- so 
                strong<br>
                and fine; and how white, and what a length! This is something<br>
                different to being a mere plant and bearing flowers. Then I had 
                no<br>
                attention, nor any water unless it rained; now, I am watched and 
                taken<br>
                care of. Every morning the maid turns me over, and I have a<br>
                shower-bath from the watering-pot every evening. Yes, and the<br>
                clergyman's wife noticed me, and said I was the best piece of 
                linen in<br>
                the whole parish. I cannot be happier than I am now.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>After some time, the linen was taken into the house, placed<br>
                under the scissors, and cut and torn into pieces, and then pricked<br>
                with needles. This certainly was not pleasant; but at last it 
                was made<br>
                into twelve garments of that kind which people do not like to 
                name,<br>
                and yet everybody should wear one. &quot;See, now, then,&quot; 
                said the flax; &quot;I have become something of importance. This 
                was my destiny; it is<br>
                quite a blessing. Now I shall be of some use in the world, as 
                everyone<br>
                ought to be; it is the only way to be happy. I am now divided 
                into<br>
                twelve pieces, and yet we are all one and the same in the whole 
                dozen.<br>
                It is most extraordinary good fortune.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Years passed away, and at last the linen was so worn it could<br>
                scarcely hold together. &quot;It must end very soon,&quot; said 
                the pieces to<br>
                each other; &quot;we would gladly have held together a little 
                longer, but<br>
                it is useless to expect impossibilities.&quot; And at length they 
                fell into<br>
                rags and tatters, and thought it was all over with them, for they 
                were<br>
                torn to shreds, and steeped in water, and made into a pulp, and 
                dried,<br>
                and they knew not what besides, till all at once they found themselves<br>
                beautiful white paper. &quot;Well, now, this is a surprise; a 
                glorious<br>
                surprise too,&quot; said the paper. &quot;I am now finer than 
                ever, and I<br>
                shall be written upon, and who can tell what fine things I may 
                have<br>
                written upon me. This is wonderful luck!&quot; And sure enough 
                the most<br>
                beautiful stories and poetry were written upon it, and only once 
                was<br>
                there a blot, which was very fortunate. Then people heard the<br>
                stories and poetry read, and it made them wiser and better; for 
                all<br>
                that was written had a good and sensible meaning, and a great 
                blessing was contained in the words on this paper.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I never imagined anything like this,&quot; said the paper, 
                &quot;when I was<br>
                only a little blue flower, growing in the fields. How could I 
                fancy<br>
                that I should ever be the means of bringing knowledge and joy 
                to<br>
                man? I cannot understand it myself, and yet it is really so. Heaven<br>
                knows that I have done nothing myself, but what I was obliged 
                to do<br>
                with my weak powers for my own preservation; and yet I have been<br>
                promoted from one joy and honor to another. Each time I think 
                that the song is ended; and then something higher and better begins 
                for me. I suppose now I shall be sent on my travels about the 
                world, so that people may read me. It cannot be otherwise; indeed, 
                it is more than probable; for I have more splendid thoughts written 
                upon me, than I had pretty flowers in olden times. I am happier 
                than ever.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the paper did not go on its travels; it was sent to the<br>
                printer, and all the words written upon it were set up in type, 
                to<br>
                make a book, or rather, many hundreds of books; for so many more<br>
                persons could derive pleasure and profit from a printed book, 
                than<br>
                from the written paper; and if the paper had been sent around 
                the<br>
                world, it would have been worn out before it had got half through<br>
                its journey.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;This is certainly the wisest plan,&quot; said the written 
                paper; &quot;I<br>
                really did not think of that. I shall remain at home, and be held 
                in<br>
                honor, like some old grandfather, as I really am to all these 
                new<br>
                books. They will do some good. I could not have wandered about 
                as they do. Yet he who wrote all this has looked at me, as every 
                word flowed from his pen upon my surface. I am the most honored 
                of all.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the paper was tied in a bundle with other papers, and<br>
                thrown into a tub that stood in the washhouse.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;After work, it is well to rest,&quot; said the paper, &quot;and 
                a very good<br>
                opportunity to collect one's thoughts. Now I am able, for the 
                first<br>
                time, to think of my real condition; and to know one's self is 
                true<br>
                progress. What will be done with me now, I wonder? No doubt I 
                shall still go forward. I have always progressed hitherto, as 
                I know quite well.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Now it happened one day that all the paper in the tub was taken<br>
                out, and laid on the hearth to be burnt. People said it could 
                not be<br>
                sold at the shop, to wrap up butter and sugar, because it had 
                been<br>
                written upon. The children in the house stood round the stove; 
                for<br>
                they wanted to see the paper burn, because it flamed up so prettily,<br>
                and afterwards, among the ashes, so many red sparks could be seen<br>
                running one after the other, here and there, as quick as the wind.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They called it seeing the children come out of school, and the 
                last<br>
                spark was the schoolmaster. They often thought the last spark 
                had<br>
                come; and one would cry, &quot;There goes the schoolmaster;&quot; 
                but the next moment another spark would appear, shining so beautifully. 
                How they would like to know where the sparks all went to! Perhaps 
                we shall find out some day, but we don't know now.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The whole bundle of paper had been placed on the fire, and was<br>
                soon alight. &quot;Ugh,&quot; cried the paper, as it burst into 
                a bright<br>
                flame; &quot;ugh.&quot; It was certainly not very pleasant to 
                be burning; but<br>
                when the whole was wrapped in flames, the flames mounted up into 
                the air, higher than the flax had ever been able to raise its 
                little<br>
                blue flower, and they glistened as the white linen never could 
                have<br>
                glistened. All the written letters became quite red in a moment, 
                and<br>
                all the words and thoughts turned to fire.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now I am mounting straight up to the sun,&quot; said a 
                voice in the<br>
                flames; and it was as if a thousand voices echoed the words; and 
                the<br>
                flames darted up through the chimney, and went out at the top. 
                Then<br>
                a number of tiny beings, as many in number as the flowers on the<br>
                flax had been, and invisible to mortal eyes, floated above them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They were even lighter and more delicate than the flowers from 
                which<br>
                they were born; and as the flames were extinguished, and nothing<br>
                remained of the paper but black ashes, these little beings danced 
                upon<br>
                it; and whenever they touched it, bright red sparks appeared.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The children are all out of school, and the schoolmaster 
                was<br>
                the last of all,&quot; said the children. It was good fun, and 
                they sang<br>
                over the dead ashes,-</p>
              <p> &quot;Snip, snap, snurre,<br>
                Basse lure:<br>
                The song is ended.&quot;</p>
              <p> But the little invisible beings said, &quot;The song is never

              <p class="h" align="center"> LITTLE IDA'S FLOWERS</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> &quot;My poor flowers are quite dead,&quot; said little Ida, 
                &quot;they were so<br>
                pretty yesterday evening, and now all the leaves are hanging down<br>
                quite withered. What do they do that for,&quot; she asked, of 
                the student<br>
                who sat on the sofa; she liked him very much, he could tell the 
                most<br>
                amusing stories, and cut out the prettiest pictures; hearts, and<br>
                ladies dancing, castles with doors that opened, as well as flowers; 
                he<br>
                was a delightful student. &quot;Why do the flowers look so faded 
                to-day?&quot;<br>
                she asked again, and pointed to her nosegay, which was quite withered.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Don't you know what is the matter with them?&quot; said 
                the student.<br>
                &quot;The flowers were at a ball last night, and therefore, it 
                is no wonder<br>
                they hang their heads.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But flowers cannot dance?&quot; cried little Ida.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes indeed, they can,&quot; replied the student. &quot;When 
                it grows<br>
                dark, and everybody is asleep, they jump about quite merrily. 
                They<br>
                have a ball almost every night.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Can children go to these balls?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the student, &quot;little daisies and lilies 
                of the valley.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Where do the beautiful flowers dance?&quot; asked little 
                Ida.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Have you not often seen the large castle outside the gates 
                of the<br>
                town, where the king lives in summer, and where the beautiful 
                garden<br>
                is full of flowers? And have you not fed the swans with bread 
                when<br>
                they swam towards you? Well, the flowers have capital balls there,<br>
                believe me.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I was in the garden out there yesterday with my mother,&quot; 
                said<br>
                Ida, &quot;but all the leaves were off the trees, and there was 
                not a<br>
                single flower left. Where are they? I used to see so many in the<br>
                summer.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;They are in the castle,&quot; replied the student. &quot;You 
                must know that<br>
                as soon as the king and all the court are gone into the town, 
                the<br>
                flowers run out of the garden into the castle, and you should 
                see<br>
                how merry they are. The two most beautiful roses seat themselves 
                on<br>
                the throne, and are called the king and queen, then all the red<br>
                cockscombs range themselves on each side, and bow, these are the<br>
                lords-in-waiting. After that the pretty flowers come in, and there<br>
                is a grand ball. The blue violets represent little naval cadets, 
                and<br>
                dance with hyacinths and crocuses which they call young ladies. 
                The<br>
                tulips and tiger-lilies are the old ladies who sit and watch the<br>
                dancing, so that everything may be conducted with order and<br>
                propriety.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But,&quot; said little Ida, &quot;is there no one there 
                to hurt the flowers<br>
                for dancing in the king's castle?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No one knows anything about it,&quot; said the student. 
                &quot;The old<br>
                steward of the castle, who has to watch there at night, sometimes<br>
                comes in; but he carries a great bunch of keys, and as soon as 
                the<br>
                flowers hear the keys rattle, they run and hide themselves behind<br>
                the long curtains, and stand quite still, just peeping their heads<br>
                out. Then the old steward says, 'I smell flowers here,' but he<br>
                cannot see them.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh how capital,&quot; said little Ida, clapping her hands. 
                &quot;Should I<br>
                be able to see these flowers?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the student, &quot;mind you think of it 
                the next time you<br>
                go out, no doubt you will see them, if you peep through the window.<br>
                I did so to-day, and I saw a long yellow lily lying stretched 
                out on<br>
                the sofa. She was a court lady.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Can the flowers from the Botanical Gardens go to these 
                balls?&quot;<br>
                asked Ida. &quot;It is such a distance!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh yes,&quot; said the student 'whenever they like, for 
                they can<br>
                fly. Have you not seen those beautiful red, white. and yellow<br>
                butterflies, that look like flowers? They were flowers once. They 
                have<br>
                flown off their stalks into the air, and flap their leaves as 
                if<br>
                they were little wings to make them fly. Then, if they behave 
                well,<br>
                they obtain permission to fly about during the day, instead of 
                being<br>
                obliged to sit still on their stems at home, and so in time their<br>
                leaves become real wings. It may be, however, that the flowers 
                in<br>
                the Botanical Gardens have never been to the king's palace, and,<br>
                therefore, they know nothing of the merry doings at night, which<br>
                take place there. I will tell you what to do, and the botanical<br>
                professor, who lives close by here, will be so surprised. You 
                know him very well, do you not? Well, next time you go into his 
                garden, you must tell one of the flowers that there is going to 
                be a grand ball at the castle, then that flower will tell all 
                the others, and they will<br>
                fly away to the castle as soon as possible. And when the professor<br>
                walks into his garden, there will not be a single flower left. 
                How<br>
                he will wonder what has become of them!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But how can one flower tell another? Flowers cannot speak?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No, certainly not,&quot; replied the student; &quot;but 
                they can make<br>
                signs. Have you not often seen that when the wind blows they nod 
                at<br>
                one another, and rustle all their green leaves?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Can the professor understand the signs?&quot; asked Ida.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, to be sure he can. He went one morning into his garden,<br>
                and saw a stinging nettle making signs with its leaves to a<br>
                beautiful red carnation. It was saying, 'You are so pretty, I 
                like you<br>
                very much.' But the professor did not approve of such nonsense, 
                so<br>
                he clapped his hands on the nettle to stop it. Then the leaves,<br>
                which are its fingers, stung him so sharply that he has never 
                ventured<br>
                to touch a nettle since.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh how funny!&quot; said Ida, and she laughed.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;How can anyone put such notions into a child's head?&quot; 
                said a<br>
                tiresome lawyer, who had come to pay a visit, and sat on the sofa.<br>
                He did not like the student, and would grumble when he saw him 
                cutting out droll or amusing pictures. Sometimes it would be a 
                man hanging on a gibbet and holding a heart in his hand as if 
                he had been stealing hearts. Sometimes it was an old witch riding 
                through the air on a broom and carrying her husband on her nose. 
                But the lawyer did not like such jokes, and he would say as he 
                had just said, &quot;How can anyone put such nonsense into a child's 
                head! what absurd fancies there are!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But to little Ida, all these stories which the student told her<br>
                about the flowers, seemed very droll, and she thought over them 
                a<br>
                great deal. The flowers did hang their heads, because they had 
                been<br>
                dancing all night, and were very tired, and most likely they were 
                ill.<br>
                Then she took them into the room where a number of toys lay on 
                a<br>
                pretty little table, and the whole of the table drawer besides 
                was<br>
                full of beautiful things. Her doll Sophy lay in the doll's bed 
                asleep,<br>
                and little Ida said to her, &quot;You must really get up Sophy, 
                and be<br>
                content to lie in the drawer to-night; the poor flowers are ill, 
                and<br>
                they must lie in your bed, then perhaps they will get well again.&quot;<br>
                So she took the doll out, who looked quite cross, and said not 
                a<br>
                single word, for she was angry at being turned out of her bed. 
                Ida<br>
                placed the flowers in the doll's bed, and drew the quilt over 
                them.<br>
                Then she told them to lie quite still and be good, while she made 
                some tea for them, so that they might be quite well and able to 
                get up<br>
                the next morning. And she drew the curtains close round the little<br>
                bed, so that the sun might not shine in their eyes. During the 
                whole<br>
                evening she could not help thinking of what the student had told<br>
                her. And before she went to bed herself, she was obliged to peep<br>
                behind the curtains into the garden where all her mother's beautiful<br>
                flowers grew, hyacinths and tulips, and many others. Then she<br>
                whispered to them quite softly, &quot;I know you are going to 
                a ball<br>
                to-night.&quot; But the flowers appeared as if they did not understand, 
                and<br>
                not a leaf moved; still Ida felt quite sure she knew all about 
                it. She<br>
                lay awake a long time after she was in bed, thinking how pretty 
                it<br>
                must be to see all the beautiful flowers dancing in the king's 
                garden.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I wonder if my flowers have really been there,&quot; she 
                said to<br>
                herself, and then she fell asleep. In the night she awoke; she 
                had<br>
                been dreaming of the flowers and of the student, as well as of 
                the<br>
                tiresome lawyer who found fault with him. It was quite still in<br>
                Ida's bedroom; the night-lamp burnt on the table, and her father 
                and<br>
                mother were asleep. &quot;I wonder if my flowers are still lying 
                in Sophy's<br>
                bed,&quot; she thought to herself; &quot;how much I should like 
                to know.&quot; She<br>
                raised herself a little, and glanced at the door of the room where 
                all<br>
                her flowers and playthings lay; it was partly open, and as she<br>
                listened, it seemed as if some one in the room was playing the<br>
                piano, but softly and more prettily than she had ever before heard 
                it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now all the flowers are certainly dancing in there,&quot; 
                she thought, &quot;oh<br>
                how much I should like to see them,&quot; but she did not dare 
                move for<br>
                fear of disturbing her father and mother. &quot;If they would 
                only come<br>
                in here,&quot; she thought; but they did not come, and the music<br>
                continued to play so beautifully, and was so pretty, that she 
                could<br>
                resist no longer. She crept out of her little bed, went softly 
                to<br>
                the door and looked into the room. Oh what a splendid sight there<br>
                was to be sure! There was no night-lamp burning, but the room 
                appeared quite light, for the moon shone through the window upon 
                the floor, and made it almost like day. All the hyacinths and 
                tulips stood in two long rows down the room, not a single flower 
                remained in the window, and the flower-pots were all empty. The 
                flowers were dancing gracefully on the floor, making turns and 
                holding each other by their long green leaves as they swung round. 
                At the piano sat a<br>
                large yellow lily which little Ida was sure she had seen in the<br>
                summer, for she remembered the student saying she was very much 
                like Miss Lina, one of Ida's friends. They all laughed at him 
                then, but now it seemed to little Ida as if the tall, yellow flower 
                was really<br>
                like the young lady. She had just the same manners while playing,<br>
                bending her long yellow face from side to side, and nodding in 
                time to the beautiful music. Then she saw a large purple crocus 
                jump into<br>
                the middle of the table where the playthings stood, go up to the<br>
                doll's bedstead and draw back the curtains; there lay the sick<br>
                flowers, but they got up directly, and nodded to the others as 
                a<br>
                sign that they wished to dance with them. The old rough doll, 
                with the<br>
                broken mouth, stood up and bowed to the pretty flowers. They did 
                not look ill at all now, but jumped about and were very merry, 
                yet none of them noticed little Ida. Presently it seemed as if 
                something fell from the table. Ida looked that way, and saw a 
                slight carnival rod<br>
                jumping down among the flowers as if it belonged to them; it was,<br>
                however, very smooth and neat, and a little wax doll with a broad<br>
                brimmed hat on her head, like the one worn by the lawyer, sat 
                upon it.<br>
                The carnival rod hopped about among the flowers on its three red<br>
                stilted feet, and stamped quite loud when it danced the Mazurka; 
                the<br>
                flowers could not perform this dance, they were too light to stamp<br>
                in that manner. All at once the wax doll which rode on the carnival<br>
                rod seemed to grow larger and taller, and it turned round and 
                said<br>
                to the paper flowers, &quot;How can you put such things in a child's<br>
                head? they are all foolish fancies;&quot; and then the doll was 
                exactly<br>
                like the lawyer with the broad brimmed hat, and looked as yellow 
                and<br>
                as cross as he did; but the paper dolls struck him on his thin 
                legs,<br>
                and he shrunk up again and became quite a little wax doll. This 
                was<br>
                very amusing, and Ida could not help laughing. The carnival rod 
                went<br>
                on dancing, and the lawyer was obliged to dance also. It was no 
                use,<br>
                he might make himself great and tall, or remain a little wax doll 
                with<br>
                a large black hat; still he must dance. Then at last the other 
                flowers<br>
                interceded for him, especially those who had lain in the doll's 
                bed,<br>
                and the carnival rod gave up his dancing. At the same moment a 
                loud<br>
                knocking was heard in the drawer, where Ida's doll Sophy lay with 
                many other toys. Then the rough doll ran to the end of the table, 
                laid<br>
                himself flat down upon it, and began to pull the drawer out a 
                little<br>
                way.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then Sophy raised himself, and looked round quite astonished,<br>
                &quot;There must be a ball here to-night,&quot; said Sophy. &quot;Why 
                did not<br>
                somebody tell me?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Will you dance with me?&quot; said the rough doll.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You are the right sort to dance with, certainly,&quot; 
                said she,<br>
                turning her back upon him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then she seated herself on the edge of the drawer, and thought<br>
                that perhaps one of the flowers would ask her to dance; but none 
                of<br>
                them came. Then she coughed, &quot;Hem, hem, a-hem;&quot; but 
                for all that not one came. The shabby doll now danced quite alone, 
                and not very<br>
                badly, after all. As none of the flowers seemed to notice Sophy, 
                she<br>
                let herself down from the drawer to the floor, so as to make a 
                very<br>
                great noise. All the flowers came round her directly, and asked 
                if she<br>
                had hurt herself, especially those who had lain in her bed. But 
                she<br>
                was not hurt at all, and Ida's flowers thanked her for the use 
                of<br>
                the nice bed, and were very kind to her. They led her into the<br>
                middle of the room, where the moon shone, and danced with her, 
                while all the other flowers formed a circle round them. Then Sophy 
                was very happy, and said they might keep her bed; she did not 
                mind lying in the drawer at all. But the flowers thanked her very 
                much, and<br>
                said,-<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We cannot live long. To-morrow morning we shall be quite 
                dead;<br>
                and you must tell little Ida to bury us in the garden, near to 
                the<br>
                grave of the canary; then, in the summer we shall wake up and 
                be<br>
                more beautiful than ever.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No, you must not die,&quot; said Sophy, as she kissed the 
                flowers.<br>
                Then the door of the room opened, and a number of beautiful<br>
                flowers danced in. Ida could not imagine where they could come 
                from, unless they were the flowers from the king's garden. First 
                came two lovely roses, with little golden crowns on their heads; 
                these were the king and queen. Beautiful stocks and carnations 
                followed, bowing to every one present. They had also music with 
                them. Large poppies and peonies had pea-shells for instruments, 
                and blew into them till they were quite red in the face. The bunches 
                of blue hyacinths and the<br>
                little white snowdrops jingled their bell-like flowers, as if 
                they<br>
                were real bells. Then came many more flowers: blue violets, purple<br>
                heart's-ease, daisies, and lilies of the valley, and they all 
                danced<br>
                together, and kissed each other. It was very beautiful to behold.<br>
              </p>
              <p>At last the flowers wished each other good-night. Then little<br>
                Ida crept back into her bed again, and dreamt of all she had seen.<br>
                When she arose the next morning, she went quickly to the little 
                table,<br>
                to see if the flowers were still there. She drew aside the curtains 
                of<br>
                the little bed. There they all lay, but quite faded; much more 
                so than<br>
                the day before. Sophy was lying in the drawer where Ida had placed<br>
                her; but she looked very sleepy.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Do you remember what the flowers told you to say to me?&quot; 
                said<br>
                little Ida. But Sophy looked quite stupid, and said not a single 
                word.<br>
                &quot;You are not kind at all,&quot; said Ida; &quot;and yet they 
                all danced with<br>
                you.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then she took a little paper box, on which were painted<br>
                beautiful birds, and laid the dead flowers in it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;This shall be your pretty coffin,&quot; she said; &quot;and 
                by and by, when<br>
                my cousins come to visit me, they shall help me to bury you out 
                in the garden; so that next summer you may grow up again more 
                beautiful than ever.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Her cousins were two good-tempered boys, whose names were James 
                and Adolphus. Their father had given them each a bow and arrow, 
                and they had brought them to show Ida. She told them about the 
                poor flowers which were dead; and as soon as they obtained permission, 
                they went with her to bury them. The two boys walked first, with 
                their crossbows on their shoulders, and little Ida followed, carrying 
                the pretty box containing the dead flowers. They dug a little 
                grave in the garden. Ida kissed her flowers and then laid them, 
                with the box, in the earth. James and Adolphus then fired their 
                crossbows over the grave, as they had neither guns nor cannons.</p>

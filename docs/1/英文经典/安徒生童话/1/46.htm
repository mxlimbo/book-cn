              <p class="h" align="center"> THE DRYAD</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> WE are travelling to Paris to the Exhibition.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Now we are there. That was a journey, a flight without magic. 
                We<br>
                flew on the wings of steam over the sea and across the land.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Yes, our time is the time of fairy tales.<br>
              </p>
              <p>We are in the midst of Paris, in a great hotel. Blooming flowers<br>
                ornament the staircases, and soft carpets the floors.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Our room is a very cosy one, and through the open balcony door<br>
                we have a view of a great square. Spring lives down there; it 
                has come to Paris, and arrived at the same time with us. It has 
                come in the<br>
                shape of a glorious young chestnut tree, with delicate leaves 
                newly<br>
                opened. How the tree gleams, dressed in its spring garb, before 
                all<br>
                the other trees in the place! One of these latter had been struck<br>
                out of the list of living trees. It lies on the ground with roots<br>
                exposed. On the place where it stood, the young chestnut tree 
                is to be<br>
                planted, and to flourish.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It still stands towering aloft on the heavy wagon which has<br>
                brought it this morning a distance of several miles to Paris. 
                For<br>
                years it had stood there, in the protection of a mighty oak tree,<br>
                under which the old venerable clergyman had often sat, with children<br>
                listening to his stories.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The young chestnut tree had also listened to the stories; for<br>
                the Dryad who lived in it was a child also. She remembered the 
                time<br>
                when the tree was so little that it only projected a short way 
                above<br>
                the grass and ferns around. These were as tall as they would ever<br>
                be; but the tree grew every year, and enjoyed the air and the<br>
                sunshine, and drank the dew and the rain. Several times it was 
                also,<br>
                as it must be, well shaken by the wind and the rain; for that 
                is a<br>
                part of education.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Dryad rejoiced in her life, and rejoiced in the sunshine,<br>
                and the singing of the birds; but she was most rejoiced at human<br>
                voices; she understood the language of men as well as she understood 
                that of animals.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Butterflies, cockchafers, dragon-flies, everything that could<br>
                fly came to pay a visit. They could all talk. They told of the<br>
                village, of the vineyard, of the forest, of the old castle with 
                its<br>
                parks and canals and ponds. Down in the water dwelt also living<br>
                beings, which, in their way, could fly under the water from one<br>
                place to another- beings with knowledge and delineation. They 
                said<br>
                nothing at all; they were so clever!<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the swallow, who had dived, told about the pretty little<br>
                goldfish, of the thick turbot, the fat brill, and the old carp. 
                The<br>
                swallow could describe all that very well, but, &quot;Self is 
                the man,&quot; she<br>
                said. &quot;One ought to see these things one's self.&quot; But 
                how was the<br>
                Dryad ever to see such beings? She was obliged to be satisfied 
                with<br>
                being able to look over the beautiful country and see the busy<br>
                industry of men.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was glorious; but most glorious of all when the old clergyman<br>
                sat under the oak tree and talked of France, and of the great 
                deeds of<br>
                her sons and daughters, whose names will be mentioned with<br>
                admiration through all time.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the Dryad heard of the shepherd girl, Joan of Arc, and of<br>
                Charlotte Corday; she heard about Henry the Fourth, and Napoleon 
                the First; she heard names whose echo sounds in the hearts of 
                the people.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The village children listened attentively, and the Dryad no less<br>
                attentively; she became a school-child with the rest. In the clouds<br>
                that went sailing by she saw, picture by picture, everything that<br>
                she heard talked about. The cloudy sky was her picture-book.<br>
                She felt so happy in beautiful France, the fruitful land of<br>
                genius, with the crater of freedom. But in her heart the sting<br>
                remained that the bird, that every animal that could fly, was 
                much<br>
                better off than she. Even the fly could look about more in the<br>
                world, far beyond the Dryad's horizon.<br>
              </p>
              <p>France was so great and so glorious, but she could only look<br>
                across a little piece of it. The land stretched out, world-wide,<br>
                with vineyards, forests and great cities. Of all these Paris was 
                the<br>
                most splendid and the mightiest. The birds could get there; but 
                she,<br>
                never!<br>
              </p>
              <p>Among the village children was a little ragged, poor girl, but 
                a<br>
                pretty one to look at. She was always laughing or singing and<br>
                twining red flowers in her black hair.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Don't go to Paris!&quot; the old clergyman warned her. 
                &quot;Poor child! if<br>
                you go there, it will be your ruin.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But she went for all that.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Dryad often thought of her; for she had the same wish, and<br>
                felt the same longing for the great city.</p>
              <p> The Dryad's tree was bearing its first chestnut blossoms; the<br>
                birds were twittering round them in the most beautiful sunshine.<br>
                Then a stately carriage came rolling along that way, and in it 
                sat a<br>
                grand lady driving the spirited, light-footed horses. On the back 
                seat<br>
                a little smart groom balanced himself. The Dryad knew the lady, 
                and<br>
                the old clergyman knew her also. He shook his head gravely when 
                he saw her, and said:<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;So you went there after all, and it was your ruin, poor 
                Mary!&quot;<br>
                &quot;That one poor?&quot; thought the Dryad. &quot;No; she wears 
                a dress fit for<br>
                a countess&quot; (she had become one in the city of magic changes). 
                &quot;Oh, if I were only there, amid all the splendor and pomp! 
                They shine up<br>
                into the very clouds at night; when I look up, I can tell in what<br>
                direction the town lies.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Towards that direction the Dryad looked every evening. She saw<br>
                in the dark night the gleaming cloud on the horizon; in the clear<br>
                moonlight nights she missed the sailing clouds, which showed her<br>
                pictures of the city and pictures from history.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The child grasps at the picture-books, the Dryad grasped at the<br>
                cloud-world, her thought-book. A sudden, cloudless sky was for 
                her a blank leaf; and for several days she had only had such leaves 
                before<br>
                her.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was in the warm summer-time: not a breeze moved through the<br>
                glowing hot days. Every leaf, every flower, lay as if it were<br>
                torpid, and the people seemed torpid, too.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the clouds arose and covered the region round about where 
                the<br>
                gleaming mist announced &quot;Here lies Paris.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The clouds piled themselves up like a chain of mountains,<br>
                hurried on through the air, and spread themselves abroad over 
                the<br>
                whole landscape, as far as the Dryad's eye could reach.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Like enormous blue-black blocks of rock, the clouds lay piled 
                over<br>
                one another. Gleams of lightning shot forth from them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;These also are the servants of the Lord God,&quot; the 
                old clergyman<br>
                had said. And there came a bluish dazzling flash of lightning, 
                a<br>
                lighting up as if of the sun itself, which could burst blocks 
                of<br>
                rock asunder. The lightning struck and split to the roots the 
                old<br>
                venerable oak. The crown fell asunder. It seemed as if the tree 
                were<br>
                stretching forth its arms to clasp the messengers of the light.<br>
              </p>
              <p>No bronze cannon can sound over the land at the birth of a royal<br>
                child as the thunder sounded at the death of the old oak. The 
                rain<br>
                streamed down; a refreshing wind was blowing; the storm had gone 
                by, and there was quite a holiday glow on all things. The old 
                clergyman spoke a few words for honorable remembrance, and a painter 
                made a drawing, as a lasting record of the tree.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Everything passes away,&quot; said the Dryad, &quot;passes 
                away like a<br>
                cloud, and never comes back!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The old clergyman, too, did not come back. The green roof of 
                his<br>
                school was gone, and his teaching-chair had vanished. The children 
                did not come; but autumn came, and winter came, and then spring 
                also. In all this change of seasons the Dryad looked toward the 
                region where, at night, Paris gleamed with its bright mist far 
                on the horizon.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Forth from the town rushed engine after engine, train after train,<br>
                whistling and screaming at all hours in the day. In the evening,<br>
                towards midnight, at daybreak, and all the day through, came the<br>
                trains. Out of each one, and into each one, streamed people from 
                the<br>
                country of every king. A new wonder of the world had summoned 
                them to Paris.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In what form did this wonder exhibit itself?<br>
                &quot;A splendid blossom of art and industry,&quot; said one, 
                &quot;has<br>
                unfolded itself in the Champ de Mars, a gigantic sunflower, from 
                whose petals one can learn geography and statistics, and can become 
                as wise as a lord mayor, and raise one's self to the level of 
                art and<br>
                poetry, and study the greatness and power of the various lands.&quot;<br>
                &quot;A fairy tale flower,&quot; said another, &quot;a many-colored 
                lotus-plant, which spreads out its green leaves like a velvet 
                carpet over the sand. The opening spring has brought it forth, 
                the summer will see it in all its splendor, the autumn winds will 
                sweep it away, so that not a leaf, not a fragment of its root 
                shall remain.&quot;</p>
              <p> In front of the Military School extends in time of peace the 
                arena<br>
                of war- a field without a blade of grass, a piece of sandy steppe,<br>
                as if cut out of the Desert of Africa, where Fata Morgana displays 
                her<br>
                wondrous airy castles and hanging gardens. In the Champ de Mars,<br>
                however, these were to be seen more splendid, more wonderful than 
                in the East, for human art had converted the airy deceptive scenes 
                into reality.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The Aladdin's Palace of the present has been built,&quot; 
                it was said.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Day by day, hour by hour, it unfolds more of its wonderful 
                splendor.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The endless halls shine in marble and many colors. &quot;Master<br>
                Bloodless&quot; here moves his limbs of steel and iron in the 
                great<br>
                circular hall of machinery. Works of art in metal, in stone, in<br>
                Gobelins tapestry, announce the vitality of mind that is stirring 
                in<br>
                every land. Halls of paintings, splendor of flowers, everything 
                that<br>
                mind and skill can create in the workshop of the artisan, has 
                been<br>
                placed here for show. Even the memorials of ancient days, out 
                of old<br>
                graves and turf-moors, have appeared at this general meeting.<br>
                The overpowering great variegated whole must be divided into small<br>
                portions, and pressed together like a plaything, if it is to be<br>
                understood and described.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Like a great table on Christmas Eve, the Champ de Mars carried 
                a<br>
                wonder-castle of industry and art, and around this knickknacks 
                from<br>
                all countries had been ranged, knickknacks on a grand scale, for 
                every nation found some remembrance of home.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Here stood the royal palace of Egypt, there the caravanserai 
                of<br>
                the desert land. The Bedouin had quitted his sunny country, and<br>
                hastened by on his camel. Here stood the Russian stables, with 
                the<br>
                fiery glorious horses of the steppe. Here stood the simple<br>
                straw-thatched dwelling of the Danish peasant, with the Dannebrog<br>
                flag, next to Gustavus Vasa's wooden house from Dalarne, with 
                its<br>
                wonderful carvings. American huts, English cottages, French pavilions, 
                kiosks, theatres, churches, all strewn around, and between them 
                the fresh green turf, the clear springing water, blooming bushes, 
                rare trees, hothouses, in which one might fancy one's self transported 
                into the tropical forest; whole gardens brought from Damascus, 
                and blooming under one roof. What colors, what fragrance!<br>
              </p>
              <p>Artificial grottoes surrounded bodies of fresh or salt water,<br>
                and gave a glimpse into the empire of the fishes; the visitor 
                seemed<br>
                to wander at the bottom of the sea, among fishes and polypi.<br>
                &quot;All this,&quot; they said, &quot;the Champ de Mars offers;&quot; 
                and around<br>
                the great richly-spread table the crowd of human beings moves 
                like a<br>
                busy swarm of ants, on foot or in little carriages, for not all 
                feet<br>
                are equal to such a fatiguing journey.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Hither they swarm from morning till late in the evening. Steamer<br>
                after steamer, crowded with people, glides down the Seine. The<br>
                number of carriages is continually on the increase. The swarm 
                of<br>
                people on foot and on horseback grows more and more dense. Carriages 
                and omnibuses are crowded, stuffed and embroidered with people. 
                All these tributary streams flow in one direction- towards the 
                Exhibition.<br>
              </p>
              <p>On every entrance the flag of France is displayed; around the<br>
                world's bazaar wave the flags of all nations. There is a humming 
                and a<br>
                murmuring from the hall of the machines; from the towers the melody 
                of the chimes is heard; with the tones of the organs in the churches<br>
                mingle the hoarse nasal songs from the cafes of the East. It is 
                a<br>
                kingdom of Babel, a wonder of the world!<br>
              </p>
              <p>In very truth it was. That's what all the reports said, and who<br>
                did not hear them? The Dryad knew everything that is told here 
                of<br>
                the new wonder in the city of cities.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Fly away, ye birds! fly away to see, and then come back 
                and<br>
                tell me,&quot; said the Dryad.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The wish became an intense desire- became the one thought of 
                a<br>
                life. Then, in the quiet silent night, while the full moon was<br>
                shining, the Dryad saw a spark fly out of the moon's disc, and 
                fall<br>
                like a shooting star. And before the tree, whose leaves waved 
                to and<br>
                fro as if they were stirred by a tempest, stood a noble, mighty, 
                and<br>
                grand figure. In tones that were at once rich and strong, like 
                the<br>
                trumpet of the Last Judgment bidding farewell to life and summoning 
                to the great account, it said:<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Thou shalt go to the city of magic; thou shalt take root 
                there,<br>
                and enjoy the mighty rushing breezes, the air and the sunshine<br>
                there. But the time of thy life shall then be shortened; the line 
                of<br>
                years that awaited thee here amid the free nature shall shrink 
                to<br>
                but a small tale. Poor Dryad! It shall be thy destruction. Thy<br>
                yearning and longing will increase, thy desire will grow more<br>
                stormy, the tree itself will be as a prison to thee, thou wilt 
                quit<br>
                thy cell and give up thy nature to fly out and mingle among men.<br>
                Then the years that would have belonged to thee will be contracted<br>
                to half the span of the ephemeral fly, that lives but a day: one<br>
                night, and thy life-taper shall be blown out- the leaves of the 
                tree<br>
                will wither and be blown away, to become green never again!&quot;<br>
                Thus the words sounded. And the light vanished away, but not the<br>
                longing of the Dryad. She trembled in the wild fever of expectation.<br>
                &quot;I shall go there!&quot; she cried, rejoicingly. &quot;Life 
                is beginning and<br>
                swells like a cloud; nobody knows whither it is hastening.&quot;<br>
                When the gray dawn arose and the moon turned pale and the clouds<br>
                were tinted red, the wished-for hour struck. The words of promise 
                were fulfilled.<br>
              </p>
              <p>People appeared with spades and poles; they dug round the roots 
                of<br>
                the tree, deeper and deeper, and beneath it. A wagon was brought<br>
                out, drawn by many horses, and the tree was lifted up, with its<br>
                roots and the lumps of earth that adhered to them; matting was<br>
                placed around the roots, as though the tree had its feet in a 
                warm<br>
                bag. And now the tree was lifted on the wagon and secured with 
                chains.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The journey began- the journey to Paris. There the tree was to 
                grow as an ornament to the city of French glory.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The twigs and the leaves of the chestnut tree trembled in the<br>
                first moments of its being moved; and the Dryad trembled in the<br>
                pleasurable feeling of expectation.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Away! away!&quot; it sounded in every beat of her pulse. 
                &quot;Away!<br>
                away&quot; sounded in words that flew trembling along. The Dryad 
                forgot<br>
                to bid farewell to the regions of home; she thought not of the<br>
                waving grass and of the innocent daisies, which had looked up 
                to her<br>
                as to a great lady, a young Princess playing at being a shepherdess<br>
                out in the open air.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The chestnut tree stood upon the wagon, and nodded his branches;<br>
                whether this meant &quot;farewell&quot; or &quot;forward,&quot; 
                the Dryad knew not; she<br>
                dreamed only of the marvellous new things, that seemed yet so<br>
                familiar, and that were to unfold themselves before her. No child's<br>
                heart rejoicing in innocence- no heart whose blood danced with<br>
                passion- had set out on the journey to Paris more full of<br>
                expectation than she.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Her &quot;farewell&quot; sounded in the words &quot;Away! away!&quot;<br>
                The wheels turned; the distant approached; the present vanished.<br>
                The region was changed, even as the clouds change. New vineyards,<br>
                forests, villages, villas appeared- came nearer- vanished!<br>
              </p>
              <p>The chestnut tree moved forward, and the Dryad went with it.<br>
                Steam-engine after steam-engine rushed past, sending up into the 
                air<br>
                vapory clouds, that formed figures which told of Paris, whence 
                they<br>
                came, and whither the Dryad was going.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Everything around knew it, and must know whither she was bound. 
                It<br>
                seemed to her as if every tree she passed stretched out its leaves<br>
                towards her, with the prayer- &quot;Take me with you! take me 
                with you!&quot;<br>
                for every tree enclosed a longing Dryad.<br>
              </p>
              <p>What changes during this flight! Houses seemed to be rising out 
                of<br>
                the earth- more and more- thicker and thicker. The chimneys rose<br>
                like flower-pots ranged side by side, or in rows one above the<br>
                other, on the roofs. Great inscriptions in letters a yard long, 
                and<br>
                figures in various colors, covering the walls from cornice to<br>
                basement, came brightly out.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Where does Paris begin, and when shall I be there?&quot; 
                asked the<br>
                Dryad.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The crowd of people grew; the tumult and the bustle increased;<br>
                carriage followed upon carriage; people on foot and people on<br>
                horseback were mingled together; all around were shops on shops, 
                music and song, crying and talking.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Dryad, in her tree, was now in the midst of Paris. The great<br>
                heavy wagon all at once stopped on a little square planted with 
                trees.<br>
                The high houses around had all of them balconies to the windows,<br>
                from which the inhabitants looked down upon the young fresh chestnut 
                tree, which was coming to be planted here as a substitute for 
                the dead tree that lay stretched on the ground.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The passers-by stood still and smiled in admiration of its pure<br>
                vernal freshness. The older trees, whose buds were still closed,<br>
                whispered with their waving branches, &quot;Welcome! welcome!&quot; 
                The<br>
                fountain, throwing its jet of water high up in the air, to let 
                it fall<br>
                again in the wide stone basin, told the wind to sprinkle the new-comer<br>
                with pearly drops, as if it wished to give him a refreshing draught 
                to<br>
                welcome him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Dryad felt how her tree was being lifted from the wagon to<br>
                be placed in the spot where it was to stand. The roots were covered<br>
                with earth, and fresh turf was laid on top. Blooming shrubs and<br>
                flowers in pots were ranged around; and thus a little garden arose<br>
                in the square.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The tree that had been killed by the fumes of gas, the steam 
                of<br>
                kitchens, and the bad air of the city, was put upon the wagon 
                and<br>
                driven away. The passers-by looked on. Children and old men sat 
                upon the bench, and looked at the green tree. And we who are telling 
                this story stood upon a balcony, and looked down upon the green 
                spring sight that had been brought in from the fresh country air, 
                and said, what the old clergyman would have said, &quot;Poor Dryad!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I am happy! I am happy!&quot; the Dryad cried, rejoicing; 
                &quot;and yet I<br>
                cannot realize, cannot describe what I feel. Everything is as 
                I<br>
                fancied it, and yet as I did not fancy it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The houses stood there, so lofty, so close! The sunlight shone<br>
                on only one of the walls, and that one was stuck over with bills 
                and<br>
                placards, before which the people stood still; and this made a 
                crowd.<br>
                Carriages rushed past, carriages rolled past; light ones and heavy<br>
                ones mingled together. Omnibuses, those over-crowded moving houses, 
                came rattling by; horsemen galloped among them; even carts and 
                wagons asserted their rights.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Dryad asked herself if these high-grown houses, which stood 
                so<br>
                close around her, would not remove and take other shapes, like 
                the<br>
                clouds in the sky, and draw aside, so that she might cast a glance<br>
                into Paris, and over it. Notre Dame must show itself, the Vendome<br>
                Column, and the wondrous building which had called and was still<br>
                calling so many strangers to the city.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the houses did not stir from their places. It was yet day 
                when<br>
                the lamps were lit. The gas-jets gleamed from the shops, and shone<br>
                even into the branches of the trees, so that it was like sunlight 
                in<br>
                summer. The stars above made their appearance, the same to which 
                the Dryad had looked up in her home. She thought she felt a clear 
                pure stream of air which went forth from them. She felt herself 
                lifted up and strengthened, and felt an increased power of seeing 
                through<br>
                every leaf and through every fibre of the root. Amid all the noise 
                and<br>
                the turmoil, the colors and the lights, she knew herself watched 
                by<br>
                mild eyes.<br>
              </p>
              <p>From the side streets sounded the merry notes of fiddles and<br>
                wind instruments. Up! to the dance, to the dance! to jollity and<br>
                pleasure! that was their invitation. Such music it was, that horses,<br>
                carriages, trees, and houses would have danced, if they had known 
                how.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The charm of intoxicating delight filled the bosom of the Dryad.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;How glorious, how splendid it is!&quot; she cried, rejoicingly. 
                &quot;Now I<br>
                am in Paris!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The next day that dawned, the next night that fell, offered the<br>
                same spectacle, similar bustle, similar life; changing, indeed, 
                yet<br>
                always the same; and thus it went on through the sequence of days.<br>
                &quot;Now I know every tree, every flower on the square here! 
                I know<br>
                every house, every balcony, every shop in this narrow cut-off<br>
                corner, where I am denied the sight of this great mighty city. 
                Where<br>
                are the arches of triumph, the Boulevards, the wondrous building 
                of<br>
                the world? I see nothing of all this. As if shut up in a cage, 
                I stand<br>
                among the high houses, which I now know by heart, with their<br>
                inscriptions, signs, and placards; all the painted confectionery, 
                that<br>
                is no longer to my taste. Where are all the things of which I 
                heard,<br>
                for which I longed, and for whose sake I wanted to come hither? 
                what have I seized, found, won? I feel the same longing I felt 
                before; I<br>
                feel that there is a life I should wish to grasp and to experience.<br>
                I must go out into the ranks of living men, and mingle among them. 
                I<br>
                must fly about like a bird. I must see and feel, and become human<br>
                altogether. I must enjoy the one half-day, instead of vegetating 
                for<br>
                years in every-day sameness and weariness, in which I become ill,<br>
                and at last sink and disappear like the dew on the meadows. I 
                will<br>
                gleam like the cloud, gleam in the sunshine of life, look out 
                over the<br>
                whole like the cloud, and pass away like it, no one knoweth whither.&quot;<br>
                Thus sighed the Dryad; and she prayed:<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Take from me the years that were destined for me, and give 
                me but<br>
                half of the life of the ephemeral fly! Deliver me from my prison! 
                Give<br>
                me human life, human happiness, only a short span, only the one 
                night,if it cannot be otherwise; and then punish me for my wish 
                to live, my longing for life! Strike me out of thy list. Let my 
                shell, the<br>
                fresh young tree, wither, or be hewn down, and burnt to ashes, 
                and<br>
                scattered to all the winds!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>A rustling went through the leaves of the tree; there was a<br>
                trembling in each of the leaves; it seemed as if fire streamed 
                through<br>
                it. A gust of wind shook its green crown, and from the midst of 
                that<br>
                crown a female figure came forth. In the same moment she was sitting<br>
                beneath the brightly-illuminated leafy branches, young and beautiful<br>
                to behold, like poor Mary, to whom the clergyman had said, &quot;The<br>
                great city will be thy destruction.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Dryad sat at the foot of the tree- at her house door, which<br>
                she had locked, and whose key had thrown away. So young! so fair!<br>
                The stars saw her, and blinked at her. The gas-lamps saw her, 
                and<br>
                gleamed and beckoned to her. How delicate she was, and yet how<br>
                blooming!- a child, and yet a grown maiden! Her dress was fine 
                as<br>
                silk, green as the freshly-opened leaves on the crown of the tree;<br>
                in her nut-brown hair clung a half-opened chestnut blossom. She 
                looked like the Goddess of Spring.<br>
              </p>
              <p>For one short minute she sat motionless; then she sprang up,<br>
                and, light as a gazelle, she hurried away. She ran and sprang 
                like the<br>
                reflection from the mirror that, carried by the sunshine, is cast, 
                now<br>
                here, now there. Could any one have followed her with his eyes, 
                he<br>
                would have seen how marvellously her dress and her form changed,<br>
                according to the nature of the house or the place whose light 
                happened to shine upon her.<br>
              </p>
              <p>She reached the Boulevards. Here a sea of light streamed forth<br>
                from the gas-flames of the lamps, the shops and the cafes. Here<br>
                stood in a row young and slender trees, each of which concealed 
                its<br>
                Dryad, and gave shade from the artificial sunlight. The whole 
                vast<br>
                pavement was one great festive hall, where covered tables stood<br>
                laden with refreshments of all kinds, from champagne and Chartreuse<br>
                down to coffee and beer. Here was an exhibition of flowers, statues,<br>
                books, and colored stuffs.<br>
              </p>
              <p>From the crowd close by the lofty houses she looked forth over 
                the<br>
                terrific stream beyond the rows of trees. Yonder heaved a stream 
                of<br>
                rolling carriages, cabriolets, coaches, omnibuses, cabs, and among<br>
                them riding gentlemen and marching troops. To cross to the opposite<br>
                shore was an undertaking fraught with danger to life and limb. 
                Now<br>
                lanterns shed their radiance abroad; now the gas had the upper 
                hand;<br>
                suddenly a rocket rises! Whence? Whither?<br>
              </p>
              <p>Here are sounds of soft Italian melodies; yonder, Spanish songs<br>
                are sung, accompanied by the rattle of the castanets; but strongest 
                of<br>
                all, and predominating over the rest, the street-organ tunes of 
                the<br>
                moment, the exciting &quot;Can-Can&quot; music, which Orpheus 
                never knew, and which was never heard by the &quot;Belle Helene.&quot; 
                Even the barrow was tempted to hop upon one of its wheels.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Dryad danced, floated, flew, changing her color every<br>
                moment, like a humming-bird in the sunshine; each house, with 
                the<br>
                world belonging to it, gave her its own reflections.<br>
              </p>
              <p>As the glowing lotus-flower, torn from its stem, is carried away<br>
                by the stream, so the Dryad drifted along. Whenever she paused, 
                she<br>
                was another being, so that none was able to follow her, to recognize<br>
                her, or to look more closely at her.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Like cloud-pictures, all things flew by her. She looked into 
                a<br>
                thousand faces, but not one was familiar to her; she saw not a<br>
                single form from home. Two bright eyes had remained in her memory. 
                She thought of Mary, poor Mary, the ragged merry child, who wore 
                the red flowers in her black hair. Mary was now here, in the world-city, 
                rich and magnificent as in that day when she drove past the house 
                of the old clergyman, and past the tree of the Dryad, the old 
                oak.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Here she was certainly living, in the deafening tumult. Perhaps<br>
                she had just stepped out of one of the gorgeous carriages in<br>
                waiting. Handsome equipages, with coachmen in gold braid and footmen 
                in silken hose, drove up. The people who alighted from them were 
                all richly-dressed ladies. They went through the opened gate, 
                and ascended the broad staircase that led to a building resting 
                on marble pillars. Was this building, perhaps, the wonder of the 
                world? </p>
              <p>There Mary would certainly be found.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Sancta Maria!&quot; resounded from the interior. Incense 
                floated<br>
                through the lofty painted and gilded aisles, where a solemn twilight<br>
                reigned.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was the Church of the Madeleine.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Clad in black garments of the most costly stuffs, fashioned<br>
                according to the latest mode, the rich feminine world of Paris<br>
                glided across the shining pavement. The crests of the proprietors 
                were engraved on silver shields on the velvet-bound prayer-books, 
                and embroidered in the corners of perfumed handkerchiefs bordered 
                with Brussels lace. A few of the ladies were kneeling in silent 
                prayer<br>
                before the altars; others resorted to the confessionals.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Anxiety and fear took possession of the Dryad; she felt as if<br>
                she had entered a place where she had no right to be. Here was 
                the<br>
                abode of silence, the hall of secrets. Everything was said in<br>
                whispers, every word was a mystery.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Dryad saw herself enveloped in lace and silk, like the women<br>
                of wealth and of high birth around her. Had, perhaps, every one 
                of<br>
                them a longing in her breast, like the Dryad?<br>
              </p>
              <p>A deep, painful sigh was heard. Did it escape from some<br>
                confessional in a distant corner, or from the bosom of the Dryad?<br>
                She drew the veil closer around her; she breathed incense, and 
                not the<br>
                fresh air. Here was not the abiding-place of her longing.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Away! away- a hastening without rest. The ephemeral fly knows<br>
                not repose, for her existence is flight.<br>
              </p>
              <p>She was out again among the gas candelabra, by a magnificent<br>
                fountain.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;All its streaming waters are not able to wash out the innocent<br>
                blood that was spilt here.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Such were the words spoken. Strangers stood around, carrying 
                on<br>
                a lively conversation, such as no one would have dared to carry 
                on<br>
                in the gorgeous hall of secrets whence the Dryad came.<br>
              </p>
              <p>A heavy stone slab was turned and then lifted. She did not<br>
                understand why. She saw an opening that led into the depths below. 
              </p>
              <p>The strangers stepped down, leaving the starlit air and the cheerful<br>
                life of the upper world behind them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I am afraid,&quot; said one of the women who stood around, 
                to her<br>
                husband, &quot;I cannot venture to go down, nor do I care for 
                the wonders down yonder. You had better stay here with me.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Indeed, and travel home,&quot; said the man, &quot;and 
                quit Paris without<br>
                having seen the most wonderful thing of all- the real wonder of 
                the<br>
                present period, created by the power and resolution of one man!&quot;<br>
                &quot;I will not go down for all that,&quot; was the reply.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The wonder of the present time,&quot; it had been called. 
                The Dryad<br>
                had heard and had understood it. The goal of her ardent longing 
                had<br>
                thus been reached, and here was the entrance to it. Down into 
                the<br>
                depths below Paris? She had not thought of such a thing; but now 
                she heard it said, and saw the strangers descending, and went 
                after them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The staircase was of cast iron, spiral, broad and easy. Below<br>
                there burned a lamp, and farther down, another. They stood in 
                a<br>
                labyrinth of endless halls and arched passages, all communicating 
                with each other. All the streets and lanes of Paris were to be 
                seen here<br>
                again, as in a dim reflection. The names were painted up; and 
                every,<br>
                house above had its number down here also, and struck its roots<br>
                under the macadamized quays of a broad canal, in which the muddy 
                water flowed onward. Over it the fresh streaming water was carried 
                on arches; and quite at the top hung the tangled net of gas-pipes 
                and<br>
                telegraph-wires.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the distance lamps gleamed, like a reflection from the<br>
                world-city above. Every now and then a dull rumbling was heard. 
                This came from the heavy wagons rolling over the entrance bridges.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Whither had the Dryad come?<br>
              </p>
              <p>You have, no doubt, heard of the CATACOMBS? Now they are vanishing 
                points in that new underground world- that wonder of the present 
                day- the sewers of Paris. The Dryad was there, and not in the<br>
                world's Exhibition in the Champ de Mars.<br>
              </p>
              <p>She heard exclamations of wonder and admiration.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;From here go forth health and life for thousands upon thousands<br>
                up yonder! Our time is the time of progress, with its manifold<br>
                blessings.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Such was the opinion and the speech of men; but not of those<br>
                creatures who had been born here, and who built and dwelt here- 
                of the rats, namely, who were squeaking to one another in the 
                clefts of a<br>
                crumbling wall, quite plainly, and in a way the Dryad understood 
                well.<br>
              </p>
              <p>A big old Father-Rat, with his tail bitten off, was relieving<br>
                his feelings in loud squeaks; and his family gave their tribute 
                of<br>
                concurrence to every word he said:<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I am disgusted with this man-mewing,&quot; he cried- &quot;with 
                these<br>
                outbursts of ignorance. A fine magnificence, truly! all made up 
                of gas<br>
                and petroleum! I can't eat such stuff as that. Everything here 
                is so<br>
                fine and bright now, that one's ashamed of one's self, without 
                exactly<br>
                knowing why. Ah, if we only lived in the days of tallow candles! 
                and<br>
                it does not lie so very far behind us. That was a romantic time, 
                as<br>
                one may say.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What are you talking of there?&quot; asked the Dryad. &quot;I 
                have never<br>
                seen you before. What is it you are talking about?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Of the glorious days that are gone,&quot; said the Rat- 
                &quot;of the<br>
                happy time of our great-grandfathers and great-grandmothers. Then 
                it<br>
                was a great thing to get down here. That was a rat's nest quite<br>
                different from Paris. Mother Plague used to live here then; she 
                killed<br>
                people, but never rats. Robbers and smugglers could breathe freely<br>
                here. Here was the meeting-place of the most interesting personages,<br>
                whom one now only gets to see in the theatres where they act<br>
                melodrama, up above. The time of romance is gone even in our rat's<br>
                nest; and here also fresh air and petroleum have broken in.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Thus squeaked the Rat; he squeaked in honor of the old time,<br>
                when Mother Plague was still alive.<br>
              </p>
              <p>A carriage stopped, a kind of open omnibus, drawn by swift horses.<br>
                The company mounted and drove away along the Boulevard de<br>
                Sebastopol, that is to say, the underground boulevard, over which<br>
                the well-known crowded street of that name extended.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The carriage disappeared in the twilight; the Dryad disappeared,<br>
                lifted to the cheerful freshness above. Here, and not below in 
                the<br>
                vaulted passages, filled with heavy air, the wonder work must 
                be found which she was to seek in her short lifetime. It must 
                gleam brighter than all the gas-flames, stronger than the moon 
                that was just<br>
                gliding past.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Yes, certainly, she saw it yonder in the distance, it gleamed<br>
                before her, and twinkled and glittered like the evening star in 
                the<br>
                sky.<br>
              </p>
              <p>She saw a glittering portal open, that led to a little garden,<br>
                where all was brightness and dance music. Colored lamps surrounded<br>
                little lakes, in which were water-plants of colored metal, from<br>
                whose flowers jets of water spurted up. Beautiful weeping willows,<br>
                real products of spring, hung their fresh branches over these 
                lakes<br>
                like a fresh, green, transparent, and yet screening veil. In the<br>
                bushes burnt an open fire, throwing a red twilight over the quiet 
                huts<br>
                of branches, into which the sounds of music penetrated- an ear<br>
                tickling, intoxicating music, that sent the blood coursing through 
                the<br>
                veins.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Beautiful girls in festive attire, with pleasant smiles on their<br>
                lips, and the light spirit of youth in their hearts- &quot;Marys,&quot; 
                with<br>
                roses in their hair, but without carriage and postilion- flitted 
                to<br>
                and fro in the wild dance.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Where were the heads, where the feet? As if stung by tarantulas,<br>
                they sprang, laughed, rejoiced, as if in their ecstacies they 
                were<br>
                going to embrace all the world.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Dryad felt herself torn with them into the whirl of the dance.<br>
                Round her delicate foot clung the silken boot, chestnut brown 
                in<br>
                color, like the ribbon that floated from her hair down upon her 
                bare<br>
                shoulders. The green silk dress waved in large folds, but did 
                not<br>
                entirely hide the pretty foot and ankle.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Had she come to the enchanted Garden of Armida? What was the<br>
                name of the place?<br>
              </p>
              <p>The name glittered in gas-jets over the entrance. It was<br>
                &quot;Mabille.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The soaring upwards of rockets, the splashing of fountains, and<br>
                the popping of champagne corks accompanied the wild bacchantic<br>
                dance. Over the whole glided the moon through the air, clear, 
                but with<br>
                a somewhat crooked face.<br>
              </p>
              <p>A wild joviality seemed to rush through the Dryad, as though 
                she<br>
                were intoxicated with opium. Her eyes spoke, her lips spoke, but 
                the<br>
                sound of violins and of flutes drowned the sound of her voice. 
                Her<br>
                partner whispered words to her which she did not understand, nor 
                do we understand them. He stretched out his arms to draw her to 
                him, but he embraced only the empty air.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Dryad had been carried away, like a rose-leaf on the wind.<br>
                Before her she saw a flame in the air, a flashing light high up 
                on a<br>
                tower. The beacon light shone from the goal of her longing, shone 
                from the red lighthouse tower of the Fata Morgana of the Champ 
                de Mars.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Thither she was carried by the wind. She circled round the tower;<br>
                the workmen thought it was a butterfly that had come too early, 
                and<br>
                that now sank down dying.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The moon shone bright, gas-lamps spread light around, through<br>
                the halls, over the all-world's buildings scattered about, over 
                the<br>
                rose-hills and the rocks produced by human ingenuity, from which<br>
                waterfalls, driven by the power of &quot;Master Bloodless,&quot; 
                fell down.<br>
                The caverns of the sea, the depths of the lakes, the kingdom of 
                the<br>
                fishes were opened here. Men walked as in the depths of the deep 
                pond, and held converse with the sea, in the diving-bell of glass. 
                The water pressed against the strong glass walls above and on 
                every side. </p>
              <p>The polypi, eel-like living creatures, had fastened themselves 
                to the<br>
                bottom, and stretched out arms, fathoms long, for prey. A big 
                turbot<br>
                was making himself broad in front, quietly enough, but not without<br>
                casting some suspicious glances aside. A crab clambered over him,<br>
                looking like a gigantic spider, while the shrimps wandered about 
                in<br>
                restless haste, like the butterflies and moths of the sea.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the fresh water grew water-lilies, nymphaea, and reeds; the<br>
                gold-fishes stood up below in rank and file, all turning their 
                heads<br>
                one way, that the streaming water might flow into their mouths. 
                Fat<br>
                carps stared at the glass wall with stupid eyes. They knew that 
                they<br>
                were here to be exhibited, and that they had made the somewhat<br>
                toilsome journey hither in tubs filled with water; and they thought<br>
                with dismay of the land-sickness from which they had suffered 
                so<br>
                cruelly on the railway.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They had come to see the Exhibition, and now contemplated it<br>
                from their fresh or salt-water position. They looked attentively 
                at<br>
                the crowds of people who passed by them early and late. All the<br>
                nations in the world, they thought, had made an exhibition of 
                their<br>
                inhabitants, for the edification of the soles and haddocks, pike 
                and<br>
                carp, that they might give their opinions upon the different kinds.<br>
                &quot;Those are scaly animals&quot; said a little slimy Whiting. 
                &quot;They put<br>
                on different scales two or three times a day, and they emit sounds<br>
                which they call speaking. We don't put on scales, and we make<br>
                ourselves understood in an easier way, simply by twitching the 
                corners of our mouths and staring with our eyes. We have a great 
                many advantages over mankind.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But they have learned swimming of us,&quot; remarked a 
                well-educated<br>
                Codling. &quot;You must know I come from the great sea outside. 
                In the<br>
                hot time of the year the people yonder go into the water; first 
                they<br>
                take off their scales, and then they swim. They have learnt from 
                the<br>
                frogs to kick out with their hind legs, and row with their fore<br>
                paws. But they cannot hold out long. They want to be like us, 
                but they cannot come up to us. Poor people!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the fishes stared. They thought that the whole swarm of people<br>
                whom they had seen in the bright daylight were still moving around<br>
                them; they were certain they still saw the same forms that had 
                first<br>
                caught their attention.<br>
              </p>
              <p>A pretty Barbel, with spotted skin, and an enviably round back,<br>
                declared that the &quot;human fry&quot; were still there.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I can see a well set-up human figure quite well,&quot; 
                said the<br>
                Barbel. &quot;She was called 'contumacious lady,' or something 
                of that<br>
                kind. She had a mouth and staring eyes, like ours, and a great 
                balloon<br>
                at the back of her head, and something like a shut-up umbrella 
                in<br>
                front; there were a lot of dangling bits of seaweed hanging about 
                her.<br>
                She ought to take all the rubbish off, and go as we do; then she 
                would look something like a respectable barbel, so far as it is 
                possible for a person to look like one!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What's become of that one whom they drew away with the 
                hook? He sat on a wheel-chair, and had paper, and pen, and ink, 
                and wrote<br>
                down everything. They called him a 'writer.'&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;They're going about with him still,&quot; said a hoary 
                old maid of a<br>
                Carp, who carried her misfortune about with her, so that she was 
                quite hoarse. In her youth she had once swallowed a hook, and 
                still swam patiently about with it in her gullet. &quot;A writer? 
                That means, as we fishes describe it, a kind of cuttle or ink-fish 
                among men.&quot;<br>
                Thus the fishes gossipped in their own way; but in the artificial 
                water-grotto the laborers were busy; who were obliged to take 
                advantage of the hours of night to get their work done by daybreak. 
                They accompanied with blows of their hammers and with songs the 
                parting words of the vanishing Dryad.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;So, at any rate, I have seen you, you pretty gold-fishes,&quot; 
                she<br>
                said. &quot;Yes, I know you;&quot; and she waved her hand to them. 
                &quot;I have known about you a long time in my home; the swallow 
                told me about you. How beautiful you are! how delicate and shining! 
                I should like to kiss every one of you. You others, also. I know 
                you all; but you do not know me.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The fishes stared out into the twilight. They did not understand 
                a<br>
                word of it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Dryad was there no longer. She had been a long time in the<br>
                open air, where the different countries- the country of black 
                bread,<br>
                the codfish coast, the kingdom of Russia leather, and the banks 
                of<br>
                eau-de-Cologne, and the gardens of rose oil- exhaled their perfumes<br>
                from the world-wonder flower.<br>
              </p>
              <p>When, after a night at a ball, we drive home half asleep and<br>
                half awake, the melodies still sound plainly in our ears; we hear<br>
                them, and could sing them all from memory. When the eye of the<br>
                murdered man closes, the picture of what it saw last clings to 
                it<br>
                for a time like a photographic picture.<br>
              </p>
              <p>So it was likewise here. The bustling life of day had not yet<br>
                disappeared in the quiet night. The Dryad had seen it; she knew,<br>
                thus it will be repeated tomorrow.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Dryad stood among the fragrant roses, and thought she knew<br>
                them, and had seen them in her own home. She also saw red<br>
                pomegranate flowers, like those that little Mary had worn in her<br>
                dark hair.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Remembrances from the home of her childhood flashed through her<br>
                thoughts; her eyes eagerly drank in the prospect around, and<br>
                feverish restlessness chased her through the wonder-filled halls.<br>
                A weariness that increased continually, took possession of her.<br>
                She felt a longing to rest on the soft Oriental carpets within, 
                or<br>
                to lean against the weeping willow without by the clear water. 
                But for<br>
                the ephemeral fly there was no rest. In a few moments the day 
                had<br>
                completed its circle.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Her thoughts trembled, her limbs trembled, she sank down on the<br>
                grass by the bubbling water.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Thou wilt ever spring living from the earth,&quot; she 
                said<br>
                mournfully. &quot;Moisten my tongue- bring me a refreshing draught.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I am no living water,&quot; was the answer. &quot;I only 
                spring upward when<br>
                the machine wills it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Give me something of thy freshness, thou green grass,&quot; 
                implored<br>
                the Dryad; &quot;give me one of thy fragrant flowers.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We must die if we are torn from our stalks,&quot; replied 
                the<br>
                Flowers and the Grass.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Give me a kiss, thou fresh stream of air- only a single<br>
                life-kiss.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Soon the sun will kiss the clouds red,&quot; answered the 
                Wind;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;then thou wilt be among the dead- blown away, as all the 
                splendor<br>
                here will be blown away before the year shall have ended. Then 
                I can<br>
                play again with the light loose sand on the place here, and whirl<br>
                the dust over the land and through the air. All is dust!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Dryad felt a terror like a woman who has cut asunder her<br>
                pulse-artery in the bath, but is filled again with the love of 
                life,<br>
                even while she is bleeding to death. She raised herself, tottered<br>
                forward a few steps, and sank down again at the entrance to a 
                little<br>
                church. The gate stood open, lights were burning upon the altar, 
                and<br>
                the organ sounded.<br>
              </p>
              <p>What music! Such notes the Dryad had never yet heard; and yet 
                it<br>
                seemed to her as if she recognized a number of well-known voices 
                among them. They came deep from the heart of all creation. She 
                thought she heard the stories of the old clergyman, of great deeds, 
                and of the celebrated names, and of the gifts that the creatures 
                of God must bestow upon posterity, if they would live on in the 
                world.<br>
                The tones of the organ swelled, and in their song there sounded<br>
                these words:<br>
                <br>
                &quot;Thy wishing and thy longing have torn thee, with thy roots,<br>
                from the place which God appointed for thee. That was thy destruction, 
                thou poor Dryad!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The notes became soft and gentle, and seemed to die away in a<br>
                wail.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the sky the clouds showed themselves with a ruddy gleam. The<br>
                Wind sighed: &quot;Pass away, ye dead! now the sun is going to 
                rise!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The first ray fell on the Dryad. Her form was irradiated in<br>
                changing colors, like the soap-bubble when it is bursting and<br>
                becomes a drop of water; like a tear that falls and passes away 
                like a<br>
                vapor.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Poor Dryad! Only a dew-drop, only a tear, poured upon the earth,<br>
                and vanished away!</p>

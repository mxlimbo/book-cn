              <p class="h" align="center"> THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> FAR away towards the east, in India, which seemed in those days<br>
                the world's end, stood the Tree of the Sun; a noble tree, such 
                as we<br>
                have never seen, and perhaps never may see.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The summit of this tree spread itself for miles like an entire<br>
                forest, each of its smaller branches forming a complete tree. 
                Palms,<br>
                beech-trees, pines, plane-trees, and various other kinds, which 
                are<br>
                found in all parts of the world, were here like small branches,<br>
                shooting forth from the great tree; while the larger boughs, with<br>
                their knots and curves, formed valleys and hills, clothed with 
                velvety<br>
                green and covered with flowers. Everywhere it was like a blooming<br>
                meadow or a lovely garden. Here were birds from all quarters of 
                the<br>
                world assembled together; birds from the primeval forests of<br>
                America, from the rose gardens of Damascus, and from the deserts 
                of Africa, in which the elephant and the lion may boast of being 
                the only rulers. Birds from the Polar regions came flying here, 
                and of course the stork and the swallow were not absent. But the 
                birds were not the only living creatures. There were stags, squirrels, 
                antelopes, and hundreds of other beautiful and light-footed animals 
                here found a<br>
                home.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The summit of the tree was a wide-spreading garden, and in the<br>
                midst of it, where the green boughs formed a kind of hill, stood 
                a<br>
                castle of crystal, with a view from it towards every quarter of<br>
                heaven. Each tower was erected in the form of a lily, and within 
                the<br>
                stern was a winding staircase, through which one could ascend 
                to the<br>
                top and step out upon the leaves as upon balconies. The calyx 
                of the<br>
                flower itself formed a most beautiful, glittering, circular hall,<br>
                above which no other roof arose than the blue firmament and the 
                sun<br>
                and stars.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Just as much splendor, but of another kind, appeared below, in 
                the<br>
                wide halls of the castle. Here, on the walls, were reflected<br>
                pictures of the world, which represented numerous and varied scenes 
                of everything that took place daily, so that it was useless to 
                read the<br>
                newspapers, and indeed there were none to be obtained in this 
                spot.<br>
              </p>
              <p>All was to be seen in living pictures by those who wished it, 
                but<br>
                all would have been too much for even the wisest man, and this 
                man<br>
                dwelt here. His name is very difficult; you would not be able 
                to<br>
                pronounce it, so it may be omitted. He knew everything that a 
                man on<br>
                earth can know or imagine. Every invention already in existence 
                or yet<br>
                to be, was known to him, and much more; still everything on earth<br>
                has a limit. The wise king Solomon was not half so wise as this 
                man.<br>
              </p>
              <p>He could govern the powers of nature and held sway over potent<br>
                spirits; even Death itself was obliged to give him every morning 
                a<br>
                list of those who were to die during the day. And King Solomon 
                himself had to die at last, and this fact it was which so often 
                occupied the thoughts of this great man in the castle on the Tree 
                of the Sun. He<br>
                knew that he also, however high he might tower above other men 
                in<br>
                wisdom, must one day die. He knew that his children would fade 
                away like the leaves of the forest and become dust. He saw the 
                human race wither and fall like leaves from the tree; he saw new 
                men come to fill their places, but the leaves that fell off never 
                sprouted forth again;<br>
                they crumbled to dust or were absorbed into other plants.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What happens to man,&quot; asked the wise man of himself, 
                &quot;when<br>
                touched by the angel of death? What can death be? The body decays, 
                and the soul. Yes; what is the soul, and whither does it go?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;To eternal life,&quot; says the comforting voice of religion.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But what is this change? Where and how shall we exist?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Above; in heaven,&quot; answers the pious man; &quot;it 
                is there we hope to<br>
                go.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Above!&quot; repeated the wise man, fixing his eyes upon 
                the moon<br>
                and stars above him. He saw that to this earthly sphere above 
                and<br>
                below were constantly changing places, and that the position varied<br>
                according to the spot on which a man found himself. He knew, also,<br>
                that even if he ascended to the top of the highest mountain which<br>
                rears its lofty summit on this earth, the air, which to us seems 
                clear<br>
                and transparent, would there be dark and cloudy; the sun would 
                have<br>
                a coppery glow and send forth no rays, and our earth would lie 
                beneath him wrapped in an orange-colored mist. How narrow are 
                the limits which confine the bodily sight, and how little can 
                be seen by the eye of the soul. How little do the wisest among 
                us know of that which is so important to us all.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the most secret chamber of the castle lay the greatest treasure<br>
                on earth- the Book of Truth. The wise man had read it through 
                page<br>
                after page. Every man may read in this book, but only in fragments. 
              </p>
              <p>To many eyes the characters seem so mixed in confusion that the 
                words cannot be distinguished. On certain pages the writing often 
                appears so pale or so blurred that the page becomes a blank. The 
                wiser a man becomes, the more he will read, and those who are 
                wisest read most.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The wise man knew how to unite the sunlight and the moonlight 
                with<br>
                the light of reason and the hidden powers of nature; and through<br>
                this stronger light, many things in the pages were made clear 
                to<br>
                him. But in the portion of the book entitled &quot;Life after 
                Death&quot; not<br>
                a single point could he see distinctly. This pained him. Should 
                he<br>
                never be able here on earth to obtain a light by which everything<br>
                written in the Book of Truth should become clear to him? Like 
                the wise King Solomon, he understood the language of animals, 
                and could interpret their talk into song; but that made him none 
                the wiser. </p>
              <p>He found out the nature of plants and metals, and their power 
                in curing diseases and arresting death, but none to destroy death 
                itself. In all created things within his reach he sought the light 
                that should<br>
                shine upon the certainty of an eternal life, but he found it not.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Book of Truth lay open before him, but, its pages were to 
                him as<br>
                blank paper. Christianity placed before him in the Bible a promise<br>
                of eternal life, but he wanted to read it in his book, in which<br>
                nothing on the subject appeared to be written.<br>
              </p>
              <p>He had five children; four sons, educated as the children of<br>
                such a wise father should be, and a daughter, fair, gentle, and<br>
                intelligent, but she was blind; yet this deprivation appeared 
                as<br>
                nothing to her; her father and brothers were outward eyes to her,<br>
                and a vivid imagination made everything clear to her mental sight. 
                The<br>
                sons had never gone farther from the castle than the branches 
                of the<br>
                trees extended, and the sister had scarcely ever left home. They<br>
                were happy children in that home of their childhood, the beautiful 
                and<br>
                fragrant Tree of the Sun. Like all children, they loved to hear<br>
                stories related to them, and their father told them many things<br>
                which other children would not have understood; but these were 
                as<br>
                clever as most grownup people are among us. He explained to them<br>
                what they saw in the pictures of life on the castle walls- the<br>
                doings of man, and the progress of events in all the lands of 
                the<br>
                earth; and the sons often expressed a wish that they could be 
                present,<br>
                and take a part in these great deeds. Then their father told them 
                that<br>
                in the world there was nothing but toil and difficulty: that it 
                was<br>
                not quite what it appeared to them, as they looked upon it in 
                their<br>
                beautiful home. He spoke to them of the true, the beautiful, and 
                the<br>
                good, and told them that these three held together in the world, 
                and<br>
                by that union they became crystallized into a precious jewel,<br>
                clearer than a diamond of the first water- a jewel, whose splendor 
                had<br>
                a value even in the sight of God, in whose brightness all things 
                are<br>
                dim. This jewel was called the philosopher's stone. He told them 
                that,<br>
                by searching, man could attain to a knowledge of the existence 
                of God, and that it was in the power of every man to discover 
                the certainty that such a jewel as the philosopher's stone really 
                existed. </p>
              <p>This information would have been beyond the perception of other 
                children; but these children understood, and others will learn 
                to comprehend its meaning after a time. They questioned their 
                father about the true, the beautiful, and the good, and he explained 
                it to them in many ways.<br>
              </p>
              <p>He told them that God, when He made man out of the dust of the<br>
                earth, touched His work five times, leaving five intense feelings,<br>
                which we call the five senses. Through these, the true, the beautiful,<br>
                and the good are seen, understood, and perceived, and through 
                these<br>
                they are valued, protected, and encouraged. Five senses have been<br>
                given mentally and corporeally, inwardly and outwardly, to body 
                and<br>
                soul.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The children thought deeply on all these things, and meditated<br>
                upon them day and night. Then the eldest of the brothers dreamt 
                a<br>
                splendid dream. Strange to say, not only the second brother but 
                also<br>
                the third and fourth brothers all dreamt exactly the same thing;<br>
                namely, that each went out into the world to find the philosopher's<br>
                stone. Each dreamt that he found it, and that, as he rode back 
                on<br>
                his swift horse, in the morning dawn, over the velvety green<br>
                meadows, to his home in the castle of his father, that the stone<br>
                gleamed from his forehead like a beaming light; and threw such 
                a<br>
                bright radiance upon the pages of the Book of Truth that every 
                word<br>
                was illuminated which spoke of the life beyond the grave. But 
                the<br>
                sister had no dream of going out into the wide world; it never 
                entered<br>
                her mind. Her world was her father's house.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I shall ride forth into the wide world,&quot; said the 
                eldest brother.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I must try what life is like there, as I mix with men. 
                I will<br>
                practise only the good and true; with these I will protect the<br>
                beautiful. Much shall be changed for the better while I am there.&quot;<br>
                Now these thoughts were great and daring, as our thoughts<br>
                generally are at home, before we have gone out into the world, 
                and<br>
                encountered its storms and tempests, its thorns and its thistles. 
                In<br>
                him, and in all his brothers, the five senses were highly<br>
                cultivated, inwardly and outwardly; but each of them had one sense<br>
                which in keenness and development surpassed the other four. In 
                the<br>
                case of the eldest, this pre-eminent sense was sight, which he 
                hoped<br>
                would be of special service. He had eyes for all times and all 
                people;<br>
                eyes that could discover in the depths of the earth hidden<br>
                treasures, and look into the hearts of men, as through a pane 
                of<br>
                glass; he could read more than is often seen on the cheek that 
                blushes<br>
                or grows pale, in the eye that droops or smiles. Stags and antelopes<br>
                accompanied him to the western boundary of his home, and there 
                he<br>
                found the wild swans. These he followed, and found himself far 
                away in the north, far from the land of his father, which extended 
                eastward to the ends of the earth. How he opened his eyes with 
                astonishment! </p>
              <p>How many things were to be seen here! and so different to the 
                mere<br>
                representation of pictures such as those in his father's house. 
                At<br>
                first he nearly lost his eyes in astonishment at the rubbish and<br>
                mockery brought forward to represent the beautiful; but he kept 
                his<br>
                eyes, and soon found full employment for them. He wished to go<br>
                thoroughly and honestly to work in his endeavor to understand 
                the<br>
                true, the beautiful, and the good. But how were they represented 
                in<br>
                the world? He observed that the wreath which rightly belonged 
                to the<br>
                beautiful was often given the hideous; that the good was often<br>
                passed by unnoticed, while mediocrity was applauded, when it should<br>
                have been hissed. People look at the dress, not at the wearer; 
                thought<br>
                more of a name than of doing their duty; and trusted more to<br>
                reputation than to real service. It was everywhere the same.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I see I must make a regular attack on these things,&quot; 
                said he; and<br>
                he accordingly did not spare them. But while looking for the truth,<br>
                came the evil one, the father of lies, to intercept him. Gladly<br>
                would the fiend have plucked out the eyes of this Seer, but that 
                would<br>
                have been a too straightforward path for him; he works more cunningly.<br>
              </p>
              <p>He allowed the young man to seek for, and discover, the beautiful<br>
                and the good; but while he was contemplating them, the evil spirit<br>
                blew one mote after another into each of his eyes; and such a<br>
                proceeding would injure the strongest sight. Then he blew upon 
                the<br>
                motes, and they became beams, so that the clearness of his sight 
                was<br>
                gone, and the Seer was like a blind man in the world, and had 
                no<br>
                longer any faith in it. He had lost his good opinion of the world,<br>
                as well as of himself; and when a man gives up the world, and<br>
                himself too, it is all over with him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;All over,&quot; said the wild swan, who flew across the 
                sea to the<br>
                east.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;All over,&quot; twittered the swallows, who were also flying<br>
                eastward towards the Tree of the Sun. It was no good news which 
                they carried home.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I think the Seer has been badly served,&quot; said the 
                second brother,<br>
                &quot;but the Hearer may be more successful.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>This one possessed the sense of hearing to a very high degree:<br>
                so acute was this sense, that it was said he could hear the grass<br>
                grow. He took a fond leave of all at home, and rode away, provided<br>
                with good abilities and good intentions. The swallows escorted 
                him,<br>
                and he followed the swans till he found himself out in the world,<br>
                and far away from home. But he soon discovered that one may have 
                too much of a good thing. His hearing was too fine. He not only 
                heard the grass grow, but could hear every man's heart beat, whether 
                in sorrow or in joy. The whole world was to him like a clockmaker's 
                great workshop, in which all the clocks were going &quot;tick, 
                tick,&quot; and all the turret clocks striking &quot;ding, dong.&quot; 
                It was unbearable. For a long<br>
                time his ears endured it, but at last all the noise and tumult<br>
                became too much for one man to bear.<br>
              </p>
              <p>There were rascally boys of sixty years old- for years do not<br>
                alone make a man- who raised a tumult, which might have made the<br>
                Hearer laugh, but for the applause which followed, echoing through<br>
                every street and house, and was even heard in country roads. Falsehood 
                thrust itself forward and played the hypocrite; the bells on the 
                fool's cap jingled, and declared they were church-bells, and the 
                noise became so bad for the Hearer that he thrust his fingers 
                into his ears.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Still, he could hear false notes and bad singing, gossip and 
                idle<br>
                words, scandal and slander, groaning and moaning, without and<br>
                within. &quot;Heaven help us!&quot; He thrust his fingers farther 
                and farther<br>
                into his ears, till at last the drums burst. And now he could 
                hear<br>
                nothing more of the true, the beautiful, and the good; for his 
                hearing<br>
                was to have been the means by which he hoped to acquire his knowledge.<br>
              </p>
              <p>He became silent and suspicious, and at last trusted no one, 
                not<br>
                even himself, and no longer hoping to find and bring home the 
                costly<br>
                jewel, he gave it up, and gave himself up too, which was worse 
                than<br>
                all.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The birds in their flight towards the east, carried the tidings,<br>
                and the news reached the castle in the Tree of the Sun.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I will try now,&quot; said the third brother; &quot;I have 
                a keen nose.&quot;<br>
                Now that was not a very elegant expression, but it was his way, 
                and we must take him as he was. He had a cheerful temper, and 
                was, besides, a real poet; he could make many things appear poetical, 
                by the way in which he spoke of them, and ideas struck him long 
                before they occurred to the minds of others. &quot;I can smell,&quot; 
                he would say; and he attributed to the sense of smelling, which 
                he possessed in a high degree, a great power in the region of 
                the beautiful. &quot;I can smell,&quot; he would say, &quot;and 
                many places are fragrant or beautiful according to the taste of 
                the frequenters. One man feels at home in the atmosphere of the 
                tavern, among the flaring tallow candles, and when the smell of<br>
                spirits mingles with the fumes of bad tobacco. Another prefers 
                sitting<br>
                amidst the overpowering scent of jasmine, or perfuming himself 
                with<br>
                scented olive oil. This man seeks the fresh sea breeze, while 
                that one<br>
                climbs the lofty mountain-top, to look down upon the busy life 
                in<br>
                miniature beneath him.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>As he spoke in this way, it seemed as if he had already been 
                out<br>
                in the world, as if he had already known and associated with man.<br>
                But this experience was intuitive- it was the poetry within him, 
                a<br>
                gift from Heaven bestowed on him in his cradle. He bade farewell 
                to<br>
                his parental roof in the Tree of the Sun, and departed on foot, 
                from<br>
                the pleasant scenes that surrounded his home. Arrived at its confines,<br>
                he mounted on the back of an ostrich, which runs faster than a<br>
                horse, and afterwards, when he fell in with the wild swans, he 
                swung<br>
                himself on the strongest of them, for he loved change, and away 
                he<br>
                flew over the sea to distant lands, where there were great forests,<br>
                deep lakes, lofty mountains, and proud cities. Wherever he came 
                it<br>
                seemed as if sunshine travelled with him across the fields, for<br>
                every flower, every bush, exhaled a renewed fragrance, as if conscious 
                that a friend and protector was near; one who understood them, 
                and knew their value. The stunted rose-bush shot forth twigs, 
                unfolded its leaves, and bore the most beautiful roses; every 
                one could see it, and even the black, slimy wood-snail noticed 
                its beauty. </p>
              <p>&quot;I will give my seal to the flower,&quot; said the snail, 
                &quot;I have trailed my slime upon it, I can do no more.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Thus it always fares with the beautiful in this world,&quot; 
                said<br>
                the poet. And he made a song upon it, and sung it after his own<br>
                fashion, but nobody listened. Then he gave a drummer twopence 
                and a peacock's feather, and composed a song for the drum, and 
                the drummer beat it through the streets of the town, and when 
                the people heard it they said, &quot;That is a capital tune.&quot; 
                The poet wrote many songs about the true, the beautiful, and the 
                good. His songs were listened to in the tavern, where the tallow 
                candles flared, in the fresh clover field, in the forest, and 
                on the high-seas; and it appeared as if this brother was to be 
                more fortunate than the other two.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the evil spirit was angry at this, so he set to work with 
                soot<br>
                and incense, which he can mix so artfully as to confuse an angel,<br>
                and how much more easily a poor poet. The evil one knew how to<br>
                manage such people. He so completely surrounded the poet with<br>
                incense that the man lost his head, forgot his mission and his 
                home,<br>
                and at last lost himself and vanished in smoke.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But when the little birds heard of it, they mourned, and for 
                three<br>
                days they sang not one song. The black wood-snail became blacker<br>
                still; not for grief, but for envy. &quot;They should have offered 
                me<br>
                incense,&quot; he said, &quot;for it was I who gave him the idea 
                of the most<br>
                famous of his songs- the drum song of 'The Way of the World;' 
                and it was I who spat at the rose; I can bring a witness to that 
                fact.&quot;<br>
                But no tidings of all this reached the poet's home in India. The<br>
                birds had all been silent for three days, and when the time of<br>
                mourning was over, so deep had been their grief, that they had<br>
                forgotten for whom they wept. Such is the way of the world.<br>
                &quot;Now I must go out into the world, and disappear like the 
                rest,&quot;<br>
                said the fourth brother. He was as good-tempered as the third, 
                but<br>
                no poet, though he could be witty.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The two eldest had filled the castle with joyfulness, and now<br>
                the last brightness was going away. Sight and hearing have always 
                been considered two of the chief senses among men, and those which 
                they wish to keep bright; the other senses are looked upon as 
                of less<br>
                importance.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the younger son had a different opinion; he had cultivated 
                his<br>
                taste in every way, and taste is very powerful. It rules over 
                what<br>
                goes into the mouth, as well as over all which is presented to 
                the<br>
                mind; and, consequently, this brother took upon himself to taste<br>
                everything stored up in bottles or jars; this he called the rough 
                part<br>
                of his work. Every man's mind was to him as a vessel in which<br>
                something was concocting; every land a kind of mental kitchen.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There are no delicacies here,&quot; he said; so he wished 
                to go out into<br>
                the world to find something delicate to suit his taste. &quot;Perhaps<br>
                fortune may be more favorable to me than it was to my brothers. 
                I<br>
                shall start on my travels, but what conveyance shall I choose? 
                Are air<br>
                balloons invented yet?&quot; he asked of his father, who knew 
                of all<br>
                inventions that had been made, or would be made.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Air balloons had not then been invented, nor steam-ships, nor<br>
                railways.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Good,&quot; said he; &quot;then I shall choose an air balloon; 
                my father<br>
                knows how they are to be made and guided. Nobody has invented 
                one yet, and the people will believe that it is an aerial phantom. 
                When I have done with the balloon I shall burn it, and for this 
                purpose,<br>
                you must give me a few pieces of another invention, which will 
                come<br>
                next; I mean a few chemical matches.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>He obtained what he wanted, and flew away. The birds accompanied<br>
                him farther than they had the other brothers. They were curious 
                to<br>
                know how this flight would end. Many more of them came swooping<br>
                down; they thought it must be some new bird, and he soon had a<br>
                goodly company of followers. They came in clouds till the air 
                became<br>
                darkened with birds as it was with the cloud of locusts over the<br>
                land of Egypt.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And now he was out in the wide world. The balloon descended over<br>
                one of the greatest cities, and the aeronaut took up his station 
                at<br>
                the highest point, on the church steeple. The balloon rose again<br>
                into the air, which it ought not to have done; what became of 
                it is<br>
                not known, neither is it of any consequence, for balloons had 
                not then<br>
                been invented.<br>
              </p>
              <p>There he sat on the church steeple. The birds no longer hovered<br>
                over him; they had got tired of him, and he was tired of them. 
                All the<br>
                chimneys in the town were smoking.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There are altars erected to my honor,&quot; said the wind, 
                who<br>
                wished to say something agreeable to him as he sat there boldly<br>
                looking down upon the people in the street. There was one stepping<br>
                along, proud of his purse; another, of the key he carried behind<br>
                him, though he had nothing to lock up; another took a pride in 
                his<br>
                moth-eaten coat; and another, in his mortified body. &quot;Vanity, 
                all<br>
                vanity!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I must go down there by-and-by, 
                and touch<br>
                and taste; but I shall sit here a little while longer, for the 
                wind<br>
                blows pleasantly at my back. I shall remain here as long as the 
                wind<br>
                blows, and enjoy a little rest. It is comfortable to sleep late 
                in the<br>
                morning when one had a great deal to do,&quot; said the sluggard; 
                &quot;so I<br>
                shall stop here as long as the wind blows, for it pleases me.&quot;<br>
                And there he stayed. But as he was sitting on the weather-cock<br>
                of the steeple, which kept turning round and round with him, he 
                was<br>
                under the false impression that the same wind still blew, and 
                that<br>
                he could stay where he was without expense.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But in India, in the castle on the Tree of the Sun, all was<br>
                solitary and still, since the brothers had gone away one after 
                the<br>
                other.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Nothing goes well with them,&quot; said the father; &quot;they 
                will never<br>
                bring the glittering jewel home, it is not made for me; they are 
                all<br>
                dead and gone.&quot; Then he bent down over the Book of Truth, 
                and gazed on the page on which he should have read of the life 
                after death, but for him there was nothing to be read or learned 
                upon it.<br>
                His blind daughter was his consolation and joy; she clung to him<br>
                with sincere affection, and for the sake of his happiness and 
                peace<br>
                she wished the costly jewel could be found and brought home.<br>
              </p>
              <p>With longing tenderness she thought of her brothers. Where were<br>
                they? Where did they live? How she wished she might dream of them; 
                but it was strange that not even in dreams could she be brought 
                near to them. But at last one night she dreamt that she heard 
                the voices of<br>
                her brothers calling to her from the distant world, and she could<br>
                not refrain herself, but went out to them, and yet it seemed in 
                her<br>
                dream that she still remained in her father's house. She did not 
                see<br>
                her brothers, but she felt as it were a fire burning in her hand,<br>
                which, however, did not hurt her, for it was the jewel she was<br>
                bringing to her father. When she awoke she thought for a moment 
                that<br>
                she still held the stone, but she only grasped the knob of her<br>
                distaff.<br>
              </p>
              <p>During the long evenings she had spun constantly, and round the<br>
                distaff were woven threads finer than the web of a spider; human<br>
                eyes could never have distinguished these threads when separated<br>
                from each other. But she had wetted them with her tears, and the 
                twist<br>
                was as strong as a cable. She rose with the impression that her<br>
                dream must be a reality, and her resolution was taken.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was still night, and her father slept; she pressed a kiss<br>
                upon his hand, and then took her distaff and fastened the end 
                of the<br>
                thread to her father's house. But for this, blind as she was, 
                she<br>
                would never have found her way home again; to this thread she 
                must<br>
                hold fast, and trust not to others or even to herself. From the 
                Tree<br>
                of the Sun she broke four leaves; which she gave up to the wind 
                and<br>
                the weather, that they might be carried to her brothers as letters 
                and<br>
                a greeting, in case she did not meet them in the wide world. Poor<br>
                blind child, what would become of her in those distant regions? 
                But<br>
                she had the invisible thread, to which she could hold fast; and 
                she<br>
                possessed a gift which all the others lacked. This was a determination<br>
                to throw herself entirely into whatever she undertook, and it 
                made her<br>
                feel as if she had eyes even at the tips of her fingers, and could<br>
                hear down into her very heart. Quietly she went forth into the<br>
                noisy, bustling, wonderful world, and wherever she went the skies 
                grew bright, and she felt the warm sunbeam, and a rainbow above 
                in the blue heavens seemed to span the dark world. She heard the 
                song of the birds, and smelt the scent of the orange groves and 
                apple orchards so strongly that she seemed to taste it. Soft tones 
                and charming songs reached her ear, as well as harsh sounds and 
                rough words- thoughts and opinions in strange contradiction to 
                each other. Into the deepest recesses of her heart penetrated 
                the echoes of human thoughts and feelings. Now she heard the following 
                words sadly sung,-</p>
              <p> &quot;Life is a shadow that flits away<br>
                In a night of darkness and woe.&quot;</p>
              <p>But then would follow brighter thoughts:</p>
              <p> &quot;Life has the rose's sweet perfume<br>
                With sunshine, light, and joy.&quot;</p>
              <p>And if one stanza sounded painfully-</p>
              <p> &quot;Each mortal thinks of himself alone,<br>
                Is a truth, alas, too clearly known;&quot;</p>
              <p>Then, on the other hand, came the answer-</p>
              <p> &quot;Love, like a mighty flowing stream,<br>
                Fills every heart with its radiant gleam.&quot;</p>
              <p>She heard, indeed, such words as these-</p>
              <p> &quot;In the pretty turmoil here below,<br>
                All is a vain and paltry show.</p>
              <p>Then came also words of comfort-</p>
              <p> &quot;Great and good are the actions done<br>
                By many whose worth is never known.&quot;</p>
              <p>And if sometimes the mocking strain reached her-</p>
              <p> &quot;Why not join in the jesting cry<br>
                That contemns all gifts from the throne on high?&quot;</p>
              <p>In the blind girl's heart a stronger voice repeated-</p>
              <p> &quot;To trust in thyself and God is best,<br>
                In His holy will forever to rest.&quot;</p>
              <p> But the evil spirit could not see this and remain contented. 
                He<br>
                has more cleverness than ten thousand men, and he found means 
                to<br>
                compass his end. He betook himself to the marsh, and collected 
                a few little bubbles of stagnant water. Then he uttered over them 
                the echoes of lying words that they might become strong. He mixed 
                up together songs of praise with lying epitaphs, as many as he 
                could find, boiled them in tears shed by envy; put upon them rouge, 
                which he had scraped from faded cheeks, and from these he produced 
                a maiden, in form and appearance like the blind girl, the angel 
                of completeness, as men called her. The evil one's plot was successful. 
              </p>
              <p>The world knew not which was the true, and indeed how should 
                the world know?</p>
              <p> &quot;To trust in thyself and God is best,<br>
                In his Holy will forever to rest.&quot;</p>
              <p>So sung the blind girl in full faith. She had entrusted the four 
                green<br>
                leaves from the Tree of the Sun to the winds, as letters of greeting<br>
                to her brothers, and she had full confidence that the leaves would<br>
                reach them. She fully believed that the jewel which outshines 
                all<br>
                the glories of the world would yet be found, and that upon the<br>
                forehead of humanity it would glitter even in the castle of her<br>
                father. &quot;Even in my father's house,&quot; she repeated. &quot;Yes, 
                the place<br>
                in which this jewel is to be found is earth, and I shall bring 
                more<br>
                than the promise of it with me. I feel it glow and swell more 
                and more<br>
                in my closed hand. Every grain of truth which the keen wind carried 
                up and whirled towards me I caught and treasured. I allowed it 
                to be<br>
                penetrated with the fragrance of the beautiful, of which there 
                is so<br>
                much in the world, even for the blind. I took the beatings of 
                a<br>
                heart engaged in a good action, and added them to my treasure. 
                All<br>
                that I can bring is but dust; still, it is a part of the jewel 
                we<br>
                seek, and there is plenty, my hand is quite full of it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>She soon found herself again at home; carried thither in a<br>
                flight of thought, never having loosened her hold of the invisible<br>
                thread fastened to her father's house. As she stretched out her 
                hand<br>
                to her father, the powers of evil dashed with the fury of a<br>
                hurricane over the Tree of the Sun; a blast of wind rushed through 
                the<br>
                open doors, and into the sanctuary, where lay the Book of Truth.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It will be blown to dust by the wind,&quot; said the father, 
                as he<br>
                seized the open hand she held towards him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No,&quot; she replied, with quiet confidence, &quot;it 
                is indestructible. I<br>
                feel its beam warming my very soul.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then her father observed that a dazzling flame gleamed from the<br>
                white page on which the shining dust had passed from her hand. 
                It<br>
                was there to prove the certainty of eternal life, and on the book<br>
                glowed one shining word, and only one, the word BELIEVE. And soon 
                the four brothers were again with the father and daughter. When 
                the green leaf from home fell on the bosom of each, a longing 
                had seized them to return. They had arrived, accompanied by the 
                birds of passage, the stag, the antelope, and all the creatures 
                of the forest who wished to take part in their joy.<br>
              </p>
              <p>We have often seen, when a sunbeam burst through a crack in the<br>
                door into a dusty room, how a whirling column of dust seems to<br>
                circle round. But this was not poor, insignificant, common dust, 
                which the blind girl had brought; even the rainbow's colors are 
                dim when compared with the beauty which shone from the page on 
                which it had fallen. The beaming word BELIEVE, from every grain 
                of truth, had the brightness of the beautiful and the good, more 
                bright than the<br>
                mighty pillar of flame that led Moses and the children of Israel 
                to<br>
                the land of Canaan, and from the word BELIEVE arose the bridge 
                of<br>
                hope, reaching even to the unmeasurable Love in the realms of 
                the<br>
                infinite.</p>

              <p class="h" align="center"> THE PUPPET-SHOW MAN</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> ON board a steamer I once met an elderly man, with such a merry<br>
                face that, if it was really an index of his mind, he must have 
                been<br>
                the happiest fellow in creation; and indeed he considered himself<br>
                so, for I heard it from his own mouth. He was a Dane, the owner 
                of a<br>
                travelling theatre. He had all his company with him in a large 
                box,<br>
                for he was the proprietor of a puppet-show. His inborn cheerfulness,<br>
                he said, had been tested by a member of the Polytechnic Institution,<br>
                and the experiment had made him completely happy. I did not at 
                first<br>
                understand all this, but afterwards he explained the whole story 
                to<br>
                me; and here it is:-<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I was giving a representation,&quot; he said, &quot;in 
                the hall of the<br>
                posting-house in the little town of Slagelse; there was a splendid<br>
                audience, entirely juvenile excepting two respectable matrons. 
                All<br>
                at once, a person in black, of student-like appearance, entered 
                the<br>
                room, and sat down; he laughed aloud at the telling points, and<br>
                applauded quite at the proper time. This was a very unusual<br>
                spectator for me, and I felt anxious to know who he was. I heard<br>
                that he was a member of the Polytechnic Institution in Copenhagen, 
                who had been sent out to lecture to the people in the provinces.<br>
                Punctually at eight o'clock my performance closed, for children 
                must<br>
                go early to bed, and a manager must also consult the convenience 
                of<br>
                the public.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;At nine o'clock the lecturer commenced his lecture and 
                his<br>
                experiments, and then I formed a part of his audience. It was<br>
                wonderful both to hear and to see. The greater part of it was 
                beyond<br>
                my comprehension, but it led me to think that if we men can acquire 
                so much, we must surely be intended to last longer than the little 
                span<br>
                which extends only to the time when we are hidden away under the<br>
                earth. His experiments were quite miracles on a small scale, and 
                yet<br>
                the explanations flowed as naturally as water from his lips. At 
                the<br>
                time of Moses and the prophets, such a man would have been placed<br>
                among the sages of the land; in the middle ages they would have<br>
                burnt him at the stake.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;All night long I could not sleep; and the next evening 
                when I<br>
                gave another performance and the lecturer was present, I was in 
                one of my best moods.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I once heard of an actor, who, when he had to act the part 
                of a<br>
                lover, always thought of one particular lady in the audience; 
                he<br>
                only played for her, and forgot all the rest of the house, and 
                now the<br>
                Polytechnic lecturer was my she, my only auditor, for whom alone 
                I<br>
                played.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;When the performance was over, and the puppets removed 
                behind the curtain, the Polytechnic lecturer invited me into his 
                room to take a<br>
                glass of wine. He talked of my comedies, and I of his science, 
                and I<br>
                believe we were both equally pleased. But I had the best of it, 
                for<br>
                there was much in what he did that he could not always explain 
                to<br>
                me. For instance, why a piece of iron which is rubbed on a cylinder,<br>
                should become magnetic. How does this happen? The magnetic sparks 
                come to it,- but how? It is the same with people in the world; 
                they are rubbed about on this spherical globe till the electric 
                spark comes upon them, and then we have a Napoleon, or a Luther, 
                or some one of the kind.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'The whole world is but a series of miracles,' said the 
                lecturer,<br>
                'but we are so accustomed to them that we call them everyday matters.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>And he went on explaining things to me till my skull seemed lifted<br>
                from my brain, and I declared that were I not such an old fellow, 
                I<br>
                would at once become a member of the Polytechnic Institution, 
                that I<br>
                might learn to look at the bright side of everything, although 
                I was<br>
                one of the happiest of men.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'One of the happiest!' said the lecturer, as if the idea<br>
                pleased him; 'are you really happy?'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'Yes,' I replied; 'for I am welcomed in every town, when 
                I arrive<br>
                with my company; but I certainly have one wish which sometimes<br>
                weighs upon my cheerful temper like a mountain of lead. I should<br>
                like to become the manager of a real theatre, and the director 
                of a<br>
                real troupe of men and women.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;'I understand,' he said; 'you would like to have life breathed<br>
                into your puppets, so that they might be living actors, and you<br>
                their director. And would you then be quite happy?'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I said I believed so. But he did not; and we talked it 
                over in<br>
                all manner of ways, yet could not agree on the subject. However, 
                the<br>
                wine was excellent, and we clanked our glasses together as we 
                drank.<br>
                There must have been magic in it, or I should most certainly become<br>
                tipsy; but that did not happen, for my mind seemed quite clear; 
                and,<br>
                indeed, a kind of sunshine filled the room, and beamed from the 
                eyes<br>
                of the Polytechnic lecturer. It made me think of the old stories<br>
                when the gods, in their immortal youth, wandered upon this earth,<br>
                and paid visits to mankind. I said so to him, and he smiled; and 
                I<br>
                could have sworn that he was one of these ancient deities in disguise,<br>
                or, at all events, that he belonged to the race of the gods. The<br>
                result seemed to prove I was right in my suspicions; for it was<br>
                arranged that my highest wish should be granted, that my puppets<br>
                were to be gifted with life, and that I was to be the manager 
                of a<br>
                real company. We drank to my success, and clanked our glasses. 
              </p>
              <p>Then he packed all my dolls into the box, and fastened it on 
                my back, and I felt as if I were spinning round in a circle, and 
                presently found<br>
                myself lying on the floor. I remember that quite well. And then 
                the<br>
                whole company sprang from the box. The spirit had come upon us 
                all; the puppets had become distinguished actors- at least, so 
                they said themselves- and I was their director.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;When all was ready for the first representation, the whole<br>
                company requested permission to speak to me before appearing in<br>
                public. The dancing lady said the house could not be supported<br>
                unless she stood on one leg; for she was a great genius, and begged 
                to be treated as such. The lady who acted the part of the queen<br>
                expected to be treated as a queen off the stage, as well as on 
                it,<br>
                or else she said she should get out of practice. The man whose 
                duty it<br>
                was to deliver a letter gave himself as many airs as he who took 
                the<br>
                part of first lover in the piece; he declared that the inferior<br>
                parts were as important as the great ones, and deserving equal<br>
                consideration, as parts of an artistic whole. The hero of the 
                piece<br>
                would only play in a part containing points likely to bring down 
                the<br>
                applause of the house. The 'prima donna' would only act when the<br>
                lights were red, for she declared that a blue light did not suit 
                her<br>
                complexion. It was like a company of flies in a bottle, and I 
                was in<br>
                the bottle with them; for I was their director. My breath was 
                taken<br>
                away, my head whirled, and I was as miserable as a man could be. 
                It<br>
                was quite a novel, strange set of beings among whom I now found<br>
                myself. I only wished I had them all in my box again, and that 
                I had<br>
                never been their director. So I told them roundly that, after 
                all,<br>
                they were nothing but puppets; and then they killed me. After 
                a<br>
                while I found myself lying on my bed in my room; but how I got<br>
                there, or how I got away at all from the Polytechnic professor, 
                he may perhaps know, I don't. The moon shone upon the floor, the 
                box lay open, and the dolls were all scattered about in great 
                confusion; but I was not idle. I jumped off the bed, and into 
                the box they all had to<br>
                go, some on their heads, some on their feet. Then I shut down 
                the lid,<br>
                and seated myself upon the box. 'Now you'll have to stay,' said 
                I,<br>
                'and I shall be cautious how I wish you flesh and blood again.'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I felt quite light, my cheerfulness had returned, and I 
                was the<br>
                happiest of mortals. The Polytechnic professor had fully cured 
                me. I<br>
                was as happy as a king, and went to sleep on the box. Next morning-<br>
                correctly speaking, it was noon, for I slept remarkably late that 
                day-<br>
                I found myself still sitting there, in happy consciousness that 
                my<br>
                former wish had been a foolish one. I inquired for the Polytechnic<br>
                professor; but he had disappeared like the Greek and Roman gods;<br>
                from that time I have been the happiest man in the world. I am 
                a happy director; for none of my company ever grumble, nor the 
                public<br>
                either, for I always make them merry. I can arrange my pieces 
                just<br>
                as I please. I choose out of every comedy what I like best, and 
                no one is offended. Plays that are neglected now-a-days by the 
                great public were ran after thirty years ago, and listened to 
                till the tears ran<br>
                down the cheeks of the audience. These are the pieces I bring 
                forward.<br>
              </p>
              <p>I place them before the little ones, who cry over them as papa 
                and<br>
                mamma used to cry thirty years ago. But I make them shorter, for 
                the<br>
                youngsters don't like long speeches; and if they have anything<br>
                mournful, they like it to be over quickly.&quot;</p>

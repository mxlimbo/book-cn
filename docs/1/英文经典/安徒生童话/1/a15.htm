              <p class="h" align="center"> THE WICKED PRINCE</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THERE lived once upon a time a wicked prince whose heart and<br>
                mind were set upon conquering all the countries of the world, 
                and on<br>
                frightening the people; he devastated their countries with fire 
                and<br>
                sword, and his soldiers trod down the crops in the fields and<br>
                destroyed the peasants' huts by fire, so that the flames licked 
                the<br>
                green leaves off the branches, and the fruit hung dried up on 
                the<br>
                singed black trees. Many a poor mother fled, her naked baby in 
                her<br>
                arms, behind the still smoking walls of her cottage; but also 
                there<br>
                the soldiers followed her, and when they found her, she served 
                as<br>
                new nourishment to their diabolical enjoyments; demons could not<br>
                possibly have done worse things than these soldiers! The prince 
                was of opinion that all this was right, and that it was only the 
                natural<br>
                course which things ought to take. His power increased day by 
                day, his name was feared by all, and fortune favoured his deeds.<br>
              </p>
              <p>He brought enormous wealth home from the conquered towns, and<br>
                gradually accumulated in his residence riches which could nowhere 
                be<br>
                equalled. He erected magnificent palaces, churches, and halls, 
                and all<br>
                who saw these splendid buildings and great treasures exclaimed<br>
                admiringly: &quot;What a mighty prince!&quot; But they did not 
                know what endless misery he had brought upon other countries, 
                nor did they hear the sighs and lamentations which rose up from 
                the debris of the<br>
                destroyed cities.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The prince often looked with delight upon his gold and his<br>
                magnificent edifices, and thought, like the crowd: &quot;What 
                a mighty<br>
                prince! But I must have more- much more. No power on earth must<br>
                equal mine, far less exceed it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>He made war with all his neighbours, and defeated them. The<br>
                conquered kings were chained up with golden fetters to his chariot<br>
                when he drove through the streets of his city. These kings had 
                to<br>
                kneel at his and his courtiers' feet when they sat at table, and<br>
                live on the morsels which they left. At last the prince had his 
                own<br>
                statue erected on the public places and fixed on the royal palaces;<br>
                nay, he even wished it to be placed in the churches, on the altars,<br>
                but in this the priests opposed him, saying: &quot;Prince, you 
                are mighty<br>
                indeed, but God's power is much greater than yours; we dare not 
                obey your orders.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said the prince. &quot;Then I will conquer 
                God too.&quot; And in his<br>
                haughtiness and foolish presumption he ordered a magnificent ship 
                to<br>
                be constructed, with which he could sail through the air; it was<br>
                gorgeously fitted out and of many colours; like the tail of a 
                peacock,<br>
                it was covered with thousands of eyes, but each eye was the barrel<br>
                of a gun. The prince sat in the centre of the ship, and had only 
                to<br>
                touch a spring in order to make thousands of bullets fly out in 
                all<br>
                directions, while the guns were at once loaded again. Hundreds 
                of<br>
                eagles were attached to this ship, and it rose with the swiftness 
                of<br>
                an arrow up towards the sun. The earth was soon left far below, 
                and<br>
                looked, with its mountains and woods, like a cornfield where the<br>
                plough had made furrows which separated green meadows; soon it<br>
                looked only like a map with indistinct lines upon it; and at last 
                it<br>
                entirely disappeared in mist and clouds. Higher and higher rose 
                the<br>
                eagles up into the air; then God sent one of his numberless angels<br>
                against the ship. The wicked prince showered thousands of bullets 
                upon him, but they rebounded from his shining wings and fell down 
                like ordinary hailstones. One drop of blood, one single drop, 
                came out of the white feathers of the angel's wings and fell upon 
                the ship in<br>
                which the prince sat, burnt into it, and weighed upon it like<br>
                thousands of hundredweights, dragging it rapidly down to the earth<br>
                again; the strong wings of the eagles gave way, the wind roared<br>
                round the prince's head, and the clouds around- were they formed 
                by<br>
                the smoke rising up from the burnt cities?- took strange shapes,<br>
                like crabs many, many miles long, which stretched their claws 
                out<br>
                after him, and rose up like enormous rocks, from which rolling<br>
                masses dashed down, and became fire-spitting dragons.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The prince was lying half-dead in his ship, when it sank at last<br>
                with a terrible shock into the branches of a large tree in the 
                wood.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I will conquer God!&quot; said the prince. &quot;I have 
                sworn it: my will<br>
                must be done!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And he spent seven years in the construction of wonderful ships 
                to<br>
                sail through the air, and had darts cast from the hardest steel 
                to<br>
                break the walls of heaven with. He gathered warriors from all<br>
                countries, so many that when they were placed side by side they<br>
                covered the space of several miles. They entered the ships and 
                the<br>
                prince was approaching his own, when God sent a swarm of gnats- 
                one swarm of little gnats. They buzzed round the prince and stung 
                his face and hands; angrily he drew his sword and brandished it, 
                but he only touched the air and did not hit the gnats. Then he 
                ordered his<br>
                servants to bring costly coverings and wrap him in them, that 
                the<br>
                gnats might no longer be able to reach him. The servants carried 
                out<br>
                his orders, but one single gnat had placed itself inside one of 
                the<br>
                coverings, crept into the prince's ear and stung him. The place<br>
                burnt like fire, and the poison entered into his blood. Mad with 
                pain,<br>
                he tore off the coverings and his clothes too, flinging them far 
                away,<br>
                and danced about before the eyes of his ferocious soldiers, who 
                now<br>
                mocked at him, the mad prince, who wished to make war with God, 
                and was overcome by a single little gnat.</p>

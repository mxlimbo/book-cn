              <p class="h" align="center"> THE LITTLE MERMAID</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> FAR out in the ocean, where the water is as blue as the prettiest 
                cornflower, and as clear as crystal, it is very, very deep; so 
                deep, indeed, that no cable could fathom it: many church steeples, 
                piled one upon another, would not reach from the ground beneath 
                to the surface of the water above. There dwell the Sea King and 
                his subjects. We must not imagine that there is nothing at the 
                bottom of the sea but bare yellow sand. No, indeed; the most singular 
                flowers and plants grow there; the leaves and stems of which are 
                so pliant, that the slightest agitation of the water causes them 
                to stir as if they had life. Fishes, both large and small, glide 
                between the branches, as birds fly among the trees here upon land. 
                In the deepest spot of all, stands the castle of the Sea King.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Its walls are built of coral, and the long, gothic windows are 
                of<br>
                the clearest amber. The roof is formed of shells, that open and<br>
                close as the water flows over them. Their appearance is very<br>
                beautiful, for in each lies a glittering pearl, which would be 
                fit for<br>
                the diadem of a queen.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Sea King had been a widower for many years, and his aged<br>
                mother kept house for him. She was a very wise woman, and<br>
                exceedingly proud of her high birth; on that account she wore 
                twelve<br>
                oysters on her tail; while others, also of high rank, were only<br>
                allowed to wear six. She was, however, deserving of very great 
                praise, especially for her care of the little sea-princesses, 
                her<br>
                grand-daughters. They were six beautiful children; but the youngest<br>
                was the prettiest of them all; her skin was as clear and delicate 
                as a<br>
                rose-leaf, and her eyes as blue as the deepest sea; but, like 
                all<br>
                the others, she had no feet, and her body ended in a fish's tail.<br>
              </p>
              <p>All day long they played in the great halls of the castle, or 
                among<br>
                the living flowers that grew out of the walls. The large amber 
                windows<br>
                were open, and the fish swam in, just as the swallows fly into 
                our<br>
                houses when we open the windows, excepting that the fishes swam 
                up to the princesses, ate out of their hands, and allowed themselves 
                to be stroked. Outside the castle there was a beautiful garden, 
                in<br>
                which grew bright red and dark blue flowers, and blossoms like<br>
                flames of fire; the fruit glittered like gold, and the leaves 
                and<br>
                stems waved to and fro continually. The earth itself was the finest<br>
                sand, but blue as the flame of burning sulphur. Over everything 
                lay<br>
                a peculiar blue radiance, as if it were surrounded by the air 
                from<br>
                above, through which the blue sky shone, instead of the dark depths 
                of the sea. In calm weather the sun could be seen, looking like 
                a<br>
                purple flower, with the light streaming from the calyx. Each of 
                the<br>
                young princesses had a little plot of ground in the garden, where<br>
                she might dig and plant as she pleased. One arranged her flower-bed<br>
                into the form of a whale; another thought it better to make hers<br>
                like the figure of a little mermaid; but that of the youngest 
                was<br>
                round like the sun, and contained flowers as red as his rays at<br>
                sunset. She was a strange child, quiet and thoughtful; and while 
                her<br>
                sisters would be delighted with the wonderful things which they<br>
                obtained from the wrecks of vessels, she cared for nothing but 
                her<br>
                pretty red flowers, like the sun, excepting a beautiful marble 
                statue.<br>
                It was the representation of a handsome boy, carved out of pure<br>
                white stone, which had fallen to the bottom of the sea from a 
                wreck.<br>
              </p>
              <p>She planted by the statue a rose-colored weeping willow. It grew<br>
                splendidly, and very soon hung its fresh branches over the statue,<br>
                almost down to the blue sands. The shadow had a violet tint, and 
                waved to and fro like the branches; it seemed as if the crown 
                of the tree and the root were at play, and trying to kiss each 
                other. Nothing gave her so much pleasure as to hear about the 
                world above the sea. </p>
              <p>She made her old grandmother tell her all she knew of the ships 
                and of the towns, the people and the animals. To her it seemed 
                most wonderful and beautiful to hear that the flowers of the land 
                should have fragrance, and not those below the sea; that the trees 
                of the forest should be green; and that the fishes among the trees 
                could sing so sweetly, that it was quite a pleasure to hear them. 
                Her grandmother<br>
                called the little birds fishes, or she would not have understood<br>
                her; for she had never seen birds.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;When you have reached your fifteenth year,&quot; said the<br>
                grand-mother, &quot;you will have permission to rise up out of 
                the sea,<br>
                to sit on the rocks in the moonlight, while the great ships are<br>
                sailing by; and then you will see both forests and towns.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the following year, one of the sisters would be fifteen: but 
                as<br>
                each was a year younger than the other, the youngest would have 
                to<br>
                wait five years before her turn came to rise up from the bottom 
                of the<br>
                ocean, and see the earth as we do. However, each promised to tell<br>
                the others what she saw on her first visit, and what she thought 
                the<br>
                most beautiful; for their grandmother could not tell them enough;<br>
                there were so many things on which they wanted information. None 
                of them longed so much for her turn to come as the youngest, she 
                who had the longest time to wait, and who was so quiet and thoughtful.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Many nights she stood by the open window, looking up through 
                the<br>
                dark blue water, and watching the fish as they splashed about 
                with<br>
                their fins and tails. She could see the moon and stars shining<br>
                faintly; but through the water they looked larger than they do 
                to<br>
                our eyes. When something like a black cloud passed between her 
                and<br>
                them, she knew that it was either a whale swimming over her head, 
                or a ship full of human beings, who never imagined that a pretty 
                little<br>
                mermaid was standing beneath them, holding out her white hands 
                towards the keel of their ship.<br>
              </p>
              <p>As soon as the eldest was fifteen, she was allowed to rise to<br>
                the surface of the ocean. When she came back, she had hundreds 
                of<br>
                things to talk about; but the most beautiful, she said, was to 
                lie<br>
                in the moonlight, on a sandbank, in the quiet sea, near the coast, 
                and<br>
                to gaze on a large town nearby, where the lights were twinkling 
                like<br>
                hundreds of stars; to listen to the sounds of the music, the noise<br>
                of carriages, and the voices of human beings, and then to hear 
                the<br>
                merry bells peal out from the church steeples; and because she 
                could<br>
                not go near to all those wonderful things, she longed for them 
                more<br>
                than ever. Oh, did not the youngest sister listen eagerly to all 
                these<br>
                descriptions? and afterwards, when she stood at the open window<br>
                looking up through the dark blue water, she thought of the great 
                city,<br>
                with all its bustle and noise, and even fancied she could hear 
                the<br>
                sound of the church bells, down in the depths of the sea.<br>
                In another year the second sister received permission to rise 
                to<br>
                the surface of the water, and to swim about where she pleased. 
                She<br>
                rose just as the sun was setting, and this, she said, was the 
                most<br>
                beautiful sight of all. The whole sky looked like gold, while 
                violet<br>
                and rose-colored clouds, which she could not describe, floated 
                over<br>
                her; and, still more rapidly than the clouds, flew a large flock 
                of<br>
                wild swans towards the setting sun, looking like a long white 
                veil<br>
                across the sea. She also swam towards the sun; but it sunk into 
                the<br>
                waves, and the rosy tints faded from the clouds and from the sea.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The third sister's turn followed; she was the boldest of them 
                all,<br>
                and she swam up a broad river that emptied itself into the sea. 
                On the<br>
                banks she saw green hills covered with beautiful vines; palaces 
                and<br>
                castles peeped out from amid the proud trees of the forest; she<br>
                heard the birds singing, and the rays of the sun were so powerful 
                that<br>
                she was obliged often to dive down under the water to cool her 
                burning face. In a narrow creek she found a whole troop of little 
                human children, quite naked, and sporting about in the water; 
                she wanted to play with them, but they fled in a great fright; 
                and then a<br>
                little black animal came to the water; it was a dog, but she did 
                not<br>
                know that, for she had never before seen one. This animal barked 
                at<br>
                her so terribly that she became frightened, and rushed back to 
                the<br>
                open sea. But she said she should never forget the beautiful forest,<br>
                the green hills, and the pretty little children who could swim 
                in<br>
                the water, although they had not fish's tails.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The fourth sister was more timid; she remained in the midst of 
                the<br>
                sea, but she said it was quite as beautiful there as nearer the<br>
                land. She could see for so many miles around her, and the sky 
                above<br>
                looked like a bell of glass. She had seen the ships, but at such 
                a<br>
                great distance that they looked like sea-gulls. The dolphins sported<br>
                in the waves, and the great whales spouted water from their nostrils<br>
                till it seemed as if a hundred fountains were playing in every<br>
                direction.<br>
                The fifth sister's birthday occurred in the winter; so when her<br>
                turn came, she saw what the others had not seen the first time 
                they<br>
                went up. The sea looked quite green, and large icebergs were<br>
                floating about, each like a pearl, she said, but larger and loftier<br>
                than the churches built by men. They were of the most singular 
                shapes,<br>
                and glittered like diamonds. She had seated herself upon one of 
                the<br>
                largest, and let the wind play with her long hair, and she remarked<br>
                that all the ships sailed by rapidly, and steered as far away 
                as<br>
                they could from the iceberg, as if they were afraid of it. Towards<br>
                evening, as the sun went down, dark clouds covered the sky, the<br>
                thunder rolled and the lightning flashed, and the red light glowed<br>
                on the icebergs as they rocked and tossed on the heaving sea. 
                On all<br>
                the ships the sails were reefed with fear and trembling, while 
                she sat<br>
                calmly on the floating iceberg, watching the blue lightning, as 
                it<br>
                darted its forked flashes into the sea.<br>
              </p>
              <p>When first the sisters had permission to rise to the surface, 
                they<br>
                were each delighted with the new and beautiful sights they saw; 
                but<br>
                now, as grown-up girls, they could go when they pleased, and they<br>
                had become indifferent about it. They wished themselves back again<br>
                in the water, and after a month had passed they said it was much<br>
                more beautiful down below, and pleasanter to be at home. Yet often, 
                in the evening hours, the five sisters would twine their arms 
                round<br>
                each other, and rise to the surface, in a row. They had more beautiful<br>
                voices than any human being could have; and before the approach 
                of a storm, and when they expected a ship would be lost, they 
                swam before the vessel, and sang sweetly of the delights to be 
                found in the depths of the sea, and begging the sailors not to 
                fear if they sank to the bottom. But the sailors could not understand 
                the song, they took it for the howling of the storm. And these 
                things were never to be<br>
                beautiful for them; for if the ship sank, the men were drowned, 
                and<br>
                their dead bodies alone reached the palace of the Sea King.<br>
              </p>
              <p>When the sisters rose, arm-in-arm, through the water in this<br>
                way, their youngest sister would stand quite alone, looking after<br>
                them, ready to cry, only that the mermaids have no tears, and<br>
                therefore they suffer more. &quot;Oh, were I but fifteen years 
                old,&quot; said<br>
                she: &quot;I know that I shall love the world up there, and all 
                the<br>
                people who live in it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>At last she reached her fifteenth year. &quot;Well, now, you 
                are<br>
                grown up,&quot; said the old dowager, her grandmother; &quot;so 
                you must let<br>
                me adorn you like your other sisters;&quot; and she placed a wreath 
                of<br>
                white lilies in her hair, and every flower leaf was half a pearl. 
                Then<br>
                the old lady ordered eight great oysters to attach themselves 
                to the<br>
                tail of the princess to show her high rank.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But they hurt me so,&quot; said the little mermaid.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Pride must suffer pain,&quot; replied the old lady. Oh, 
                how gladly she<br>
                would have shaken off all this grandeur, and laid aside the heavy<br>
                wreath! The red flowers in her own garden would have suited her 
                much better, but she could not help herself: so she said, &quot;Farewell,&quot; 
                and rose as lightly as a bubble to the surface of the water. The 
                sun had just set as she raised her head above the waves; but the 
                clouds were tinted with crimson and gold, and through the glimmering 
                twilight beamed the evening star in all its beauty. The sea was 
                calm, and the air mild and fresh. A large ship, with three masts, 
                lay becalmed on the water, with only one sail set; for not a breeze 
                stiffed, and the sailors sat idle on deck or amongst the rigging. 
                There was music and song on board; and, as darkness came on, a 
                hundred colored lanterns were lighted, as if the flags of all 
                nations waved in the air. The little mermaid swam close to the 
                cabin windows; and now and then, as the waves lifted her up, she 
                could look in through clear glass window-panes, and see a number 
                of well-dressed people within. </p>
              <p>Among them was a young prince, the most beautiful of all, with 
                large black eyes; he was sixteen years of age, and his birthday 
                was being kept with much rejoicing. The sailors were dancing on 
                deck, but when the prince came out of the cabin, more than a hundred 
                rockets rose in<br>
                the air, making it as bright as day. The little mermaid was so<br>
                startled that she dived under water; and when she again stretched<br>
                out her head, it appeared as if all the stars of heaven were falling<br>
                around her, she had never seen such fireworks before. Great suns<br>
                spurted fire about, splendid fireflies flew into the blue air, 
                and<br>
                everything was reflected in the clear, calm sea beneath. The ship<br>
                itself was so brightly illuminated that all the people, and even 
                the<br>
                smallest rope, could be distinctly and plainly seen. And how<br>
                handsome the young prince looked, as he pressed the hands of all<br>
                present and smiled at them, while the music resounded through 
                the<br>
                clear night air.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was very late; yet the little mermaid could not take her eyes<br>
                from the ship, or from the beautiful prince. The colored lanterns<br>
                had been extinguished, no more rockets rose in the air, and the 
                cannon had ceased firing; but the sea became restless, and a moaning,<br>
                grumbling sound could be heard beneath the waves: still the little<br>
                mermaid remained by the cabin window, rocking up and down on the<br>
                water, which enabled her to look in. After a while, the sails 
                were<br>
                quickly unfurled, and the noble ship continued her passage; but 
                soon<br>
                the waves rose higher, heavy clouds darkened the sky, and lightning<br>
                appeared in the distance. A dreadful storm was approaching; once<br>
                more the sails were reefed, and the great ship pursued her flying<br>
                course over the raging sea. The waves rose mountains high, as 
                if<br>
                they would have overtopped the mast; but the ship dived like a 
                swan<br>
                between them, and then rose again on their lofty, foaming crests. 
                To<br>
                the little mermaid this appeared pleasant sport; not so to the<br>
                sailors. At length the ship groaned and creaked; the thick planks 
                gave<br>
                way under the lashing of the sea as it broke over the deck; the<br>
                mainmast snapped asunder like a reed; the ship lay over on her 
                side;<br>
                and the water rushed in. The little mermaid now perceived that 
                the<br>
                crew were in danger; even she herself was obliged to be careful 
                to<br>
                avoid the beams and planks of the wreck which lay scattered on 
                the<br>
                water. At one moment it was so pitch dark that she could not see 
                a<br>
                single object, but a flash of lightning revealed the whole scene;<br>
                she could see every one who had been on board excepting the prince;<br>
                when the ship parted, she had seen him sink into the deep waves, 
                and<br>
                she was glad, for she thought he would now be with her; and then 
                she<br>
                remembered that human beings could not live in the water, so that 
                when he got down to her father's palace he would be quite dead. 
                But he must not die. So she swam about among the beams and planks 
                which strewed the surface of the sea, forgetting that they could 
                crush her to pieces. Then she dived deeply under the dark waters, 
                rising and<br>
                falling with the waves, till at length she managed to reach the<br>
                young prince, who was fast losing the power of swimming in that 
                stormy sea. His limbs were failing him, his beautiful eyes were 
                closed, and he would have died had not the little mermaid come 
                to his<br>
                assistance. She held his head above the water, and let the waves 
                drift<br>
                them where they would.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the morning the storm had ceased; but of the ship not a<br>
                single fragment could be seen. The sun rose up red and glowing 
                from<br>
                the water, and its beams brought back the hue of health to the<br>
                prince's cheeks; but his eyes remained closed. The mermaid kissed<br>
                his high, smooth forehead, and stroked back his wet hair; he seemed 
                to her like the marble statue in her little garden, and she kissed 
                him<br>
                again, and wished that he might live. Presently they came in sight<br>
                of land; she saw lofty blue mountains, on which the white snow<br>
                rested as if a flock of swans were lying upon them. Near the coast<br>
                were beautiful green forests, and close by stood a large building,<br>
                whether a church or a convent she could not tell. Orange and citron<br>
                trees grew in the garden, and before the door stood lofty palms. 
                The<br>
                sea here formed a little bay, in which the water was quite still,<br>
                but very deep; so she swam with the handsome prince to the beach,<br>
                which was covered with fine, white sand, and there she laid him 
                in the<br>
                warm sunshine, taking care to raise his head higher than his body.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then bells sounded in the large white building, and a number 
                of<br>
                young girls came into the garden. The little mermaid swam out<br>
                farther from the shore and placed herself between some high rocks 
                that rose out of the water; then she covered her head and neck 
                with the foam of the sea so that her little face might not be 
                seen, and watched to see what would become of the poor prince. 
                She did not wait long before she saw a young girl approach the 
                spot where he lay. </p>
              <p>She seemed frightened at first, but only for a moment; then she 
                fetched a number of people, and the mermaid saw that the prince 
                came to life again, and smiled upon those who stood round him. 
                But to her he sent no smile; he knew not that she had saved him. 
                This made her very unhappy, and when he was led away into the 
                great building, she dived down sorrowfully into the water, and 
                returned to her father's castle. She had always been silent and 
                thoughtful, and now she was more so than ever. Her sisters asked 
                her what she had seen during her first visit to the surface of 
                the water; but she would tell them nothing. Many an evening and 
                morning did she rise to the place where she had left the prince. 
                She saw the fruits in the garden ripen till they were gathered, 
                the snow on the tops of the mountains melt away; but she never 
                saw the prince, and therefore she returned home, always more sorrowful 
                than before. It was her only comfort to sit in her own little 
                garden, and fling her arm round the beautiful marble statue which 
                was like the prince; but she gave up tending her flowers, and 
                they grew in wild confusion over the paths, twining their long 
                leaves and stems round the branches of the trees, so that the 
                whole place became dark and gloomy. At length she could bear it 
                no longer, and told one of her sisters all about it. Then the 
                others heard the secret, and very soon it became known to two 
                mermaids whose intimate friend happened to know who the prince 
                was. She had also seen the festival on board ship, and she told 
                them where the prince came from, and where his palace stood.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Come, little sister,&quot; said the other princesses; then 
                they<br>
                entwined their arms and rose up in a long row to the surface of 
                the<br>
                water, close by the spot where they knew the prince's palace stood. 
                It<br>
                was built of bright yellow shining stone, with long flights of<br>
                marble steps, one of which reached quite down to the sea. Splendid<br>
                gilded cupolas rose over the roof, and between the pillars that<br>
                surrounded the whole building stood life-like statues of marble.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Through the clear crystal of the lofty windows could be seen 
                noble<br>
                rooms, with costly silk curtains and hangings of tapestry; while 
                the<br>
                walls were covered with beautiful paintings which were a pleasure 
                to<br>
                look at. In the centre of the largest saloon a fountain threw 
                its<br>
                sparkling jets high up into the glass cupola of the ceiling, through<br>
                which the sun shone down upon the water and upon the beautiful<br>
                plants growing round the basin of the fountain. Now that she knew<br>
                where he lived, she spent many an evening and many a night on 
                the<br>
                water near the palace. She would swim much nearer the shore than 
                any of the others ventured to do; indeed once she went quite up 
                the narrow channel under the marble balcony, which threw a broad 
                shadow on the water. Here she would sit and watch the young prince, 
                who thought himself quite alone in the bright moonlight. She saw 
                him many times of an evening sailing in a pleasant boat, with 
                music playing and flags waving. She peeped out from among the 
                green rushes, and if the wind caught her long silvery-white veil, 
                those who saw it believed it to be a swan, spreading out its wings. 
                On many a night, too, when the fishermen, with their torches, 
                were out at sea, she heard them relate so many good things about 
                the doings of the young prince, that she was glad she had saved 
                his life when he had been tossed about half-dead on the waves. 
                And she remembered that his head had rested on her bosom, and 
                how heartily she had kissed him; but he knew nothing of all this, 
                and could not even dream of her. She grew more and more fond of 
                human beings, and wished more and more to be able to wander about 
                with those whose world seemed to be so much larger than her own.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They could fly over the sea in ships, and mount the high hills 
                which<br>
                were far above the clouds; and the lands they possessed, their 
                woods<br>
                and their fields, stretched far away beyond the reach of her sight.<br>
              </p>
              <p>There was so much that she wished to know, and her sisters were 
                unable to answer all her questions. Then she applied to her old<br>
                grandmother, who knew all about the upper world, which she very<br>
                rightly called the lands above the sea.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;If human beings are not drowned,&quot; asked the little 
                mermaid,<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;can they live forever? do they never die as we do here 
                in the sea?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied the old lady, &quot;they must also die, 
                and their term<br>
                of life is even shorter than ours. We sometimes live to three<br>
                hundred years, but when we cease to exist here we only become 
                the foam on the surface of the water, and we have not even a grave 
                down here of those we love. We have not immortal souls, we shall 
                never live again; but, like the green sea-weed, when once it has 
                been cut off, we can never flourish more. Human beings, on the 
                contrary, have a soul which lives forever, lives after the body 
                has been turned to dust.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It rises up through the clear, pure air beyond the glittering 
                stars.<br>
                As we rise out of the water, and behold all the land of the earth,<br>
                so do they rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall 
                never<br>
                see.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Why have not we an immortal soul?&quot; asked the little 
                mermaid<br>
                mournfully; &quot;I would give gladly all the hundreds of years 
                that I have<br>
                to live, to be a human being only for one day, and to have the 
                hope of<br>
                knowing the happiness of that glorious world above the stars.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You must not think of that,&quot; said the old woman; &quot;we 
                feel<br>
                ourselves to be much happier and much better off than human beings.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;So I shall die,&quot; said the little mermaid, &quot;and 
                as the foam of the<br>
                sea I shall be driven about never again to hear the music of the<br>
                waves, or to see the pretty flowers nor the red sun. Is there 
                anything<br>
                I can do to win an immortal soul?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No,&quot; said the old woman, &quot;unless a man were to 
                love you so much<br>
                that you were more to him than his father or mother; and if all 
                his<br>
                thoughts and all his love were fixed upon you, and the priest 
                placed<br>
                his right hand in yours, and he promised to be true to you here 
                and<br>
                hereafter, then his soul would glide into your body and you would<br>
                obtain a share in the future happiness of mankind. He would give 
                a<br>
                soul to you and retain his own as well; but this can never happen.<br>
                Your fish's tail, which amongst us is considered so beautiful, 
                is<br>
                thought on earth to be quite ugly; they do not know any better, 
                and<br>
                they think it necessary to have two stout props, which they call 
                legs,<br>
                in order to be handsome.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the little mermaid sighed, and looked sorrowfully at her<br>
                fish's tail. &quot;Let us be happy,&quot; said the old lady, &quot;and 
                dart and<br>
                spring about during the three hundred years that we have to live,<br>
                which is really quite long enough; after that we can rest ourselves<br>
                all the better. This evening we are going to have a court ball.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>It is one of those splendid sights which we can never see on<br>
                earth. The walls and the ceiling of the large ball-room were of 
                thick,<br>
                but transparent crystal. May hundreds of colossal shells, some 
                of a<br>
                deep red, others of a grass green, stood on each side in rows, 
                with<br>
                blue fire in them, which lighted up the whole saloon, and shone<br>
                through the walls, so that the sea was also illuminated. Innumerable<br>
                fishes, great and small, swam past the crystal walls; on some 
                of<br>
                them the scales glowed with a purple brilliancy, and on others 
                they<br>
                shone like silver and gold. Through the halls flowed a broad stream,<br>
                and in it danced the mermen and the mermaids to the music of their 
                own sweet singing. No one on earth has such a lovely voice as 
                theirs.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The little mermaid sang more sweetly than them all. The whole 
                court<br>
                applauded her with hands and tails; and for a moment her heart 
                felt<br>
                quite gay, for she knew she had the loveliest voice of any on 
                earth or<br>
                in the sea. But she soon thought again of the world above her, 
                for she<br>
                could not forget the charming prince, nor her sorrow that she 
                had<br>
                not an immortal soul like his; therefore she crept away silently 
                out<br>
                of her father's palace, and while everything within was gladness 
                and<br>
                song, she sat in her own little garden sorrowful and alone. Then 
                she<br>
                heard the bugle sounding through the water, and thought- &quot;He 
                is<br>
                certainly sailing above, he on whom my wishes depend, and in whose<br>
                hands I should like to place the happiness of my life. I will<br>
                venture all for him, and to win an immortal soul, while my sisters 
                are<br>
                dancing in my father's palace, I will go to the sea witch, of 
                whom I<br>
                have always been so much afraid, but she can give me counsel and<br>
                help.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And then the little mermaid went out from her garden, and took 
                the<br>
                road to the foaming whirlpools, behind which the sorceress lived.<br>
                She had never been that way before: neither flowers nor grass 
                grew<br>
                there; nothing but bare, gray, sandy ground stretched out to the<br>
                whirlpool, where the water, like foaming mill-wheels, whirled 
                round<br>
                everything that it seized, and cast it into the fathomless deep.<br>
                Through the midst of these crushing whirlpools the little mermaid<br>
                was obliged to pass, to reach the dominions of the sea witch; 
                and also for a long distance the only road lay right across a 
                quantity of warm, bubbling mire, called by the witch her turfmoor. 
                Beyond this stood her house, in the centre of a strange forest, 
                in which all the trees and flowers were polypi, half animals and 
                half plants; they looked like<br>
                serpents with a hundred heads growing out of the ground. The<br>
                branches were long slimy arms, with fingers like flexible worms,<br>
                moving limb after limb from the root to the top. All that could 
                be<br>
                reached in the sea they seized upon, and held fast, so that it 
                never<br>
                escaped from their clutches. The little mermaid was so alarmed 
                at what she saw, that she stood still, and her heart beat with 
                fear, and she was very nearly turning back; but she thought of 
                the prince, and of the human soul for which she longed, and her 
                courage returned. She fastened her long flowing hair round her 
                head, so that the polypi<br>
                might not seize hold of it. She laid her hands together across 
                her<br>
                bosom, and then she darted forward as a fish shoots through the 
                water, between the supple arms and fingers of the ugly polypi, 
                which were stretched out on each side of her. She saw that each 
                held in its grasp something it had seized with its numerous little 
                arms, as if they were iron bands. The white skeletons of human 
                beings who had perished at sea, and had sunk down into the deep 
                waters, skeletons of land animals, oars, rudders, and chests of 
                ships were lying tightly grasped by their clinging arms; even 
                a little mermaid, whom they had caught and strangled; and this 
                seemed the most shocking of all to the<br>
                little princess.<br>
              </p>
              <p>She now came to a space of marshy ground in the wood, where large,<br>
                fat water-snakes were rolling in the mire, and showing their ugly,<br>
                drab-colored bodies. In the midst of this spot stood a house, 
                built<br>
                with the bones of shipwrecked human beings. There sat the sea 
                witch,<br>
                allowing a toad to eat from her mouth, just as people sometimes 
                feed a canary with a piece of sugar. She called the ugly water-snakes 
                her<br>
                little chickens, and allowed them to crawl all over her bosom.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I know what you want,&quot; said the sea witch; &quot;it 
                is very stupid<br>
                of you, but you shall have your way, and it will bring you to<br>
                sorrow, my pretty princess. You want to get rid of your fish's 
                tail,<br>
                and to have two supports instead of it, like human beings on earth, 
                so<br>
                that the young prince may fall in love with you, and that you 
                may have<br>
                an immortal soul.&quot; And then the witch laughed so loud and<br>
                disgustingly, that the toad and the snakes fell to the ground, 
                and lay<br>
                there wriggling about. &quot;You are but just in time,&quot; said 
                the witch;<br>
                &quot;for after sunrise to-morrow I should not be able to help 
                you till the<br>
                end of another year. I will prepare a draught for you, with which<br>
                you must swim to land tomorrow before sunrise, and sit down on 
                the<br>
                shore and drink it. Your tail will then disappear, and shrink 
                up<br>
                into what mankind calls legs, and you will feel great pain, as 
                if a<br>
                sword were passing through you. But all who see you will say that<br>
                you are the prettiest little human being they ever saw. You will 
                still<br>
                have the same floating gracefulness of movement, and no dancer 
                will<br>
                ever tread so lightly; but at every step you take it will feel 
                as if<br>
                you were treading upon sharp knives, and that the blood must flow.<br>
                If you will bear all this, I will help you.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, I will,&quot; said the little princess in a trembling 
                voice, as<br>
                she thought of the prince and the immortal soul.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But think again,&quot; said the witch; &quot;for when once 
                your shape has<br>
                become like a human being, you can no more be a mermaid. You will<br>
                never return through the water to your sisters, or to your father's<br>
                palace again; and if you do not win the love of the prince, so 
                that he<br>
                is willing to forget his father and mother for your sake, and 
                to<br>
                love you with his whole soul, and allow the priest to join your<br>
                hands that you may be man and wife, then you will never have an<br>
                immortal soul. The first morning after he marries another your 
                heart<br>
                will break, and you will become foam on the crest of the waves.&quot;<br>
                &quot;I will do it,&quot; said the little mermaid, and she became 
                pale as<br>
                death.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But I must be paid also,&quot; said the witch, &quot;and 
                it is not a trifle<br>
                that I ask. You have the sweetest voice of any who dwell here 
                in the<br>
                depths of the sea, and you believe that you will be able to charm<br>
                the prince with it also, but this voice you must give to me; the<br>
                best thing you possess will I have for the price of my draught. 
                My own blood must be mixed with it, that it may be as sharp as 
                a two-edged sword.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But if you take away my voice,&quot; said the little mermaid, 
                &quot;what is<br>
                left for me?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Your beautiful form, your graceful walk, and your expressive<br>
                eyes; surely with these you can enchain a man's heart. Well, have<br>
                you lost your courage? Put out your little tongue that I may cut 
                it<br>
                off as my payment; then you shall have the powerful draught.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It shall be,&quot; said the little mermaid. Then the witch 
                placed her cauldron on the fire, to prepare the magic draught.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Cleanliness is a good thing,&quot; said she, scouring the 
                vessel<br>
                with snakes, which she had tied together in a large knot; then 
                she<br>
                pricked herself in the breast, and let the black blood drop into 
                it.<br>
                The steam that rose formed itself into such horrible shapes that 
                no<br>
                one could look at them without fear. Every moment the witch threw<br>
                something else into the vessel, and when it began to boil, the 
                sound<br>
                was like the weeping of a crocodile. When at last the magic draught<br>
                was ready, it looked like the clearest water. &quot;There it is 
                for you,&quot;<br>
                said the witch. Then she cut off the mermaid's tongue, so that 
                she<br>
                became dumb, and would never again speak or sing. &quot;If the 
                polypi<br>
                should seize hold of you as you return through the wood,&quot; 
                said the<br>
                witch, &quot;throw over them a few drops of the potion, and their 
                fingers<br>
                will be torn into a thousand pieces.&quot; But the little mermaid 
                had no<br>
                occasion to do this, for the polypi sprang back in terror when 
                they<br>
                caught sight of the glittering draught, which shone in her hand 
                like a<br>
                twinkling star.<br>
              </p>
              <p>So she passed quickly through the wood and the marsh, and<br>
                between the rushing whirlpools. She saw that in her father's palace<br>
                the torches in the ballroom were extinguished, and all within<br>
                asleep; but she did not venture to go in to them, for now she 
                was dumb and going to leave them forever, she felt as if her heart 
                would break.<br>
              </p>
              <p>She stole into the garden, took a flower from the flower-beds 
                of<br>
                each of her sisters, kissed her hand a thousand times towards 
                the<br>
                palace, and then rose up through the dark blue waters. The sun 
                had not risen when she came in sight of the prince's palace, and 
                approached the beautiful marble steps, but the moon shone clear 
                and bright.</p>
              <p> Then the little mermaid drank the magic draught, and it seemed 
                as if a<br>
                two-edged sword went through her delicate body: she fell into 
                a swoon, and lay like one dead. When the sun arose and shone over 
                the sea, she recovered, and felt a sharp pain; but just before 
                her stood the<br>
                handsome young prince. He fixed his coal-black eyes upon her so<br>
                earnestly that she cast down her own, and then became aware that 
                her<br>
                fish's tail was gone, and that she had as pretty a pair of white<br>
                legs and tiny feet as any little maiden could have; but she had 
                no<br>
                clothes, so she wrapped herself in her long, thick hair. The prince<br>
                asked her who she was, and where she came from, and she looked 
                at<br>
                him mildly and sorrowfully with her deep blue eyes; but she could<br>
                not speak. Every step she took was as the witch had said it would<br>
                be, she felt as if treading upon the points of needles or sharp<br>
                knives; but she bore it willingly, and stepped as lightly by the<br>
                prince's side as a soap-bubble, so that he and all who saw her<br>
                wondered at her graceful-swaying movements. She was very soon<br>
                arrayed in costly robes of silk and muslin, and was the most beautiful<br>
                creature in the palace; but she was dumb, and could neither speak<br>
                nor sing.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Beautiful female slaves, dressed in silk and gold, stepped forward<br>
                and sang before the prince and his royal parents: one sang better 
                than<br>
                all the others, and the prince clapped his hands and smiled at 
                her.<br>
                This was great sorrow to the little mermaid; she knew how much 
                more sweetly she herself could sing once, and she thought, &quot;Oh 
                if he<br>
                could only know that! I have given away my voice forever, to be 
                with<br>
                him.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The slaves next performed some pretty fairy-like dances, to the<br>
                sound of beautiful music. Then the little mermaid raised her lovely<br>
                white arms, stood on the tips of her toes, and glided over the<br>
                floor, and danced as no one yet had been able to dance. At each 
                moment her beauty became more revealed, and her expressive eyes 
                appealed more directly to the heart than the songs of the slaves. 
                Every one was enchanted, especially the prince, who called her 
                his little foundling; and she danced again quite readily, to please 
                him, though each time her foot touched the floor it seemed as 
                if she trod on sharp knives.&quot; </p>
              <p>The prince said she should remain with him always, and she<br>
                received permission to sleep at his door, on a velvet cushion. 
                He<br>
                had a page's dress made for her, that she might accompany him 
                on<br>
                horseback. They rode together through the sweet-scented woods, 
                where the green boughs touched their shoulders, and the little 
                birds sang among the fresh leaves. She climbed with the prince 
                to the tops of high mountains; and although her tender feet bled 
                so that even her<br>
                steps were marked, she only laughed, and followed him till they<br>
                could see the clouds beneath them looking like a flock of birds<br>
                travelling to distant lands. While at the prince's palace, and 
                when<br>
                all the household were asleep, she would go and sit on the broad<br>
                marble steps; for it eased her burning feet to bathe them in the<br>
                cold sea-water; and then she thought of all those below in the 
                deep.<br>
                Once during the night her sisters came up arm-in-arm, singing<br>
                sorrowfully, as they floated on the water. She beckoned to them, 
                and<br>
                then they recognized her, and told her how she had grieved them. 
              </p>
              <p>After that, they came to the same place every night; and once 
                she saw in the distance her old grandmother, who had not been 
                to the surface of the sea for many years, and the old Sea King, 
                her father, with his crown on his head. They stretched out their 
                hands towards her, but they did not venture so near the land as 
                her sisters did.<br>
              </p>
              <p>As the days passed, she loved the prince more fondly, and he 
                loved<br>
                her as he would love a little child, but it never came into his 
                head<br>
                to make her his wife; yet, unless he married her, she could not<br>
                receive an immortal soul; and, on the morning after his marriage<br>
                with another, she would dissolve into the foam of the sea.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Do you not love me the best of them all?&quot; the eyes 
                of the<br>
                little mermaid seemed to say, when he took her in his arms, and 
                kissed her fair forehead.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, you are dear to me,&quot; said the prince; &quot;for 
                you have the best<br>
                heart, and you are the most devoted to me; you are like a young 
                maiden whom I once saw, but whom I shall never meet again. I was 
                in a ship that was wrecked, and the waves cast me ashore near 
                a holy temple, where several young maidens performed the service. 
                The youngest of them found me on the shore, and saved my life. 
                I saw her but twice, and she is the only one in the world whom 
                I could love; but you are like her, and you have almost driven 
                her image out of my mind. She belongs to the holy temple, and 
                my good fortune has sent you to me instead of her; and we will 
                never part.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ah, he knows not that it was I who saved his life,&quot; 
                thought the<br>
                little mermaid. &quot;I carried him over the sea to the wood where 
                the<br>
                temple stands: I sat beneath the foam, and watched till the human<br>
                beings came to help him. I saw the pretty maiden that he loves<br>
                better than he loves me;&quot; and the mermaid sighed deeply, 
                but she could not shed tears. &quot;He says the maiden belongs 
                to the holy temple,<br>
                therefore she will never return to the world. They will meet no<br>
                more: while I am by his side, and see him every day. I will take<br>
                care of him, and love him, and give up my life for his sake.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Very soon it was said that the prince must marry, and that the<br>
                beautiful daughter of a neighboring king would be his wife, for 
                a fine<br>
                ship was being fitted out. Although the prince gave out that he 
                merely<br>
                intended to pay a visit to the king, it was generally supposed 
                that he<br>
                really went to see his daughter. A great company were to go with<br>
                him. The little mermaid smiled, and shook her head. She knew the<br>
                prince's thoughts better than any of the others.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I must travel,&quot; he had said to her; &quot;I must see 
                this beautiful<br>
                princess; my parents desire it; but they will not oblige me to 
                bring<br>
                her home as my bride. I cannot love her; she is not like the beautiful<br>
                maiden in the temple, whom you resemble. If I were forced to choose<br>
                a bride, I would rather choose you, my dumb foundling, with those<br>
                expressive eyes.&quot; And then he kissed her rosy mouth, played 
                with her<br>
                long waving hair, and laid his head on her heart, while she dreamed 
                of<br>
                human happiness and an immortal soul. &quot;You are not afraid 
                of the<br>
                sea, my dumb child,&quot; said he, as they stood on the deck of 
                the noble<br>
                ship which was to carry them to the country of the neighboring 
                king.<br>
                And then he told her of storm and of calm, of strange fishes in 
                the<br>
                deep beneath them, and of what the divers had seen there; and 
                she<br>
                smiled at his descriptions, for she knew better than any one what<br>
                wonders were at the bottom of the sea.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the moonlight, when all on board were asleep, excepting the 
                man<br>
                at the helm, who was steering, she sat on the deck, gazing down<br>
                through the clear water. She thought she could distinguish her<br>
                father's castle, and upon it her aged grandmother, with the silver<br>
                crown on her head, looking through the rushing tide at the keel 
                of the<br>
                vessel. Then her sisters came up on the waves, and gazed at her<br>
                mournfully, wringing their white hands. She beckoned to them, 
                and<br>
                smiled, and wanted to tell them how happy and well off she was; 
                but<br>
                the cabin-boy approached, and when her sisters dived down he thought 
                it was only the foam of the sea which he saw.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The next morning the ship sailed into the harbor of a beautiful<br>
                town belonging to the king whom the prince was going to visit. 
                The<br>
                church bells were ringing, and from the high towers sounded a 
                flourish of trumpets; and soldiers, with flying colors and glittering 
                bayonets, lined the rocks through which they passed. Every day 
                was a festival; balls and entertainments followed one another.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the princess had not yet appeared. People said that she was<br>
                being brought up and educated in a religious house, where she 
                was<br>
                learning every royal virtue. At last she came. Then the little<br>
                mermaid, who was very anxious to see whether she was really beautiful, 
                was obliged to acknowledge that she had never seen a more perfect 
                vision of beauty. Her skin was delicately fair, and beneath her 
                long dark eye-lashes her laughing blue eyes shone with truth and 
                purity.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It was you,&quot; said the prince, &quot;who saved my life 
                when I lay<br>
                dead on the beach,&quot; and he folded his blushing bride in his 
                arms. &quot;Oh, I am too happy,&quot; said he to the little mermaid; 
                &quot;my fondest hopes are all fulfilled. You will rejoice at 
                my happiness; for your devotion to me is great and sincere.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The little mermaid kissed his hand, and felt as if her heart<br>
                were already broken. His wedding morning would bring death to 
                her, and she would change into the foam of the sea. All the church 
                bells<br>
                rung, and the heralds rode about the town proclaiming the betrothal.<br>
                Perfumed oil was burning in costly silver lamps on every altar. 
                The<br>
                priests waved the censers, while the bride and bridegroom joined 
                their<br>
                hands and received the blessing of the bishop. The little mermaid,<br>
                dressed in silk and gold, held up the bride's train; but her ears<br>
                heard nothing of the festive music, and her eyes saw not the holy<br>
                ceremony; she thought of the night of death which was coming to 
                her,<br>
                and of all she had lost in the world. On the same evening the 
                bride<br>
                and bridegroom went on board ship; cannons were roaring, flags 
                waving, and in the centre of the ship a costly tent of purple 
                and gold had been erected. It contained elegant couches, for the 
                reception of the bridal pair during the night. The ship, with 
                swelling sails and a<br>
                favorable wind, glided away smoothly and lightly over the calm 
                sea.<br>
                When it grew dark a number of colored lamps were lit, and the<br>
                sailors danced merrily on the deck. The little mermaid could not<br>
                help thinking of her first rising out of the sea, when she had 
                seen<br>
                similar festivities and joys; and she joined in the dance, poised<br>
                herself in the air as a swallow when he pursues his prey, and 
                all<br>
                present cheered her with wonder. She had never danced so elegantly<br>
                before. Her tender feet felt as if cut with sharp knives, but 
                she<br>
                cared not for it; a sharper pang had pierced through her heart. 
                She<br>
                knew this was the last evening she should ever see the prince, 
                for<br>
                whom she had forsaken her kindred and her home; she had given 
                up her beautiful voice, and suffered unheard-of pain daily for 
                him, while<br>
                he knew nothing of it. This was the last evening that she would<br>
                breathe the same air with him, or gaze on the starry sky and the<br>
                deep sea; an eternal night, without a thought or a dream, awaited 
                her:<br>
                she had no soul and now she could never win one. All was joy and<br>
                gayety on board ship till long after midnight; she laughed and<br>
                danced with the rest, while the thoughts of death were in her 
                heart.<br>
                The prince kissed his beautiful bride, while she played with his 
                raven<br>
                hair, till they went arm-in-arm to rest in the splendid tent. 
                Then all<br>
                became still on board the ship; the helmsman, alone awake, stood 
                at<br>
                the helm. The little mermaid leaned her white arms on the edge 
                of<br>
                the vessel, and looked towards the east for the first blush of<br>
                morning, for that first ray of dawn that would bring her death. 
                She<br>
                saw her sisters rising out of the flood: they were as pale as 
                herself;<br>
                but their long beautiful hair waved no more in the wind, and had<br>
                been cut off.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We have given our hair to the witch,&quot; said they, &quot;to 
                obtain<br>
                help for you, that you may not die to-night. She has given us 
                a knife:<br>
                here it is, see it is very sharp. Before the sun rises you must 
                plunge<br>
                it into the heart of the prince; when the warm blood falls upon 
                your<br>
                feet they will grow together again, and form into a fish's tail, 
                and<br>
                you will be once more a mermaid, and return to us to live out 
                your<br>
                three hundred years before you die and change into the salt sea<br>
                foam. Haste, then; he or you must die before sunrise. Our old<br>
                grandmother moans so for you, that her white hair is falling off<br>
                from sorrow, as ours fell under the witch's scissors. Kill the<br>
                prince and come back; hasten: do you not see the first red streaks<br>
                in the sky? In a few minutes the sun will rise, and you must die.&quot; 
                And<br>
                then they sighed deeply and mournfully, and sank down beneath 
                the<br>
                waves.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The little mermaid drew back the crimson curtain of the tent,<br>
                and beheld the fair bride with her head resting on the prince's<br>
                breast. She bent down and kissed his fair brow, then looked at 
                the sky on which the rosy dawn grew brighter and brighter; then 
                she glanced at the sharp knife, and again fixed her eyes on the 
                prince, who whispered the name of his bride in his dreams. She 
                was in his thoughts, and the knife trembled in the hand of the 
                little mermaid: then she flung it far away from her into the waves; 
                the water turned red where it fell, and the drops that spurted 
                up looked like blood. She cast one more lingering, half-fainting 
                glance at the prince, and then threw herself from the ship into 
                the sea, and thought her body was<br>
                dissolving into foam. The sun rose above the waves, and his warm<br>
                rays fell on the cold foam of the little mermaid, who did not 
                feel<br>
                as if she were dying. She saw the bright sun, and all around her<br>
                floated hundreds of transparent beautiful beings; she could see<br>
                through them the white sails of the ship, and the red clouds in 
                the<br>
                sky; their speech was melodious, but too ethereal to be heard 
                by<br>
                mortal ears, as they were also unseen by mortal eyes. The little<br>
                mermaid perceived that she had a body like theirs, and that she<br>
                continued to rise higher and higher out of the foam. &quot;Where 
                am I?&quot;<br>
                asked she, and her voice sounded ethereal, as the voice of those 
                who<br>
                were with her; no earthly music could imitate it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Among the daughters of the air,&quot; answered one of them. 
                &quot;A mermaid<br>
                has not an immortal soul, nor can she obtain one unless she wins 
                the<br>
                love of a human being. On the power of another hangs her eternal<br>
                destiny. But the daughters of the air, although they do not possess 
                an<br>
                immortal soul, can, by their good deeds, procure one for themselves.<br>
                We fly to warm countries, and cool the sultry air that destroys<br>
                mankind with the pestilence. We carry the perfume of the flowers 
                to<br>
                spread health and restoration. After we have striven for three 
                hundred<br>
                years to all the good in our power, we receive an immortal soul 
                and<br>
                take part in the happiness of mankind. You, poor little mermaid,<br>
                have tried with your whole heart to do as we are doing; you have<br>
                suffered and endured and raised yourself to the spirit-world by 
                your<br>
                good deeds; and now, by striving for three hundred years in the 
                same<br>
                way, you may obtain an immortal soul.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The little mermaid lifted her glorified eyes towards the sun,<br>
                and felt them, for the first time, filling with tears. On the 
                ship, in<br>
                which she had left the prince, there were life and noise; she 
                saw<br>
                him and his beautiful bride searching for her; sorrowfully they<br>
                gazed at the pearly foam, as if they knew she had thrown herself<br>
                into the waves. Unseen she kissed the forehead of her bride, and<br>
                fanned the prince, and then mounted with the other children of 
                the air<br>
                to a rosy cloud that floated through the aether.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;After three hundred years, thus shall we float into the 
                kingdom<br>
                of heaven,&quot; said she. &quot;And we may even get there sooner,&quot; 
                whispered<br>
                one of her companions. &quot;Unseen we can enter the houses of 
                men, where there are children, and for every day on which we find 
                a good child, who is the joy of his parents and deserves their 
                love, our time of probation is shortened. The child does not know, 
                when we fly through the room, that we smile with joy at his good 
                conduct, for we can count one year less of our three hundred years. 
                But when we see a naughty or a wicked child, we shed tears of 
                sorrow, and for every tear a day is added to our time of trial!&quot;</p>

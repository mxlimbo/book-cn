                FRIENDSHIP</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THE little dwelling in which we lived was of clay, but the<br>
                door-posts were columns of fluted marble, found near the spot 
                on which it stood. The roof sloped nearly to the ground. It was 
                at this time dark, brown, and ugly, but had originally been formed 
                of blooming olive and laurel branches, brought from beyond the 
                mountains. The house was situated in a narrow gorge, whose rocky 
                walls rose to a perpendicular height, naked and black, while round 
                their summits clouds often hung, looking like white living figures. 
                Not a singing bird was ever heard there, neither did men dance 
                to the sound of the pipe. The spot was one sacred to olden times; 
                even its name recalled a memory of the days when it was called 
                &quot;Delphi.&quot; </p>
              <p>Then the summits of the dark, sacred mountains were covered with 
                snow, and the highest, mount Parnassus, glowed longest in the 
                red evening light. The brook which rolled from it near our house, 
                was also sacred. How well I can remember every spot in that deep, 
                sacred solitude! A fire had been kindled in the midst of the hut, 
                and while the hot ashes lay there red and glowing, the bread was 
                baked in them. At times the snow would be piled so high around 
                our hut as almost to hide it, and then my mother appeared most 
                cheerful. She would hold my head between her hands, and sing the 
                songs she never sang at other times, for the Turks, our masters, 
                would not allow it. She sang,-<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;On the summit of mount Olympus, in a forest of dwarf firs, 
                lay an<br>
                old stag. His eyes were heavy with tears, and glittering with 
                colors<br>
                like dewdrops; and there came by a roebuck, and said, 'What ailest<br>
                thee, that thou weepest blue and red tears?' And the stag answered,<br>
                'The Turk has come to our city; he has wild dogs for the chase, 
                a<br>
                goodly pack.' 'I will drive them away across the islands!' cried 
                the<br>
                young roebuck; 'I will drive them away across the islands into 
                the<br>
                deep sea.' But before evening the roebuck was slain, and before<br>
                night the hunted stag was dead.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And when my mother sang thus, her eyes would become moist; and<br>
                on the long eyelashes were tears, but she concealed them and watched 
                the black bread baking in the ashes. Then I would clench my fist, 
                and cry, &quot;We will kill these Turks!&quot; But she repeated 
                the words of the song, &quot;I will drive them across the islands 
                to the deep sea; but<br>
                before evening came the roebuck was slain, and before the night 
                the<br>
                hunted stag was dead.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>We had been lonely in our hut for several days and nights when<br>
                my father came home. I knew he would bring me some shells from 
                the gulf of Lepanto, or perhaps a knife with a shining blade. 
                This time he brought, under his sheep-skin cloak, a little child, 
                a little<br>
                half-naked girl. She was wrapped in a fur; but when this was taken<br>
                off, and she lay in my mother's lap, three silver coins were found<br>
                fastened in her dark hair; they were all her possessions. My father<br>
                told us that the child's parents had been killed by the Turks, 
                and<br>
                he talked so much about them that I dreamed of Turks all night. 
                He<br>
                himself had been wounded, and my mother bound up his arm. It was 
                a deep wound, and the thick sheep-skin cloak was stiff with congealed 
                blood. The little maiden was to be my sister. How pretty and bright 
                she looked: even my mother's eyes were not more gentle than hers.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Anastasia, as she was called, was to be my sister, because her<br>
                father had been united to mine by an old custom, which we still<br>
                follow. They had sworn brotherhood in their youth, and the most<br>
                beautiful and virtuous maiden in the neighborhood was chosen to<br>
                perform the act of consecration upon this bond of friendship. 
                So now this little girl was my sister. She sat in my lap, and 
                I brought her<br>
                flowers, and feathers from the birds of the mountain. We drank<br>
                together of the waters of Parnassus, and dwelt for many years<br>
                beneath the laurel roof of the hut, while, winter after winter, 
                my<br>
                mother sang her song of the stag who shed red tears. But as yet 
                I<br>
                did not understand that the sorrows of my own countrymen were 
                mirrored in those tears.<br>
              </p>
              <p>One day there came to our hut Franks, men from a far country,<br>
                whose dress was different to ours. They had tents and beds with<br>
                them, carried by horses; and they were accompanied by more than 
                twenty Turks, all armed with swords and muskets. These Franks 
                were friends of the Pacha, and had letters from him, commanding 
                an escort for them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They only came to see our mountain, to ascend Parnassus amid 
                the<br>
                snow and clouds, and to look at the strange black rocks which 
                raised<br>
                their steep sides near our hut. They could not find room in the 
                hut,<br>
                nor endure the smoke that rolled along the ceiling till it found 
                its<br>
                way out at the low door; so they pitched their tents on a small<br>
                space outside our dwelling. Roasted lambs and birds were brought<br>
                forth, and strong, sweet wine, of which the Turks are forbidden 
                to<br>
                partake.<br>
              </p>
              <p>When they departed, I accompanied them for some distance, carrying<br>
                my little sister Anastasia, wrapped in a goat-skin, on my back. 
                One of<br>
                the Frankish gentlemen made me stand in front of a rock, and drew 
                us<br>
                both as we stood there, so that we looked like one creature. I 
                did not<br>
                think of it then, but Anastasia and I were really one. She was<br>
                always sitting on my lap, or riding in the goat-skin on my back; 
                and<br>
                in my dreams she always appeared to me.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Two nights after this, other men, armed with knives and muskets,<br>
                came into our tent. They were Albanians, brave men, my mother 
                told me.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They only stayed a short time. My sister Anastasia sat on the 
                knee<br>
                of one of them; and when they were gone, she had not three, but 
                two<br>
                silver coins in her hair- one had disappeared. They wrapped tobacco 
                in strips of paper, and smoked it; and I remember they were uncertain<br>
                as to the road they ought to take. But they were obliged to go 
                at<br>
                last, and my father went with them. Soon after, we heard the sound<br>
                of firing. The noise continued, and presently soldiers rushed 
                into our<br>
                hut, and took my mother and myself and Anastasia prisoners. They<br>
                declared that we had entertained robbers, and that my father had 
                acted as their guide, and therefore we must now go with them. 
                The corpses of the robbers, and my father's corpse, were brought 
                into the hut. I saw my poor dead father, and cried till I fell 
                asleep. When I awoke, I found myself in a prison; but the room 
                was not worse than our own in the hut. They gave me onions and 
                musty wine from a tarred cask; but we were not accustomed to much 
                better fare at home. How long we were kept in prison, I do not 
                know; but many days and nights passed by. We were set free about 
                Easter-time. I carried Anastasia on my back, and we walked very 
                slowly; for my mother was very weak, and it is a long way to the 
                sea, to the Gulf of Lepanto.<br>
              </p>
              <p>On our arrival, we entered a church, in which there were beautiful<br>
                pictures in golden frames. They were pictures of angels, fair 
                and<br>
                bright; and yet our little Anastasia looked equally beautiful, 
                as it<br>
                seemed to me. In the centre of the floor stood a coffin filled 
                with<br>
                roses. My mother told me it was the Lord Jesus Christ who was<br>
                represented by these roses. Then the priest announced, &quot;Christ 
                is<br>
                risen,&quot; and all the people greeted each other. Each one carried 
                a<br>
                burning taper in his hand, and one was given to me, as well as 
                to<br>
                little Anastasia. The music sounded, and the people left the church<br>
                hand-in-hand, with joy and gladness. Outside, the women were<br>
                roasting the paschal lamb. We were invited to partake; and as 
                I sat by<br>
                the fire, a boy, older than myself, put his arms round my neck, 
                and<br>
                kissed me, and said, &quot;Christ is risen.&quot; And thus it 
                was that for the<br>
                first time I met Aphtanides.<br>
              </p>
              <p>My mother could make fishermen's nets, for which there was a 
                great<br>
                demand here in the bay; and we lived a long time by the side of 
                the<br>
                sea, the beautiful sea, that had a taste like tears, and in its 
                colors<br>
                reminded me of the stag that wept red tears; for sometimes its<br>
                waters were red, and sometimes green or blue. Aphtanides knew 
                how to manage our boat, and I often sat in it, with my little 
                Anastasia,<br>
                while it glided on through the water, swift as a bird flying through<br>
                the air. Then, when the sun set, how beautifully, deeply blue, 
                would<br>
                be the tint on the mountains, one rising above the other in the 
                far<br>
                distance, and the summit of mount Parnassus rising above them 
                all like a glorious crown. Its top glittered in the evening rays 
                like molten<br>
                gold, and it seemed as if the light came from within it; for long<br>
                after the sun had sunk beneath the horizon, the mountain-top would<br>
                glow in the clear, blue sky. The white aquatic birds skimmed the<br>
                surface of the water in their flight, and all was calm and still 
                as<br>
                amid the black rocks at Delphi. I lay on my back in the boat,<br>
                Anastasia leaned against me, while the stars above us glittered 
                more<br>
                brightly than the lamps in our church. They were the same stars, 
                and<br>
                in the same position over me as when I used to sit in front of 
                our hut<br>
                at Delphi, and I had almost begun to fancy I was still there, 
                when<br>
                suddenly there was a splash in the water- Anastasia had fallen 
                in; but<br>
                in a moment Aphtanides has sprung in after her, and was now holding<br>
                her up to me. We dried her clothes as well as we were able, and<br>
                remained on the water till they were dry; for we did not wish 
                it to be<br>
                known what a fright we had had, nor the danger which our little<br>
                adopted sister had incurred, in whose life Aphtanides had now 
                a part.<br>
                The summer came, and the burning heat of the sun tinted the leaves<br>
                of the trees with lines of gold. I thought of our cool<br>
                mountain-home, and the fresh water that flowed near it; my mother,<br>
                too, longed for if, and one evening we wandered towards home. 
                How<br>
                peaceful and silent it was as we walked on through the thick, 
                wild<br>
                thyme, still fragrant, though the sun had scorched the leaves. 
                Not a<br>
                single herdsman did we meet, not a solitary hut did we pass;<br>
                everything appeared lonely and deserted- only a shooting star 
                showed<br>
                that in the heavens there was yet life. I know not whether the<br>
                clear, blue atmosphere gleamed with its own light, or if the<br>
                radiance came from the stars; but we could distinguish quite plainly<br>
                the outline of the mountains. My mother lighted a fire, and roasted<br>
                some roots she had brought with her, and I and my little sister<br>
                slept among the bushes, without fear of the ugly smidraki, from<br>
                whose throat issues fire, or of the wolf and the jackal; for my 
                mother<br>
                sat by us, and I considered her presence sufficient protection.<br>
              </p>
              <p>We reached our old home; but the cottage was in ruins, and we<br>
                had to build a new one. With the aid of some neighbors, chiefly 
                women, the walls were in a few days erected, and very soon covered 
                with a roof of olive-branches. My mother obtained a living by 
                making<br>
                bottle-cases of bark and skins, and I kept the sheep belonging 
                to<br>
                the priests, who were sometimes peasants, while I had for my<br>
                playfellows Anastasia and the turtles.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Once our beloved Aphtanides paid us a visit. He said he had been<br>
                longing to see us so much; and he remained with us two whole happy<br>
                days. A month afterwards he came again to wish us good-bye, and<br>
                brought with him a large fish for my mother. He told us he was 
                going<br>
                in a ship to Corfu and Patras, and could relate a great many<br>
                stories, not only about the fishermen who lived near the gulf 
                of<br>
                Lepanto, but also of kings and heroes who had once possessed Greece, 
                just as the Turks possess it now.<br>
              </p>
              <p>I have seen a bud on a rose-bush gradually, in the course of 
                a few<br>
                weeks, unfold its leaves till it became a rose in all its beauty; 
                and,<br>
                before I was aware of it, I beheld it blooming in rosy loveliness. 
                The<br>
                same thing had happened to Anastasia. Unnoticed by me, she had<br>
                gradually become a beautiful maiden, and I was now also a stout,<br>
                strong youth. The wolf-skins that covered the bed in which my 
                mother and Anastasia slept, had been taken from wolves which I 
                had myself shot.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Years had gone by when, one evening, Aphtanides came in. He had<br>
                grown tall and slender as a reed, with strong limbs, and a dark, 
                brown<br>
                skin. He kissed us all, and had so much to tell of what he had 
                seen of<br>
                the great ocean, of the fortifications at Malta, and of the marvellous<br>
                sepulchres of Egypt, that I looked up to him with a kind of<br>
                veneration. His stories were as strange as the legends of the<br>
                priests of olden times.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;How much you know!&quot; I exclaimed, &quot;and what wonders 
                you can<br>
                relate?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I think what you once told me, the finest of all,&quot; 
                he replied;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;you told me of a thing that has never been out of my thoughts- 
                of the<br>
                good old custom of 'the bond of friendship,'- a custom I should 
                like<br>
                to follow. Brother, let you and I go to church, as your father 
                and<br>
                Anastasia's father once did. Your sister Anastasia is the most<br>
                beautiful and most innocent of maidens, and she shall consecrate 
                the<br>
                deed. No people have such grand old customs as we Greeks.&quot;<br>
                Anastasia blushed like a young rose, and my mother kissed<br>
                Aphtanides.<br>
              </p>
              <p>At about two miles from our cottage, where the earth on the hill<br>
                is sheltered by a few scattered trees, stood the little church, 
                with a<br>
                silver lamp hanging before the altar. I put on my best clothes, 
                and<br>
                the white tunic fell in graceful folds over my hips. The red jacket<br>
                fitted tight and close, the tassel on my Fez cap was of silver, 
                and in<br>
                my girdle glittered a knife and my pistols. Aphtanides was clad 
                in the<br>
                blue dress worn by the Greek sailors; on his breast hung a silver<br>
                medal with the figure of the Virgin Mary, and his scarf was as<br>
                costly as those worn by rich lords. Every one could see that we 
                were<br>
                about to perform a solemn ceremony. When we entered the little,<br>
                unpretending church, the evening sunlight streamed through the 
                open<br>
                door on the burning lamp, and glittered on the golden picture<br>
                frames. We knelt down together on the altar steps, and Anastasia<br>
                drew near and stood beside us. A long, white garment fell in<br>
                graceful folds over her delicate form, and on her white neck and 
                bosom hung a chain entwined with old and new coins, forming a 
                kind of collar. Her black hair was fastened into a knot, and confined 
                by a<br>
                headdress formed of gold and silver coins which had been found 
                in an ancient temple. No Greek girl had more beautiful ornaments 
                than these.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Her countenance glowed, and her eyes were like two stars. We 
                all three offered a silent prayer, and then she said to us, &quot;Will 
                you be friends in life and in death?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; we replied.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Will you each remember to say, whatever may happen, 'My 
                brother<br>
                is a part of myself; his secret is my secret, my happiness is 
                his;<br>
                self-sacrifice, patience, everything belongs to me as they do 
                to<br>
                him?'&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And we again answered, &quot;Yes.&quot; Then she joined out hands 
                and kissed us on the forehead, and we again prayed silently. After 
                this a<br>
                priest came through a door near the altar, and blessed us all 
                three.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then a song was sung by other holy men behind the altar-screen, 
                and<br>
                the bond of eternal friendship was confirmed. When we arose, I 
                saw<br>
                my mother standing by the church door, weeping.<br>
              </p>
              <p>How cheerful everything seemed now in our little cottage by the<br>
                Delphian springs! On the evening before his departure, Aphtanides<br>
                sat thoughtfully beside me on the slopes of the mountain. His 
                arm<br>
                was flung around me, and mine was round his neck. We spoke of 
                the<br>
                sorrows of Greece, and of the men of the country who could be 
                trusted.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Every thought of our souls lay clear before us. Presently I seized 
                his<br>
                hand: &quot;Aphtanides,&quot; I exclaimed, &quot;there is one 
                thing still that you<br>
                must know,- one thing that till now has been a secret between 
                myself<br>
                and Heaven. My whole soul is filled with love,- with a love stronger<br>
                than the love I bear to my mother and to thee.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And whom do you love?&quot; asked Aphtanides. And his face 
                and neck<br>
                grew red as fire.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I love Anastasia,&quot; I replied.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then his hand trembled in mine, and he became pale as a corpse.<br>
                I saw it, I understood the cause, and I believe my hand trembled<br>
                too. I bent towards him, I kissed his forehead, and whispered, 
                &quot;I have<br>
                never spoken of this to her, and perhaps she does not love me.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Brother, think of this; I have seen her daily, she has grown 
                up beside<br>
                me, and has become a part of my soul.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And she shall be thine,&quot; he exclaimed; &quot;thine! 
                I may not wrong<br>
                thee, nor will I do so. I also love her, but tomorrow I depart. 
                In a<br>
                year we will see each other again, but then you will be married; 
                shall<br>
                it not be so? I have a little gold of my own, it shall be yours. 
                You<br>
                must and shall take it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>We wandered silently homeward across the mountains. It was late 
                in<br>
                the evening when we reached my mother's door. Anastasia held the<br>
                lamp as we entered; my mother was not there. She looked at<br>
                Aphtanides with a sweet but mournful expression on her face.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;To-morrow you are going to leave us,&quot; she said. &quot;I 
                am very sorry.&quot;<br>
                &quot;Sorry!&quot; he exclaimed, and his voice was troubled with 
                a grief<br>
                as deep as my own. I could not speak; but he seized her hand and 
                said,<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Our brother yonder loves you, and is he not dear to you? 
                His very<br>
                silence now proves his affection.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Anastasia trembled, and burst into tears. Then I saw no one,<br>
                thought of none, but her. I threw my arms round her, and pressed 
                my<br>
                lips to hers. As she flung her arms round my neck, the lamp fell 
                to<br>
                the ground, and we were in darkness, dark as the heart of poor<br>
                Aphtanides.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Before daybreak he rose, kissed us all, and said &quot;Farewell,&quot; 
                and<br>
                went away. He had given all his money to my mother for us. </p>
              <p>Anastasia was betrothed to me, and in a few days afterwards she 
                became my wife.</p>

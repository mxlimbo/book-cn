              <p class="h" align="center"> A LEAF FROM HEAVEN</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> HIGH up in the clear, pure air flew an angel, with a flower<br>
                plucked from the garden of heaven. As he was kissing the flower 
                a very little leaf fell from it and sunk down into the soft earth 
                in the<br>
                middle of a wood. It immediately took root, sprouted, and sent 
                out<br>
                shoots among the other plants. &quot;What a ridiculous little 
                shoot!&quot; said one. &quot;No one will recognize it; not even 
                the thistle nor the stinging-nettle.&quot; &quot;It must be a 
                kind of garden plant,&quot; said another; and so they<br>
                sneered and despised the plant as a thing from a garden. &quot;Where 
                are you coming?&quot; said the tall thistles whose leaves were 
                all armed with thorns. &quot;It is stupid nonsense to allow yourself 
                to shoot out in this way; we are not here to support you.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Winter came, and the plant was covered with snow, but the snow<br>
                glittered over it as if it had sunshine beneath as well as above.<br>
                When spring came, the plant appeared in full bloom: a more<br>
                beautiful object than any other plant in the forest. And now the<br>
                professor of botany presented himself, one who could explain his<br>
                knowledge in black and white. He examined and tested the plant, 
                but it did not belong to his system of botany, nor could he possibly 
                find out to what class it did belong. &quot;It must be some degenerate 
                species,&quot;<br>
                said he; &quot;I do not know it, and it is not mentioned in any 
                system.&quot;<br>
                &quot;Not known in any system!&quot; repeated the thistles and 
                the nettles.<br>
                <br>
                The large trees which grew round it saw the plant and heard the<br>
                remarks, but they said not a word either good or bad, which is 
                the<br>
                wisest plan for those who are ignorant.<br>
                <br>
                There passed through the forest a poor innocent girl; her heart<br>
                was pure, and her understanding increased by her faith. Her chief<br>
                inheritance had been an old Bible, which she read and valued. 
                From its pages she heard the voice of God speaking to her, and 
                telling her to remember what was said of Joseph's brethren when 
                persons wished to injure her. &quot;They imagined evil in their 
                hearts, but God turned it to good.&quot; If we suffer wrongfully, 
                if we are misunderstood or despised, we must think of Him who 
                was pure and holy, and who prayed for those who nailed Him to 
                the cross, &quot;Father forgive them, for they know not what they 
                do.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                The girl stood still before the wonderful plant, for the green<br>
                leaves exhaled a sweet and refreshing fragrance, and the flowers<br>
                glittered and sparkled in the sunshine like colored flames, and 
                the<br>
                harmony of sweet sounds lingered round them as if each concealed<br>
                within itself a deep fount of melody, which thousands of years 
                could<br>
                not exhaust. With pious gratitude the girl looked upon this glorious<br>
                work of God, and bent down over one of the branches, that she 
                might examine the flower and inhale the sweet perfume. Then a 
                light broke in on her mind, and her heart expanded. Gladly would 
                she have plucked a flower, but she could not overcome her reluctance 
                to break one off.<br>
                <br>
                She knew it would so soon fade; so she took only a single green<br>
                leaf, carried it home, and laid it in her Bible, where it remained<br>
                ever green, fresh, and unfading. Between the pages of the Bible 
                it<br>
                still lay when, a few weeks afterwards, that Bible was laid under<br>
                the young girl's head in her coffin. A holy calm rested on her 
                face,<br>
                as if the earthly remains bore the impress of the truth that she 
                now<br>
                stood in the presence of God.<br>
                <br>
                In the forest the wonderful plant still continued to bloom till 
                it<br>
                grew and became almost a tree, and all the birds of passage bowed<br>
                themselves before it.<br>
                <br>
                &quot;That plant is a foreigner, no doubt,&quot; said the thistles 
                and the<br>
                burdocks. &quot;We can never conduct ourselves like that in this<br>
                country.&quot; And the black forest snails actually spat at the 
                flower.<br>
                Then came the swineherd; he was collecting thistles and shrubs<br>
                to burn them for the ashes. He pulled up the wonderful plant, 
                roots<br>
                and all, and placed it in his bundle. &quot;This will be as useful 
                as any,&quot;<br>
                he said; so the plant was carried away.<br>
                <br>
                Not long after, the king of the country suffered from the<br>
                deepest melancholy. He was diligent and industrious, but employment<br>
                did him no good. They read deep and learned books to him, and 
                then the lightest and most trifling that could be found, but all 
                to no purpose.<br>
                <br>
                Then they applied for advice to one of the wise men of the world,<br>
                and he sent them a message to say that there was one remedy which<br>
                would relieve and cure him, and that it was a plant of heavenly 
                origin<br>
                which grew in the forest in the king's own dominions. The messenger<br>
                described the flower so that is appearance could not be mistaken.<br>
                Then said the swineherd, &quot;I am afraid I carried this plant 
                away<br>
                from the forest in my bundle, and it has been burnt to ashes long 
                ago.<br>
                But I did not know any better.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                &quot;You did not know, any better! Ignorance upon ignorance indeed!&quot;<br>
                The poor swineherd took these words to heart, for they were<br>
                addressed to him; he knew not that there were others who were<br>
                equally ignorant. Not even a leaf of the plant could be found. 
                There<br>
                was one, but it lay in the coffin of the dead; no one knew anything<br>
                about it.<br>
                <br>
                Then the king, in his melancholy, wandered out to the spot in<br>
                the wood. &quot;Here is where the plant stood,&quot; he said; 
                &quot;it is a sacred<br>
                place.&quot; Then he ordered that the place should be surrounded 
                with a<br>
                golden railing, and a sentry stationed near it.<br>
                <br>
                The botanical professor wrote a long treatise about the heavenly<br>
                plant, and for this he was loaded with gold, which improved the<br>
                position of himself and his family.<br>
                <br>
                And this part is really the most pleasant part of the story. For<br>
                the plant had disappeared, and the king remained as melancholy 
                and sad as ever, but the sentry said he had always been so.</p>

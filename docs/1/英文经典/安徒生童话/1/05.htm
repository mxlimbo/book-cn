              <p class="h" align="center"> A STORY FROM THE SAND-HILLS</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THIS story is from the sand-dunes or sand-hills of Jutland, 
                but it<br>
                does not begin there in the North, but far away in the South, 
                in Spain. The wide sea is the highroad from nation to nation; 
                journey in thought; then, to sunny Spain. It is warm and beautiful 
                there;<br>
                the fiery pomegranate flowers peep from among dark laurels; a 
                cool<br>
                refreshing breeze from the mountains blows over the orange gardens,<br>
                over the Moorish halls with their golden cupolas and coloured 
                walls.<br>
                <br>
                Children go through the streets in procession with candles and<br>
                waving banners, and the sky, lofty and clear with its glittering<br>
                stars, rises above them. Sounds of singing and castanets can be 
                heard, and youths and maidens dance upon the flowering acacia 
                trees, while even the beggar sits upon a block of marble, refreshing 
                himself with a juicy melon, and dreamily enjoying life. It all 
                seems like a beautiful dream.<br>
                <br>
                Here dwelt a newly married couple who completely gave themselves<br>
                up to the charm of life; indeed they possessed every good thing 
                they<br>
                could desire- health and happiness, riches and honour.<br>
                <br>
                We are as happy as human beings can be,&quot; said the young couple<br>
                from the depths of their hearts. They had indeed only one step<br>
                higher to mount on the ladder of happiness- they hoped that God<br>
                would give them a child, a son like them in form and spirit. The 
                happy<br>
                little one was to be welcomed with rejoicing, to be cared for 
                with<br>
                love and tenderness, and enjoy every advantage of wealth and luxury<br>
                that a rich and influential family can give. So the days went 
                by<br>
                like a joyous festival.<br>
                <br>
                &quot;Life is a gracious gift from God, almost too great a gift 
                for<br>
                us to appreciate!&quot; said the young wife. &quot;Yet they say 
                that fulness<br>
                of joy for ever and ever can only be found in the future life. 
                I<br>
                cannot realise it!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The thought arises, perhaps, from the arrogance of men,&quot; 
                said the<br>
                husband. &quot;It seems a great pride to believe that we shall 
                live for<br>
                ever, that we shall be as gods! Were not these the words of the<br>
                serpent, the father of lies?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Surely you do not doubt the existence of a future life?&quot;<br>
                exclaimed the young wife. It seemed as if one of the first shadows<br>
                passed over her sunny thoughts.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Faith realises it, and the priests tell us so,&quot; replied 
                her<br>
                husband; &quot;but amid all my happiness I feel that it is arrogant 
                to<br>
                demand a continuation of it- another life after this. Has not 
                so<br>
                much been given us in this world that we ought to be, we must 
                be,<br>
                contented with it?&quot;<br>
                <br>
                &quot;Yes, it has been given to us,&quot; said the young wife, 
                &quot;but this<br>
                life is nothing more than one long scene of trial and hardship 
                to many<br>
                thousands. How many have been cast into this world only to endure<br>
                poverty, shame, illness, and misfortune? If there were no future 
                life,<br>
                everything here would be too unequally divided, and God would 
                not be the personification of justice.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                &quot;The beggar there,&quot; said her husband, &quot;has joys 
                of his own which<br>
                seem to him great, and cause him as much pleasure as a king would 
                find in the magnificence of his palace. And then do you not think 
                that<br>
                the beast of burden, which suffers blows and hunger, and works<br>
                itself to death, suffers just as much from its miserable fate? 
                The<br>
                dumb creature might demand a future life also, and declare the 
                law<br>
                unjust that excludes it from the advantages of the higher creation.&quot;<br>
                &quot;Christ said: 'In my father's house are many mansions,'&quot; 
                she<br>
                answered. &quot;Heaven is as boundless as the love of our Creator; 
                the dumb animal is also His creature, and I firmly believe that 
                no life will be lost, but each will receive as much happiness 
                as he can enjoy, which will be sufficient for him.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                &quot;This world is sufficient for me,&quot; said the husband, 
                throwing<br>
                his arm round his beautiful, sweet-tempered wife. He sat by her 
                side<br>
                on the open balcony, smoking a cigarette in the cool air, which 
                was<br>
                loaded with the sweet scent of carnations and orange blossoms.<br>
                Sounds of music and the clatter of castanets came from the road<br>
                beneath, the stars shone above then, and two eyes full of affection-<br>
                those of his wife- looked upon him with the expression of undying<br>
                love. &quot;Such a moment,&quot; he said, &quot;makes it worth 
                while to be born, to<br>
                die, and to be annihilated!&quot; He smiled- the young wife raised 
                her hand<br>
                in gentle reproof, and the shadow passed away from her mind, and<br>
                they were happy- quite happy.<br>
                <br>
                Everything seemed to work together for their good. They advanced<br>
                in honour, in prosperity, and in happiness. A change came certainly,<br>
                but it was only a change of place and not of circumstances.<br>
                The young man was sent by his Sovereign as ambassador to the<br>
                Russian Court. This was an office of high dignity, but his birth 
                and<br>
                his acquirements entitled him to the honour. He possessed a large<br>
                fortune, and his wife had brought him wealth equal to his own, 
                for she<br>
                was the daughter of a rich and respected merchant. One of this<br>
                merchant's largest and finest ships was to be sent that year to<br>
                Stockholm, and it was arranged that the dear young couple, the<br>
                daughter and the son-in-law, should travel in it to St. Petersburg.<br>
                All the arrangements on board were princely and silk and luxury 
                on<br>
                every side.<br>
                <br>
                In an old war song, called &quot;The King of England's Son,&quot; 
                it says:</p>
              <p> &quot;Farewell, he said, and sailed away.<br>
                And many recollect that day.<br>
                The ropes were of silk, the anchor of gold,<br>
                And everywhere riches and wealth untold.&quot;</p>
              <p> These words would aptly describe the vessel from Spain, for 
                here<br>
                was the same luxury, and the same parting thought naturally arose:</p>
              <p> &quot;God grant that we once more may meet<br>
                In sweet unclouded peace and joy.&quot;</p>
              <p> There was a favourable wind blowing as they left the Spanish<br>
                coast, and it would be but a short journey, for they hoped to 
                reach<br>
                their destination in a few weeks; but when they came out upon 
                the wide ocean the wind dropped, the sea became smooth and shining, 
                and the stars shone brightly. Many festive evenings were spent 
                on board. At last the travellers began to wish for wind, for a 
                favourable breeze; but their wish was useless- not a breath of 
                air stirred, or if it<br>
                did arise it was contrary. Weeks passed by in this way, two whole<br>
                months, and then at length a fair wind blew from the south-west. 
                The<br>
                ship sailed on the high seas between Scotland and Jutland; then 
                the<br>
                wind increased, just as it did in the old song of &quot;The King 
                of<br>
                England's Son.&quot;</p>
              <p> &quot;'Mid storm and wind, and pelting hail,<br>
                Their efforts were of no avail.<br>
                The golden anchor forth they threw;<br>
                Towards Denmark the west wind blew.&quot;</p>
              <p> This all happened a long time ago; King Christian VII, who sat<br>
                on the Danish throne, was still a young man. Much has happened 
                since then, much has altered or been changed. Sea and moorland 
                have been turned into green meadows, stretches of heather have 
                become arable land, and in the shelter of the peasant's cottages, 
                apple-trees and rose-bushes grow, though they certainly require 
                much care, as the sharp west wind blows upon them. In West Jutland 
                one may go back in thought to old times, farther back than the 
                days when Christian VII ruled. The purple heather still extends 
                for miles, with its barrows and aerial spectacles, intersected 
                with sandy uneven roads, just as it did then; towards the west, 
                where broad streams run into the bays, are marshes and meadows 
                encircled by lofty, sandy hills, which, like a chain of Alps, 
                raise their pointed summits near the sea; they are only broken 
                by high ridges of clay, from which the sea, year by year, bites 
                out great mouthfuls, so that the overhanging banks fall down as 
                if by the shock of an earthquake. Thus it is there today and thus 
                it was long ago, when the happy pair were sailing in the beautiful 
                ship.</p>
              <p> It was a Sunday, towards the end of September; the sun was<br>
                shining, and the chiming of the church bells in the Bay of Nissum<br>
                was carried along by the breeze like a chain of sounds. The churches<br>
                there are almost entirely built of hewn blocks of stone, each 
                like a<br>
                piece of rock. The North Sea might foam over them and they would 
                not be disturbed. Nearly all of them are without steeples, and 
                the bells<br>
                are hung outside between two beams. The service was over, and 
                the<br>
                congregation passed out into the churchyard, where not a tree 
                or<br>
                bush was to be seen; no flowers were planted there, and they had 
                not<br>
                placed a single wreath upon any of the graves. It is just the 
                same<br>
                now. Rough mounds show where the dead have been buried, and rank 
                grass, tossed by the wind, grows thickly over the whole churchyard; 
                here and there a grave has a sort of monument, a block of half-decayed 
                wood, rudely cut in the shape of a coffin; the blocks are brought 
                from the forest of West Jutland, but the forest is the sea itself, 
                and the inhabitants find beams, and planks, and fragments which 
                the waves have cast upon the beach. One of these blocks had been 
                placed by loving hands on a child's grave, and one of the women 
                who had come out of the church walked up to it; she stood there, 
                her eyes resting on the weather-beaten memorial, and a few moments 
                afterwards her husband joined her. They were both silent, but 
                he took her hand, and they walked together across the purple heath, 
                over moor and meadow towards the sandhills. For a long time they 
                went on without speaking.<br>
                <br>
                &quot;It was a good sermon to-day,&quot; the man said at last. 
                &quot;If we had<br>
                not God to trust in, we should have nothing.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                &quot;Yes,&quot; replied the woman, &quot;He sends joy and sorrow, 
                and He has a<br>
                right to send them. To-morrow our little son would have been five<br>
                years old if we had been permitted to keep him.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is no use fretting, wife,&quot; said the man. &quot;The 
                boy is well<br>
                provided for. He is where we hope and pray to go to.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>They said nothing more, but went out towards their houses among<br>
                the sand-hills. All at once, in front of one of the houses where 
                the<br>
                sea grass did not keep the sand down with its twining roots, what<br>
                seemed to be a column of smoke rose up. A gust of wind rushed<br>
                between the hills, hurling the particles of sand high into the 
                air;<br>
                another gust, and the strings of fish hung up to dry flapped and<br>
                beat violently against the walls of the cottage; then everything 
                was<br>
                quiet once more, and the sun shone with renewed heat.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The man and his wife went into the cottage. They had soon taken<br>
                off their Sunday clothes and come out again, hurrying over the 
                dunes<br>
                which stood there like great waves of sand suddenly arrested in<br>
                their course, while the sandweeds and dune grass with its bluish<br>
                stalks spread a changing colour over them. A few neighbours also<br>
                came out, and helped each other to draw the boats higher up on 
                the<br>
                beach. The wind now blew more keenly, it was chilly and cold, 
                and when they went back over the sand-hills, sand and little sharp 
                stones<br>
                blew into their faces. The waves rose high, crested with white 
                foam,<br>
                and the wind cut off their crests, scattering the foam far and 
                wide.<br>
                Evening came; there was a swelling roar in the air, a wailing 
                or<br>
                moaning like the voices of despairing spirits, that sounded above<br>
                the thunder of the waves. The fisherman's little cottage was on 
                the<br>
                very margin, and the sand rattled against the window panes; every<br>
                now and then a violent gust of wind shook the house to its foundation.<br>
                <br>
                It was dark, but about midnight the moon would rise. Later on 
                the<br>
                air became clearer, but the storm swept over the perturbed sea 
                with<br>
                undiminished fury; the fisher folks had long since gone to bed, 
                but in<br>
                such weather there was no chance of closing an eye. Presently 
                there<br>
                was a tapping at the window; the door was opened, and a voice 
                said:<br>
                &quot;There's a large ship stranded on the farthest reef.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                In a moment the fisher people sprung from their beds and hastily<br>
                dressed themselves. The moon had risen, and it was light enough 
                to<br>
                make the surrounding objects visible to those who could open their<br>
                eyes in the blinding clouds of sand; the violence of the wind 
                was<br>
                terrible, and it was only possible to pass among the sand-hills 
                if one<br>
                crept forward between the gusts; the salt spray flew up from the 
                sea<br>
                like down, and the ocean foamed like a roaring cataract towards 
                the<br>
                beach. Only a practised eye could discern the vessel out in the<br>
                offing; she was a fine brig, and the waves now lifted her over 
                the<br>
                reef, three or four cables' length out of the usual channel. She 
                drove<br>
                towards the shore, struck on the second reef, and remained fixed.<br>
                It was impossible to render assistance; the sea rushed in upon 
                the<br>
                vessel, making a clean breach over her. Those on shore thought 
                they<br>
                heard cries for help from those on board, and could plainly<br>
                distinguish the busy but useless efforts made by the stranded 
                sailors.<br>
                Now a wave came rolling onward. It fell with enormous force on 
                the<br>
                bowsprit, tearing it from the vessel, and the stern was lifted 
                high<br>
                above the water. Two people were seen to embrace and plunge together 
                into the sea, and the next moment one of the largest waves that 
                rolled towards the sand-hills threw a body on the beach. It was 
                a woman; the sailors said that she was quite dead, but the women 
                thought they saw signs of life in her, so the stranger was carried 
                across the sand-hills to the fisherman's cottage. How beautiful 
                and fair she was!<br>
                <br>
                She must be a great lady, they said.<br>
                <br>
                They laid her upon the humble bed; there was not a yard of linen<br>
                on it, only a woollen coverlet to keep the occupant warm.<br>
                Life returned to her, but she was delirious, and knew nothing 
                of<br>
                what had happened or where she was; and it was better so, for<br>
                everything she loved and valued lay buried in the sea. The same<br>
                thing happened to her ship as to the one spoken of in the song 
                about<br>
                &quot;The King of England's Son.&quot;</p>
              <p> &quot;Alas! how terrible to see<br>
                The gallant bark sink rapidly.&quot;</p>
              <p> Fragments of the wreck and pieces of wood were washed ashore; 
                they were all that remained of the vessel. The wind still blew 
                violently on the coast.<br>
                <br>
                For a few moments the strange lady seemed to rest; but she awoke<br>
                in pain, and uttered cries of anguish and fear. She opened her<br>
                wonderfully beautiful eyes, and spoke a few words, but nobody<br>
                understood her.- And lo! as a reward for the sorrow and suffering<br>
                she had undergone, she held in her arms a new-born babe. The child<br>
                that was to have rested upon a magnificent couch, draped with 
                silken<br>
                curtains, in a luxurious home; it was to have been welcomed with 
                joy<br>
                to a life rich in all the good things of this world; and now Heaven<br>
                had ordained that it should be born in this humble retreat, that 
                it<br>
                should not even receive a kiss from its mother, for when the<br>
                fisherman's wife laid the child upon the mother's bosom, it rested<br>
                on a heart that beat no more- she was dead.<br>
                <br>
                The child that was to have been reared amid wealth and luxury<br>
                was cast into the world, washed by the sea among the sand-hills 
                to<br>
                share the fate and hardships of the poor.<br>
                <br>
                Here we are reminded again of the song about &quot;The King of<br>
                England's Son,&quot; for in it mention is made of the custom prevalent 
                at<br>
                the time, when knights and squires plundered those who had been<br>
                saved from shipwreck. The ship had stranded some distance south 
                of<br>
                Nissum Bay, and the cruel, inhuman days, when, as we have just 
                said,<br>
                the inhabitants of Jutland treated the shipwrecked people so crudely<br>
                were past, long ago. Affectionate sympathy and self-sacrifice 
                for<br>
                the unfortunate existed then, just as it does in our own time 
                in<br>
                many a bright example. The dying mother and the unfortunate child<br>
                would have found kindness and help wherever they had been cast 
                by<br>
                the winds, but nowhere would it have been more sincere than in 
                the<br>
                cottage of the poor fisherman's wife, who had stood, only the 
                day<br>
                before, beside her child's grave, who would have been five years 
                old<br>
                that day if God had spared it to her.<br>
                <br>
                No one knew who the dead stranger was, they could not even form<br>
                a conjecture; the fragments of wreckage gave no clue to the matter.<br>
                No tidings reached Spain of the fate of the daughter and<br>
                son-in-law. They did not arrive at their destination, and violent<br>
                storms had raged during the past weeks. At last the verdict was 
                given:<br>
                &quot;Foundered at sea- all lost.&quot; But in the fisherman's 
                cottage among the<br>
                sand-hills near Hunsby, there lived a little scion of the rich 
                Spanish<br>
                family.<br>
                <br>
                Where Heaven sends food for two, a third can manage to find a<br>
                meal, and in the depth of the sea there is many a dish of fish 
                for the<br>
                hungry.<br>
                <br>
                They called the boy Jurgen.<br>
                <br>
                &quot;It must certainly be a Jewish child, its skin is so dark,&quot; 
                the<br>
                people said.<br>
                <br>
                &quot;It might be an Italian or a Spaniard,&quot; remarked the 
                clergyman.<br>
                But to the fisherman's wife these nations seemed all the same, 
                and<br>
                she consoled herself with the thought that the child was baptized 
                as a<br>
                Christian.<br>
                <br>
                The boy throve; the noble blood in his veins was warm, and he<br>
                became strong on his homely fare. He grew apace in the humble 
                cottage, and the Danish dialect spoken by the West Jutes became 
                his language.<br>
                <br>
                The pomegranate seed from Spain became a hardy plant on the coast 
                of West Jutland. Thus may circumstances alter the course of a 
                man's life!<br>
                <br>
                To this home he clung with deep-rooted affection; he was to experience 
                cold and hunger, and the misfortunes and hardships that surround 
                the poor; but he also tasted of their joys.<br>
                <br>
                Childhood has bright days for every one, and the memory of them<br>
                shines through the whole after-life. The boy had many sources 
                of<br>
                pleasure and enjoyment; the coast for miles and miles was full 
                of<br>
                playthings, for it was a mosaic of pebbles, some red as coral 
                or<br>
                yellow as amber, and others again white and rounded like birds' 
                eggs<br>
                and smoothed and prepared by the sea. Even the bleached fishes'<br>
                skeletons, the water plants dried by the wind, and seaweed, white<br>
                and shining long linen-like bands waving between the stones- all 
                these<br>
                seemed made to give pleasure and occupation for the boy's thoughts,<br>
                and he had an intelligent mind; many great talents lay dormant 
                in him.<br>
                How readily he remembered stories and songs that he heard, and 
                how<br>
                dexterous he was with his fingers! With stones and mussel-shells 
                he<br>
                could put together pictures and ships with which one could decorate<br>
                the room; and he could make wonderful things from a stick, his<br>
                foster-mother said, although he was still so young and little. 
                He<br>
                had a sweet voice, and every melody seemed to flow naturally from<br>
                his lips. And in his heart were hidden chords, which might have<br>
                sounded far out into the world if he had been placed anywhere 
                else<br>
                than in the fisherman's hut by the North Sea.<br>
                <br>
                One day another ship was wrecked on the coast, and among other<br>
                things a chest filled with valuable flower bulbs was washed ashore.<br>
                Some were put into saucepans and cooked, for they were thought 
                to be fit to eat, and others lay and shrivelled in the sand- they 
                did not<br>
                accomplish their purpose, or unfold their magnificent colours. 
                Would<br>
                Jurgen fare better? The flower bulbs had soon played their part, 
                but<br>
                he had years of apprenticeship before him. Neither he nor his<br>
                friends noticed in what a monotonous, uniform way one day followed<br>
                another, for there was always plenty to do and see. The ocean 
                itself<br>
                was a great lesson-book, and it unfolded a new leaf each day of 
                calm<br>
                or storm- the crested wave or the smooth surface.<br>
                <br>
                The visits to the church were festive occasions, but among the<br>
                fisherman's house one was especially looked forward to; this was, 
                in<br>
                fact, the visit of the brother of Jurgen's foster-mother, the<br>
                eel-breeder from Fjaltring, near Bovbjerg. He came twice a year 
                in a<br>
                cart, painted red with blue and white tulips upon it, and full 
                of<br>
                eels; it was covered and locked like a box, two dun oxen drew 
                it,<br>
                and Jurgen was allowed to guide them.<br>
                <br>
                The eel-breeder was a witty fellow, a merry guest, and brought 
                a<br>
                measure of brandy with him. They all received a small glassful 
                or a<br>
                cupful if there were not enough glasses; even Jurgen had about 
                a<br>
                thimbleful, that he might digest the fat eel, as the eel-breeder 
                said;<br>
                he always told one story over and over again, and if his hearers<br>
                laughed he would immediately repeat it to them. Jurgen while still 
                a<br>
                boy, and also when he was older, used phrases from the eel-breeder's<br>
                story on various occasions, so it will be as well for us to listen<br>
                to it. It runs thus:<br>
                <br>
                &quot;The eels went into the bay, and the young ones begged leave 
                to go<br>
                a little farther out. 'Don't go too far,' said their mother; 'the 
                ugly<br>
                eel-spearer might come and snap you all up.' But they went too 
                far,<br>
                and of eight daughters only three came back to the mother, and 
                these<br>
                wept and said, 'We only went a little way out, and the ugly<br>
                eel-spearer came immediately and stabbed five of our sisters to<br>
                death.' 'They'll come back again,' said the mother eel. 'Oh, no,'<br>
                exclaimed the daughters, 'for he skinned them, cut them in two, 
                and<br>
                fried them.' 'Oh, they'll come back again,' the mother eel<br>
                persisted. 'No,' replied the daughters, 'for he ate them up.' 
                'They'll<br>
                come back again,' repeated the mother eel. 'But he drank brandy<br>
                after them,' said the daughters. 'Ah, then they'll never come 
                back,'<br>
                said the mother, and she burst out crying, 'it's the brandy that<br>
                buries the eels.'&quot;<br>
                <br>
                &quot;And therefore,&quot; said the eel-breeder in conclusion, 
                &quot;it is always<br>
                the proper thing to drink brandy after eating eels.&quot;<br>
                This story was the tinsel thread, the most humorous recollection<br>
                of Jurgen's life. He also wanted to go a little way farther out 
                and up<br>
                the bay- that is to say, out into the world in a ship- but his<br>
                mother said, like the eel-breeder, &quot;There are so many bad 
                people-<br>
                eel spearers!&quot; He wished to go a little way past the sand-hills, 
                out<br>
                into the dunes, and at last he did: four happy days, the brightest<br>
                of his childhood, fell to his lot, and the whole beauty and<br>
                splendour of Jutland, all the happiness and sunshine of his home, 
                were concentrated in these. He went to a festival, but it was 
                a burial<br>
                feast.<br>
                <br>
                A rich relation of the fisherman's family had died; the farm was<br>
                situated far eastward in the country and a little towards the 
                north.<br>
                Jurgen's foster parents went there, and he also went with them 
                from<br>
                the dunes, over heath and moor, where the Skjaerumaa takes its<br>
                course through green meadows and contains many eels; mother eels<br>
                live there with their daughters, who are caught and eaten up by 
                wicked<br>
                people. But do not men sometimes act quite as cruelly towards 
                their<br>
                own fellow-men? Was not the knight Sir Bugge murdered by wicked<br>
                people? And though he was well spoken of, did he not also wish 
                to kill the architect who built the castle for him, with its thick 
                walls and<br>
                tower, at the point where the Skjaerumaa falls into the bay? Jurgen<br>
                and his parents now stood there; the wall and the ramparts still<br>
                remained, and red crumbling fragments lay scattered around. Here 
                it<br>
                was that Sir Bugge, after the architect had left him, said to 
                one of<br>
                his men, &quot;Go after him and say, 'Master, the tower shakes.' 
                If he<br>
                turns round, kill him and take away the money I paid him, but 
                if he<br>
                does not turn round let him go in peace.&quot; The man did as 
                he was<br>
                told; the architect did not turn round, but called back &quot;The 
                tower<br>
                does not shake in the least, but one day a man will come from 
                the west in a blue cloak- he will cause it to shake!&quot; And 
                so indeed it happened a hundred years later, for the North Sea 
                broke in and cast down the tower; but Predbjorn Gyldenstjerne, 
                the man who then possessed the castle, built a new castle higher 
                up at the end of the meadow, and that one is standing to this 
                day, and is called Norre-Vosborg.<br>
                <br>
                Jurgen and his foster parents went past this castle. They had 
                told<br>
                him its story during the long winter evenings, and now he saw 
                the<br>
                stately edifice, with its double moat, and trees and bushes; the 
                wall,<br>
                covered with ferns, rose within the moat, but the lofty lime-trees<br>
                were the most beautiful of all; they grew up to the highest windows,<br>
                and the air was full of their sweet fragrance. In a north-west<br>
                corner of the garden stood a great bush full of blossom, like 
                winter<br>
                snow amid the summer's green; it was a juniper bush, the first 
                that<br>
                Jurgen had ever seen in bloom. He never forgot it, nor the lime-trees;<br>
                the child's soul treasured up these memories of beauty and fragrance<br>
                to gladden the old man.<br>
                <br>
                From Norre-Vosborg, where the juniper blossomed, the journey<br>
                became more pleasant, for they met some other people who were 
                also<br>
                going to the funeral and were riding in waggons. Our travellers 
                had to<br>
                sit all together on a little box at the back of the waggon, but 
                even<br>
                this, they thought, was better than walking. So they continued 
                their<br>
                journey across the rugged heath. The oxen which drew the waggon<br>
                stopped every now and then, where a patch of fresh grass appeared 
                amid the heather. The sun shone with considerable heat, and it 
                was<br>
                wonderful to behold how in the far distance something like smoke<br>
                seemed to be rising; yet this smoke was clearer than the air; 
                it was<br>
                transparent, and looked like rays of light rolling and dancing 
                afar<br>
                over the heath.<br>
                <br>
                &quot;That is Lokeman driving his sheep,&quot; said some one.<br>
                And this was enough to excite Jurgen's imagination. He felt as<br>
                if they were now about to enter fairyland, though everything was 
                still<br>
                real. How quiet it was! The heath stretched far and wide around 
                them<br>
                like a beautiful carpet. The heather was in blossom, and the<br>
                juniper-bushes and fresh oak saplings rose like bouquets from 
                the<br>
                earth. An inviting place for a frolic, if it had not been for 
                the<br>
                number of poisonous adders of which the travellers spoke; they 
                also<br>
                mentioned that the place had formerly been infested with wolves, 
                and<br>
                that the district was still called Wolfsborg for this reason. 
                The<br>
                old man who was driving the oxen told them that in the lifetime 
                of his<br>
                father the horses had many a hard battle with the wild beasts 
                that<br>
                were now exterminated. One morning, when he himself had gone out 
                to bring in the horses, he found one of them standing with its 
                forefeet<br>
                on a wolf it had killed, but the savage animal had torn and<br>
                lacerated the brave horse's legs.<br>
                <br>
                The journey over the heath and the deep sand was only too<br>
                quickly at an end. They stopped before the house of mourning, 
                where<br>
                they found plenty of guests within and without. Waggon after waggon<br>
                stood side by side, while the horses and oxen had been turned 
                out to<br>
                graze on the scanty pasture. Great sand-hills like those at home 
                by<br>
                the North Sea rose behind the house and extended far and wide. 
                How had they come here, so many miles inland? They were as large 
                and high as those on the coast, and the wind had carried them 
                there; there was also a legend attached to them.<br>
                <br>
                Psalms were sung, and a few of the old people shed tears; with<br>
                this exception, the guests were cheerful enough, it seemed to<br>
                Jurgen, and there was plenty to eat and drink. There were eels 
                of<br>
                the fattest, requiring brandy to bury them, as the eel-breeder 
                said;<br>
                and certainly they did not forget to carry out his maxim here.<br>
                Jurgen went in and out the house; and on the third day he felt<br>
                as much at home as he did in the fisherman's cottage among the<br>
                sand-hills, where he had passed his early days. Here on the heath 
                were riches unknown to him until now; for flowers, blackberries, 
                and<br>
                bilberries were to be found in profusion, so large and sweet that 
                when<br>
                they were crushed beneath the tread of passers-by the heather 
                was<br>
                stained with their red juice. Here was a barrow and yonder another.<br>
                Then columns of smoke rose into the still air; it was a heath 
                fire,<br>
                they told him- how brightly it blazed in the dark evening!<br>
                The fourth day came, and the funeral festivities were at an end;<br>
                they were to go back from the land-dunes to the sand-dunes.<br>
                &quot;Ours are better,&quot; said the old fisherman, Jurgen's 
                foster-father;<br>
                &quot;these have no strength.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                And they spoke of the way in which the sand-dunes had come inland,<br>
                and it seemed very easy to understand. This is how they explained 
                it:<br>
                A dead body had been found on the coast, and the peasants buried<br>
                it in the churchyard. From that time the sand began to fly about 
                and<br>
                the sea broke in with violence. A wise man in the district advised<br>
                them to open the grave and see if the buried man was not lying 
                sucking his thumb, for if so he must be a sailor, and the sea 
                would not rest until it had got him back. The grave was opened, 
                and he really was found with his thumb in his mouth. So they laid 
                him upon a cart, and harnessed two oxen to it; and the oxen ran 
                off with the sailor over heath and moor to the ocean, as if they 
                had been stung by an adder.<br>
                <br>
                Then the sand ceased to fly inland, but the hills that had been<br>
                piled up still remained.<br>
                <br>
                All this Jurgen listened to and treasured up in his memory of<br>
                the happiest days of his childhood- the days of the burial feast.<br>
                How delightful it was to see fresh places and to mix with<br>
                strangers! And he was to go still farther, for he was not yet 
                fourteen<br>
                years old when he went out in a ship to see the world. He<br>
                encountered bad weather, heavy seas, unkindness, and hard men- 
                such were his experiences, for he became ship-boy. Cold nights, 
                bad living, and blows had to be endured; then he felt his noble 
                Spanish blood boil within him, and bitter, angry, words rose to 
                his lips, but he gulped them down; it was better, although he 
                felt as the eel must feel when it is skinned, cut up, and put 
                into the frying-pan.<br>
                &quot;I shall get over it,&quot; said a voice within him.<br>
                <br>
                He saw the Spanish coast, the native land of his parents. He<br>
                even saw the town where they had lived in joy and prosperity, 
                but he<br>
                knew nothing of his home or his relations, and his relations knew 
                just<br>
                as little about him.<br>
                <br>
                The poor ship boy was not permitted to land, but on the last day<br>
                of their stay he managed to get ashore. There were several purchases<br>
                to be made, and he was sent to carry them on board.<br>
                <br>
                Jurgen stood there in his shabby clothes which looked as if they<br>
                had been washed in the ditch and dried in the chimney; he, who 
                had<br>
                always dwelt among the sand-hills, now saw a great city for the<br>
                first time. How lofty the houses seemed, and what a number of 
                people there were in the streets! some pushing this way, some 
                that- a perfect maelstrom of citizens and peasants, monks and 
                soldiers- the jingling of bells on the trappings of asses and 
                mules, the chiming of church bells, calling, shouting, hammering 
                and knocking- all going on at once. Every trade was located in 
                the basement of the houses or in<br>
                the side thoroughfares; and the sun shone with such heat, and 
                the<br>
                air was so close, that one seemed to be in an oven full of beetles,<br>
                cockchafers, bees and flies, all humming and buzzing together.<br>
                Jurgen scarcely knew where he was or which way he went. Then he 
                saw just in front of him the great doorway of a cathedral; the 
                lights were gleaming in the dark aisles, and the fragrance of 
                incense was wafted towards him. Even the poorest beggar ventured 
                up the steps into the sanctuary. Jurgen followed the sailor he 
                was with into the church, and stood in the sacred edifice. Coloured 
                pictures gleamed from their golden background, and on the altar 
                stood the figure of the Virgin with the child Jesus, surrounded 
                by lights and flowers; priests in festive robes were chanting, 
                and choir boys in dazzling attire swung<br>
                silver censers. What splendour and magnificence he saw there! 
                It<br>
                streamed in upon his soul and overpowered him: the church and 
                the<br>
                faith of his parents surrounded him, and touched a chord in his<br>
                heart that caused his eyes to overflow with tears.<br>
                <br>
                They went from the church to the market-place. Here a quantity<br>
                of provisions were given him to carry. The way to the harbour 
                was<br>
                long; and weary and overcome with various emotions, he rested 
                for a<br>
                few moments before a splendid house, with marble pillars, statues, 
                and broad steps. Here he rested his burden against the wall. Then 
                a porter in livery came out, lifted up a silver-headed cane, and 
                drove him away- him, the grandson of that house. But no one knew 
                that, and he just as little as any one. Then he went on board 
                again, and once more encountered rough words and blows, much work 
                and little sleep-such was his experience of life. They say it 
                is good to suffer in<br>
                one's young days, if age brings something to make up for it.<br>
                <br>
                His period of service on board the ship came to an end, and the<br>
                vessel lay once more at Ringkjobing in Jutland. He came ashore, 
                and<br>
                went home to the sand-dunes near Hunsby; but his foster-mother 
                had<br>
                died during his absence.<br>
                <br>
                A hard winter followed this summer. Snow-storms swept over land<br>
                and sea, and there was difficulty in getting from one place to<br>
                another. How unequally things are distributed in this world! Here<br>
                there was bitter cold and snow-storms, while in Spain there was<br>
                burning sunshine and oppressive heat. Yet, when a clear frosty 
                day<br>
                came, and Jurgen saw the swans flying in numbers from the sea<br>
                towards the land, across to Norre-Vosborg, it seemed to him that<br>
                people could breathe more freely here; the summer also in this 
                part of<br>
                the world was splendid. In imagination he saw the heath blossom 
                and<br>
                become purple with rich juicy berries, and the elder-bushes and<br>
                lime-trees at Norre Vosborg in flower. He made up his mind to 
                go there again.<br>
                <br>
                Spring came, and the fishing began. Jurgen was now an active<br>
                helper in this, for he had grown during the last year, and was 
                quick<br>
                at work. He was full of life, and knew how to swim, to tread water,<br>
                and to turn over and tumble in the strong tide. They often warned<br>
                him to beware of the sharks, which seize the best swimmer, draw 
                him<br>
                down, and devour him; but such was not to be Jurgen's fate.<br>
                <br>
                At a neighbour's house in the dunes there was a boy named<br>
                Martin, with whom Jurgen was on very friendly terms, and they 
                both<br>
                took service in the same ship to Norway, and also went together 
                to<br>
                Holland. They never had a quarrel, but a person can be easily<br>
                excited to quarrel when he is naturally hot tempered, for he often<br>
                shows it in many ways; and this is just what Jurgen did one day 
                when<br>
                they fell out about the merest trifle. They were sitting behind 
                the<br>
                cabin door, eating from a delft plate, which they had placed between<br>
                them. Jurgen held his pocket-knife in his hand and raised it towards<br>
                Martin, and at the same time became ashy pale, and his eyes had 
                an<br>
                ugly look. Martin only said, &quot;Ah! ah! you are one of that 
                sort, are<br>
                you? Fond of using the knife!&quot;<br>
                <br>
                The words were scarcely spoken, when Jurgen's hand sank down. 
                He<br>
                did not answer a syllable, but went on eating, and afterwards 
                returned<br>
                to his work. When they were resting again he walked up to Martin 
                and<br>
                said:<br>
                <br>
                &quot;Hit me in the face! I deserve it. But sometimes I feel as 
                if I<br>
                had a pot in me that boils over.&quot;<br>
                &quot;There, let the thing rest,&quot; replied Martin.<br>
                <br>
                And after that they were almost better friends than ever; when<br>
                afterwards they returned to the dunes and began telling their<br>
                adventures, this was told among the rest. Martin said that Jurgen<br>
                was certainly passionate, but a good fellow after all.<br>
                <br>
                They were both young and healthy, well-grown and strong; but<br>
                Jurgen was the cleverer of the two.<br>
                <br>
                In Norway the peasants go into the mountains and take the cattle<br>
                there to find pasture. On the west coast of Jutland huts have 
                been<br>
                erected among the sand-hills; they are built of pieces of wreck, 
                and<br>
                thatched with turf and heather; there are sleeping places round 
                the<br>
                walls, and here the fishermen live and sleep during the early<br>
                spring. Every fisherman has a female helper, or manager as she 
                is<br>
                called, who baits his hooks, prepares warm beer for him when he<br>
                comes ashore, and gets the dinner cooked and ready for him by 
                the time he comes back to the hut tired and hungry. Besides this 
                the managers bring up the fish from the boats, cut them open, 
                prepare them, and have generally a great deal to do.<br>
                <br>
                Jurgen, his father, and several other fishermen and their managers<br>
                inhabited the same hut; Martin lived in the next one.<br>
                One of the girls, whose name was Else, had known Jurgen from<br>
                childhood; they were glad to see each other, and were of the same<br>
                opinion on many points, but in appearance they were entirely opposite; 
                for he was dark, and she was pale, and fair, and had flaxen hair, 
                and eyes as blue as the sea in sunshine.<br>
                <br>
                As they were walking together one day, Jurgen held her hand very<br>
                firmly in his, and she said to him:<br>
                <br>
                &quot;Jurgen, I have something I want to say to you; let me be 
                your<br>
                manager, for you are like a brother to me; but Martin, whose<br>
                housekeeper I am- he is my lover- but you need not tell this to 
                the<br>
                others.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                It seemed to Jurgen as if the loose sand was giving way under<br>
                his feet. He did not speak a word, but nodded his head, and that 
                meant &quot;yes.&quot; It was all that was necessary; but he suddenly 
                felt in his<br>
                heart that he hated Martin, and the more he thought the more he 
                felt<br>
                convinced that Martin had stolen away from him the only being 
                he<br>
                ever loved, and that this was Else: he had never thought of Else 
                in<br>
                this way before, but now it all became plain to him.<br>
                <br>
                When the sea is rather rough, and the fishermen are coming home 
                in<br>
                their great boats, it is wonderful to see how they cross the reefs.<br>
                One of them stands upright in the bow of the boat, and the others<br>
                watch him sitting with the oars in their hands. Outside the reef 
                it<br>
                looks as if the boat was not approaching land but going back to 
                sea;<br>
                then the man who is standing up gives them the signal that the 
                great<br>
                wave is coming which is to float them across the reef. The boat 
                is<br>
                lifted high into the air, so that the keel is seen from the shore; 
                the<br>
                next moment nothing can be seen, mast, keel, and people are all<br>
                hidden- it seems as though the sea had devoured them; but in a 
                few<br>
                moments they emerge like a great sea animal climbing up the waves, 
                and the oars move as if the creature had legs. The second and 
                third reef are passed in the same manner; then the fishermen jump 
                into the<br>
                water and push the boat towards the shore- every wave helps them-<br>
                and at length they have it drawn up, beyond the reach of the breakers.<br>
                <br>
                A wrong order given in front of the reef- the slightest hesitation- 
                and the boat would be lost, &quot;Then it would be all over with 
                me and Martin too!&quot; This thought passed through Jurgen's 
                mind one day while they<br>
                were out at sea, where his foster-father had been taken suddenly<br>
                ill. The fever had seized him. They were only a few oars' strokes 
                from<br>
                the reef, and Jurgen sprang from his seat and stood up in the 
                bow.<br>
                &quot;Father-let me come!&quot; he said, and he glanced at Martin 
                and across<br>
                the waves; every oar bent with the exertions of the rowers as 
                the<br>
                great wave came towards them, and he saw his father's pale face, 
                and<br>
                dared not obey the evil impulse that had shot through his brain. 
                The<br>
                boat came safely across the reef to land; but the evil thought<br>
                remained in his heart, and roused up every little fibre of<br>
                bitterness which he remembered between himself and Martin since 
                they had known each other. But he could not weave the fibres together, 
                nor did he endeavour to do so. He felt that Martin had robbed 
                him, and this was enough to make him hate his former friend. Several 
                of the fishermen saw this, but Martin did not- he remained as 
                obliging and talkative as ever, in fact he talked rather too much.<br>
                <br>
                Jurgen's foster-father took to his bed, and it became his death-bed, 
                for he died a week afterwards; and now Jurgen was heir to the 
                little house behind the sand-hills. It was small, certainly, but 
                still it was something, and Martin had nothing of the kind.<br>
                <br>
                &quot;You will not go to sea again, Jurgen, I suppose,&quot; observed 
                one of<br>
                the old fishermen. &quot;You will always stay with us now.&quot;<br>
                But this was not Jurgen's intention; he wanted to see something 
                of<br>
                the world. The eel-breeder of Fjaltring had an uncle at Old Skjagen,<br>
                who was a fisherman, but also a prosperous merchant with ships 
                upon the sea; he was said to be a good old man, and it would not 
                be a bad thing to enter his service. Old Skjagen lies in the extreme 
                north of Jutland, as far away from the Hunsby dunes as one can 
                travel in that country; and this is just what pleased Jurgen, 
                for he did not want<br>
                to remain till the wedding of Martin and Else, which would take<br>
                place in a week or two.<br>
                <br>
                The old fisherman said it was foolish to go away, for now that<br>
                Jurgen had a home Else would very likely be inclined to take him<br>
                instead of Martin.<br>
                <br>
                Jurgen gave such a vague answer that it was not easy to make out<br>
                what he meant- the old man brought Else to him, and she said:<br>
                &quot;You have a home now; you ought to think of that.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                And Jurgen thought of many things.<br>
                <br>
                The sea has heavy waves, but there are heavier waves in the<br>
                human heart. Many thoughts, strong and weak, rushed through Jurgen's 
                brain, and he said to Else:<br>
                <br>
                &quot;If Martin had a house like mine, which of us would you rather<br>
                have?&quot;<br>
                &quot;But Martin has no house and cannot get one.&quot;<br>
                &quot;Suppose he had one?&quot;<br>
                &quot;Well, then I would certainly take Martin, for that is what 
                my<br>
                heart tells me; but one cannot live upon love.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                Jurgen turned these things over in his mind all night. Something<br>
                was working within him, he hardly knew what it was, but it was 
                even<br>
                stronger than his love for Else; and so he went to Martin's, and<br>
                what he said and did there was well considered. He let the house 
                to<br>
                Martin on most liberal terms, saying that he wished to go to sea<br>
                again, because he loved it. And Else kissed him when she heard 
                of<br>
                it, for she loved Martin best.<br>
                <br>
                Jurgen proposed to start early in the morning, and on the<br>
                evening before his departure, when it was already getting rather 
                late,<br>
                he felt a wish to visit Martin once more. He started, and among 
                the<br>
                dunes met the old fisherman, who was angry at his leaving the 
                place.<br>
                <br>
                The old man made jokes about Martin, and declared there must be 
                some magic about that fellow, of whom the girls were so fond.<br>
                Jurgen did not pay any attention to his remarks, but said good-bye<br>
                to the old man and went on towards the house where Martin dwelt. 
                <br>
                He heard loud talking inside; Martin was not alone, and this made<br>
                Jurgen waver in his determination, for he did not wish to see 
                Else<br>
                again. On second thoughts, he decided that it was better not to 
                hear<br>
                any more thanks from Martin, and so he turned back.<br>
                <br>
                On the following morning, before the sun rose, he fastened his<br>
                knapsack on his back, took his wooden provision box in his hand, 
                and went away among the sand-hills towards the coast path. This 
                way was more pleasant than the heavy sand road, and besides it 
                was shorter; and he intended to go first to Fjaltring, near Bovbjerg, 
                where the eel-breeder lived, to whom he had promised a visit.<br>
                <br>
                The sea lay before him, clear and blue, and the mussel shells<br>
                and pebbles, the playthings of his childhood, crunched over his<br>
                feet. While he thus walked on his nose suddenly began to bleed; 
                it was a trifling occurrence, but trifles sometimes are of great<br>
                importance. A few large drops of blood fell upon one of his sleeves.<br>
                <br>
                He wiped them off and stopped the bleeding, and it seemed to him 
                as if this had cleared and lightened his brain. The sea-cale bloomed 
                here<br>
                and there in the sand as he passed. He broke off a spray and stuck<br>
                it in his hat; he determined to be merry and light-hearted, for 
                he was<br>
                going out into the wide world- &quot;a little way out, beyond 
                the bay,&quot;<br>
                as the young eels had said. &quot;Beware of bad people who will 
                catch<br>
                you, and skin you, and put you in the frying-pan!&quot; he repeated 
                in<br>
                his mind, and smiled, for he thought he should find his way through<br>
                the world- good courage is a strong weapon!<br>
                <br>
                The sun was high in the heavens when he approached the narrow<br>
                entrance to Nissum Bay. He looked back and saw a couple of horsemen 
                galloping a long distance behind him, and there were other people 
                with them. But this did not concern him.<br>
                <br>
                The ferry-boat was on the opposite side of the bay. Jurgen<br>
                called to the ferry-man, and the latter came over with his boat.<br>
                Jurgen stepped in; but before he had got half-way across, the 
                men whom he had seen riding so hastily, came up, hailed the ferry-man, 
                and commanded him to return in the name of the law. Jurgen did 
                not<br>
                understand the reason of this, but he thought it would be best 
                to turn<br>
                back, and therefore he himself took an oar and returned. As soon 
                as<br>
                the boat touched the shore, the men sprang on board, and before 
                he was aware of it, they had bound his hands with a rope.<br>
                <br>
                &quot;This wicked deed will cost you your life,&quot; they said. 
                &quot;It is a<br>
                good thing we have caught you.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                He was accused of nothing less than murder. Martin had been<br>
                found dead, with his throat cut. One of the fishermen, late on 
                the<br>
                previous evening, had met Jurgen going towards Martin's house; 
                this<br>
                was not the first time Jurgen had raised his knife against Martin,<br>
                so they felt sure that he was the murderer. The prison was in 
                a town<br>
                at a great distance, and the wind was contrary for going there 
                by sea;<br>
                but it would not take half an hour to get across the bay, and<br>
                another quarter of an hour would bring them to Norre-Vosborg, 
                the<br>
                great castle with ramparts and moat. One of Jurgen's captors was 
                a<br>
                fisherman, a brother of the keeper of the castle, and he said 
                it might<br>
                be managed that Jurgen should be placed for the present in the 
                dungeon at Vosborg, where Long Martha the gipsy had been shut 
                up till her execution. They paid no attention to Jurgen's defence; 
                the few drops of blood on his shirt-sleeve bore heavy witness 
                against him. <br>
                <br>
                But he was conscious of his innocence, and as there was no chance 
                of clearing himself at present he submitted to his fate.<br>
                <br>
                The party landed just at the place where Sir Bugge's castle had<br>
                stood, and where Jurgen had walked with his foster-parents after 
                the<br>
                burial feast, during. the four happiest days of his childhood. 
                He<br>
                was led by the well-known path, over the meadow to Vosborg; once<br>
                more the elders were in bloom and the lofty lime-trees gave forth<br>
                sweet fragrance, and it seemed as if it were but yesterday that 
                he had<br>
                last seen the spot. In each of the two wings of the castle there 
                was a<br>
                staircase which led to a place below the entrance, from whence 
                there<br>
                is access to a low, vaulted cellar. In this dungeon Long Martha 
                had<br>
                been imprisoned, and from here she was led away to the scaffold. 
                She had eaten the hearts of five children, and had imagined that 
                if she<br>
                could obtain two more she would be able to fly and make herself<br>
                invisible. In the middle of the roof of the cellar there was a<br>
                little narrow air-hole, but no window. The flowering lime trees<br>
                could not breathe refreshing fragrance into that abode, where<br>
                everything was dark and mouldy. There was only a rough bench in 
                the cell; but a good conscience is a soft pillow, and therefore 
                Jurgen<br>
                could sleep well.<br>
                <br>
                The thick oaken door was locked, and secured on the outside by<br>
                an iron bar; but the goblin of superstition can creep through 
                a<br>
                keyhole into a baron's castle just as easily as it can into a<br>
                fisherman's cottage, and why should he not creep in here, where 
                Jurgen sat thinking of Long Martha and her wicked deeds? Her last 
                thoughts on the night before her execution had filled this place, 
                and the magic that tradition asserted to have been practised here, 
                in Sir<br>
                Svanwedel's time, came into Jurgen's mind, and made him shudder; 
                but a sunbeam, a refreshing thought from without, penetrated his 
                heart<br>
                even here- it was the remembrance of the flowering elder and the 
                sweet smelling lime-trees.<br>
                <br>
                He was not left there long. They took him away to the town of<br>
                Ringkjobing, where he was imprisoned with equal severity.<br>
                Those times were not like ours. The common people were treated<br>
                harshly; and it was just after the days when farms were converted 
                into<br>
                knights' estates, when coachmen and servants were often made<br>
                magistrates, and had power to sentence a poor man, for a small<br>
                offence, to lose his property and to corporeal punishment. Judges 
                of<br>
                this kind were still to be found; and in Jutland, so far from 
                the<br>
                capital, and from the enlightened, well-meaning, head of the<br>
                Government, the law was still very loosely administered sometimes- 
                the smallest grievance Jurgen could expect was that his case should 
                be delayed.<br>
                <br>
                His dwelling was cold and comfortless; and how long would he be<br>
                obliged to bear all this? It seemed his fate to suffer misfortune<br>
                and sorrow innocently. He now had plenty of time to reflect on 
                the<br>
                difference of fortune on earth, and to wonder why this fate had 
                been<br>
                allotted to him; yet he felt sure that all would be made clear 
                in<br>
                the next life, the existence that awaits us when this life is 
                over.<br>
                His faith had grown strong in the poor fisherman's cottage; the<br>
                light which had never shone into his father's mind, in all the<br>
                richness and sunshine of Spain, was sent to him to be his comfort 
                in<br>
                poverty and distress, a sign of that mercy of God which never 
                fails.<br>
                The spring storms began to blow. The rolling and moaning of the<br>
                North Sea could be heard for miles inland when the wind was blowing, 
                and then it sounded like the rushing of a thousand waggons over 
                a hard road with a mine underneath. Jurgen heard these sounds 
                in his prison, and it was a relief to him. No music could have 
                touched his heart as did these sounds of the sea- the rolling 
                sea, the boundless<br>
                sea, on which a man can be borne across the world before the wind,<br>
                carrying his own house with him wherever he goes, just as the 
                snail<br>
                carries its home even into a strange country.<br>
                <br>
                He listened eagerly to its deep murmur and then the thought arose-<br>
                &quot;Free! free! How happy to be free, even barefooted and in 
                ragged<br>
                clothes!&quot; Sometimes, when such thoughts crossed his mind, 
                the fiery<br>
                nature rose within him, and he beat the wall with his clenched 
                fists.<br>
                Weeks, months, a whole year had gone by, when Niels the thief,<br>
                called also a horse-dealer, was arrested; and now better times 
                came,<br>
                and it was seen that Jurgen had been wrongly accused.<br>
                <br>
                On the afternoon before Jurgen's departure from home, and before<br>
                the murder, Niels the thief, had met Martin at a beer-house in 
                the<br>
                neighbourhood of Ringkjobing. A few glasses were drank, not enough 
                to cloud the brain, but enough to loosen Martin's tongue. He began 
                to boast and to say that he had obtained a house and intended 
                to marry, and when Niels asked him where he was going to get the 
                money, he slapped his pocket proudly and said:<br>
                <br>
                &quot;The money is here, where it ought to be.&quot;<br>
                This boast cost him his life; for when he went home Niels followed<br>
                him, and cut his throat, intending to rob the murdered man of 
                the<br>
                gold, which did not exist.<br>
                All this was circumstantially explained; but it is enough for 
                us<br>
                to know that Jurgen was set free. But what compensation did he 
                get for having been imprisoned a whole year, and shut out from 
                all<br>
                communication with his fellow creatures? They told him he was<br>
                fortunate in being proved innocent, and that he might go. The<br>
                burgomaster gave him two dollars for travelling expenses, and 
                many<br>
                citizens offered him provisions and beer- there were still good<br>
                people; they were not all hard and pitiless. But the best thing 
                of all<br>
                was that the merchant Bronne, of Skjagen, into whose service Jurgen<br>
                had proposed entering the year before, was just at that time on<br>
                business in the town of Ringkjobing. Bronne heard the whole story;<br>
                he was kind-hearted, and understood what Jurgen must have felt 
                and<br>
                suffered. Therefore he made up his mind to make it up to the poor 
                lad, and convince him that there were still kind folks in the 
                world.<br>
                So Jurgen went forth from prison as if to paradise, to find<br>
                freedom, affection, and trust. He was to travel this path now, 
                for<br>
                no goblet of life is all bitterness; no good man would pour out 
                such a<br>
                draught for his fellow-man, and how should He do it, Who is love<br>
                personified?<br>
                <br>
                &quot;Let everything be buried and forgotten,&quot; said Bronne, 
                the<br>
                merchant. &quot;Let us draw a thick line through last year: we 
                will even<br>
                burn the almanack. In two days we will start for dear, friendly,<br>
                peaceful Skjagen. People call it an out-of-the-way corner; but 
                it is a<br>
                good warm chimney-corner, and its windows open toward every part 
                of the world.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                What a journey that was: It was like taking fresh breath out of<br>
                the cold dungeon air into the warm sunshine. The heather bloomed 
                in<br>
                pride and beauty, and the shepherd-boy sat on a barrow and blew 
                his<br>
                pipe, which he had carved for himself out of a sheep bone. Fata<br>
                Morgana, the beautiful aerial phenomenon of the wilderness, appeared<br>
                with hanging gardens and waving forests, and the wonderful cloud<br>
                called &quot;Lokeman driving his sheep&quot; also was seen.<br>
                <br>
                Up towards Skjagen they went, through the land of the Wendels,<br>
                whence the men with long beards (the Longobardi or Lombards) had<br>
                emigrated in the reign of King Snio, when all the children and 
                old<br>
                people were to have been killed, till the noble Dame Gambaruk 
                proposed that the young people should emigrate. Jurgen knew all 
                this, he had some little knowledge; and although he did not know 
                the land of the Lombards beyond the lofty Alps, he had an idea 
                that it must be<br>
                there, for in his boyhood he had been in the south, in Spain. 
                He<br>
                thought of the plenteousness of the southern fruit, of the red<br>
                pomegranate flowers, of the humming, buzzing, and toiling in the 
                great beehive of a city he had seen; but home is the best place 
                after all, and Jurgen's home was Denmark.<br>
                <br>
                At last they arrived at &quot;Vendilskaga,&quot; as Skjagen is 
                called in old<br>
                Norwegian and Icelandic writings. At that time Old Skjagen, with 
                the<br>
                eastern and western town, extended for miles, with sand hills 
                and<br>
                arable land as far as the lighthouse near &quot;Grenen.&quot; 
                Then, as now,<br>
                the houses were strewn among the wind-raised sand-hills- a<br>
                wilderness in which the wind sports with the sand, and where the 
                voice of the sea-gull and wild swan strikes harshly on the ear.<br>
                <br>
              </p>
              <p> In the south-west, a mile from &quot;Grenen,&quot; lies Old 
                Skjagen;<br>
                merchant Bronne dwelt here, and this was also to be Jurgen's home<br>
                for the future. The dwelling-house was tarred, and all the small<br>
                out-buildings had been put together from pieces of wreck. There 
                was no fence, for indeed there was nothing to fence in except 
                the long rows of fishes which were hung upon lines, one above 
                the other, to dry in the wind. The entire coast was strewn with 
                spoiled herrings, for there were so many of these fish that a 
                net was scarcely thrown into the sea before it was filled. They 
                were caught by carloads, and many of them were either thrown back 
                into the sea or left to lie on the beach.<br>
                <br>
                The old man's wife and daughter and his servants also came to 
                meet<br>
                him with great rejoicing. There was a great squeezing of hands, 
                and<br>
                talking and questioning. And the daughter, what a sweet face and<br>
                bright eyes she had!<br>
                <br>
                The inside of the house was comfortable and roomy. Fritters,<br>
                that a king would have looked upon as a dainty dish, were placed 
                on<br>
                the table, and there was wine from the Skjagen vineyard- that 
                is,<br>
                the sea; for there the grapes come ashore ready pressed and prepared<br>
                in barrels and in bottles.<br>
                <br>
                When the mother and daughter heard who Jurgen was, and how<br>
                innocently he had suffered, they looked at him in a still more<br>
                friendly way; and pretty Clara's eyes had a look of especial<br>
                interest as she listened to his story. Jurgen found a happy home 
                in<br>
                Old Skjagen. It did his heart good, for it had been sorely tried. 
                He<br>
                had drunk the bitter goblet of love which softens or hardens the<br>
                heart, according to circumstances. Jurgen's heart was still soft- 
                it<br>
                was young, and therefore it was a good thing that Miss Clara was 
                going in three weeks' time to Christiansand in Norway, in her 
                father's ship, to visit an aunt and to stay there the whole winter.<br>
                On the Sunday before she went away they all went to church, to 
                the<br>
                <br>
                Holy Communion. The church was large and handsome, and had been 
                built centuries before by Scotchmen and Dutchmen; it stood some 
                little way out of the town. It was rather ruinous certainly, and 
                the road to it was heavy, through deep sand, but the people gladly 
                surmounted these difficulties to get to the house of God, to sing 
                psalms and to hear the sermon. The sand had heaped itself up round 
                the walls of the church, but the graves were kept free from it.<br>
                It was the largest church north of the Limfjorden. The Virgin<br>
                Mary, with a golden crown on her head and the child Jesus in her 
                arms, stood lifelike on the altar; the holy Apostles had been 
                carved in<br>
                the choir, and on the walls there were portraits of the old<br>
                burgomasters and councillors of Skjagen; the pulpit was of carved<br>
                work. The sun shone brightly into the church, and its radiance 
                fell on<br>
                the polished brass chandelier and on the little ship that hung 
                from<br>
                the vaulted roof.<br>
                <br>
                Jurgen felt overcome by a holy, childlike feeling, like that which<br>
                possessed him, when, as a boy, he stood in the splendid Spanish<br>
                cathedral. But here the feeling was different, for he felt conscious<br>
                of being one of the congregation.<br>
                <br>
                After the sermon followed Holy Communion. He partook of the<br>
                bread and wine, and it so happened that he knelt by the side of 
                Miss<br>
                Clara; but his thoughts were so fixed upon heaven and the Holy<br>
                Sacrament that he did not notice his neighbour until he rose from<br>
                his knees, and then he saw tears rolling down her cheeks.<br>
              </p>
              <p>She left Skjagen and went to Norway two days later. He remained<br>
                behind, and made himself useful on the farm and at the fishery. 
                He<br>
                went out fishing, and in those days fish were more plentiful and<br>
                larger than they are now. The shoals of the mackerel glittered 
                in<br>
                the dark nights, and indicated where they were swimming; the<br>
                gurnards snarled, and the crabs gave forth pitiful yells when 
                they<br>
                were chased, for fish are not so mute as people say.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Every Sunday Jurgen went to church; and when his eyes rested 
                on<br>
                the picture of the Virgin Mary over the altar as he sat there, 
                they<br>
                often glided away to the spot where they had knelt side by side.<br>
                Autumn came, and brought rain and snow with it; the water rose<br>
                up right into the town of Skjagen, the sand could not suck it 
                all<br>
                in, one had to wade through it or go by boat. The storms threw<br>
                vessel after vessel on the fatal reefs; there were snow-storm 
                and<br>
                sand-storms; the sand flew up to the houses, blocking the entrances,<br>
                so that people had to creep up through the chimneys; that was<br>
                nothing at all remarkable here. It was pleasant and cheerful<br>
                indoors, where peat fuel and fragments of wood from the wrecks<br>
                blazed and crackled upon the hearth. Merchant Bronne read aloud,<br>
                from an old chronicle, about Prince Hamlet of Denmark, who had 
                come over from England, landed near Bovbjerg, and fought a battle; 
                close by Ramme was his grave, only a few miles from the place 
                where the eel-breeder lived; hundreds of barrow rose there from 
                the heath, forming as it were an enormous churchyard. Merchant 
                Bronne had himself been at Hamlet's grave; they spoke about old 
                times, and about their neighbours, the English and the Scotch, 
                and Jurgen sang the air of &quot;The King of England's Son,&quot; 
                and of his splendid ship and its outfit.</p>
              <p> &quot;In the hour of peril when most men fear,<br>
                He clasped the bride that he held so dear,<br>
                And proved himself the son of a King;<br>
                Of his courage and valour let us sing.&quot;</p>
              <p> This verse Jurgen sang with so much feeling that his eyes<br>
                beamed, and they were black and sparkling since his infancy.<br>
                There was wealth, comfort, and happiness even among the domestic<br>
                animals, for they were all well cared for, and well kept. The<br>
                kitchen looked bright with its copper and tin utensils, and white<br>
                plates, and from the rafters hung hams, beef, and winter stores 
                in<br>
                plenty. This can still be seen in many rich farms on the west 
                coast of<br>
                Jutland: plenty to eat and drink, clean, prettily decorated rooms,<br>
                active minds, cheerful tempers, and hospitality can be found there, 
                as<br>
                in an Arab's tent.<br>
                <br>
                Jurgen had never spent such a happy time since the famous burial<br>
                feast, and yet Miss Clara was absent, except in the thoughts and<br>
                memory of all.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In April a ship was to start for Norway, and Jurgen was to sail 
                in<br>
                it. He was full of life and spirits, and looked so sturdy and 
                well<br>
                that Dame Bronne said it did her good to see him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And it does one good to look at you also, old wife,&quot; 
                said the<br>
                merchant. &quot;Jurgen has brought fresh life into our winter 
                evenings, and<br>
                into you too, mother. You look younger than ever this year, and 
                seem<br>
                well and cheerful. But then you were once the prettiest girl in<br>
                Viborg, and that is saying a great deal, for I have always found 
                the<br>
                Viborg girls the prettiest of any.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Jurgen said nothing, but he thought of a certain maiden of<br>
                Skjagen, whom he was soon to visit. The ship set sail for<br>
                Christiansand in Norway, and as the wind was favourable it soon<br>
                arrived there.<br>
              </p>
              <p>One morning merchant Bronne went out to the lighthouse, which<br>
                stands a little way out of Old Skjagen, not far from &quot;Grenen.&quot; 
                The<br>
                light was out, and the sun was already high in the heavens, when 
                he<br>
                mounted the tower. The sand-banks extend a whole mile from the<br>
                shore, beneath the water, outside these banks; many ships could 
                be<br>
                seen that day, and with the aid of his telescope the old man thought<br>
                he descried his own ship, the Karen Bronne. Yes! certainly, there<br>
                she was, sailing homewards with Clara and Jurgen on board.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Clara sat on deck, and saw the sand-hills gradually appearing 
                in<br>
                the distance; the church and lighthouse looked like a heron and 
                a swan rising from the blue waters. If the wind held good they 
                might reach home in about an hour. So near they were to home and 
                all its joys-so near to death and all its terrors! A plank in 
                the ship gave way,<br>
                and the water rushed in; the crew flew to the pumps, and did their<br>
                best to stop the leak. A signal of distress was hoisted, but they 
                were<br>
                still fully a mile from the shore. Some fishing boats were in 
                sight,<br>
                but they were too far off to be of any use. The wind blew towards<br>
                the land, the tide was in their favour, but it was all useless; 
                the<br>
                ship could not be saved.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Jurgen threw his right arm round Clara, and pressed her to him.<br>
                With what a look she gazed up into his face, as with a prayer 
                to God<br>
                for help he breasted the waves, which rushed over the sinking 
                ship!<br>
                She uttered a cry, but she felt safe and certain that he would 
                not<br>
                leave her to sink. And in this hour of terror and danger Jurgen 
                felt<br>
                as the king's son did, as told in the old song:</p>
              <p> &quot;In the hour of peril when most men fear,<br>
                He clasped the bride that he held so dear.&quot;</p>
              <p> How glad he felt that he was a good swimmer! He worked his way<br>
                onward with his feet and one arm, while he held the young girl 
                up<br>
                firmly with the other. He rested on the waves, he trod the water- 
                in<br>
                fact, did everything he could think of, in order not to fatigue<br>
                himself, and to reserve strength enough to reach land. He heard<br>
                Clara sigh, and felt her shudder convulsively, and he pressed 
                her more closely to him. Now and then a wave rolled over them, 
                the current lifted them; the water, although deep, was so clear 
                that for a<br>
                moment he imagined he saw the shoals of mackerel glittering, or<br>
                Leviathan himself ready to swallow them. Now the clouds cast a<br>
                shadow over the water, then again came the playing sunbeams; flocks 
                of loudly screaming birds passed over him, and the plump and lazy 
                wild ducks which allow themselves to be drifted by the waves rose 
                up<br>
                terrified at the sight of the swimmer. He began to feel his strength<br>
                decreasing, but he was only a few cable lengths' distance from 
                the<br>
                shore, and help was coming, for a boat was approaching him. At 
                this<br>
                moment he distinctly saw a white staring figure under the water- 
                a<br>
                wave lifted him up, and he came nearer to the figure- he felt 
                a<br>
                violent shock, and everything became dark around him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>On the sand reef lay the wreck of a ship, which was covered with<br>
                water at high tide; the white figure head rested against the anchor,<br>
                the sharp iron edge of which rose just above the surface. Jurgen 
                had<br>
                come in contact with this; the tide had driven him against it 
                with<br>
                great force. He sank down stunned with the blow, but the next 
                wave<br>
                lifted him and the young girl up again. Some fishermen, coming 
                with<br>
                a boat, seized them and dragged them into it. The blood streamed<br>
                down over Jurgen's face; he seemed dead, but still held the young 
                girl<br>
                so tightly that they were obliged to take her from him by force. 
                She<br>
                was pale and lifeless; they laid her in the boat, and rowed as 
                quickly<br>
                as possible to the shore. They tried every means to restore Clara 
                to<br>
                life, but it was all of no avail. Jurgen had been swimming for 
                some<br>
                distance with a corpse in his arms, and had exhausted his strength 
                for<br>
                one who was dead.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Jurgen still breathed, so the fishermen carried him to the nearest<br>
                house upon the sand-hills, where a smith and general dealer lived<br>
                who knew something of surgery, and bound up Jurgen's wounds in 
                a<br>
                temporary way until a surgeon could be obtained from the nearest<br>
                town the next day. The injured man's brain was affected, and in 
                his<br>
                delirium he uttered wild cries; but on the third day he lay quiet<br>
                and weak upon his bed; his life seemed to hang by a thread, and 
                the<br>
                physician said it would be better for him if this thread broke. 
                &quot;Let<br>
                us pray that God may take him,&quot; he said, &quot;for he will 
                never be the<br>
                same man again.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But life did not depart from him- the thread would not break,<br>
                but the thread of memory was severed; the thread of his mind had<br>
                been cut through, and what was still more grievous, a body remained- 
                a living healthy body that wandered about like a troubled spirit.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Jurgen remained in merchant Bronne's house. &quot;He was hurt 
                while<br>
                endeavouring to save our child,&quot; said the old man, &quot;and 
                now he is<br>
                our son.&quot; People called Jurgen insane, but that was not exactly 
                the<br>
                correct term. He was like an instrument in which the strings are 
                loose<br>
                and will give no sound; only occasionally they regained their 
                power<br>
                for a few minutes, and then they sounded as they used to do. He<br>
                would sing snatches of songs or old melodies, pictures of the 
                past<br>
                would rise before him, and then disappear in the mist, as it were, 
                but<br>
                as a general rule he sat staring into vacancy, without a thought. 
                We<br>
                may conjecture that he did not suffer, but his dark eyes lost 
                their<br>
                brightness, and looked like clouded glass.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Poor mad Jurgen,&quot; said the people. And this was the 
                end of a life<br>
                whose infancy was to have been surrounded with wealth and splendour 
                had his parents lived! All his great mental abilities had been 
                lost, nothing but hardship, sorrow, and disappointment had been 
                his fate. </p>
              <p>He was like a rare plant, torn from its native soil, and tossed 
                upon<br>
                the beach to wither there. And was this one of God's creatures,<br>
                fashioned in His own likeness, to have no better fate? Was he 
                to be<br>
                only the plaything of fortune? No! the all-loving Creator would<br>
                certainly repay him in the life to come for what he had suffered 
                and<br>
                lost here. &quot;The Lord is good to all; and His mercy is over 
                all His<br>
                works.&quot; The pious old wife of the merchant repeated these 
                words from the Psalms of David in patience and hope, and the prayer 
                of her<br>
                heart was that Jurgen might soon be called away to enter into<br>
                eternal life.<br>
              </p>
              <p>In the churchyard where the walls were surrounded with sand<br>
                Clara lay buried. Jurgen did not seem to know this; it did not 
                enter<br>
                his mind, which could only retain fragments of the past. Every<br>
                Sunday he went to church with the old people, and sat there<br>
                silently, staring vacantly before him. One day, when the Psalms 
                were<br>
                being sung, he sighed deeply, and his eyes became bright; they 
                were<br>
                fixed upon a place near the altar where he had knelt with his 
                friend<br>
                who was dead. He murmured her name, and became deadly pale, and<br>
                tears rolled down his cheeks. They led him out of church; he told<br>
                those standing round him that he was well, and had never been 
                ill; he,<br>
                who had been so grievously afflicted, the outcast, thrown upon 
                the<br>
                world, could not remember his sufferings. The Lord our Creator 
                is wise and full of loving kindness- who can doubt it?<br>
              </p>
              <p>In Spain, where balmy breezes blow over the Moorish cupolas and<br>
                gently stir the orange and myrtle groves, where singing and the<br>
                sound of the castanets are always heard, the richest merchant 
                in the<br>
                place, a childless old man, sat in a luxurious house, while children<br>
                marched in procession through the streets with waving flags and<br>
                lighted tapers. If he had been able to press his children to his<br>
                heart, his daughter, or her child, that had, perhaps never seen 
                the<br>
                light of day, far less the kingdom of heaven, how much of his 
                wealth<br>
                would he not have given! &quot;Poor child!&quot; Yes, poor child- 
                a child still,<br>
                yet more than thirty years old, for Jurgen had arrived at this 
                age<br>
                in Old Skjagen.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The shifting sands had covered the graves in the courtyard,<br>
                quite up to the church walls, but still, the dead must be buried 
                among<br>
                their relatives and the dear ones who had gone before them. Merchant<br>
                Bronne and his wife now rested with their children under the white<br>
                sand.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was in the spring- the season of storms. The sand from the<br>
                dunes was whirled up in clouds; the sea was rough, and flocks 
                of birds flew like clouds in the storm, screaming across the sand-hills.<br>
                Shipwreck followed upon shipwreck on the reefs between Old Skagen 
                and the Hunsby dunes.<br>
              </p>
              <p>One evening Jurgen sat in his room alone: all at once his mind<br>
                seemed to become clearer, and a restless feeling came over him, 
                such<br>
                as had often, in his younger days, driven him out to wander over 
                the<br>
                sand-hills or on the heath. &quot;Home, home!&quot; he cried. 
                No one heard<br>
                him. He went out and walked towards the dunes. Sand and stones 
                blew into his face, and whirled round him; he went in the direction 
                of<br>
                the church. The sand was banked up the walls, half covering the<br>
                windows, but it had been cleared away in front of the door, and 
                the<br>
                entrance was free and easy to open, so Jurgen went into the church.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The storm raged over the town of Skjagen; there had not been<br>
                such a terrible tempest within the memory of the inhabitants, 
                nor such<br>
                a rough sea. But Jurgen was in the temple of God, and while the<br>
                darkness of night reigned outside, a light arose in his soul that<br>
                was never to depart from it; the heavy weight that pressed on 
                his<br>
                brain burst asunder. He fancied he heard the organ, but it was 
                only<br>
                the storm and the moaning of the sea. He sat down on one of the 
                seats, and lo! the candies were lighted one by one, and there 
                was<br>
                brightness and grandeur such as he had only seen in the Spanish<br>
                cathedral. The portraits of the old citizens became alive, stepped<br>
                down from the walls against which they had hung for centuries, 
                and<br>
                took seats near the church door. The gates flew open, and all 
                the dead people from the churchyard came in, and filled the church, 
                while<br>
                beautiful music sounded. Then the melody of the psalm burst forth,<br>
                like the sound of the waters, and Jurgen saw that his foster parents<br>
                from the Hunsby dunes were there, also old merchant Bronne with 
                his<br>
                wife and their daughter Clara, who gave him her hand. They both 
                went up to the altar where they had knelt before, and the priest 
                joined<br>
                their hands and united them for life. Then music was heard again; 
                it<br>
                was wonderfully sweet, like a child's voice, full of joy and<br>
                expectation, swelling to the powerful tones of a full organ, sometimes<br>
                soft and sweet, then like the sounds of a tempest, delightful 
                and<br>
                elevating to hear, yet strong enough to burst the stone tombs 
                of the<br>
                dead. Then the little ship that hung from the roof of the choir 
                was<br>
                let down and looked wonderfully large and beautiful with its silken<br>
                sails and rigging:</p>
              <p> &quot;The ropes were of silk, the anchor of gold,<br>
                And everywhere riches and pomp untold,&quot;as the old song says.</p>
              <p><br>
                The young couple went on board, accompanied by the whole<br>
                congregation, for there was room and enjoyment for them all. Then<br>
                the walls and arches of the church were covered with flowering<br>
                junipers and lime trees breathing forth fragrance; the branches 
                waved,<br>
                creating a pleasant coolness; they bent and parted, and the ship<br>
                sailed between them through the air and over the sea. Every candle<br>
                in the church became a star, and the wind sang a hymn in which 
                they<br>
                all joined. &quot;Through love to glory, no life is lost, the 
                future is<br>
                full of blessings and happiness. Hallelujah!&quot; These were 
                the last<br>
                words Jurgen uttered in this world, for the thread that bound 
                his<br>
                immortal soul was severed, and nothing but the dead body lay in 
                the<br>
                dark church, while the storm raged outside, covering it with loose<br>
                sand.</p>
              <p><br>
                The next day was Sunday, and the congregation and their pastor<br>
                went to the church. The road had always been heavy, but now it 
                was<br>
                almost unfit for use, and when they at last arrived at the church, 
                a<br>
                great heap of sand lay piled up in front of them. The whole church 
                was completely buried in sand. The clergyman offered a short prayer, 
                and said that God had closed the door of His house here, and that 
                the<br>
                congregation must go and build a new one for Him somewhere else. 
                So they sung a hymn in the open air, and went home again.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Jurgen could not be found anywhere in the town of Skjagen, nor<br>
                on the dunes, though they searched for him everywhere. They came 
                to the conclusion that one of the great waves, which had rolled 
                far up<br>
                on the beach, had carried him away; but his body lay buried in 
                a<br>
                great sepulchre- the church itself. The Lord had thrown down a<br>
                covering for his grave during the storm, and the heavy mound of 
                sand<br>
                lies upon it to this day. The drifting sand had covered the vaulted<br>
                roof of the church, the arched cloisters, and the stone aisles. 
                The<br>
                white thorn and the dog rose now blossom above the place where 
                the<br>
                church lies buried, but the spire, like an enormous monument over 
                a<br>
                grave, can be seen for miles round. No king has a more splendid<br>
                memorial. Nothing disturbs the peaceful sleep of the dead. I was 
                the<br>
                first to hear this story, for the storm sung it to me among the<br>
                sand-hills.</p>

              <p class="h" align="center"> SOMETHING</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> &quot;I MEAN to be somebody, and do something useful in the 
                world,&quot;<br>
                said the eldest of five brothers. &quot;I don't care how humble 
                my position<br>
                is, so that I can only do some good, which will be something. 
                I intend<br>
                to be a brickmaker; bricks are always wanted, and I shall be really<br>
                doing something.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Your 'something' is not enough for me,&quot; said the second<br>
                brother; &quot;what you talk of doing is nothing at all, it is 
                journeyman's<br>
                work, or might even be done by a machine. No! I should prefer 
                to be<br>
                a builder at once, there is something real in that. A man gains 
                a<br>
                position, he becomes a citizen, has his own sign, his own house 
                of<br>
                call for his workmen: so I shall be a builder. If all goes well, 
                in<br>
                time I shall become a master, and have my own journeymen, and 
                my<br>
                wife will be treated as a master's wife. This is what I call<br>
                something.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I call it all nothing,&quot; said the third; &quot;not 
                in reality any<br>
                position. There are many in a town far above a master builder 
                in<br>
                position. You may be an upright man, but even as a master you 
                will<br>
                only be ranked among common men. I know better what to do than 
                that. I will be an architect, which will place me among those 
                who possess riches and intellect, and who speculate in art. I 
                shall certainly have to rise by my own endeavors from a bricklayer's 
                laborer, or as a<br>
                carpenter's apprentice- a lad wearing a paper cap, although I 
                now wear a silk hat. I shall have to fetch beer and spirits for 
                the journeymen, and they will call me 'thou,' which will be an 
                insult. I shall<br>
                endure it, however, for I shall look upon it all as a mere representation, 
                a masquerade, a mummery, which to-morrow, that is,<br>
                when I myself as a journeyman, shall have served my time, will 
                vanish, and I shall go my way, and all that has passed will be 
                nothing to me. Then I shall enter the academy, and get instructed 
                in drawing, and be called an architect. I may even attain to rank, 
                and have<br>
                something placed before or after my name, and I shall build as<br>
                others have done before me. By this there will be always 'something'<br>
                to make me remembered, and is not that worth living for?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Not in my opinion,&quot; said the fourth; &quot;I will 
                never follow the<br>
                lead of others, and only imitate what they have done. I will be 
                a<br>
                genius, and become greater than all of you together. I will create 
                a<br>
                new style of building, and introduce a plan for erecting houses<br>
                suitable to the climate, with material easily obtained in the 
                country,<br>
                and thus suit national feeling and the developments of the age,<br>
                besides building a storey for my own genius.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But supposing the climate and the material are not good 
                for<br>
                much,&quot; said the fifth brother, &quot;that would be very unfortunate 
                for<br>
                you, and have an influence over your experiments. Nationality 
                may<br>
                assert itself until it becomes affectation, and the developments 
                of<br>
                a century may run wild, as youth often does. I see clearly that 
                none<br>
                of you will ever really be anything worth notice, however you 
                may<br>
                now fancy it. But do as you like, I shall not imitate you. I mean 
                to<br>
                keep clear of all these things, and criticize what you do. In 
                every<br>
                action something imperfect may be discovered, something not right,<br>
                which I shall make it my business to find out and expose; that 
                will be<br>
                something, I fancy.&quot; And he kept his word, and became a critic.<br>
              </p>
              <p>People said of this fifth brother, &quot;There is something very 
                precise about him; he has a good head-piece, but he does nothing.&quot; 
                And<br>
                on that very account they thought he must be something.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Now, you see, this is a little history which will never end; 
                as<br>
                long as the world exists, there will always be men like these 
                five<br>
                brothers. And what became of them? Were they each nothing or<br>
                something? You shall hear; it is quite a history.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The eldest brother, he who fabricated bricks, soon discovered 
                that<br>
                each brick, when finished, brought him in a small coin, if only 
                a<br>
                copper one; and many copper pieces, if placed one upon another, 
                can be changed into a shining shilling; and at whatever door a 
                person knocks, who has a number of these in his hands, whether 
                it be the baker's, the butcher's, or the tailor's, the door flies 
                open, and he can get all he wants. So you see the value of bricks. 
                Some of the bricks, however, crumbled to pieces, or were broken, 
                but the elder brother found a use for even these.<br>
              </p>
              <p>On the high bank of earth, which formed a dyke on the sea-coast, 
                a<br>
                poor woman named Margaret wished to build herself a house, so 
                all<br>
                the imperfect bricks were given to her, and a few whole ones with<br>
                them; for the eldest brother was a kind-hearted man, although 
                he never achieved anything higher than making bricks. The poor 
                woman built herself a little house- it was small and narrow, and 
                the window was quite crooked, the door too low, and the straw 
                roof might have been better thatched. But still it was a shelter, 
                and from within you could look far over the sea, which dashed 
                wildly against the sea-wall on which the little house was built. 
                The salt waves sprinkled their white foam over it, but it stood 
                firm, and remained long after he who had given the bricks to build 
                it was dead and buried.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The second brother of course knew better how to build than poor<br>
                Margaret, for he served an apprenticeship to learn it. When his 
                time<br>
                was up, he packed up his knapsack, and went on his travels, singing<br>
                the journeyman's song,-</p>
              <p> &quot;While young, I can wander without a care,<br>
                And build new houses everywhere;<br>
                Fair and bright are my dreams of home,<br>
                Always thought of wherever I roam.</p>
              <p> Hurrah for a workman's life of glee!<br>
                There's a loved one at home who thinks of me;<br>
                Home and friends I can ne'er forget,<br>
                And I mean to be a master yet.&quot;</p>
              <p>And that is what he did. On his return home, he became a master<br>
                builder,- built one house after another in the town, till they<br>
                formed quite a street, which, when finished, became really an 
                ornament to the town. These houses built a house for him in return, 
                which was to be his own. But how can houses build a house? If 
                the houses were asked, they could not answer; but the people would 
                understand, and say, &quot;Certainly the street built his house 
                for him.&quot; It was not very large, and the floor was of lime; 
                but when he danced with his bride on the lime-covered floor, it 
                was to him white and shining, and from every stone in the wall 
                flowers seemed to spring forth and decorate the room as with the 
                richest tapestry. It was really a pretty house, and in it were 
                a happy pair. The flag of the corporation fluttered before it, 
                and the journeymen and apprentices shouted &quot;Hurrah.&quot; 
                He had gained his position, he had made himself something, and 
                at last he died, which was &quot;something&quot; too.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Now we come to the architect, the third brother, who had been<br>
                first a carpenter's apprentice, had worn a cap, and served as 
                an<br>
                errand boy, but afterwards went to the academy, and risen to be 
                an<br>
                architect, a high and noble gentleman. Ah yes, the houses of the 
                new<br>
                street, which the brother who was a master builder erected, may 
                have<br>
                built his house for him, but the street received its name from 
                the<br>
                architect, and the handsomest house in the street became his property.<br>
              </p>
              <p>That was something, and he was &quot;something,&quot; for he 
                had a list of<br>
                titles before and after his name. His children were called &quot;wellborn,&quot;<br>
                and when he died, his widow was treated as a lady of position, 
                and<br>
                that was &quot;something.&quot; His name remained always written 
                at the corner<br>
                of the street, and lived in every one's mouth as its name. Yes, 
                this<br>
                also was something.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And what about the genius of the family- the fourth brother- 
                who<br>
                wanted to invent something new and original? He tried to build 
                a lofty<br>
                storey himself, but it fell to pieces, and he fell with it and 
                broke<br>
                his neck. However, he had a splendid funeral, with the city flags<br>
                and music in the procession; flowers were strewn on the pavement,<br>
                and three orations were spoken over his grave, each one longer 
                than<br>
                the other. He would have liked this very much during his life, 
                as well<br>
                as the poems about him in the papers, for he liked nothing so 
                well<br>
                as to be talked of. A monument was also erected over his grave. 
                It was only another storey over him, but that was &quot;something,&quot; 
                Now he was dead, like the three other brothers.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The youngest- the critic- outlived them all, which was quite 
                right<br>
                for him. It gave him the opportunity of having the last word, 
                which to<br>
                him was of great importance. People always said he had a good<br>
                head-piece. At last his hour came, and he died, and arrived at 
                the<br>
                gates of heaven. Souls always enter these gates in pairs; so he<br>
                found himself standing and waiting for admission with another; 
                and who should it be but old dame Margaret, from the house on 
                the dyke! </p>
              <p>&quot;It is evidently for the sake of contrast that I and this 
                wretched soul<br>
                should arrive here exactly at the same time,&quot; said the critic. 
                &quot;Pray<br>
                who are you, my good woman?&quot; said he; &quot;do you want to 
                get in here<br>
                too?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the old woman curtsied as well as she could; she thought 
                it<br>
                must be St. Peter himself who spoke to her. &quot;I am a poor 
                old woman,&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>she said, &quot;without my family. I am old Margaret, that lived 
                in the<br>
                house on the dyke.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well, and what have you done- what great deed have you<br>
                performed down below?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I have done nothing at all in the world that could give 
                me a<br>
                claim to have these doors open for me,&quot; she said. &quot;It 
                would be only<br>
                through mercy that I can be allowed to slip in through the gate.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;In what manner did you leave the world?&quot; he asked, 
                just for the<br>
                sake of saying something; for it made him feel very weary to stand<br>
                there and wait.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;How I left the world?&quot; she replied; &quot;why, I can 
                scarcely tell<br>
                you. During the last years of my life I was sick and miserable, 
                and<br>
                I was unable to bear creeping out of bed suddenly into the frost 
                and<br>
                cold. Last winter was a hard winter, but I have got over it all 
                now.<br>
                There were a few mild days, as your honor, no doubt, knows. The 
                ice lay thickly on the lake, as far one could see. The people 
                came from the town, and walked upon it, and they say there were 
                dancing and skating upon it, I believe, and a great feasting. 
                The sound of<br>
                beautiful music came into my poor little room where I lay. Towards<br>
                evening, when the moon rose beautifully, though not yet in her 
                full<br>
                splendor, I glanced from my bed over the wide sea; and there, 
                just<br>
                where the sea and sky met, rose a curious white cloud. I lay looking<br>
                at the cloud till I observed a little black spot in the middle 
                of<br>
                it, which gradually grew larger and larger, and then I knew what 
                it<br>
                meant- I am old and experienced; and although this token is not<br>
                often seen, I knew it, and a shuddering seized me. Twice in my 
                life<br>
                had I seen this same thing, and I knew that there would be an 
                awful<br>
                storm, with a spring tide, which would overwhelm the poor people 
                who were now out on the ice, drinking, dancing, and making merry. 
              </p>
              <p>Young and old, the whole city, were there; who was to warn them, 
                if no one noticed the sign, or knew what it meant as I did? I 
                was so alarmed, that I felt more strength and life than I had 
                done for some time. I got out of bed, and reached the window; 
                I could not crawl any<br>
                farther from weakness and exhaustion; but I managed to open the<br>
                window. I saw the people outside running and jumping about on 
                the ice; I saw the beautiful flags waving in the wind; I heard 
                the boys<br>
                shouting, 'Hurrah!' and the lads and lasses singing, and everything<br>
                full of merriment and joy. But there was the white cloud with 
                the<br>
                black spot hanging over them. I cried out as loudly as I could, 
                but no<br>
                one heard me; I was too far off from the people. Soon would the<br>
                storm burst, the ice break, and all who were on it be irretrievably<br>
                lost. They could not hear me, and to go to them was quite out 
                of my<br>
                power. Oh, if I could only get them safe on land! Then came the<br>
                thought, as if from heaven, that I would rather set fire to my 
                bed,<br>
                and let the house be burnt down, than that so many people should<br>
                perish miserably. I got a light, and in a few moments the red 
                flames<br>
                leaped up as a beacon to them. I escaped fortunately as far as 
                the<br>
                threshold of the door; but there I fell down and remained: I could<br>
                go no farther. The flames rushed out towards me, flickered on 
                the<br>
                window, and rose high above the roof. The people on the ice became<br>
                aware of the fire, and ran as fast as possible to help a poor 
                sick<br>
                woman, who, as they thought, was being burnt to death. There was 
                not one who did not run. I heard them coming, and I also at the 
                same<br>
                time was conscious of a rush of air and a sound like the roar 
                of heavy<br>
                artillery. The spring flood was lifting the ice covering, which<br>
                brake into a thousand pieces. But the people had reached the sea-wall, 
                where the sparks were flying round. I had saved them all; but 
                I<br>
                suppose I could not survive the cold and fright; so I came up 
                here<br>
                to the gates of paradise. I am told they are open to poor creatures<br>
                such as I am, and I have now no house left on earth; but I do 
                not<br>
                think that will give me a claim to be admitted here.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the gates were opened, and an angel led the old woman in. 
                She<br>
                had dropped one little straw out of her straw bed, when she set 
                it<br>
                on fire to save the lives of so many. It had been changed into 
                the<br>
                purest gold- into gold that constantly grew and expanded into<br>
                flowers and fruit of immortal beauty.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;See,&quot; said the angel, pointing to the wonderful straw, 
                &quot;this is<br>
                what the poor woman has brought. What dost thou bring? I know 
                thou hast accomplished nothing, not even made a single brick. 
                Even if<br>
                thou couldst return, and at least produce so much, very likely, 
                when<br>
                made, the brick would be useless, unless done with a good will,<br>
                which is always something. But thou canst not return to earth, 
                and I<br>
                can do nothing for thee.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the poor soul, the old mother who had lived in the house 
                on<br>
                the dyke, pleaded for him. She said, &quot;His brother made all 
                the stone<br>
                and bricks, and sent them to me to build my poor little dwelling,<br>
                which was a great deal to do for a poor woman like me. Could not 
                all<br>
                these bricks and pieces be as a wall of stone to prevail for him? 
                It<br>
                is an act of mercy; he is wanting it now; and here is the very<br>
                fountain of mercy.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Then,&quot; said the angel, &quot;thy brother, he who has 
                been looked<br>
                upon as the meanest of you all, he whose honest deeds to thee 
                appeared so humble,- it is he who has sent you this heavenly gift. 
              </p>
              <p>Thou shalt not be turned away. Thou shalt have permission to 
                stand without the gate and reflect, and repent of thy life on 
                earth; but thou shalt not be admitted here until thou hast performed 
                one good deed of repentance, which will indeed for thee be something.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I could have expressed that better,&quot; thought the critic; 
                but he<br>
                did not say it aloud, which for him was SOMETHING, after all.</p>

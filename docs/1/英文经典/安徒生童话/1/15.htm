              <p class="h" align="center"> IB AND LITTLE CHRISTINA</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> IN the forest that extends from the banks of the Gudenau, in 
                North<br>
                Jutland, a long way into the country, and not far from the clear<br>
                stream, rises a great ridge of land, which stretches through the<br>
                wood like a wall. Westward of this ridge, and not far from the<br>
                river, stands a farmhouse, surrounded by such poor land that the 
                sandy soil shows itself between the scanty ears of rye and wheat 
                which grow in it. Some years have passed since the people who 
                lived here cultivated these fields; they kept three sheep, a pig, 
                and two oxen; in fact they maintained themselves very well, they 
                had quite enough to live upon, as people generally have who are 
                content with their lot. They even could have afforded to keep 
                two horses, but it was a saying among the farmers in those parts, 
                &quot;The horse eats himself up;&quot; that is to say, he eats 
                as much as he earns. Jeppe Jans<br>
                cultivated his fields in summer, and in the winter he made wooden<br>
                shoes. He also had an assistant, a lad who understood as well 
                as he<br>
                himself did how to make wooden shoes strong, but light, and in 
                the<br>
                fashion. They carved shoes and spoons, which paid well; therefore 
                no one could justly call Jeppe Jans and his family poor people. 
                Little<br>
                Ib, a boy of seven years old and the only child, would sit by,<br>
                watching the workmen, or cutting a stick, and sometimes his finger<br>
                instead of the stick. But one day Ib succeeded so well in his<br>
                carving that he made two pieces of wood look really like two little<br>
                wooden shoes, and he determined to give them as a present to Little<br>
                Christina.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And who was Little Christina?&quot; She was the boatman's 
                daughter,<br>
                graceful and delicate as the child of a gentleman; had she been<br>
                dressed differently, no one would have believed that she lived 
                in a<br>
                hut on the neighboring heath with her father. He was a widower, 
                and<br>
                earned his living by carrying firewood in his large boat from 
                the<br>
                forest to the eel-pond and eel-weir, on the estate of Silkborg, 
                and<br>
                sometimes even to the distant town of Randers. There was no one<br>
                under whose care he could leave Little Christina; so she was almost<br>
                always with him in his boat, or playing in the wood among the<br>
                blossoming heath, or picking the ripe wild berries. Sometimes, 
                when<br>
                her father had to go as far as the town, he would take Little<br>
                Christina, who was a year younger than Ib, across the heath to 
                the<br>
                cottage of Jeppe Jans, and leave her there. Ib and Christina agreed<br>
                together in everything; they divided their bread and berries when 
                they<br>
                were hungry; they were partners in digging their little gardens;<br>
                they ran, and crept, and played about everywhere. Once they wandered 
                a long way into the forest, and even ventured together to climb 
                the high ridge. Another time they found a few snipes' eggs in 
                the wood, which was a great event. Ib had never been on the heath 
                where Christina's father lived, nor on the river; but at last 
                came an opportunity.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Christina's father invited him to go for a sail in his boat; 
                and the<br>
                evening before, he accompanied the boatman across the heath to 
                his<br>
                house. The next morning early, the two children were placed on 
                the top of a high pile of firewood in the boat, and sat eating 
                bread and<br>
                wild strawberries, while Christina's father and his man drove 
                the boat<br>
                forward with poles. They floated on swiftly, for the tide was 
                in their<br>
                favor, passing over lakes, formed by the stream in its course;<br>
                sometimes they seemed quite enclosed by reeds and water-plants, 
                yet<br>
                there was always room for them to pass out, although the old trees<br>
                overhung the water and the old oaks stretched out their bare branches, 
                as if they had turned up their sleeves and wished to show their 
                knotty, naked arms. Old alder-trees, whose roots were loosened 
                from the banks, clung with their fibres to the bottom of the stream, 
                and the tops of the branches above the water looked like little 
                woody<br>
                islands. The water-lilies waved themselves to and fro on the river,<br>
                everything made the excursion beautiful, and at last they came 
                to<br>
                the great eel-weir, where the water rushed through the flood-gates;<br>
                and the children thought this a beautiful sight. In those days 
                there<br>
                was no factory nor any town house, nothing but the great farm, 
                with<br>
                its scanty-bearing fields, in which could be seen a few herd of<br>
                cattle, and one or two farm laborers. The rushing of the water 
                through<br>
                the sluices, and the scream of the wild ducks, were almost the 
                only<br>
                signs of active life at Silkborg. After the firewood had been<br>
                unloaded, Christina's father bought a whole bundle of eels and 
                a<br>
                sucking-pig, which were all placed in a basket in the stern of 
                the<br>
                boat. Then they returned again up the stream; and as the wind 
                was<br>
                favorable, two sails were hoisted, which carried the boat on as 
                well<br>
                as if two horses had been harnessed to it. As they sailed on, 
                they<br>
                came by chance to the place where the boatman's assistant lived, 
                at<br>
                a little distance from the bank of the river. The boat was moored; 
                and<br>
                the two men, after desiring the children to sit still, both went 
                on<br>
                shore. they obeyed this order for a very short time, and then 
                forgot<br>
                it altogether. First they peeped into the basket containing the 
                eels<br>
                and the sucking-pig; then they must needs pull out the pig and 
                take it<br>
                in their hands, and feel it, and touch it; and as they both wanted<br>
                to hold it at the same time, the consequence was that they let 
                it fall<br>
                into the water, and the pig sailed away with the stream.<br>
                Here was a terrible disaster. Ib jumped ashore, and ran a little<br>
                distance from the boat.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, take me with you,&quot; cried Christina; and she sprang 
                after him.<br>
                In a few minutes they found themselves deep in a thicket, and 
                could no longer see the boat or the shore. They ran on a little 
                farther, and<br>
                then Christina fell down, and began to cry.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Ib helped her up, and said, &quot;Never mind; follow me. Yonder 
                is<br>
                the house.&quot; But the house was not yonder; and they wandered 
                still<br>
                farther, over the dry rustling leaves of the last year, and treading<br>
                on fallen branches that crackled under their little feet; then 
                they<br>
                heard a loud, piercing cry, and they stood still to listen.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Presently the scream of an eagle sounded through the wood; it 
                was an<br>
                ugly cry, and it frightened the children; but before them, in 
                the<br>
                thickest part of the forest, grew the most beautiful blackberries,<br>
                in wonderful quantities. They looked so inviting that the children<br>
                could not help stopping; and they remained there so long eating,<br>
                that their mouths and cheeks became quite black with the juice.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Presently they heard the frightful scream again, and Christina<br>
                said, &quot;We shall get into trouble about that pig.&quot;<br>
                &quot;Oh, never mind,&quot; said Ib; &quot;we will go home to 
                my father's<br>
                house. It is here in the wood.&quot; So they went on, but the 
                road led them<br>
                out of the way; no house could be seen, it grew dark, and the 
                children<br>
                were afraid. The solemn stillness that reigned around them was 
                now and then broken by the shrill cries of the great horned owl 
                and other<br>
                birds that they knew nothing of. At last they both lost themselves<br>
                in the thicket; Christina began to cry, and then Ib cried too; 
                and,<br>
                after weeping and lamenting for some time, they stretched themselves<br>
                down on the dry leaves and fell asleep.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The sun was high in the heavens when the two children woke. They<br>
                felt cold; but not far from their resting-place, on a hill, the 
                sun<br>
                was shining through the trees. They thought if they went there 
                they<br>
                should be warm, and Ib fancied he should be able to see his father's<br>
                house from such a high spot. But they were far away from home 
                now, in quite another part of the forest. They clambered to the 
                top of<br>
                the rising ground, and found themselves on the edge of a declivity,<br>
                which sloped down to a clear transparent lake. Great quantities 
                of<br>
                fish could be seen through the clear water, sparkling in the sun's<br>
                rays; they were quite surprised when they came so suddenly upon 
                such an unexpected sight.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Close to where they stood grew a hazel-bush, covered with<br>
                beautiful nuts. They soon gathered some, cracked them, and ate 
                the<br>
                fine young kernels, which were only just ripe. But there was another<br>
                surprise and fright in store for them. Out of the thicket stepped 
                a<br>
                tall old woman, her face quite brown, and her hair of a deep shining<br>
                black; the whites of her eyes glittered like a Moor's; on her 
                back she<br>
                carried a bundle, and in her hand a knotted stick. She was a gypsy.<br>
                The children did not at first understand what she said. She drew 
                out<br>
                of her pocket three large nuts, in which she told them were hidden 
                the<br>
                most beautiful and lovely things in the world, for they were wishing<br>
                nuts. Ib looked at her, and as she spoke so kindly, he took courage,<br>
                and asked her if she would give him the nuts; and the woman gave<br>
                them to him, and then gathered some more from the bushes for<br>
                herself, quite a pocket full. Ib and Christina looked at the wishing<br>
                nuts with wide open eyes.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Is there in this nut a carriage, with a pair of horses?&quot; 
                asked<br>
                Ib.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, there is a golden carriage, with two golden horses,&quot; 
                replied<br>
                the woman.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Then give me that nut,&quot; said Christina; so Ib gave 
                it to her, and<br>
                the strange woman tied up the nut for her in her handkerchief.<br>
                Ib held up another nut. &quot;Is there, in this nut, a pretty 
                little<br>
                neckerchief like the one Christina has on her neck?&quot; asked 
                Ib.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There are ten neckerchiefs in it,&quot; she replied, &quot;as 
                well as<br>
                beautiful dresses, stockings, and a hat and veil.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Then I will have that one also,&quot; said Christina; &quot;and 
                it is a<br>
                pretty one too. And then Ib gave her the second nut.<br>
                The third was a little black thing. &quot;You may keep that one,&quot;<br>
                said Christina; &quot;it is quite as pretty.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What is in it?&quot; asked Ib.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The best of all things for you,&quot; replied the gypsy. 
                So Ib held<br>
                the nut very tight.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the woman promised to lead the children to the right path,<br>
                that they might find their way home: and they went forward certainly<br>
                in quite another direction to the one they meant to take; therefore 
                no<br>
                one ought to speak against the woman, and say that she wanted 
                to steal the children. In the wild wood-path they met a forester 
                who knew Ib, and, by his help, Ib and Christina reached home, 
                where they found every one had been very anxious about them. They 
                were pardoned and forgiven, although they really had both done 
                wrong, and deserved to get into trouble; first, because they had 
                let the sucking-pig fall into the water; and, secondly, because 
                they had run away. Christina was taken back to her father's house 
                on the heath, and Ib remained in the farm-house on the borders 
                of the wood, near the great land ridge.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The first thing Ib did that evening was to take out of his<br>
                pocket the little black nut, in which the best thing of all was 
                said<br>
                to be enclosed. He laid it carefully between the door and the<br>
                door-post, and then shut the door so that the nut cracked directly.<br>
                But there was not much kernel to be seen; it was what we should 
                call<br>
                hollow or worm-eaten, and looked as if it had been filled with 
                tobacco or rich black earth. &quot;It is just what I expected!&quot; 
                exclaimed Ib.<br>
                &quot;How should there be room in a little nut like this for the 
                best thing<br>
                of all? Christina will find her two nuts just the same; there 
                will<br>
                be neither fine clothes or a golden carriage in them.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Winter came; and the new year, and indeed many years passed<br>
                away; until Ib was old enough to be confirmed, and, therefore, 
                he went during a whole winter to the clergyman of the nearest 
                village to be prepared.<br>
              </p>
              <p>One day, about this time, the boatman paid a visit to Ib's<br>
                parents, and told them that Christina was going to service, and 
                that<br>
                she had been remarkably fortunate in obtaining a good place, with 
                most respectable people. &quot;Only think,&quot; he said, &quot;She 
                is going to the rich innkeeper's, at the hotel in Herning, many 
                miles west from here. </p>
              <p>She is to assist the landlady in the housekeeping; and, if afterwards<br>
                she behaves well and remains to be confirmed, the people will 
                treat<br>
                her as their own daughter.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>So Ib and Christina took leave of each other. People already<br>
                called them &quot;the betrothed,&quot; and at parting the girl 
                showed Ib the two<br>
                nuts, which she had taken care of ever since the time that they 
                lost<br>
                themselves in the wood; and she told him also that the little 
                wooden<br>
                shoes he once carved for her when he was a boy, and gave her as 
                a<br>
                present, had been carefully kept in a drawer ever since. And so 
                they<br>
                parted.<br>
              </p>
              <p>After Ib's confirmation, he remained at home with his mother,<br>
                for he had become a clever shoemaker, and in summer managed the 
                farm for her quite alone. His father had been dead some time, 
                and his<br>
                mother kept no farm servants. Sometimes, but very seldom, he heard<br>
                of Christina, through a postillion or eel-seller who was passing.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But she was well off with the rich innkeeper; and after being<br>
                confirmed she wrote a letter to her father, in which was a kind<br>
                message to Ib and his mother. In this letter, she mentioned that 
                her<br>
                master and mistress had made her a present of a beautiful new 
                dress,<br>
                and some nice under-clothes. This was, of course, pleasant news.<br>
              </p>
              <p>One day, in the following spring, there came a knock at the door<br>
                of the house where Ib's old mother lived; and when they opened 
                it,<br>
                lo and behold, in stepped the boatman and Christina. She had come 
                to pay them a visit, and to spend the day. A carriage had to come 
                from the Herning hotel to the next village, and she had taken 
                the<br>
                opportunity to see her friends once more. She looked as elegant 
                as a<br>
                real lady, and wore a pretty dress, beautifully made on purpose 
                for<br>
                her. There she stood, in full dress, while Ib wore only his working<br>
                clothes. He could not utter a word; he could only seize her hand 
                and<br>
                hold it fast in his own, but he felt too happy and glad to open 
                his<br>
                lips. Christina, however, was quite at her ease; she talked and<br>
                talked, and kissed him in the most friendly manner. Even afterwards,<br>
                when they were left alone, and she asked, &quot;Did you know me 
                again, Ib?&quot; he still stood holding her hand, and said at 
                last, &quot;You are become quite a grand lady, Christina, and 
                I am only a rough working man; but I have often thought of you 
                and of old times.&quot; Then they<br>
                wandered up the great ridge, and looked across the stream to the<br>
                heath, where the little hills were covered with the flowering 
                broom.<br>
                Ib said nothing; but before the time came for them to part, it<br>
                became quite clear to him that Christina must be his wife: had 
                they<br>
                not even in childhood been called the betrothed? To him it seemed 
                as<br>
                if they were really engaged to each other, although not a word 
                had<br>
                been spoken on the subject. They had only a few more hours to 
                remain together, for Christina was obliged to return that evening 
                to the<br>
                neighboring village, to be ready for the carriage which was to 
                start<br>
                the next morning early for Herning. Ib and her father accompanied<br>
                her to the village. It was a fine moonlight evening; and when 
                they<br>
                arrived, Ib stood holding Christina's hand in his, as if he could<br>
                not let her go. His eyes brightened, and the words he uttered 
                came<br>
                with hesitation from his lips, but from the deepest recesses of 
                his<br>
                heart: &quot;Christina, if you have not become too grand, and 
                if you can be<br>
                contented to live in my mother's house as my wife, we will be<br>
                married some day. But we can wait for a while.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh yes,&quot; she replied; &quot;Let us wait a little longer, 
                Ib. I can<br>
                trust you, for I believe that I do love you. But let me think 
                it<br>
                over.&quot; Then he kissed her lips; and so they parted.<br>
              </p>
              <p>On the way home, Ib told the boatman that he and Christina were 
                as<br>
                good as engaged to each other; and the boatman found out that 
                he had always expected it would be so, and went home with Ib that 
                evening, and remained the night in the farmhouse; but nothing 
                further was said of the engagement. During the next year, two 
                letters passed<br>
                between Ib and Christina. They were signed, &quot;Faithful till 
                death;&quot; but<br>
                at the end of that time, one day the boatman came over to see 
                Ib, with<br>
                a kind greeting from Christina. He had something else to say, 
                which<br>
                made him hesitate in a strange manner. At last it came out that<br>
                Christina, who had grown a very pretty girl, was more lucky than 
                ever.<br>
              </p>
              <p>She was courted and admired by every one; but her master's son, 
                who had been home on a visit, was so much pleased with Christina 
                that he wished to marry her. He had a very good situation in an 
                office at Copenhagen, and as she had also taken a liking for him, 
                his parents<br>
                were not unwilling to consent. But Christina, in her heart, often<br>
                thought of Ib, and knew how much he thought of her; so she felt<br>
                inclined to refuse this good fortune, added the boatman. At first 
                Ib<br>
                said not a word, but he became as white as the wall, and shook 
                his<br>
                head gently, and then he spoke,- &quot;Christina must not refuse 
                this<br>
                good fortune.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Then will you write a few words to her?&quot; said the 
                boatman.<br>
                Ib sat down to write, but he could not get on at all. The words<br>
                were not what he wished to say, so he tore up the page. The<br>
                following morning, however, a letter lay ready to be sent to<br>
                Christina, and the following is what he wrote:-<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The letter written by you to your father I have read, and 
                see<br>
                from it that you are prosperous in everything, and that still 
                better<br>
                fortune is in store for you. Ask your own heart, Christina, and<br>
                think over carefully what awaits you if you take me for your<br>
                husband, for I possess very little in the world. Do not think 
                of me or<br>
                of my position; think only of your own welfare. You are bound 
                to me by no promises; and if in your heart you have given me one, 
                I release you from it. May every blessing and happiness be poured 
                out upon you, Christina. Heaven will give me the heart's consolation.<br>
                Ever your sincere friend, IB.&quot;</p>
              <p> This letter was sent, and Christina received it in due time. 
                In<br>
                the course of the following November, her banns were published 
                in<br>
                the church on the heath, and also in Copenhagen, where the<br>
                bridegroom lived. She was taken to Copenhagen under the protection<br>
                of her future mother-in-law, because the bridegroom could not 
                spare<br>
                time from his numerous occupations for a journey so far into<br>
                Jutland. On the journey, Christina met her father at one of the<br>
                villages through which they passed, and here he took leave of 
                her.<br>
                Very little was said about the matter to Ib, and he did not refer 
                to<br>
                it; his mother, however, noticed that he had grown very silent 
                and<br>
                pensive. Thinking as he did of old times, no wonder the three 
                nuts<br>
                came into his mind which the gypsy woman had given him when a 
                child, and of the two which he had given to Christina. These wishing 
                nuts, after all, had proved true fortune-tellers. One had contained 
                a gilded carriage and noble horses, and the other beautiful clothes; 
                all of<br>
                these Christina would now have in her new home at Copenhagen. 
                Her part had come true. And for him the nut had contained only 
                black earth. The gypsy woman had said it was the best for him. 
                Perhaps it was, and this also would be fulfilled. He understood 
                the gypsy woman's meaning now. The black earth- the dark grave- 
                was the best thing for him now.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Again years passed away; not many, but they seemed long years 
                to<br>
                Ib. The old innkeeper and his wife died one after the other; and 
                the<br>
                whole of their property, many thousand dollars, was inherited 
                by their<br>
                son. Christina could have the golden carriage now, and plenty 
                of<br>
                fine clothes. During the two long years which followed, no letter 
                came<br>
                from Christina to her father; and when at last her father received 
                one<br>
                from her, it did not speak of prosperity or happiness. Poor Christina!<br>
                Neither she nor her husband understood how to economize or save, 
                and the riches brought no blessing with them, because they had 
                not asked for it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Years passed; and for many summers the heath was covered with<br>
                bloom; in winter the snow rested upon it, and the rough winds 
                blew<br>
                across the ridge under which stood Ib's sheltered home. One spring 
                day the sun shone brightly, and he was guiding the plough across 
                his<br>
                field. The ploughshare struck against something which he fancied 
                was a firestone, and then he saw glittering in the earth a splinter 
                of<br>
                shining metal which the plough had cut from something which gleamed 
                brightly in the furrow. He searched, and found a large golden 
                armlet of superior workmanship, and it was evident that the plough 
                had disturbed a Hun's grave. He searched further, and found more<br>
                valuable treasures, which Ib showed to the clergyman, who explained<br>
                their value to him. Then he went to the magistrate, who informed 
                the<br>
                president of the museum of the discovery, and advised Ib to take 
                the<br>
                treasures himself to the president.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You have found in the earth the best thing you could find,&quot;<br>
                said the magistrate.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The best thing,&quot; thought Ib; &quot;the very best thing 
                for me,- and<br>
                found in the earth! Well, if it really is so, then the gypsy woman 
                was<br>
                right in her prophecy.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>So Ib went in the ferry-boat from Aarhus to Copenhagen. To him 
                who had only sailed once or twice on the river near his own home, 
                this seemed like a voyage on the ocean; and at length he arrived 
                at<br>
                Copenhagen. The value of the gold he had found was paid to him; 
                it was a large sum- six hundred dollars. Then Ib of the heath 
                went out, and wandered about in the great city.<br>
              </p>
              <p>On the evening before the day he had settled to return with the<br>
                captain of the passage-boat, Ib lost himself in the streets, and<br>
                took quite a different turning to the one he wished to follow. 
                He<br>
                wandered on till he found himself in a poor street of the suburb<br>
                called Christian's Haven. Not a creature could be seen. At last 
                a very<br>
                little girl came out of one of the wretched-looking houses, and 
                Ib<br>
                asked her to tell him the way to the street he wanted; she looked 
                up<br>
                timidly at him, and began to cry bitterly. He asked her what was 
                the<br>
                matter; but what she said he could not understand. So he went 
                along<br>
                the street with her; and as they passed under a lamp, the light 
                fell<br>
                on the little girl's face. A strange sensation came over Ib, as 
                he<br>
                caught sight of it. The living, breathing embodiment of Little<br>
                Christina stood before him, just as he remembered her in the days 
                of<br>
                her childhood. He followed the child to the wretched house, and<br>
                ascended the narrow, crazy staircase which led to a little garret 
                in<br>
                the roof. The air in the room was heavy and stifling, no light 
                was<br>
                burning, and from one corner came sounds of moaning and sighing. 
                It was the mother of the child who lay there on a miserable bed. 
                With the help of a match, Ib struck a light, and approached her.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Can I be of any service to you?&quot; he asked. &quot;This 
                little girl<br>
                brought me up here; but I am a stranger in this city. Are there 
                no<br>
                neighbors or any one whom I can call?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then he raised the head of the sick woman, and smoothed her<br>
                pillow. He started as he did so. It was Christina of the heath! 
                No one<br>
                had mentioned her name to Ib for years; it would have disturbed 
                his<br>
                peace of mind, especially as the reports respecting her were not 
                good.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The wealth which her husband had inherited from his parents had 
                made him proud and arrogant. He had given up his certain appointment, 
                and travelled for six months in foreign lands, and, on his return, 
                had lived in great style, and got into terrible debt. For a time 
                he had trembled on the high pedestal on which he had placed himself, 
                till<br>
                at last he toppled over, and ruin came. His numerous merry companions, 
                and the visitors at his table, said it served him right, for he 
                had kept house like a madman. One morning his corpse was found 
                in the canal. The cold hand of death had already touched the heart 
                of<br>
                Christina. Her youngest child, looked for in the midst of<br>
                prosperity, had sunk into the grave when only a few weeks old; 
                and<br>
                at last Christina herself became sick unto death, and lay, forsaken<br>
                and dying, in a miserable room, amid poverty she might have borne 
                in<br>
                her younger days, but which was now more painful to her from the<br>
                luxuries to which she had lately been accustomed. It was her eldest<br>
                child, also a Little Christina, whom Ib had followed to her home,<br>
                where she suffered hunger and poverty with her mother.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It makes me unhappy to think that I shall die, and leave this 
                poor<br>
                child,&quot; sighed she. &quot;Oh, what will become of her?&quot; 
                She could say no<br>
                more.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then Ib brought out another match, and lighted a piece of candle<br>
                which he found in the room, and it threw a glimmering light over 
                the<br>
                wretched dwelling. Ib looked at the little girl, and thought of<br>
                Christina in her young days. For her sake, could he not love this<br>
                child, who was a stranger to him? As he thus reflected, the dying<br>
                woman opened her eyes, and gazed at him. Did she recognize him? 
                He never knew; for not another word escaped her lips.</p>
              <p> * * * * * * *</p>
              <p> In the forest by the river Gudenau, not far from the heath, 
                and<br>
                beneath the ridge of land, stood the little farm, newly painted 
                and<br>
                whitewashed. The air was heavy and dark; there were no blossoms 
                on the heath; the autumn winds whirled the yellow leaves towards 
                the<br>
                boatman's hut, in which strangers dwelt; but the little farm stood<br>
                safely sheltered beneath the tall trees and the high ridge. The 
                turf<br>
                blazed brightly on the hearth, and within was sunlight, the<br>
                sparkling light from the sunny eyes of a child; the birdlike tones<br>
                from the rosy lips ringing like the song of a lark in spring. 
                All<br>
                was life and joy. Little Christina sat on Ib's knee. Ib was to 
                her<br>
                both father and mother; her own parents had vanished from her<br>
                memory, as a dream-picture vanishes alike from childhood and age. 
              </p>
              <p>Ib's house was well and prettily furnished; for he was a prosperous 
                man now, while the mother of the little girl rested in the churchyard 
                at<br>
                Copenhagen, where she had died in poverty. Ib had money now- money 
                which had come to him out of the black earth; and he had Christina 
                for his own, after all.</p>

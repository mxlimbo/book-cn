              <p class="h" align="center"> THE METAL PIG</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> IN the city of Florence, not far from the Piazza del Granduca,<br>
                runs a little street called Porta Rosa. In this street, just in<br>
                front of the market-place where vegetables are sold, stands a 
                pig,<br>
                made of brass and curiously formed. The bright color has been<br>
                changed by age to dark green; but clear, fresh water pours from 
                the<br>
                snout, which shines as if it had been polished, and so indeed 
                it<br>
                has, for hundreds of poor people and children seize it in their<br>
                hands as they place their mouths close to the mouth of the animal,<br>
                to drink. It is quite a picture to see a half-naked boy clasping 
                the<br>
                well-formed creature by the head, as he presses his rosy lips<br>
                against its jaws. Every one who visits Florence can very quickly<br>
                find the place; he has only to ask the first beggar he meets for 
                the<br>
                Metal Pig, and he will be told where it is.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was late on a winter evening; the mountains were covered with<br>
                snow, but the moon shone brightly, and moonlight in Italy is like 
                a<br>
                dull winter's day in the north; indeed it is better, for clear 
                air<br>
                seems to raise us above the earth, while in the north a cold, 
                gray,<br>
                leaden sky appears to press us down to earth, even as the cold 
                damp<br>
                earth shall one day press on us in the grave. In the garden of 
                the<br>
                grand duke's palace, under the roof of one of the wings, where 
                a<br>
                thousand roses bloom in winter, a little ragged boy had been sitting<br>
                the whole day long; a boy, who might serve as a type of Italy,<br>
                lovely and smiling, and yet still suffering. He was hungry and<br>
                thirsty, yet no one gave him anything; and when it became dark, 
                and<br>
                they were about to close the gardens, the porter turned him out. 
                He<br>
                stood a long time musing on the bridge which crosses the Arno, 
                and<br>
                looking at the glittering stars, reflected in the water which 
                flowed<br>
                between him and the elegant marble bridge Della Trinita. He then<br>
                walked away towards the Metal Pig, half knelt down, clasped it 
                with<br>
                his arms, and then put his mouth to the shining snout and drank 
                deep<br>
                draughts of the fresh water. Close by, lay a few salad-leaves 
                and<br>
                two chestnuts, which were to serve for his supper. No one was 
                in the<br>
                street but himself; it belonged only to him, so he boldly seated<br>
                himself on the pig's back, leaned forward so that his curly head 
                could<br>
                rest on the head of the animal, and, before he was aware, he fell<br>
                asleep.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was midnight. The Metal Pig raised himself gently, and the<br>
                boy heard him say quite distinctly, &quot;Hold tight, little boy, 
                for I<br>
                am going to run;&quot; and away he started for a most wonderful 
                ride.<br>
                First, they arrived at the Piazza del Granduca, and the metal 
                horse<br>
                which bears the duke's statue, neighed aloud. The painted<br>
                coats-of-arms on the old council-house shone like transparent<br>
                pictures, and Michael Angelo's David tossed his sling; it was 
                as if<br>
                everything had life. The metallic groups of figures, among which<br>
                were Perseus and the Rape of the Sabines, looked like living<br>
                persons, and cries of terror sounded from them all across the 
                noble<br>
                square. By the Palazzo degli Uffizi, in the arcade, where the 
                nobility<br>
                assemble for the carnival, the Metal Pig stopped. &quot;Hold fast,&quot; 
                said<br>
                the animal; &quot;hold fast, for I am going up stairs.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The little boy said not a word; he was half pleased and half<br>
                afraid. They entered a long gallery, where the boy had been before.<br>
                The walls were resplendent with paintings; here stood statues 
                and<br>
                busts, all in a clear light as if it were day. But the grandest<br>
                appeared when the door of a side room opened; the little boy could<br>
                remember what beautiful things he had seen there, but to-night<br>
                everything shone in its brightest colors. Here stood the figure 
                of a<br>
                beautiful woman, as beautifully sculptured as possible by one 
                of the<br>
                great masters. Her graceful limbs appeared to move; dolphins sprang 
                at her feet, and immortality shone from her eyes. The world called 
                her<br>
                the Venus de' Medici. By her side were statues, in which the spirit 
                of<br>
                life breathed in stone; figures of men, one of whom whetted his 
                sword, and was named the Grinder; wrestling gladiators formed 
                another group, the sword had been sharpened for them, and they 
                strove for the goddess of beauty. The boy was dazzled by so much 
                glitter; for the walls were gleaming with bright colors, all appeared 
                living reality.<br>
              </p>
              <p>As they passed from hall to hall, beauty everywhere showed itself;<br>
                and as the Metal Pig went step by step from one picture to the<br>
                other, the little boy could see it all plainly. One glory eclipsed<br>
                another; yet there was one picture that fixed itself on the little<br>
                boy's memory, more especially because of the happy children it<br>
                represented, for these the little boy had seen in daylight. Many<br>
                pass this picture by with indifference, and yet it contains a 
                treasure<br>
                of poetic feeling; it represents Christ descending into Hades. 
                They<br>
                are not the lost whom the spectator sees, but the heathen of olden<br>
                times. The Florentine, Angiolo Bronzino, painted this picture; 
                most<br>
                beautiful is the expression on the face of the two children, who<br>
                appear to have full confidence that they shall reach heaven at 
                last.<br>
                They are embracing each other, and one little one stretches out 
                his<br>
                hand towards another who stands below him, and points to himself, 
                as if he were saying, &quot;I am going to heaven.&quot; The older 
                people stand as if uncertain, yet hopeful, and they bow in humble 
                adoration to the<br>
                Lord Jesus. On this picture the boy's eyes rested longer than 
                on any<br>
                other: the Metal Pig stood still before it. A low sigh was heard.<br>
                Did it come from the picture or from the animal? The boy raised 
                his<br>
                hands towards the smiling children, and then the Pig ran off with<br>
                him through the open vestibule.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Thank you, thank you, you beautiful animal,&quot; said 
                the little boy,<br>
                caressing the Metal Pig as it ran down the steps.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Thanks to yourself also,&quot; replied the Metal Pig; &quot;I 
                have helped<br>
                you and you have helped me, for it is only when I have an innocent<br>
                child on my back that I receive the power to run. Yes; as you 
                see, I<br>
                can even venture under the rays of the lamp, in front of the picture<br>
                of the Madonna, but I may not enter the church; still from without,<br>
                and while you are upon my back, I may look in through the open 
                door.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Do not get down yet, for if you do, then I shall be lifeless, 
                as you<br>
                have seen me in the Porta Rosa.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I will stay with you, my dear creature,&quot; said the 
                little boy.<br>
                So then they went on at a rapid pace through the streets of<br>
                Florence, till they came to the square before the church of Santa<br>
                Croce. The folding-doors flew open, and light streamed from the<br>
                altar through the church into the deserted square. A wonderful 
                blaze<br>
                of light streamed from one of the monuments in the left-side aisle,<br>
                and a thousand moving stars seemed to form a glory round it; even<br>
                the coat-of-arms on the tomb-stone shone, and a red ladder on 
                a blue<br>
                field gleamed like fire. It was the grave of Galileo. The monument<br>
                is unadorned, but the red ladder is an emblem of art, signifying<br>
                that the way to glory leads up a shining ladder, on which the 
                prophets<br>
                of mind rise to heaven, like Elias of old. In the right aisle 
                of the<br>
                church every statue on the richly carved sarcophagi seemed endowed<br>
                with life. Here stood Michael Angelo; there Dante, with the laurel<br>
                wreath round his brow; Alfieri and Machiavelli; for here side 
                by<br>
                side rest the great men- the pride of Italy. The church itself 
                is very<br>
                beautiful, even more beautiful than the marble cathedral at<br>
                Florence, though not so large. It seemed as if the carved vestments<br>
                stirred, and as if the marble figures they covered raised their<br>
                heads higher, to gaze upon the brightly colored glowing altar 
                where<br>
                the white-robed boys swung the golden censers, amid music and 
                song, while the strong fragrance of incense filled the church, 
                and<br>
                streamed forth into the square. The boy stretched forth his hands<br>
                towards the light, and at the same moment the Metal Pig started<br>
                again so rapidly that he was obliged to cling tightly to him. 
                The wind<br>
                whistled in his ears, he heard the church door creak on its hinges<br>
                as it closed, and it seemed to him as if he had lost his senses-<br>
                then a cold shudder passed over him, and he awoke.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was morning; the Metal Pig stood in its old place on the<br>
                Porta Rosa, and the boy found he had slipped nearly off its back. 
                Fear and trembling came upon him as he thought of his mother; 
                she had sent him out the day before to get some money, he had 
                not done so, and now he was hungry and thirsty. Once more he clasped 
                the neck of his metal horse, kissed its nose, and nodded farewell 
                to it. </p>
              <p>Then he wandered away into one of the narrowest streets, where 
                there was scarcely room for a loaded donkey to pass. A great iron-bound 
                door stood ajar; he passed through, and climbed up a brick staircase,<br>
                with dirty walls and a rope for a balustrade, till he came to 
                an<br>
                open gallery hung with rags. From here a flight of steps led down 
                to a<br>
                court, where from a well water was drawn up by iron rollers to 
                the<br>
                different stories of the house, and where the water-buckets hung<br>
                side by side. Sometimes the roller and the bucket danced in the 
                air,<br>
                splashing the water all over the court. Another broken-down<br>
                staircase led from the gallery, and two Russian sailors running 
                down<br>
                it almost upset the poor boy. They were coming from their nightly<br>
                carousal. A woman not very young, with an unpleasant face and 
                a<br>
                quantity of black hair, followed them. &quot;What have you brought 
                home?&quot; she asked. when she saw the boy.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Don't be angry,&quot; he pleaded; &quot;I received nothing, 
                I have<br>
                nothing at all;&quot; and he seized his mother's dress and would 
                have<br>
                kissed it. Then they went into a little room. I need not describe<br>
                it, but only say that there stood in it an earthen pot with handles,<br>
                made for holding fire, which in Italy is called a marito. This 
                pot she<br>
                took in her lap, warmed her fingers, and pushed the boy with her<br>
                elbow.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Certainly you must have some money,&quot; she said. The 
                boy began to<br>
                cry, and then she struck him with her foot till he cried out louder.<br>
                &quot;Will you be quiet? or I'll break your screaming head;&quot; 
                and she<br>
                swung about the fire-pot which she held in her hand, while the 
                boy<br>
                crouched to the earth and screamed.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then a neighbor came in, and she had also a marito under her<br>
                arm. &quot;Felicita,&quot; she said, &quot;what are you doing 
                to the child?&quot;<br>
                &quot;The child is mine,&quot; she answered; &quot;I can murder 
                him if I like,<br>
                and you too, Giannina.&quot; And then she swung about the fire-pot. 
                The<br>
                other woman lifted up hers to defend herself, and the two pots 
                clashed together so violently that they were dashed to pieces, 
                and fire and ashes flew about the room. The boy rushed out at 
                the sight, sped<br>
                across the courtyard, and fled from the house. The poor child 
                ran till<br>
                he was quite out of breath; at last he stopped at the church, 
                the<br>
                doors of which were opened to him the night before, and went in.<br>
                Here everything was bright, and the boy knelt down by the first 
                tomb<br>
                on his right, the grave of Michael Angelo, and sobbed as if his<br>
                heart would break. People came and went, mass was performed, but 
                no one noticed the boy, excepting an elderly citizen, who stood 
                still and looked at him for a moment, and then went away like 
                the rest. Hunger and thirst overpowered the child, and he became 
                quite faint and ill. </p>
              <p>At last he crept into a corner behind the marble monuments, and 
                went<br>
                to sleep. Towards evening he was awakened by a pull at his sleeve;<br>
                he started up, and the same old citizen stood before him.<br>
                &quot;Are you ill? where do you live? have you been here all day?&quot; 
                were<br>
                some of the questions asked by the old man. After hearing his 
                answers, the old man took him home to a small house close by, 
                in a back street.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They entered a glovemaker's shop, where a woman sat sewing busily. 
                A little white poodle, so closely shaven that his pink skin could<br>
                plainly be seen, frisked about the room, and gambolled upon the 
                boy.<br>
                &quot;Innocent souls are soon intimate,&quot; said the woman, 
                as she<br>
                caressed both the boy and the dog. These good people gave the 
                child<br>
                food and drink, and said he should stay with them all night, and<br>
                that the next day the old man, who was called Giuseppe, would 
                go and speak to his mother. A little homely bed was prepared for 
                him, but to him who had so often slept on the hard stones it was 
                a royal couch, and he slept sweetly and dreamed of the splendid 
                pictures and of the Metal Pig. Giuseppe went out the next morning, 
                and the poor child was not glad to see him go, for he knew that 
                the old man was gone to his mother, and that, perhaps, he would 
                have to go back. He wept at the thought, and then he played with 
                the little, lively dog, and<br>
                kissed it, while the old woman looked kindly at him to encourage<br>
                him. And what news did Giuseppe bring back? At first the boy could 
                not hear, for he talked a great deal to his wife, and she nodded 
                and<br>
                stroked the boy's cheek.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then she said, &quot;He is a good lad, he shall stay with us, 
                he may<br>
                become a clever glovemaker, like you. Look what delicate fingers 
                he<br>
                has got; Madonna intended him for a glovemaker.&quot; So the boy 
                stayed<br>
                with them, and the woman herself taught him to sew; and he ate 
                well,<br>
                and slept well, and became very merry. But at last he began to 
                tease<br>
                Bellissima, as the little dog was called. This made the woman 
                angry,<br>
                and she scolded him and threatened him, which made him very unhappy, 
                and he went and sat in his own room full of sad thoughts. This 
                chamber looked upon the street, in which hung skins to dry, and 
                there were thick iron bars across his window. That night he lay 
                awake, thinking of the Metal Pig; indeed, it was always in his 
                thoughts. Suddenly he fancied he heard feet outside going pit-a-pat. 
                He sprung out of bed and went to the window. Could it be the Metal 
                Pig? But there was nothing to be seen; whatever he had heard had 
                passed already. Next morning, their neighbor, the artist, passed 
                by, carrying a paint-box and a large roll of canvas.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Help the gentleman to carry his box of colors,&quot; said 
                the woman to<br>
                the boy; and he obeyed instantly, took the box, and followed the<br>
                painter. They walked on till they reached the picture gallery, 
                and<br>
                mounted the same staircase up which he had ridden that night on 
                the<br>
                Metal Pig. He remembered all the statues and pictures, the beautiful<br>
                marble Venus, and again he looked at the Madonna with the Saviour<br>
                and St. John. They stopped before the picture by Bronzino, in 
                which<br>
                Christ is represented as standing in the lower world, with the<br>
                children smiling before Him, in the sweet expectation of entering<br>
                heaven; and the poor boy smiled, too, for here was his heaven.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You may go home now,&quot; said the painter, while the 
                boy stood<br>
                watching him, till he had set up his easel.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;May I see you paint?&quot; asked the boy; &quot;may I see 
                you put the<br>
                picture on this white canvas?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I am not going to paint yet,&quot; replied the artist; 
                then he brought<br>
                out a piece of chalk. His hand moved quickly, and his eye measured 
                the great picture; and though nothing appeared but a faint line, 
                the<br>
                figure of the Saviour was as clearly visible as in the colored<br>
                picture.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Why don't you go?&quot; said the painter. Then the boy 
                wandered home<br>
                silently, and seated himself on the table, and learned to sew<br>
                gloves. But all day long his thoughts were in the picture gallery; 
                and<br>
                so he pricked his fingers and was awkward. But he did not tease<br>
                Bellissima. When evening came, and the house door stood open, 
                he<br>
                slipped out. It was a bright, beautiful, starlight evening, but 
                rather<br>
                cold. Away he went through the already-deserted streets, and soon 
                came to the Metal Pig; he stooped down and kissed its shining 
                nose, and then seated himself on its back.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You happy creature,&quot; he said; &quot;how I have longed 
                for you! we must<br>
                take a ride to-night.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the Metal Pig lay motionless, while the fresh stream gushed<br>
                forth from its mouth. The little boy still sat astride on its 
                back,<br>
                when he felt something pulling at his clothes. He looked down, 
                and<br>
                there was Bellissima, little smooth-shaven Bellissima, barking 
                as if<br>
                she would have said, &quot;Here I am too; why are you sitting 
                there?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>A fiery dragon could not have frightened the little boy so much 
                as<br>
                did the little dog in this place. &quot;Bellissima in the street, 
                and not<br>
                dressed!&quot; as the old lady called it; &quot;what would be 
                the end of this?&quot;<br>
                The dog never went out in winter, unless she was attired in a<br>
                little lambskin coat which had been made for her; it was fastened<br>
                round the little dog's neck and body with red ribbons, and was<br>
                decorated with rosettes and little bells. The dog looked almost 
                like a<br>
                little kid when she was allowed to go out in winter, and trot 
                after<br>
                her mistress. And now here she was in the cold, and not dressed. 
                Oh,<br>
                how would it end? All his fancies were quickly put to flight; 
                yet he<br>
                kissed the Metal Pig once more, and then took Bellissima in his<br>
                arms. The poor little thing trembled so with cold, that the boy 
                ran<br>
                homeward as fast as he could.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What are you running away with there?&quot; asked two of 
                the police<br>
                whom he met, and at whom the dog barked. &quot;Where have you 
                stolen that pretty dog?&quot; they asked; and they took it away 
                from him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, I have not stolen it; do give it to me back again,&quot; 
                cried the<br>
                boy, despairingly.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;If you have not stolen it, you may say at home that they 
                can send<br>
                to the watch-house for the dog.&quot; Then they told him where 
                the<br>
                watch-house was, and went away with Bellissima.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Here was a dreadful trouble. The boy did not know whether he 
                had<br>
                better jump into the Arno, or go home and confess everything. 
                They<br>
                would certainly kill him, he thought.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well, I would gladly be killed,&quot; he reasoned; &quot;for 
                then I shall<br>
                die, and go to heaven:&quot; and so he went home, almost hoping 
                for death.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The door was locked, and he could not reach the knocker. No one<br>
                was in the street; so he took up a stone, and with it made a<br>
                tremendous noise at the door.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Who is there?&quot; asked somebody from within.<br>
                &quot;It is I,&quot; said he. &quot;Bellissima is gone. Open the 
                door, and then<br>
                kill me.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then indeed there was a great panic. Madame was so very fond 
                of<br>
                Bellissima. She immediately looked at the wall where the dog's 
                dress<br>
                usually hung; and there was the little lambskin.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Bellissima in the watch-house!&quot; she cried. &quot;You 
                bad boy! how<br>
                did you entice her out? Poor little delicate thing, with those 
                rough<br>
                policemen! and she'll be frozen with cold.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Giuseppe went off at once, while his wife lamented, and the boy<br>
                wept. Several of the neighbors came in, and amongst them the<br>
                painter. He took the boy between his knees, and questioned him; 
                and,<br>
                in broken sentences, he soon heard the whole story, and also about 
                the Metal Pig, and the wonderful ride to the picture-gallery, 
                which was<br>
                certainly rather incomprehensible. The painter, however, consoled<br>
                the little fellow, and tried to soften the lady's anger; but she 
                would<br>
                not be pacified till her husband returned with Bellissima, who 
                had<br>
                been with the police. Then there was great rejoicing, and the<br>
                painter caressed the boy, and gave him a number of pictures. Oh,<br>
                what beautiful pictures these were!- figures with funny heads; 
                and,<br>
                above all, the Metal Pig was there too. Oh, nothing could be more<br>
                delightful. By means of a few strokes, it was made to appear on 
                the<br>
                paper; and even the house that stood behind it had been sketched 
                in.<br>
                Oh, if he could only draw and paint! He who could do this could<br>
                conjure all the world before him. The first leisure moment during<br>
                the next day, the boy got a pencil, and on the back of one of 
                the<br>
                other drawings he attempted to copy the drawing of the Metal Pig,<br>
                and he succeeded. Certainly it was rather crooked, rather up and 
                down, one leg thick, and another thin; still it was like the copy, 
                and he<br>
                was overjoyed at what he had done. The pencil would not go quite 
                as it ought,- he had found that out; but the next day he tried 
                again. A<br>
                second pig was drawn by the side of the first, and this looked 
                a<br>
                hundred times better; and the third attempt was so good, that<br>
                everybody might know what it was meant to represent.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And now the glovemaking went on but slowly. The orders given 
                by<br>
                the shops in the town were not finished quickly; for the Metal 
                Pig had<br>
                taught the boy that all objects may be drawn upon paper; and<br>
                Florence is a picture-book in itself for any one who chooses to 
                turn<br>
                over its pages. On the Piazza dell Trinita stands a slender pillar,<br>
                and upon it is the goddess of Justice, blindfolded, with her scales 
                in<br>
                her hand. She was soon represented on paper, and it was the<br>
                glovemaker's boy who placed her there. His collection of pictures<br>
                increased; but as yet they were only copies of lifeless objects,<br>
                when one day Bellissima came gambolling before him: &quot;Stand 
                still,&quot;<br>
                cried he, &quot;and I will draw you beautifully, to put amongst 
                my<br>
                collection.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But Bellissima would not stand still, so she must be bound fast 
                in<br>
                one position. He tied her head and tail; but she barked and jumped,<br>
                and so pulled and tightened the string, that she was nearly strangled;<br>
                and just then her mistress walked in.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You wicked boy! the poor little creature!&quot; was all 
                she could<br>
                utter.<br>
              </p>
              <p>She pushed the boy from her, thrust him away with her foot, called<br>
                him a most ungrateful, good-for-nothing, wicked boy, and forbade 
                him to enter the house again. Then she wept, and kissed her little<br>
                half-strangled Bellissima. At this moment the painter entered 
                the<br>
                room.</p>

              <p> In the year 1834 there was an exhibition in the Academy of Arts 
                at<br>
                Florence. Two pictures, placed side by side, attracted a large<br>
                number of spectators. The smaller of the two represented a little<br>
                boy sitting at a table, drawing; before him was a little white 
                poodle,<br>
                curiously shaven; but as the animal would not stand still, it 
                had been<br>
                fastened with a string to its head and tail, to keep it in one<br>
                position. The truthfulness and life in this picture interested 
                every<br>
                one. The painter was said to be a young Florentine, who had been 
                found in the streets, when a child, by an old glovemaker, who 
                had brought him up. The boy had taught himself to draw: it was 
                also said that a young artist, now famous, had discovered talent 
                in the child just as he was about to be sent away for having tied 
                up madame's favorite<br>
                little dog, and using it as a model. The glovemaker's boy had 
                also<br>
                become a great painter, as the picture proved; but the larger<br>
                picture by its side was a still greater proof of his talent. It<br>
                represented a handsome boy, clothed in rags, lying asleep, and 
                leaning against the Metal Pig in the street of the Porta Rosa. 
                All the<br>
                spectators knew the spot well. The child's arms were round the 
                neck of the Pig, and he was in a deep sleep. The lamp before the 
                picture of<br>
                the Madonna threw a strong, effective light on the pale, delicate 
                face<br>
                of the child. It was a beautiful picture. A large gilt frame<br>
                surrounded it, and on one corner of the frame a laurel wreath 
                had been hung; but a black band, twined unseen among the green 
                leaves, and a streamer of crape, hung down from it; for within 
                the last few days the young artist had- died.</p>

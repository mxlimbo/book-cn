              <p class="h" align="center"> THE WILD SWANS</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> FAR away in the land to which the swallows fly when it is<br>
                winter, dwelt a king who had eleven sons, and one daughter, named<br>
                Eliza. The eleven brothers were princes, and each went to school<br>
                with a star on his breast, and a sword by his side. They wrote 
                with<br>
                diamond pencils on gold slates, and learnt their lessons so quickly<br>
                and read so easily that every one might know they were princes.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Their sister Eliza sat on a little stool of plate-glass, and 
                had a<br>
                book full of pictures, which had cost as much as half a kingdom. 
                Oh,<br>
                these children were indeed happy, but it was not to remain so<br>
                always. Their father, who was king of the country, married a very<br>
                wicked queen, who did not love the poor children at all. They 
                knew<br>
                this from the very first day after the wedding. In the palace 
                there<br>
                were great festivities, and the children played at receiving<br>
                company; but instead of having, as usual, all the cakes and apples<br>
                that were left, she gave them some sand in a tea-cup, and told 
                them to<br>
                pretend it was cake. The week after, she sent little Eliza into 
                the<br>
                country to a peasant and his wife, and then she told the king 
                so<br>
                many untrue things about the young princes, that he gave himself 
                no<br>
                more trouble respecting them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Go out into the world and get your own living,&quot; said 
                the queen.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Fly like great birds, who have no voice.&quot; But she 
                could not make them ugly as she wished, for they were turned into 
                eleven beautiful wild swans. Then, with a strange cry, they flew 
                through the windows of the palace, over the park, to the forest 
                beyond. It was early<br>
                morning when they passed the peasant's cottage, where their sister<br>
                Eliza lay asleep in her room. They hovered over the roof, twisted<br>
                their long necks and flapped their wings, but no one heard them 
                or saw them, so they were at last obliged to fly away, high up 
                in the clouds; and over the wide world they flew till they came 
                to a thick, dark wood, which stretched far away to the seashore. 
                Poor little Eliza<br>
                was alone in her room playing with a green leaf, for she had no<br>
                other playthings, and she pierced a hole through the leaf, and<br>
                looked through it at the sun, and it was as if she saw her brothers'<br>
                clear eyes, and when the warm sun shone on her cheeks, she thought<br>
                of all the kisses they had given her. One day passed just like<br>
                another; sometimes the winds rustled through the leaves of the<br>
                rose-bush, and would whisper to the roses, &quot;Who can be more<br>
                beautiful than you!&quot; But the roses would shake their heads, 
                and say,<br>
                &quot;Eliza is.&quot; And when the old woman sat at the cottage 
                door on<br>
                Sunday, and read her hymn-book, the wind would flutter the leaves, 
                and say to the book, &quot;Who can be more pious than you?&quot; 
                and then the hymn-book would answer &quot;Eliza.&quot; And the 
                roses and the hymn-book told the real truth. At fifteen she returned 
                home, but when the queen saw how beautiful she was, she became 
                full of spite and hatred towards her. Willingly would she have 
                turned her into a swan, like her<br>
                brothers, but she did not dare to do so yet, because the king 
                wished<br>
                to see his daughter. Early one morning the queen went into the<br>
                bath-room; it was built of marble, and had soft cushions, trimmed 
                with the most beautiful tapestry. She took three toads with her, 
                and kissed them, and said to one, &quot;When Eliza comes to the 
                bath, seat yourself upon her head, that she may become as stupid 
                as you are.&quot; </p>
              <p>Then she said to another, &quot;Place yourself on her forehead, 
                that she may become as ugly as you are, and that her father may 
                not know her.&quot; &quot;Rest on her heart,&quot; she whispered 
                to the third, &quot;then she will have evil inclinations, and 
                suffer in consequence.&quot; So she put the toads into the clear 
                water, and they turned green immediately. She next called Eliza, 
                and helped her to undress and get into the bath. As<br>
                Eliza dipped her head under the water, one of the toads sat on 
                her<br>
                hair, a second on her forehead, and a third on her breast, but 
                she did<br>
                not seem to notice them, and when she rose out of the water, there<br>
                were three red poppies floating upon it. Had not the creatures 
                been<br>
                venomous or been kissed by the witch, they would have been changed 
                into red roses. At all events they became flowers, because they 
                had rested on Eliza's head, and on her heart. She was too good 
                and too innocent for witchcraft to have any power over her. When 
                the wicked queen saw this, she rubbed her face with walnut-juice, 
                so that she was quite brown; then she tangled her beautiful hair 
                and smeared it with disgusting ointment, till it was quite impossible 
                to recognize the<br>
                beautiful Eliza.<br>
              </p>
              <p>When her father saw her, he was much shocked, and declared she 
                was not his daughter. No one but the watch-dog and the swallows 
                knew her; and they were only poor animals, and could say nothing. 
              </p>
              <p>Then poor Eliza wept, and thought of her eleven brothers, who 
                were all away.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Sorrowfully, she stole away from the palace, and walked, the 
                whole<br>
                day, over fields and moors, till she came to the great forest. 
                She<br>
                knew not in what direction to go; but she was so unhappy, and 
                longed so for her brothers, who had been, like herself, driven 
                out into the world, that she was determined to seek them. She 
                had been but a<br>
                short time in the wood when night came on, and she quite lost 
                the<br>
                path; so she laid herself down on the soft moss, offered up her<br>
                evening prayer, and leaned her head against the stump of a tree. 
                All<br>
                nature was still, and the soft, mild air fanned her forehead. 
                The<br>
                light of hundreds of glow-worms shone amidst the grass and the 
                moss, like green fire; and if she touched a twig with her hand, 
                ever so<br>
                lightly, the brilliant insects fell down around her, like<br>
                shooting-stars.<br>
              </p>
              <p>All night long she dreamt of her brothers. She and they were<br>
                children again, playing together. She saw them writing with their<br>
                diamond pencils on golden slates, while she looked at the beautiful<br>
                picture-book which had cost half a kingdom. They were not writing<br>
                lines and letters, as they used to do; but descriptions of the 
                noble<br>
                deeds they had performed, and of all they had discovered and seen.<br>
                In the picture-book, too, everything was living. The birds sang, 
                and<br>
                the people came out of the book, and spoke to Eliza and her<br>
                brothers; but, as the leaves turned over, they darted back again 
                to<br>
                their places, that all might be in order.<br>
              </p>
              <p>When she awoke, the sun was high in the heavens; yet she could 
                not<br>
                see him, for the lofty trees spread their branches thickly over 
                her<br>
                head; but his beams were glancing through the leaves here and 
                there,<br>
                like a golden mist. There was a sweet fragrance from the fresh 
                green<br>
                verdure, and the birds almost perched upon her shoulders. She 
                heard<br>
                water rippling from a number of springs, all flowing in a lake 
                with<br>
                golden sands. Bushes grew thickly round the lake, and at one spot 
                an<br>
                opening had been made by a deer, through which Eliza went down 
                to<br>
                the water. The lake was so clear that, had not the wind rustled 
                the<br>
                branches of the trees and the bushes, so that they moved, they 
                would<br>
                have appeared as if painted in the depths of the lake; for every<br>
                leaf was reflected in the water, whether it stood in the shade 
                or<br>
                the sunshine. As soon as Eliza saw her own face, she was quite<br>
                terrified at finding it so brown and ugly; but when she wetted 
                her<br>
                little hand, and rubbed her eyes and forehead, the white skin<br>
                gleamed forth once more; and, after she had undressed, and dipped<br>
                herself in the fresh water, a more beautiful king's daughter could 
                not<br>
                be found in the wide world. As soon as she had dressed herself<br>
                again, and braided her long hair, she went to the bubbling spring, 
                and<br>
                drank some water out of the hollow of her hand. Then she wandered<br>
                far into the forest, not knowing whither she went. She thought 
                of<br>
                her brothers, and felt sure that God would not forsake her. It 
                is<br>
                God who makes the wild apples grow in the wood, to satisfy the 
                hungry, and He now led her to one of these trees, which was so 
                loaded with fruit, that the boughs bent beneath the weight. Here 
                she held her noonday repast, placed props under the boughs, and 
                then went into the gloomiest depths of the forest. It was so still 
                that she could hear the sound of her own footsteps, as well as 
                the rustling of<br>
                every withered leaf which she crushed under her feet. Not a bird 
                was<br>
                to be seen, not a sunbeam could penetrate through the large, dark<br>
                boughs of the trees. Their lofty trunks stood so close together, 
                that,<br>
                when she looked before her, it seemed as if she were enclosed 
                within<br>
                trellis-work. Such solitude she had never known before. The night<br>
                was very dark. Not a single glow-worm glittered in the moss.<br>
                Sorrowfully she laid herself down to sleep; and, after a while, 
                it<br>
                seemed to her as if the branches of the trees parted over her 
                head,<br>
                and that the mild eyes of angels looked down upon her from heaven.<br>
              </p>
              <p>When she awoke in the morning, she knew not whether she had dreamt 
                this, or if it had really been so. Then she continued her wandering; 
                but she had not gone many steps forward, when she met an old woman 
                with berries in her basket, and she gave her a few to eat. Then 
                Eliza askd her if she had not seen eleven princes riding through 
                the forest.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No,&quot; replied the old woman, &quot;But I saw yesterday 
                eleven swans,<br>
                with gold crowns on their heads, swimming on the river close by.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p>Then she led Eliza a little distance farther to a sloping bank, 
                and at<br>
                the foot of it wound a little river. The trees on its banks<br>
                stretched their long leafy branches across the water towards each<br>
                other, and where the growth prevented them from meeting naturally, 
                the roots had torn themselves away from the ground, so that the 
                branches might mingle their foliage as they hung over the water. 
                Eliza bade the old woman farewell, and walked by the flowing river, 
                till she<br>
                reached the shore of the open sea. And there, before the young<br>
                maiden's eyes, lay the glorious ocean, but not a sail appeared 
                on<br>
                its surface, not even a boat could be seen. How was she to go 
                farther?<br>
              </p>
              <p>She noticed how the countless pebbles on the sea-shore had been<br>
                smoothed and rounded by the action of the water. Glass, iron,<br>
                stones, everything that lay there mingled together, had taken 
                its<br>
                shape from the same power, and felt as smooth, or even smoother 
                than her own delicate hand. &quot;The water rolls on without weariness,&quot; 
                she said, till all that is hard becomes smooth; so will I be unwearied<br>
                in my task. Thanks for your lessons, bright rolling waves; my 
                heart<br>
                tells me you will lead me to my dear brothers.&quot; On the foam-covered<br>
                sea-weeds, lay eleven white swan feathers, which she gathered 
                up and<br>
                placed together. Drops of water lay upon them; whether they were<br>
                dew-drops or tears no one could say. Lonely as it was on the<br>
                sea-shore, she did not observe it, for the ever-moving sea showed 
                more changes in a few hours than the most varying lake could produce 
                during a whole year. If a black heavy cloud arose, it was as if 
                the sea said,<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I can look dark and angry too;&quot; and then the wind 
                blew, and the waves turned to white foam as they rolled. When 
                the wind slept, and the clouds glowed with the red sunlight, then 
                the sea looked like a rose leaf. But however quietly its white 
                glassy surface rested, there was still a motion on the shore, 
                as its waves rose and fell like the<br>
                breast of a sleeping child. When the sun was about to set, Eliza 
                saw<br>
                eleven white swans with golden crowns on their heads, flying towards<br>
                the land, one behind the other, like a long white ribbon. Then 
                Eliza<br>
                went down the slope from the shore, and hid herself behind the 
                bushes.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The swans alighted quite close to her and flapped their great 
                white<br>
                wings. As soon as the sun had disappeared under the water, the<br>
                feathers of the swans fell off, and eleven beautiful princes,<br>
              </p>
              <p>Eliza's brothers, stood near her. She uttered a loud cry, for,<br>
                although they were very much changed, she knew them immediately. 
              </p>
              <p>She sprang into their arms, and called them each by name. Then, 
                how<br>
                happy the princes were at meeting their little sister again, for<br>
                they recognized her, although she had grown so tall and beautiful.<br>
                They laughed, and they wept, and very soon understood how wickedly 
                their mother had acted to them all. &quot;We brothers,&quot; said 
                the eldest, &quot;fly about as wild swans, so long as the sun 
                is in the sky; but as soon as it sinks behind the hills, we recover 
                our human shape.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Therefore must we always be near a resting place for our feet 
                before<br>
                sunset; for if we should be flying towards the clouds at the time 
                we<br>
                recovered our natural shape as men, we should sink deep into the<br>
                sea. We do not dwell here, but in a land just as fair, that lies<br>
                beyond the ocean, which we have to cross for a long distance; 
                there is no island in our passage upon which we could pass, the 
                night;<br>
                nothing but a little rock rising out of the sea, upon which we 
                can<br>
                scarcely stand with safety, even closely crowded together. If 
                the<br>
                sea is rough, the foam dashes over us, yet we thank God even for<br>
                this rock; we have passed whole nights upon it, or we should never<br>
                have reached our beloved fatherland, for our flight across the 
                sea<br>
                occupies two of the longest days in the year. We have permission 
                to<br>
                visit out home once in every year, and to remain eleven days, 
                during<br>
                which we fly across the forest to look once more at the palace 
                where<br>
                our father dwells, and where we were born, and at the church, 
                where<br>
                our mother lies buried. Here it seems as if the very trees and<br>
                bushes were related to us. The wild horses leap over the plains 
                as<br>
                we have seen them in our childhood. The charcoal burners sing 
                the<br>
                old songs, to which we have danced as children. This is our<br>
                fatherland, to which we are drawn by loving ties; and here we 
                have<br>
                found you, our dear little sister., Two days longer we can remain<br>
                here, and then must we fly away to a beautiful land which is not 
                our<br>
                home; and how can we take you with us? We have neither ship nor 
                boat.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;How can I break this spell?&quot; said their sister. And 
                then she<br>
                talked about it nearly the whole night, only slumbering for a 
                few<br>
                hours. Eliza was awakened by the rustling of the swans' wings 
                as<br>
                they soared above. Her brothers were again changed to swans, and<br>
                they flew in circles wider and wider, till they were far away; 
                but one<br>
                of them, the youngest swan, remained behind, and laid his head 
                in<br>
                his sister's lap, while she stroked his wings; and they remained<br>
                together the whole day. Towards evening, the rest came back, and 
                as<br>
                the sun went down they resumed their natural forms. &quot;To-morrow,&quot;<br>
                said one, &quot;we shall fly away, not to return again till a 
                whole year<br>
                has passed. But we cannot leave you here. Have you courage to 
                go<br>
                with us? My arm is strong enough to carry you through the wood; 
                and will not all our wings be strong enough to fly with you over 
                the sea?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, take me with you,&quot; said Eliza. Then they spent 
                the whole<br>
                night in weaving a net with the pliant willow and rushes. It was<br>
                very large and strong. Eliza laid herself down on the net, and 
                when<br>
                the sun rose, and her brothers again became wild swans, they took 
                up<br>
                the net with their beaks, and flew up to the clouds with their 
                dear<br>
                sister, who still slept. The sunbeams fell on her face, therefore<br>
                one of the swans soared over her head, so that his broad wings 
                might<br>
                shade her. They were far from the land when Eliza woke. She thought<br>
                she must still be dreaming, it seemed so strange to her to feel<br>
                herself being carried so high in the air over the sea. By her 
                side lay<br>
                a branch full of beautiful ripe berries, and a bundle of sweet<br>
                roots; the youngest of her brothers had gathered them for her, 
                and<br>
                placed them by her side. She smiled her thanks to him; she knew 
                it was the same who had hovered over her to shade her with his 
                wings. </p>
              <p>They were now so high, that a large ship beneath them looked 
                like a white sea-gull skimming the waves. A great cloud floating 
                behind them appeared like a vast mountain, and upon it Eliza saw 
                her own shadow and those of the eleven swans, looking gigantic 
                in size. </p>
              <p>Altogether it formed a more beautiful picture than she had ever 
                seen; but as the sun rose higher, and the clouds were left behind, 
                the shadowy picture vanished away. Onward the whole day they flew 
                through the air like a winged arrow, yet more slowly than usual, 
                for they had their sister to carry. The weather seemed inclined 
                to be stormy, and Eliza watched the sinking sun with great anxiety, 
                for the little rock in the ocean was not yet in sight. It appeared 
                to her as if the swans were making great efforts with their wings. 
                Alas! she was the cause of their not advancing more quickly. When 
                the sun set, they would change to men, fall into the sea and be 
                drowned. Then she offered a prayer from her inmost heart, but 
                still no appearance of the rock. Dark clouds came nearer, the 
                gusts of wind told of a coming storm, while from a thick, heavy 
                mass of clouds the lightning burst forth flash after flash. The 
                sun had reached the edge of the sea, when the swans darted down 
                so swiftly, that Eliza's head trembled; she believed they were 
                falling, but they again soared onward. Presently she caught sight 
                of the rock just below them, and by this time the sun was half 
                hidden by the waves. The rock did not appear larger than a seal's 
                head thrust out of the water. They sunk so rapidly, that at the 
                moment their feet touched the rock, it shone only like a star, 
                and at last disappeared like the last spark in a piece of burnt 
                paper. Then she<br>
                saw her brothers standing closely round her with their arms linked<br>
                together. There was but just room enough for them, and not the<br>
                smallest space to spare. The sea dashed against the rock, and<br>
                covered them with spray. The heavens were lighted up with continual<br>
                flashes, and peal after peal of thunder rolled. But the sister 
                and<br>
                brothers sat holding each other's hands, and singing hymns, from 
                which they gained hope and courage. In the early dawn the air 
                became calm and still, and at sunrise the swans flew away from 
                the rock with<br>
                Eliza. The sea was still rough, and from their high position in 
                the<br>
                air, the white foam on the dark green waves looked like millions 
                of<br>
                swans swimming on the water. As the sun rose higher, Eliza saw<br>
                before her, floating on the air, a range of mountains, with shining<br>
                masses of ice on their summits. In the centre, rose a castle<br>
                apparently a mile long, with rows of columns, rising one above<br>
                another, while, around it, palm-trees waved and flowers bloomed 
                as<br>
                large as mill wheels. She asked if this was the land to which 
                they<br>
                were hastening. The swans shook their heads, for what she beheld<br>
                were the beautiful ever-changing cloud palaces of the &quot;Fata<br>
                Morgana,&quot; into which no mortal can enter. Eliza was still 
                gazing at<br>
                the scene, when mountains, forests, and castles melted away, and<br>
                twenty stately churches rose in their stead, with high towers 
                and<br>
                pointed gothic windows. Eliza even fancied she could hear the 
                tones of the organ, but it was the music of the murmuring sea 
                which she<br>
                heard. As they drew nearer to the churches, they also changed 
                into a<br>
                fleet of ships, which seemed to be sailing beneath her; but as 
                she<br>
                looked again, she found it was only a sea mist gliding over the 
                ocean.<br>
                So there continued to pass before her eyes a constant change of 
                scene, till at last she saw the real land to which they were bound, 
                with<br>
                its blue mountains, its cedar forests, and its cities and palaces.<br>
                Long before the sun went down, she sat on a rock, in front of 
                a<br>
                large cave, on the floor of which the over-grown yet delicate 
                green<br>
                creeping plants looked like an embroidered carpet. &quot;Now we 
                shall<br>
                expect to hear what you dream of to-night,&quot; said the youngest 
                brother, as he showed his sister her bedroom.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Heaven grant that I may dream how to save you,&quot; she 
                replied.<br>
                And this thought took such hold upon her mind that she prayed<br>
                earnestly to God for help, and even in her sleep she continued 
                to<br>
                pray. Then it appeared to her as if she were flying high in the 
                air,<br>
                towards the cloudy palace of the &quot;Fata Morgana,&quot; and 
                a fairy came<br>
                out to meet her, radiant and beautiful in appearance, and yet 
                very<br>
                much like the old woman who had given her berries in the wood, 
                and who had told her of the swans with golden crowns on their 
                heads. </p>
              <p>&quot;Your brothers can be released,&quot; said she, &quot;if 
                you have only courage and perseverance. True, water is softer 
                than your own delicate hands,<br>
                and yet it polishes stones into shapes; it feels no pain as your<br>
                fingers would feel, it has no soul, and cannot suffer such agony 
                and<br>
                torment as you will have to endure. Do you see the stinging nettle<br>
                which I hold in my hand? Quantities of the same sort grow round 
                the<br>
                cave in which you sleep, but none will be of any use to you unless<br>
                they grow upon the graves in a churchyard. These you must gather<br>
                even while they burn blisters on your hands. Break them to pieces 
                with your hands and feet, and they will become flax, from which 
                you must spin and weave eleven coats with long sleeves; if these 
                are then<br>
                thrown over the eleven swans, the spell will be broken. But<br>
                remember, that from the moment you commence your task until it 
                is<br>
                finished, even should it occupy years of your life, you must not<br>
                speak. The first word you utter will pierce through the hearts 
                of your<br>
                brothers like a deadly dagger. Their lives hang upon your tongue.<br>
                Remember all I have told you.&quot; And as she finished speaking, 
                she<br>
                touched her hand lightly with the nettle, and a pain, as of burning<br>
                fire, awoke Eliza.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was broad daylight, and close by where she had been sleeping<br>
                lay a nettle like the one she had seen in her dream. She fell 
                on her<br>
                knees and offered her thanks to God. Then she went forth from 
                the cave to begin her work with her delicate hands. She groped 
                in amongst the ugly nettles, which burnt great blisters on her 
                hands and arms, but she determined to bear it gladly if she could 
                only release her dear brothers. So she bruised the nettles with 
                her bare feet and spun the flax. At sunset her brothers returned 
                and were very much frightened when they found her dumb. They believed 
                it to be some new sorcery of their wicked step-mother. But when 
                they saw her hands they understood what she was doing on their 
                behalf, and the youngest brother wept, and where his tears fell 
                the pain ceased, and the burning blisters vanished. She kept to 
                her work all night, for she<br>
                could not rest till she had released her dear brothers. During 
                the<br>
                whole of the following day, while her brothers were absent, she 
                sat in<br>
                solitude, but never before had the time flown so quickly. One 
                coat was already finished and she had begun the second, when she 
                heard the huntsman's horn, and was struck with fear. The sound 
                came nearer and nearer, she heard the dogs barking, and fled with 
                terror into the cave. She hastily bound together the nettles she 
                had gathered into a bundle and sat upon them. Immediately a great 
                dog came bounding towards her out of the ravine, and then another 
                and another; they barked loudly, ran back, and then came again. 
                In a very few minutes all the huntsmen stood before the cave, 
                and the handsomest of them was the king of the country. He advanced 
                towards her, for he had never seen a more beautiful maiden.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;How did you come here, my sweet child?&quot; he asked. 
                But Eliza shook her head. She dared not speak, at the cost of 
                her brothers' lives. And she hid her hands under her apron, so 
                that the king might not see how she must be suffering.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Come with me,&quot; he said; &quot;here you cannot remain. 
                If you are as<br>
                good as you are beautiful, I will dress you in silk and velvet, 
                I will<br>
                place a golden crown upon your head, and you shall dwell, and 
                rule,<br>
                and make your home in my richest castle.&quot; And then he lifted 
                her on<br>
                his horse. She wept and wrung her hands, but the king said, &quot;I 
                wish<br>
                only for your happiness. A time will come when you will thank 
                me for<br>
                this.&quot; And then he galloped away over the mountains, holding 
                her<br>
                before him on this horse, and the hunters followed behind them. 
                As the sun went down, they approached a fair royal city, with 
                churches, and cupolas. On arriving at the castle the king led 
                her into marble halls, where large fountains played, and where 
                the walls and the ceilings<br>
                were covered with rich paintings. But she had no eyes for all 
                these<br>
                glorious sights, she could only mourn and weep. Patiently she<br>
                allowed the women to array her in royal robes, to weave pearls 
                in<br>
                her hair, and draw soft gloves over her blistered fingers. As 
                she<br>
                stood before them in all her rich dress, she looked so dazzingly<br>
                beautiful that the court bowed low in her presence. Then the king<br>
                declared his intention of making her his bride, but the archbishop<br>
                shook his head, and whispered that the fair young maiden was only 
                a<br>
                witch who had blinded the king's eyes and bewitched his heart. 
                But the king would not listen to this; he ordered the music to 
                sound, the<br>
                daintiest dishes to be served, and the loveliest maidens to dance.<br>
                After-wards he led her through fragrant gardens and lofty halls, 
                but<br>
                not a smile appeared on her lips or sparkled in her eyes. She 
                looked<br>
                the very picture of grief. Then the king opened the door of a 
                little<br>
                chamber in which she. was to sleep; it was adorned with rich green<br>
                tapestry, and resembled the cave in which he had found her. On 
                the<br>
                floor lay the bundle of flax which she had spun from the nettles,<br>
                and under the ceiling hung the coat she had made. These things 
                had<br>
                been brought away from the cave as curiosities by one of the huntsmen.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Here you can dream yourself back again in the old home 
                in the<br>
                cave,&quot; said the king; &quot;here is the work with which you 
                employed<br>
                yourself. It will amuse you now in the midst of all this splendor 
                to<br>
                think of that time.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>When Eliza saw all these things which lay so near her heart, 
                a<br>
                smile played around her mouth, and the crimson blood rushed to 
                her<br>
                cheeks. She thought of her brothers, and their release made her 
                so<br>
                joyful that she kissed the king's hand. Then he pressed her to 
                his<br>
                heart. Very soon the joyous church bells announced the marriage 
                feast, and that the beautiful dumb girl out of the wood was to 
                be made the queen of the country. Then the archbishop whispered 
                wicked words in the king's ear, but they did not sink into his 
                heart. </p>
              <p>The marriage was still to take place, and the archbishop himself 
                had to place the crown on the bride's head; in his wicked spite, 
                he pressed the narrow circlet so tightly on her forehead that 
                it caused her pain. But a heavier weight encircled her heart- 
                sorrow for her brothers. She felt not bodily pain. Her mouth was 
                closed; a single word would cost the lives of her brothers. But 
                she loved the kind, handsome king, who did everything to make 
                her happy more and more each day; she loved him with all her heart, 
                and her eyes beamed with the love she dared not speak. Oh! if 
                she had only been able to confide in him and tell him of her grief. 
                But dumb she must remain till her task was finished.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Therefore at night she crept away into her little chamber, which 
                had<br>
                been decked out to look like the cave, and quickly wove one coat 
                after another. But when she began the seventh she found she had 
                no more flax. She knew that the nettles she wanted to use grew 
                in the<br>
                churchyard, and that she must pluck them herself. How should she 
                get out there? &quot;Oh, what is the pain in my fingers to the 
                torment which my heart endures?&quot; said she. &quot;I must venture, 
                I shall not be denied<br>
                help from heaven.&quot; Then with a trembling heart, as if she 
                were about<br>
                to perform a wicked deed, she crept into the garden in the broad<br>
                moonlight, and passed through the narrow walks and the deserted<br>
                streets, till she reached the churchyard. Then she saw on one 
                of the<br>
                broad tombstones a group of ghouls. These hideous creatures took 
                off their rags, as if they intended to bathe, and then clawing 
                open the<br>
                fresh graves with their long, skinny fingers, pulled out the dead<br>
                bodies and ate the flesh! Eliza had to pass close by them, and 
                they<br>
                fixed their wicked glances upon her, but she prayed silently, 
                gathered<br>
                the burning nettles, and carried them home with her to the castle. 
                One<br>
                person only had seen her, and that was the archbishop- he was 
                awake<br>
                while everybody was asleep. Now he thought his opinion was evidently 
                correct. All was not right with the queen. She was a witch, and 
                had bewitched the king and all the people. Secretly he told the 
                king what he had seen and what he feared, and as the hard words 
                came from his tongue, the carved images of the saints shook their 
                heads as if they would say. &quot;It is not so. Eliza is innocent.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the archbishop interpreted it in another way; he believed 
                that<br>
                they witnessed against her, and were shaking their heads at her<br>
                wickedness. Two large tears rolled down the king's cheeks, and 
                he went home with doubt in his heart, and at night he pretended 
                to sleep,<br>
                but there came no real sleep to his eyes, for he saw Eliza get 
                up<br>
                every night and disappear in her own chamber. From day to day 
                his brow became darker, and Eliza saw it and did not understand 
                the reason, but it alarmed her and made her heart tremble for 
                her brothers. Her hot tears glittered like pearls on the regal 
                velvet and diamonds, while all who saw her were wishing they could 
                be queens. </p>
              <p>In the mean time she had almost finished her task; only one coat 
                of mail was wanting, but she had no flax left, and not a single 
                nettle. Once more only, and for the last time, must she venture 
                to the churchyard and pluck a few handfuls. She thought with terror 
                of the solitary walk, and of the horrible ghouls, but her will 
                was firm, as well as her trust in Providence. Eliza went, and 
                the king and the archbishop followed her. They saw her vanish 
                through the wicket gate into the churchyard, and when they came 
                nearer they saw the ghouls sitting on the tombstone, as Eliza 
                had seen them, and the king turned away his head, for he thought 
                she was with them- she whose head had rested on his breast that 
                very evening. &quot;The people must condemn her,&quot; said he, 
                and she was very quickly condemned by every one to suffer death 
                by fire. Away from the gorgeous regal halls was she led to a dark, 
                dreary cell, where the wind whistled through the iron bars. Instead 
                of the velvet and silk dresses, they gave her the coats of mail 
                which she had woven to cover her, and the bundle of nettles for 
                a pillow; but nothing they could give her would have pleased her 
                more. She continued her task with joy, and prayed for help, while 
                the street-boys sang jeering songs about her, and not a soul comforted 
                her with a kind word. Towards evening, she heard at the grating 
                the flutter of a swan's wing, it was her youngest brother- he 
                had found his sister, and she sobbed for joy, although she knew 
                that very likely this would be the last night she would have to 
                live. But still she could hope, for her task was almost finished, 
                and her brothers were come. Then the archbishop arrived, to be 
                with her during her last hours, as he had promised the king. But 
                she shook her head, and begged him, by looks and gestures, not 
                to stay; for in this night she knew she must finish her task, 
                otherwise all her pain and tears and sleepless nights would have 
                been suffered in vain. The archbishop withdrew, uttering bitter 
                words against her; but poor Eliza knew that she was innocent, 
                and diligently continued her work.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The little mice ran about the floor, they dragged the nettles 
                to<br>
                her feet, to help as well as they could; and the thrush sat outside<br>
                the grating of the window, and sang to her the whole night long, 
                as<br>
                sweetly as possible, to keep up her spirits.<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was still twilight, and at least an hour before sunrise, when<br>
                the eleven brothers stood at the castle gate, and demanded to 
                be<br>
                brought before the king. They were told it could not be, it was 
                yet<br>
                almost night, and as the king slept they dared not disturb him. 
                They<br>
                threatened, they entreated. Then the guard appeared, and even 
                the king himself, inquiring what all the noise meant. At this 
                moment the sun rose. The eleven brothers were seen no more, but 
                eleven wild swans flew away over the castle.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And now all the people came streaming forth from the gates of<br>
                the city, to see the witch burnt. An old horse drew the cart on<br>
                which she sat. They had dressed her in a garment of coarse<br>
                sackcloth. Her lovely hair hung loose on her shoulders, her cheeks<br>
                were deadly pale, her lips moved silently, while her fingers still<br>
                worked at the green flax. Even on the way to death, she would 
                not give up her task. The ten coats of mail lay at her feet, she 
                was working hard at the eleventh, while the mob jeered her and 
                said, &quot;See the witch, how she mutters! She has no hymn-book 
                in her hand. She sits there with her ugly sorcery. Let us tear 
                it in a thousand pieces.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And then they pressed towards her, and would have destroyed the<br>
                coats of mail, but at the same moment eleven wild swans flew over 
                her, and alighted on the cart. Then they flapped their large wings, 
                and the crowd drew on one side in alarm.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is a sign from heaven that she is innocent,&quot; whispered 
                many of<br>
                them; but they ventured not to say it aloud.<br>
              </p>
              <p>As the executioner seized her by the hand, to lift her out of<br>
                the cart, she hastily threw the eleven coats of mail over the 
                swans,<br>
                and they immediately became eleven handsome princes; but the<br>
                youngest had a swan's wing, instead of an arm; for she had not 
                been<br>
                able to finish the last sleeve of the coat.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now I may speak,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I am innocent.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the people, who saw what happened, bowed to her, as before<br>
                a saint; but she sank lifeless in her brothers' arms, overcome 
                with<br>
                suspense, anguish, and pain.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, she is innocent,&quot; said the eldest brother; and 
                then he<br>
                related all that had taken place; and while he spoke there rose 
                in the<br>
                air a fragrance as from millions of roses. Every piece of faggot 
                in<br>
                the pile had taken root, and threw out branches, and appeared 
                a<br>
                thick hedge, large and high, covered with roses; while above all<br>
                bloomed a white and shining flower, that glittered like a star. 
                This<br>
                flower the king plucked, and placed in Eliza's bosom, when she 
                awoke from her swoon, with peace and happiness in her heart. And 
                all the church bells rang of themselves, and the birds came in 
                great troops.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And a marriage procession returned to the castle, such as no 
                king<br>
                had ever before seen.</p>

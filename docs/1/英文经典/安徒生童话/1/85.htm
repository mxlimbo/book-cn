              <p class="h" align="center"> THE PORTUGUESE DUCK</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> A DUCK once arrived from Portugal, but there were some who said<br>
                she came from Spain, which is almost the same thing. At all events,<br>
                she was called the &quot;Portuguese,&quot; and she laid eggs, 
                was killed, and<br>
                cooked, and there was an end of her. But the ducklings which crept<br>
                forth from the eggs were also called &quot;Portuguese,&quot; and 
                about that<br>
                there may be some question. But of all the family one only remained 
                in the duckyard, which may be called a farmyard, as the chickens 
                were admitted, and the cock strutted about in a very hostile manner. 
                &quot;He annoys me with his loud crowing,&quot; said the Portuguese 
                duck; &quot;but, still, he's a handsome bird, there's no denying 
                that, although he's<br>
                not a drake. He ought to moderate his voice, like those little 
                birds<br>
                who are singing in the lime-trees over there in our neighbor's 
                garden,<br>
                but that is an art only acquired in polite society. How sweetly 
                they<br>
                sing there; it is quite a pleasure to listen to them! I call it<br>
                Portuguese singing. If I had only such a little singing-bird, 
                I'd be<br>
                kind and good as a mother to him, for it's in my nature, in my<br>
                Portuguese blood.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>While she was speaking, one of the little singing-birds came<br>
                tumbling head over heels from the roof into the yard. The cat 
                was<br>
                after him, but he had escaped from her with a broken wing, and 
                so came tumbling into the yard. &quot;That's just like the cat, 
                she's a villain,&quot;<br>
                said the Portuguese duck. &quot;I remember her ways when I had 
                children<br>
                of my own. How can such a creature be allowed to live, and wander<br>
                about upon the roofs. I don't think they allow such things in<br>
                Portugal.&quot; She pitied the little singing-bird, and so did 
                all the<br>
                other ducks who were not Portuguese.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Poor little creature!&quot; they said, one after another, 
                as they came<br>
                up. &quot;We can't sing, certainly; but we have a sounding-board, 
                or<br>
                something of the kind, within us; we can feel that, though we 
                don't<br>
                talk about it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But I can talk,&quot; said the Portuguese duck; &quot;and 
                I'll do something<br>
                for the little fellow; it's my duty;&quot; and she stepped into 
                the<br>
                water-trough, and beat her wings upon the water so strongly that 
                the<br>
                bird was nearly drowned by a shower-bath; but the duck meant it<br>
                kindly. &quot;That is a good deed,&quot; she said; &quot;I hope 
                the others will<br>
                take example by it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Tweet, tweet!&quot; said the little bird, for one of his 
                wings being<br>
                broken, he found it difficult to shake himself; but he quite<br>
                understood that the bath was meant kindly, and he said, &quot;You 
                are<br>
                very kind-hearted, madam;&quot; but he did not wish for a second 
                bath.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I have never thought about my heart,&quot; replied the 
                Portuguese<br>
                duck, &quot;but I know that I love all my fellow-creatures, except 
                the cat,<br>
                and nobody can expect me to love her, for she ate up two of my<br>
                ducklings. But pray make yourself at home; it is easy to make 
                one's<br>
                self comfortable. I am myself from a foreign country, as you may 
                see<br>
                by my feathery dress. My drake is a native of these parts; he's 
                not of<br>
                my race; but I am not proud on that account. If any one here can<br>
                understand you, I may say positively I am that person.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;She's quite full of 'Portulak,'&quot; said a little common 
                duck, who<br>
                was witty. All the common ducks considered the word &quot;Portulak&quot; 
                a<br>
                good joke, for it sounded like Portugal. They nudged each other, 
                and<br>
                said, &quot;Quack! that was witty!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the other ducks began to notice the little bird. &quot;The<br>
                Portuguese had certainly a great flow of language,&quot; they 
                said to the<br>
                little bird. &quot;For our part we don't care to fill our beaks 
                with such<br>
                long words, but we sympathize with you quite as much. If we don't 
                do anything else, we can walk about with you everywhere, and we 
                think that is the best thing we can do.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You have a lovely voice,&quot; said one of the eldest ducks; 
                &quot;it<br>
                must be great satisfaction to you to be able to give so much<br>
                pleasure as you do. I am certainly no judge of your singing so 
                I<br>
                keep my beak shut, which is better than talking nonsense, as others<br>
                do.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Don't plague him so, interposed the Portuguese duck; &quot;he 
                requires<br>
                rest and nursing. My little singing-bird do you wish me to prepare<br>
                another bath for you?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, no! no! pray let me dry,&quot; implored the little 
                bird.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The water-cure is the only remedy for me, when I am not 
                well,&quot;<br>
                said the Portuguese. &quot;Amusement, too, is very beneficial. 
                The fowls<br>
                from the neighborhood will soon be here to pay you a visit. There<br>
                are two Cochin Chinese amongst them; they wear feathers on their 
                legs, and are well educated. They have been brought from a great 
                distance, and consequently I treat them with greater respect than 
                I do the others.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the fowls arrived, and the cock was polite enough to-day 
                to<br>
                keep from being rude. &quot;You are a real songster,&quot; he 
                said, &quot;you do as<br>
                much with your little voice as it is possible to do; but there<br>
                requires more noise and shrillness in any one who wishes it to 
                be<br>
                known who he is.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The two Chinese were quite enchanted with the appearance of the<br>
                singing-bird. His feathers had been much ruffled by his bath, 
                so<br>
                that he seemed to them quite like a tiny Chinese fowl. &quot;He's<br>
                charming,&quot; they said to each other, and began a conversation 
                with<br>
                him in whispers, using the most aristocratic Chinese dialect: 
                &quot;We<br>
                are of the same race as yourself,&quot; they said. &quot;The ducks, 
                even the<br>
                Portuguese, are all aquatic birds, as you must have noticed. You 
                do<br>
                not know us yet,- very few know us, or give themselves the trouble<br>
                to make our acquaintance, not even any of the fowls, though we 
                are<br>
                born to occupy a higher grade in society than most of them. But 
                that<br>
                does not disturb us, we quietly go on in our own way among the 
                rest,<br>
                whose ideas are certainly not ours; for we look at the bright 
                side<br>
                of things, and only speak what is good, although that is sometimes<br>
                very difficult to find where none exists. Except ourselves and 
                the<br>
                cock there is not one in the yard who can be called talented or<br>
                polite. It cannot even be said of the ducks, and we warn you, 
                little<br>
                bird, not to trust that one yonder, with the short tail feathers,<br>
                for she is cunning; that curiously marked one, with the crooked<br>
                stripes on her wings, is a mischief-maker, and never lets any 
                one have<br>
                the last word, though she is always in the wrong. That fat duck 
                yonder speaks evil of every one, and that is against our principles. 
                If we have nothing good to tell, we close our beaks. The Portuguese 
                is the only one who has had any education, and with whom we can 
                associate, but she is passionate, and talks too much about 'Portugal.'&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I wonder what those two Chinese are whispering about,&quot;<br>
                whispered one duck to another; &quot;they are always doing it, 
                and it<br>
                annoys me. We never speak to them.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Now the drake came up, and he thought the little singing-bird<br>
                was a sparrow. &quot;Well, I don't understand the difference,&quot; 
                he said; &quot;it<br>
                appears to me all the same. He's only a plaything, and if people<br>
                will have playthings, why let them, I say.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Don't take any notice of what he says,&quot; whispered 
                the Portuguese;<br>
                &quot;he's very well in matters of business, and with him business 
                is<br>
                placed before everything. But now I shall lie down and have a 
                little<br>
                rest. It is a duty we owe to ourselves that we may be nice and 
                fat<br>
                when we come to be embalmed with sage and onions and apples.&quot; 
                So she laid herself down in the sun and winked with one eye; she 
                had a very comfortable place, and felt so comfortable that she 
                fell asleep. </p>
              <p>The little singing-bird busied himself for some time with his 
                broken wing, and at last he lay down, too, quite close to his 
                protectress. The<br>
                sun shone warm and bright, and he found out that it was a very 
                good<br>
                place. But the fowls of the neighborhood were all awake, and, 
                to<br>
                tell the truth, they had paid a visit to the duckyard, simply 
                and<br>
                solely to find food for themselves. The Chinese were the first 
                to<br>
                leave, and the other fowls soon followed them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The witty little duck said of the Portuguese, that the old lady<br>
                was getting quite a &quot;doting ducky,&quot; All the other ducks 
                laughed at<br>
                this. &quot;Doting ducky,&quot; they whispered. &quot;Oh, that's 
                too 'witty!'&quot; And<br>
                then they repeated the former joke about &quot;Portulak,&quot; 
                and declared it<br>
                was most amusing. Then they all lay down to have a nap.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They had been lying asleep for some time, when suddenly<br>
                something was thrown into the yard for them to eat. It came down<br>
                with such a bang, that the whole company started up and clapped<br>
                their wings. The Portuguese awoke too, and rushed over to the 
                other<br>
                side: in so doing she trod upon the little singing-bird.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Tweet,&quot; he cried; &quot;you trod very hard upon me, 
                madam.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well, then, why do you lie in my way?&quot; she retorted, 
                &quot;you must<br>
                not be so touchy. I have nerves of my own, but I do not cry 'tweet.'&quot;<br>
                &quot;Don't be angry,&quot; said the little bird; &quot;the 'tweet' 
                slipped out<br>
                of my beak unawares.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Portuguese did not listen to him, but began eating as fast<br>
                as she could, and made a good meal. When she had finished, she 
                lay<br>
                down again, and the little bird, who wished to be amiable, began 
                to<br>
                sing,-</p>
              <p> &quot;Chirp and twitter,<br>
                The dew-drops glitter,<br>
                In the hours of sunny spring,<br>
                I'll sing my best,<br>
                Till I go to rest,<br>
                With my head behind my wing.&quot;</p>
              <p> &quot;Now I want rest after my dinner,&quot; said the Portuguese; 
                &quot;you<br>
                must conform to the rules of the house while you are here. I want 
                to<br>
                sleep now.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The little bird was quite taken aback, for he meant it kindly.<br>
                When madam awoke afterwards, there he stood before her with a 
                little<br>
                corn he had found, and laid it at her feet; but as she had not 
                slept<br>
                well, she was naturally in a bad temper. &quot;Give that to a 
                chicken,&quot; she<br>
                said, &quot;and don't be always standing in my way.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Why are you angry with me?&quot; replied the little singing-bird,<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What have I done?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Done!&quot; repeated the Portuguese duck, &quot;your mode 
                of expressing<br>
                yourself is not very polite. I must call your attention to that 
                fact.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It was sunshine here yesterday,&quot; said the little bird, 
                &quot;but<br>
                to-day it is cloudy and the air is close.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You know very little about the weather, I fancy,&quot; 
                she retorted,<br>
                &quot;the day is not over yet. Don't stand there, looking so stupid.&quot;<br>
                &quot;But you are looking at me just as the wicked eyes looked 
                when I<br>
                fell into the yard yesterday.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Impertinent creature!&quot; exclaimed the Portuguese duck: 
                &quot;would<br>
                you compare me with the cat- that beast of prey? There's not a 
                drop of malicious blood in me. I've taken your part, and now I'll 
                teach you<br>
                better manners.&quot; So saying, she made a bite at the little<br>
                singing-bird's head, and he fell dead on the ground. &quot;Now 
                whatever<br>
                is the meaning of this?&quot; &quot;she said; &quot;could he not 
                bear even such a<br>
                little peck as I gave him? Then certainly he was not made for 
                this<br>
                world. I've been like a mother to him, I know that, for I've a 
                good<br>
                heart.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the cock from the neighboring yard stuck his head in, and<br>
                crowed with steam-engine power.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You'll kill me with your crowing,&quot; she cried, &quot;it's 
                all your<br>
                fault. He's lost his life, and I'm very near losing mine.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There's not much of him lying there,&quot; observed the 
                cock.<br>
                &quot;Speak of him with respect,&quot; said the Portuguese duck, 
                &quot;for he had<br>
                manners and education, and he could sing. He was affectionate 
                and<br>
                gentle, and that is as rare a quality in animals as in those who<br>
                call themselves human beings.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then all the ducks came crowding round the little dead bird. 
                Ducks<br>
                have strong passions, whether they feel envy or pity. There was<br>
                nothing to envy here, so they all showed a great deal of pity, 
                even<br>
                the two Chinese. &quot;We shall never have another singing-bird 
                again<br>
                amongst us; he was almost a Chinese,&quot; they whispered, and 
                then they<br>
                wept with such a noisy, clucking sound, that all the other fowls<br>
                clucked too, but the ducks went about with redder eyes afterwards. 
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We have hearts of our own,&quot; they said, &quot;nobody 
                can deny that.&quot;<br>
                &quot;Hearts!&quot; repeated the Portuguese, &quot;indeed you 
                have, almost as<br>
                tender as the ducks in Portugal.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Let us think of getting something to satisfy our hunger,&quot; 
                said<br>
                the drake, that's the most important business. If one of our toys 
                is<br>
                broken, why we have plenty more.&quot;</p>

              <p class="h" align="center"> UNDER THE WILLOW-TREE</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THE region round the little town of Kjoge is very bleak and<br>
                cold. The town lies on the sea shore, which is always beautiful; 
                but<br>
                here it might be more beautiful than it is, for on every side 
                the<br>
                fields are flat, and it is a long way to the forest. But when<br>
                persons reside in a place and get used to it, they can always 
                find<br>
                something beautiful in it,- something for which they long, even 
                in the<br>
                most charming spot in the world which is not home. It must be 
                owned that there are in the outskirts of the town some humble 
                gardens on the banks of a little stream that runs on towards the 
                sea, and in summer these gardens look very pretty. Such indeed 
                was the opinion of two little children, whose parents were neighbors, 
                and who played in these gardens, and forced their way from one 
                garden to the other through the gooseberry-bushes that divided 
                them. In one of the gardens grew an elder-tree, and in the other 
                an old willow, under which the children were very fond of playing. 
                They had permission to do so, although the tree stood close by 
                the stream, and they might easily have fallen into the water; 
                but the eye of God watches over the little ones, otherwise they 
                would never be safe. At the same time, these children were very 
                careful not to go too near the water; indeed, the boy was so afraid 
                of it, that in the summer, while the other<br>
                children were splashing about in the sea, nothing could entice 
                him<br>
                to join them. They jeered and laughed at him, and he was obliged 
                to<br>
                bear it all as patiently as he could. Once the neighbor's little 
                girl,<br>
                Joanna, dreamed that she was sailing in a boat, and the boy- Knud<br>
                was his name- waded out in the water to join her, and the water 
                came<br>
                up to his neck, and at last closed over his head, and in a moment 
                he<br>
                had disappeared. When little Knud heard this dream, it seemed 
                as if he could not bear the mocking and jeering again; how could 
                he dare to go into the water now, after Joanna's dream! He never 
                would do it, for this dream always satisfied him. The parents 
                of these children, who were poor, often sat together while Knud 
                and Joanna played in the gardens or in the road. Along this road- 
                a row of willow-trees had<br>
                been planted to separate it from a ditch on one side of it. They<br>
                were not very handsome trees, for the tops had been cut off;<br>
                however, they were intended for use, and not for show. The old<br>
                willow-tree in the garden was much handsomer, and therefore the<br>
                children were very fond of sitting under it. The town had a large<br>
                market-place; and at the fair-time there would be whole rows, 
                like<br>
                streets, of tents and booths containing silks and ribbons, and 
                toys<br>
                and cakes, and everything that could be wished for. There were<br>
                crowds of people, and sometimes the weather would be rainy, and 
                splash with moisture the woollen jackets of the peasants; but 
                it did not destroy the beautiful fragrance of the honey-cakes 
                and gingerbread with which one booth was filled; and the best 
                of it was, that the man who sold these cakes always lodged during 
                the fair-time with little Knud's parents. So every now and then 
                he had a present of<br>
                gingerbread, and of course Joanna always had a share. And, more<br>
                delightful still, the gingerbread seller knew all sorts of things 
                to<br>
                tell and could even relate stories about his own gingerbread. 
                So one<br>
                evening he told them a story that made such a deep impression 
                on the<br>
                children that they never forgot it; and therefore I think we may 
                as<br>
                well hear it too, for it is not very long.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Once upon a time,&quot; said he, &quot;there lay on my 
                counter two<br>
                gingerbread cakes, one in the shape of a man wearing a hat, the<br>
                other of a maiden without a bonnet. Their faces were on the side<br>
                that was uppermost, for on the other side they looked very<br>
                different. Most people have a best side to their characters, which<br>
                they take care to show to the world. On the left, just where the 
                heart<br>
                is, the gingerbread man had an almond stuck in to represent it, 
                but<br>
                the maiden was honey cake all over. They were placed on the counter 
                as samples, and after lying there a long time they at last fell 
                in love<br>
                with each other; but neither of them spoke of it to the other, 
                as they<br>
                should have done if they expected anything to follow. 'He is a 
                man, he ought to speak the first word,' thought the gingerbread 
                maiden; but<br>
                she felt quite happy- she was sure that her love was returned. 
                But his<br>
                thoughts were far more ambitious, as the thoughts of a man often<br>
                are. He dreamed that he was a real street boy, that he possessed<br>
                four real pennies, and that he had bought the gingerbread lady, 
                and<br>
                ate her up. And so they lay on the counter for days and weeks, 
                till<br>
                they grew hard and dry; but the thoughts of the maiden became 
                ever<br>
                more tender and womanly. 'Ah well, it is enough for me that I 
                have<br>
                been able to live on the same counter with him,' said she one 
                day;<br>
                when suddenly, 'crack,' and she broke in two. 'Ah,' said the<br>
                gingerbread man to himself, 'if she had only known of my love, 
                she<br>
                would have kept together a little longer.' And here they both 
                are, and<br>
                that is their history,&quot; said the cake man. &quot;You think 
                the history of<br>
                their lives and their silent love, which never came to anything,<br>
                very remarkable; and there they are for you.&quot; So saying, 
                he gave<br>
                Joanna the gingerbread man, who was still quite whole- and to 
                Knud the broken maiden; but the children had been so much impressed 
                by the story, that they had not the heart to eat the lovers up.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The next day they went into the churchyard, and took the two<br>
                cake figures with them, and sat down under the church wall, which<br>
                was covered with luxuriant ivy in summer and winter, and looked 
                as<br>
                if hung with rich tapestry. They stuck up the two gingerbread<br>
                figures in the sunshine among the green leaves, and then told 
                the<br>
                story, and all about the silent love which came to nothing, to 
                a group<br>
                of children. They called it, &quot;love,&quot; because the story 
                was so<br>
                lovely, and the other children had the same opinion. But when 
                they<br>
                turned to look at the gingerbread pair, the broken maiden was 
                gone!<br>
                A great boy, out of wickedness, had eaten her up. At first the<br>
                children cried about it; but afterwards, thinking very probably 
                that<br>
                the poor lover ought not to be left alone in the world, they ate 
                him<br>
                up too: but they never forgot the story.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The two children still continued to play together by the<br>
                elder-tree, and under the willow; and the little maiden sang beautiful<br>
                songs, with a voice that was as clear as a bell. Knud, on the<br>
                contrary, had not a note of music in him, but knew the words of 
                the<br>
                songs, and that of course is something. The people of Kjoge, and<br>
                even the rich wife of the man who kept the fancy shop, would stand 
                and listen while Joanna was singing, and say, &quot;She has really 
                a very sweet voice.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Those were happy days; but they could not last forever. The<br>
                neighbors were separated, the mother of the little girl was dead,<br>
                and her father had thoughts of marrying again and of residing 
                in the<br>
                capital, where he had been promised a very lucrative appointment 
                as<br>
                messenger. The neighbors parted with tears, the children wept 
                sadly;<br>
                but their parents promised that they should write to each other 
                at<br>
                least once a year.<br>
              </p>
              <p>After this, Knud was bound apprentice to a shoemaker; he was<br>
                growing a great boy, and could not be allowed to run wild any<br>
                longer. Besides, he was going to be confirmed. Ah, how happy he<br>
                would have been on that festal day in Copenhagen with little Joanna;<br>
                but he still remained at Kjoge, and had never seen the great city,<br>
                though the town is not five miles from it. But far across the 
                bay,<br>
                when the sky was clear, the towers of Copenhagen could be seen; 
                and on the day of his confirmation he saw distinctly the golden 
                cross on the principal church glittering in the sun. How often 
                his thoughts<br>
                were with Joanna! but did she think of him? Yes. About Christmas<br>
                came a letter from her father to Knud's parents, which stated 
                that<br>
                they were going on very well in Copenhagen, and mentioning<br>
                particularly that Joanna's beautiful voice was likely to bring 
                her a<br>
                brilliant fortune in the future. She was engaged to sing at a 
                concert,<br>
                and she had already earned money by singing, out of which she 
                sent her dear neighbors at Kjoge a whole dollar, for them to make 
                merry on Christmas eve, and they were to drink her health. She 
                had herself<br>
                added this in a postscript, and in the same postscript she wrote,<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Kind regards to Knud.&quot;<br>
                The good neighbors wept, although the news was so pleasant; but<br>
                they wept tears of joy. Knud's thoughts had been daily with Joanna,<br>
                and now he knew that she also had thought of him; and the nearer 
                the<br>
                time came for his apprenticeship to end, the clearer did it appear<br>
                to him that he loved Joanna, and that she must be his wife; and 
                a<br>
                smile came on his lips at the thought, and at one time he drew 
                the<br>
                thread so fast as he worked, and pressed his foot so hard against<br>
                the knee strap, that he ran the awl into his finger; but what 
                did he<br>
                care for that? He was determined not to play the dumb lover as 
                both<br>
                the gingerbread cakes had done; the story was a good lesson to 
                him.<br>
                At length he become a journeyman; and then, for the first time, 
                he<br>
                prepared for a journey to Copenhagen, with his knapsack packed 
                and<br>
                ready. A master was expecting him there, and he thought of Joanna, 
                and how glad she would be to see him. She was now seventeen, and 
                he nineteen years old. He wanted to buy a gold ring for her in 
                Kjoge, but then he recollected how far more beautiful such things 
                would be in Copenhagen. So he took leave of his parents, and on 
                a rainy day,<br>
                late in the autumn, wandered forth on foot from the town of his 
                birth.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The leaves were falling from the trees; and, by the time he arrived 
                at<br>
                his new master's in the great metropolis, he was wet through. 
                On the<br>
                following Sunday he intended to pay his first visit to Joanna's<br>
                father. When the day came, the new journeyman's clothes were brought 
                out, and a new hat, which he had brought in Kjoge. The hat became 
                him very well, for hitherto he had only worn a cap. He found the 
                house that he sought easily, but had to mount so many stairs that 
                he became quite giddy; it surprised him to find how people lived 
                over one another in this dreadful town.<br>
              </p>
              <p>On entering a room in which everything denoted prosperity,<br>
                Joanna's father received him very kindly. The new wife was a<br>
                stranger to him, but she shook hands with him, and offered him 
                coffee.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Joanna will be very glad to see you,&quot; said her father. 
                &quot;You<br>
                have grown quite a nice young man, you shall see her presently; 
                she is<br>
                a good child, and is the joy of my heart, and, please God, she 
                will<br>
                continue to be so; she has her own room now, and pays us rent 
                for it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the father knocked quite politely at a door, as if he were 
                a<br>
                stranger, and then they both went in. How pretty everything was 
                in<br>
                that room! a more beautiful apartment could not be found in the<br>
                whole town of Kjoge; the queen herself could scarcely be better<br>
                accommodated. There were carpets, and rugs, and window curtains<br>
                hanging to the ground. Pictures and flowers were scattered about.<br>
              </p>
              <p>There was a velvet chair, and a looking-glass against the wall, 
                into<br>
                which a person might be in danger of stepping, for it was as large<br>
                as a door. All this Knud saw at a glance, and yet, in truth, he 
                saw<br>
                nothing but Joanna. She was quite grown up, and very different 
                from<br>
                what Knud had fancied her, and a great deal more beautiful. In 
                all<br>
                Kjoge there was not a girl like her; and how graceful she looked,<br>
                although her glance at first was odd, and not familiar; but for 
                a<br>
                moment only, then she rushed towards him as if she would have 
                kissed him; she did not, however, although she was very near it. 
                Yes, she really was joyful at seeing the friend of her childhood 
                once more, and the tears even stood in her eyes. Then she asked 
                so many questions about Knud's parents, and everything, even to 
                the elder-tree and the willow, which she called &quot;elder-mother 
                and willow-father,&quot; as if they had been human beings; and 
                so, indeed, they might be, quite as much as the gingerbread cakes. 
                Then she talked about them, and the story of their silent love, 
                and how they lay on the counter together<br>
                and split in two; and then she laughed heartily; but the blood<br>
                rushed into Knud's cheeks, and his heart beat quickly. Joanna 
                was<br>
                not proud at all; he noticed that through her he was invited by 
                her<br>
                parents to remain the whole evening with them, and she poured 
                out<br>
                the tea and gave him a cup herself; and afterwards she took a 
                book and read aloud to them, and it seemed to Knud as if the story 
                was all<br>
                about himself and his love, for it agreed so well with his own<br>
                thoughts. And then she sang a simple song, which, through her 
                singing, became a true story, and as if she poured forth the feelings 
                of her own heart.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; he thought, &quot;she knows I am fond of her.&quot; 
                The tears he could<br>
                not restrain rolled down his cheeks, and he was unable to utter 
                a<br>
                single word; it seemed as if he had been struck dumb.<br>
              </p>
              <p>When he left, she pressed his hand, and said, &quot;You have 
                a kind<br>
                heart, Knud: remain always as you are now.&quot; What an evening 
                of<br>
                happiness this had been; to sleep after it was impossible, and 
                Knud<br>
                did not sleep.<br>
              </p>
              <p>At parting, Joanna's father had said, &quot;Now, you won't quite 
                forget<br>
                us; you must not let the whole winter go by without paying us<br>
                another visit;&quot; so that Knud felt himself free to go again 
                the<br>
                following Sunday evening, and so he did. But every evening after<br>
                working hours- and they worked by candle-light then- he walked 
                out<br>
                into the town, and through the street in which Joanna lived, to 
                look<br>
                up at her window. It was almost always lighted up; and one evening<br>
                he saw the shadow of her face quite plainly on the window blind;<br>
                that was a glorious evening for him. His master's wife did not 
                like<br>
                his always going out in the evening, idling, wasting time, as 
                she<br>
                called it, and she shook her head.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But his master only smiled, and said, &quot;He is a young man, 
                my dear,<br>
                you know.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;On Sunday I shall see her,&quot; said Knud to himself, 
                &quot;and I will<br>
                tell her that I love her with my whole heart and soul, and that 
                she<br>
                must be my little wife. I know I am now only a poor journeyman<br>
                shoemaker, but I will work and strive, and become a master in 
                time.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Yes, I will speak to her; nothing comes from silent love. I learnt<br>
                that from the gingerbread-cake story.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Sunday came, but when Knud arrived, they were all unfortunately<br>
                invited out to spend the evening, and were obliged to tell him 
                so.<br>
                Joanna pressed his hand, and said, &quot;Have you ever been to 
                the<br>
                theatre? you must go once; I sing there on Wednesday, and if you<br>
                have time on that day, I will send you a ticket; my father knows 
                where<br>
                your master lives.&quot; How kind this was of her! And on Wednesday,<br>
                about noon, Knud received a sealed packet with no address, but 
                the<br>
                ticket was inside; and in the evening Knud went, for the first 
                time in<br>
                his life, to a theatre. And what did he see? He saw Joanna, and 
                how<br>
                beautiful and charming she looked! He certainly saw her being<br>
                married to a stranger, but that was all in the play, and only 
                a<br>
                pretence; Knud well knew that. She could never have the heart, 
                he<br>
                thought, to send him a ticket to go and see it, if it had been 
                real.<br>
              </p>
              <p>So he looked on, and when all the people applauded and clapped 
                their hands, he shouted &quot;hurrah.&quot; He could see that 
                even the king smiled at Joanna, and seemed delighted with her 
                singing. How small Knud felt; but then he loved her so dearly, 
                and thought she loved him, and the man must speak the first word, 
                as the gingerbread maiden had<br>
                thought. Ah, how much there was for him in that childish story. 
                As<br>
                soon as Sunday arrived, he went again, and felt as if he were 
                about to<br>
                enter on holy ground. Joanna was alone to welcome him, nothing 
                could be more fortunate.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I am so glad you are come,&quot; she said. I was thinking 
                of sending<br>
                my father for you, but I had a presentiment that you would be 
                here<br>
                this evening. The fact is, I wanted to tell you that I am going 
                to<br>
                France. I shall start on Friday. It is necessary for me to go 
                there,<br>
                if I wish to become a first-rate performer.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Poor Knud! it seemed to him as if the whole room was whirling<br>
                round with him. His courage failed, and he felt as if his heart<br>
                would burst. He kept down the tears, but it was easy to see how<br>
                sorrowful he was.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You honest, faithful soul,&quot; she exclaimed; and the 
                words loosened<br>
                Knud's tongue, and he told her how truly he had loved her, and 
                that<br>
                she must be his wife; and as he said this, he saw Joanna change 
                color,<br>
                and turn pale. She let his hand fall, and said, earnestly and<br>
                mournfully, &quot;Knud, do not make yourself and me unhappy. I 
                will<br>
                always be a good sister to you, one in whom you can trust; but 
                I can<br>
                never be anything more.&quot; And she drew her white hand over 
                his<br>
                burning forehead, and said, &quot;God gives strength to bear a 
                great<br>
                deal, if we only strive ourselves to endure.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>At this moment her stepmother came into the room, and Joanna<br>
                said quickly, &quot;Knud is so unhappy, because I am going away;&quot; 
                and it<br>
                appeared as if they had only been talking of her journey. &quot;Come, 
                be<br>
                a man&quot; she added, placing her hand on his shoulder; &quot;you 
                are still a<br>
                child, and you must be good and reasonable, as you were when we 
                were both children, and played together under the willow-tree.&quot;<br>
                Knud listened, but he felt as if the world had slid out of its<br>
                course. His thoughts were like a loose thread fluttering to and 
                fro in<br>
                the wind. He stayed, although he could not tell whether she had<br>
                asked him to do so. But she was kind and gentle to him; she poured 
                out his tea, and sang to him; but the song had not the old tone 
                in it,<br>
                although it was wonderfully beautiful, and made his heart feel 
                ready<br>
                to burst. And then he rose to go. He did not offer his hand, but 
                she<br>
                seized it, and said- &quot;Will you not shake hands with your 
                sister at parting, my old playfellow?&quot; and she smiled through 
                the tears that were rolling down her cheeks. Again she repeated 
                the word &quot;brother,&quot; which was a great consolation certainly; 
                and thus they parted.<br>
              </p>
              <p>She sailed to France, and Knud wandered about the muddy streets 
                of<br>
                Copenhagen. The other journeymen in the shop asked him why he 
                looked so gloomy, and wanted him to go and amuse himself with 
                them, as he was still a young man. So he went with them to a dancing-room. 
                He saw many handsome girls there, but none like Joanna; and here, 
                where he thought to forget her, she was more life-like before 
                his mind than ever.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;God gives us strength to bear much, if we try to do our 
                best,&quot; she<br>
                had said; and as he thought of this, a devout feeling came into 
                his<br>
                mind, and he folded his hands. Then, as the violins played and 
                the<br>
                girls danced round the room, he started; for it seemed to him 
                as if he<br>
                were in a place where he ought not to have brought Joanna, for 
                she was here with him in his heart; and so he went out at once. 
                As he went through the streets at a quick pace, he passed the 
                house where she used to live; it was all dark, empty, and lonely. 
                But the world went<br>
                on its course, and Knud was obliged to go on too.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Winter came; the water was frozen, and everything seemed buried 
                in<br>
                a cold grave. But when spring returned, and the first steamer 
                prepared<br>
                to sail, Knud was seized with a longing to wander forth into the<br>
                world, but not to France. So he packed his knapsack, and travelled<br>
                through Germany, going from town to town, but finding neither 
                rest<br>
                or peace. It was not till he arrived at the glorious old town 
                of<br>
                Nuremberg that he gained the mastery over himself, and rested 
                his<br>
                weary feet; and here he remained.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Nuremberg is a wonderful old city, and looks as if it had been 
                cut<br>
                out of an old picture-book. The streets seem to have arranged<br>
                themselves according to their own fancy, and as if the houses 
                objected to stand in rows or rank and file. Gables, with little 
                towers,<br>
                ornamented columns, and statues, can be seen even to the city 
                gate;<br>
                and from the singular-shaped roofs, waterspouts, formed like<br>
                dragons, or long lean dogs, extend far across to the middle of 
                the<br>
                street. Here, in the market-place, stood Knud, with his knapsack 
                on<br>
                his back, close to one of the old fountains which are so beautifully<br>
                adorned with figures, scriptural and historical, and which spring 
                up<br>
                between the sparkling jets of water. A pretty servant-maid was 
                just<br>
                filling her pails, and she gave Knud a refreshing draught; she 
                had a<br>
                handful of roses, and she gave him one, which appeared to him 
                like a<br>
                good omen for the future. From a neighboring church came the sounds 
                of music, and the familiar tones reminded him of the organ at 
                home at Kjoge; so he passed into the great cathedral. The sunshine 
                streamed through the painted glass windows, and between two lofty 
                slender pillars. His thoughts became prayerful, and calm peace 
                rested on his soul. He next sought and found a good master in 
                Nuremberg, with whom he stayed and learnt the German language.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The old moat round the town had been converted into a number 
                of<br>
                little kitchen gardens; but the high walls, with their heavy-looking<br>
                towers, are still standing. Inside these walls the ropemaker twisted<br>
                his ropes along a walk built like a gallery, and in the cracks 
                and<br>
                crevices of the walls elderbushes grow and stretch their green<br>
                boughs over the small houses which stand below. In one of these 
                houses lived the master for whom Knud worked; and over the little 
                garret window where he sat, the elder-tree waved its branches. 
                Here he dwelt through one summer and winter, but when spring came 
                again, he could endure it no longer. The elder was in blossom, 
                and its fragrance was so homelike, that he fancied himself back 
                again in the gardens of Kjoge. So Knud left his master, and went 
                to work for another who lived farther in the town, where no elder 
                grew. His workshop was quite close to one of the old stone bridges, 
                near to a water-mill, round which the roaring stream rushed and 
                foamed always, yet restrained by the neighboring houses, whose 
                old, decayed balconies hung over, and seemed ready to fall into 
                the water. Here grew no elder; here was not even a flower-pot, 
                with its little green plant; but just opposite the workshop stood 
                a great willow-tree, which seemed to hold fast to the house for 
                fear of being carried away by the water. It stretched its branches 
                over the stream just as those of the<br>
                willow-tree in the garden at Kjoge had spread over the river. 
                Yes,<br>
                he had indeed gone from elder-mother to willow-father. There was 
                a<br>
                something about the tree here, especially in the moonlight nights,<br>
                that went direct to his heart; yet it was not in reality the<br>
                moonlight, but the old tree itself. However, he could not endure 
                it:<br>
                and why? Ask the willow, ask the blossoming elder! At all events, 
                he<br>
                bade farewell to Nuremberg and journeyed onwards. He never spoke 
                of Joanna to any one; his sorrow was hidden in his heart. The 
                old<br>
                childish story of the two cakes had a deep meaning for him. He<br>
                understood now why the gingerbread man had a bitter almond in 
                his left side; his was the feeling of bitterness, and Joanna, 
                so mild and<br>
                friendly, was represented by the honeycake maiden. As he thought<br>
                upon all this, the strap of his knapsack pressed across his chest 
                so<br>
                that he could hardly breathe; he loosened it, but gained no relief. 
                He<br>
                saw but half the world around him; the other half he carried with<br>
                him in his inward thoughts; and this is the condition in which 
                he left<br>
                Nuremberg. Not till he caught sight of the lofty mountains did 
                the<br>
                world appear more free to him; his thoughts were attracted to 
                outer<br>
                objects, and tears came into his eyes. The Alps appeared to him 
                like<br>
                the wings of earth folded together; unfolded, they would display 
                the<br>
                variegated pictures of dark woods, foaming waters, spreading clouds,<br>
                and masses of snow. &quot;At the last day,&quot; thought he, &quot;the 
                earth will<br>
                unfold its great wings, and soar upwards to the skies, there to<br>
                burst like a soap-bubble in the radiant glance of the Deity. Oh,&quot;<br>
                sighed he, &quot;that the last day were come!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Silently he wandered on through the country of the Alps, which<br>
                seemed to him like a fruit garden, covered with soft turf. From 
                the<br>
                wooden balconies of the houses the young lacemakers nodded as 
                he<br>
                passed. The summits of the mountains glowed in the red evening 
                sunset, and the green lakes beneath the dark trees reflected the 
                glow. </p>
              <p>Then he thought of the sea coast by the bay Kjoge, with a longing 
                in his heart that was, however, without pain. There, where the 
                Rhine rolls onward like a great billow, and dissolves itself into 
                snowflakes, where glistening clouds are ever changing as if here 
                was the place of<br>
                their creation, while the rainbow flutters about them like a<br>
                many-colored ribbon, there did Knud think of the water-mill at<br>
                Kjoge, with its rushing, foaming waters. Gladly would he have 
                remained in the quiet Rhenish town, but there were too many elders 
                and willow-trees.<br>
              </p>
              <p>So he travelled onwards, over a grand, lofty chain of mountains,<br>
                over rugged,- rocky precipices, and along roads that hung on the<br>
                mountain's side like a swallow's nest. The waters foamed in the 
                depths below him. The clouds lay beneath him. He wandered on, 
                treading upon Alpine roses, thistles, and snow, with the summer 
                sun shining upon him, till at length he bid farewell to the lands 
                of the north. Then he passed on under the shade of blooming chestnut-trees, 
                through vineyards, and fields of Indian corn, till conscious that 
                the mountains were as a wall between him and his early recollections;<br>
                and he wished it to be so.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Before him lay a large and splendid city, called Milan, and here<br>
                he found a German master who engaged him as a workman. The master 
                and his wife, in whose workshop he was employed, were an old, 
                pious couple; and the two old people became quite fond of the 
                quiet journeyman, who spoke but little, but worked more, and led 
                a pious, Christian life; and even to himself it seemed as if God 
                had removed the heavy burden from his heart. His greatest pleasure 
                was to climb, now and then, to the roof of the noble church, which 
                was built of white marble. The pointed towers, the decorated and 
                open cloisters, the stately columns, the white statues which smiled 
                upon him from every corner and porch and arch,- all, even the 
                church itself,<br>
                seemed to him to have been formed from the snow of his native 
                land.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Above him was the blue sky; below him, the city and the wide-spreading 
                plains of Lombardy; and towards the north, the lofty mountains, 
                covered with perpetual snow. And then he thought of the church 
                of Kjoge, with its red, ivy-clad walls, but he had no longing 
                to go there; here, beyond the mountains, he would die and be buried.<br>
                Three years had passed away since he left his home; one year of<br>
                that time he had dwelt at Milan.<br>
              </p>
              <p>One day his master took him into the town; not to the circus 
                in<br>
                which riders performed, but to the opera, a large building, itself 
                a<br>
                sight well worth seeing. The seven tiers of boxes, which reached<br>
                from the ground to a dizzy height, near the ceiling, were hung 
                with<br>
                rich, silken curtains; and in them were seated elegantly-dressed<br>
                ladies, with bouquets of flowers in their hands. The gentlemen 
                were<br>
                also in full dress, and many of them wore decorations of gold 
                and<br>
                silver. The place was so brilliantly lighted that it seemed like<br>
                sunshine, and glorious music rolled through the building. Everything<br>
                looked more beautiful than in the theatre at Copenhagen, but then<br>
                Joanna had been there, and- could it be? Yes- it was like magic,-<br>
                she was here also: for, when the curtain rose, there stood Joanna,<br>
                dressed in silk and gold, and with a golden crown upon her head. 
                She<br>
                sang, he thought, as only an angel could sing; and then she stepped<br>
                forward to the front and smiled, as only Joanna could smile, and<br>
                looked directly at Knud. Poor Knud! he seized his master's hand, 
                and<br>
                cried out loud, &quot;Joanna,&quot; but no one heard him, excepting 
                his<br>
                master, for the music sounded above everything.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, yes, it is Joanna,&quot; said his master; and he drew 
                forth a<br>
                printed bill, and pointed to her name, which was there in full. 
                Then<br>
                it was not a dream. All the audience applauded her, and threw<br>
                wreaths of flowers at her; and every time she went away they called<br>
                for her again, so that she was always coming and going. In the<br>
                street the people crowded round her carriage, and drew it away<br>
                themselves without the horses. Knud was in the foremost row, and<br>
                shouted as joyously as the rest; and when the carriage stopped<br>
                before a brilliantly lighted house, Knud placed himself close 
                to the<br>
                door of her carriage. It flew open, and she stepped out; the light<br>
                fell upon her dear face, and he could see that she smiled as she<br>
                thanked them, and appeared quite overcome. Knud looked straight 
                in her face, and she looked at him, but she did not recognize 
                him. A man, with a glittering star on his breast, gave her his 
                arm, and people<br>
                said the two were engaged to be married. Then Knud went home and<br>
                packed up his knapsack; he felt he must return to the home of 
                his<br>
                childhood, to the elder-tree and the willow. &quot;Ah, under that<br>
                willow-tree!&quot; A man may live a whole life in one single hour.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The old couple begged him to remain, but words were useless. 
                In<br>
                vain they reminded him that winter was coming, and that the snow 
                had already fallen on the mountains. He said he could easily follow 
                the track of the closely-moving carriages, for which a path must 
                be kept clear, and with nothing but his knapsack on his back, 
                and leaning on his stick, he could step along briskly. So he turned 
                his steps to<br>
                the mountains, ascended one side and descended the other, still<br>
                going northward till his strength began to fail, and not a house 
                or<br>
                village could be seen. The stars shone in the sky above him, and<br>
                down in the valley lights glittered like stars, as if another 
                sky were<br>
                beneath him; but his head was dizzy and his feet stumbled, and 
                he felt<br>
                ill. The lights in the valley grew brighter and brighter, and 
                more<br>
                numerous, and he could see them moving to and fro, and then he<br>
                understood that there must be a village in the distance; so he 
                exerted<br>
                his failing strength to reach it, and at length obtained shelter 
                in<br>
                a humble lodging. He remained there that night and the whole of 
                the<br>
                following day, for his body required rest and refreshment, and 
                in<br>
                the valley there was rain and a thaw. But early in the morning 
                of<br>
                the third day, a man came with an organ and played one of the 
                melodies of home; and after that Knud could remain there no longer, 
                so he started again on his journey toward the north. He travelled 
                for many days with hasty steps, as if he were trying to reach 
                home before all whom he remembered should die; but he spoke to 
                no one of this longing.<br>
              </p>
              <p>No one would have believed or understood this sorrow of his heart, 
                the deepest that can be felt by human nature. Such grief is not 
                for the<br>
                world; it is not entertaining even to friends, and poor Knud had 
                no<br>
                friends; he was a stranger, wandering through strange lands to 
                his<br>
                home in the north.<br>
              </p>
              <p>He was walking one evening through the public roads, the country<br>
                around him was flatter, with fields and meadows, the air had a<br>
                frosty feeling. A willow-tree grew by the roadside, everything<br>
                reminded him of home. He felt very tired; so he sat down under 
                the<br>
                tree, and very soon began to nod, then his eyes closed in sleep. 
                Yet<br>
                still he seemed conscious that the willow-tree was stretching 
                its<br>
                branches over him; in his dreaming state the tree appeared like 
                a<br>
                strong, old man- the &quot;willow-father&quot; himself, who had 
                taken his<br>
                tired son up in his arms to carry him back to the land of home, 
                to the<br>
                garden of his childhood, on the bleak open shores of Kjoge. And 
                then he dreamed that it was really the willow-tree itself from 
                Kjoge, which had travelled out in the world to seek him, and now 
                had found him and carried him back into the little garden on the 
                banks of the<br>
                streamlet; and there stood Joanna, in all her splendor, with the<br>
                golden crown on her head, as he had last seen her, to welcome 
                him<br>
                back. And then there appeared before him two remarkable shapes,<br>
                which looked much more like human beings than when he had seen 
                them in his childhood; they were changed, but he remembered that 
                they were the two gingerbread cakes, the man and the woman, who 
                had shown their best sides to the world and looked so good.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We thank you,&quot; they said to Knud, &quot;for you have 
                loosened our<br>
                tongues; we have learnt from you that thoughts should be spoken<br>
                freely, or nothing will come of them; and now something has come 
                of<br>
                our thoughts, for we are engaged to be married.&quot; Then they 
                walked<br>
                away, hand-in-hand, through the streets of Kjoge, looking very<br>
                respectable on the best side, which they were quite right to show.<br>
              </p>
              <p>They turned their steps to the church, and Knud and Joanna followed<br>
                them, also walking hand-in-hand; there stood the church, as of 
                old,<br>
                with its red walls, on which the green ivy grew.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The great church door flew open wide, and as they walked up the<br>
                broad aisle, soft tones of music sounded from the organ. &quot;Our 
                master<br>
                first,&quot; said the gingerbread pair, making room for Knud and 
                Joanna. </p>
              <p>As they knelt at the altar, Joanna bent her head over him, and 
                cold,<br>
                icy tears fell on his face from her eyes. They were indeed tears 
                of<br>
                ice, for her heart was melting towards him through his strong 
                love,<br>
                and as her tears fell on his burning cheeks he awoke. He was still<br>
                sitting under the willow-tree in a strange land, on a cold winter<br>
                evening, with snow and hail falling from the clouds, and beating<br>
                upon his face.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That was the most delightful hour of my life,&quot; said 
                he, &quot;although<br>
                it was only a dream. Oh, let me dream again.&quot; Then he closed 
                his<br>
                eyes once more, and slept and dreamed.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Towards morning there was a great fall of snow; the wind drifted<br>
                it over him, but he still slept on. The villagers came forth to 
                go<br>
                to church; by the roadside they found a workman seated, but he 
                was<br>
                dead! frozen to death under a willow-tree.</p>

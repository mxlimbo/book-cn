              <p class="h" align="center"> THE SNOW MAN</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> &quot;IT is so delightfully cold,&quot; said the Snow Man, &quot;that 
                it makes my<br>
                whole body crackle. This is just the kind of wind to blow life 
                into<br>
                one. How that great red thing up there is staring at me!&quot; 
                He meant the<br>
                sun, who was just setting. &quot;It shall not make me wink. I 
                shall<br>
                manage to keep the pieces.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>He had two triangular pieces of tile in his head, instead of 
                eyes;<br>
                his mouth was made of an old broken rake, and was, of course,<br>
                furnished with teeth. He had been brought into existence amidst 
                the<br>
                joyous shouts of boys, the jingling of sleigh-bells, and the<br>
                slashing of whips. The sun went down, and the full moon rose, 
                large,<br>
                round, and clear, shining in the deep blue.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There it comes again, from the other side,&quot; said the 
                Snow Man,<br>
                who supposed the sun was showing himself once more. &quot;Ah, 
                I have<br>
                cured him of staring, though; now he may hang up there, and shine,<br>
                that I may see myself. If I only knew how to manage to move away<br>
                from this place,- I should so like to move. If I could, I would<br>
                slide along yonder on the ice, as I have seen the boys do; but 
                I don't<br>
                understand how; I don't even know how to run.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Away, away,&quot; barked the old yard-dog. He was quite 
                hoarse, and<br>
                could not pronounce &quot;Bow wow&quot; properly. He had once 
                been an indoor dog, and lay by the fire, and he had been hoarse 
                ever since. &quot;The sun will make you run some day. I saw him, 
                last winter, make your predecessor run, and his predecessor before 
                him. Away, away, they all have to go.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I don't understand you, comrade,&quot; said the Snow Man. 
                &quot;Is that<br>
                thing up yonder to teach me to run? I saw it running itself a 
                little<br>
                while ago, and now it has come creeping up from the other side.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You know nothing at all,&quot; replied the yard-dog; &quot;but 
                then, you've<br>
                only lately been patched up. What you see yonder is the moon, 
                and<br>
                the one before it was the sun. It will come again to-morrow, and<br>
                most likely teach you to run down into the ditch by the well; 
                for I<br>
                think the weather is going to change. I can feel such pricks and 
                stabs<br>
                in my left leg; I am sure there is going to be a change.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I don't understand him,&quot; said the Snow Man to himself; 
                &quot;but I<br>
                have a feeling that he is talking of something very disagreeable.<br>
                The one who stared so just now, and whom he calls the sun, is 
                not my friend; I can feel that too.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Away, away,&quot; barked the yard-dog, and then he turned 
                round<br>
                three times, and crept into his kennel to sleep.<br>
              </p>
              <p>There was really a change in the weather. Towards morning, a 
                thick<br>
                fog covered the whole country round, and a keen wind arose, so 
                that<br>
                the cold seemed to freeze one's bones; but when the sun rose, 
                the<br>
                sight was splendid. Trees and bushes were covered with hoar frost, 
                and looked like a forest of white coral; while on every twig glittered<br>
                frozen dew-drops. The many delicate forms concealed in summer 
                by<br>
                luxuriant foliage, were now clearly defined, and looked like<br>
                glittering lace-work. From every twig glistened a white radiance.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The birch, waving in the wind, looked full of life, like trees 
                in<br>
                summer; and its appearance was wondrously beautiful. And where 
                the sun shone, how everything glittered and sparkled, as if diamond 
                dust had been strewn about; while the snowy carpet of the earth 
                appeared as if covered with diamonds, from which countless lights 
                gleamed,<br>
                whiter than even the snow itself.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;This is really beautiful,&quot; said a young girl, who 
                had come into<br>
                the garden with a young man; and they both stood still near the 
                Snow<br>
                Man, and contemplated the glittering scene. &quot;Summer cannot 
                show a more beautiful sight,&quot; she exclaimed, while her eyes 
                sparkled.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And we can't have such a fellow as this in the summer time,&quot;<br>
                replied the young man, pointing to the Snow Man; &quot;he is capital.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The girl laughed, and nodded at the Snow Man, and then tripped<br>
                away over the snow with her friend. The snow creaked and crackled<br>
                beneath her feet, as if she had been treading on starch.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Who are these two?&quot; asked the Snow Man of the yard-dog. 
                &quot;You have been here longer than I have; do you know them?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Of course I know them,&quot; replied the yard-dog; &quot;she 
                has stroked my<br>
                back many times, and he has given me a bone of meat. I never bite<br>
                those two.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But what are they?&quot; asked the Snow Man.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;They are lovers,&quot; he replied; &quot;they will go and 
                live in the<br>
                same kennel by-and-by, and gnaw at the same bone. Away, away!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Are they the same kind of beings as you and I?&quot; asked 
                the Snow<br>
                Man.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well, they belong to the same master,&quot; retorted the 
                yard-dog.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Certainly people who were only born yesterday know very 
                little. I can see that in you. I have age and experience. I know 
                every one here in the house, and I know there was once a time 
                when I did not lie out<br>
                here in the cold, fastened to a chain. Away, away!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The cold is delightful,&quot; said the Snow Man; &quot;but 
                do tell me<br>
                tell me; only you must not clank your chain so; for it jars all<br>
                through me when you do that.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Away, away!&quot; barked the yard-dog; &quot;I'll tell 
                you; they said I was<br>
                a pretty little fellow once; then I used to lie in a velvet-covered<br>
                chair, up at the master's house, and sit in the mistress's lap. 
                They<br>
                used to kiss my nose, and wipe my paws with an embroidered<br>
                handkerchief, and I was called 'Ami, dear Ami, sweet Ami.' But 
                after a while I grew too big for them, and they sent me away to 
                the<br>
                housekeeper's room; so I came to live on the lower story. You 
                can look into the room from where you stand, and see where I was 
                master once; for I was indeed master to the housekeeper. It was 
                certainly a smaller room than those up stairs; but I was more 
                comfortable; for I was not being continually taken hold of and 
                pulled about by the children as I had been. I received quite as 
                good food, or even better. I had my own cushion, and there was 
                a stove- it is the finest thing in the world at this season of 
                the year. I used to go under the stove, and<br>
                lie down quite beneath it. Ah, I still dream of that stove. Away,<br>
                away!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Does a stove look beautiful?&quot; asked the Snow Man, 
                &quot;is it at all<br>
                like me?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is just the reverse of you,' said the dog; &quot;it's 
                as black as a<br>
                crow, and has a long neck and a brass knob; it eats firewood, 
                so<br>
                that fire spurts out of its mouth. We should keep on one side, 
                or<br>
                under it, to be comfortable. You can see it through the window, 
                from<br>
                where you stand.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the Snow Man looked, and saw a bright polished thing with 
                a<br>
                brazen knob, and fire gleaming from the lower part of it. The 
                Snow Man felt quite a strange sensation come over him; it was 
                very odd, he knew not what it meant, and he could not account 
                for it. But there are<br>
                people who are not men of snow, who understand what it is. &quot;'And 
                why did you leave her?&quot; asked the Snow Man, for it seemed 
                to him that the stove must be of the female sex. &quot;How could 
                you give up such a comfortable place?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I was obliged,&quot; replied the yard-dog. &quot;They turned 
                me out of<br>
                doors, and chained me up here. I had bitten the youngest of my<br>
                master's sons in the leg, because he kicked away the bone I was<br>
                gnawing. 'Bone for bone,' I thought; but they were so angry, and<br>
                from that time I have been fastened with a chain, and lost my 
                bone.<br>
                Don't you hear how hoarse I am. Away, away! I can't talk any more 
                like other dogs. Away, away, that is the end of it all.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the Snow Man was no longer listening. He was looking into<br>
                the housekeeper's room on the lower storey; where the stove stood 
                on its four iron legs, looking about the same size as the Snow 
                Man<br>
                himself. &quot;What a strange crackling I feel within me,&quot; 
                he said.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Shall I ever get in there? It is an innocent wish, and 
                innocent<br>
                wishes are sure to be fulfilled. I must go in there and lean against<br>
                her, even if I have to break the window.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You must never go in there,&quot; said the yard-dog, &quot;for 
                if you<br>
                approach the stove, you'll melt away, away.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I might as well go,&quot; said the Snow Man, &quot;for 
                I think I am<br>
                breaking up as it is.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>During the whole day the Snow Man stood looking in through the<br>
                window, and in the twilight hour the room became still more<br>
                inviting, for from the stove came a gentle glow, not like the 
                sun or<br>
                the moon; no, only the bright light which gleams from a stove 
                when<br>
                it has been well fed. When the door of the stove was opened, the<br>
                flames darted out of its mouth; this is customary with all stoves. 
                The<br>
                light of the flames fell directly on the face and breast of the 
                Snow<br>
                Man with a ruddy gleam. &quot;I can endure it no longer,&quot; 
                said he; &quot;how<br>
                beautiful it looks when it stretches out its tongue?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The night was long, but did not appear so to the Snow Man, who<br>
                stood there enjoying his own reflections, and crackling with the 
                cold.<br>
                In the morning, the window-panes of the housekeeper's room were<br>
                covered with ice. They were the most beautiful ice-flowers any 
                Snow<br>
                Man could desire, but they concealed the stove. These window-panes<br>
                would not thaw, and he could see nothing of the stove, which he<br>
                pictured to himself, as if it had been a lovely human being. The<br>
                snow crackled and the wind whistled around him; it was just the 
                kind<br>
                of frosty weather a Snow Man might thoroughly enjoy. But he did 
                not<br>
                enjoy it; how, indeed, could he enjoy anything when he was &quot;stove<br>
                sick?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That is terrible disease for a Snow Man,&quot; said the 
                yard-dog; &quot;I<br>
                have suffered from it myself, but I got over it. Away, away,&quot; 
                he<br>
                barked and then he added, &quot;the weather is going to change.&quot; 
                And the<br>
                weather did change; it began to thaw. As the warmth increased, 
                the<br>
                Snow Man decreased. He said nothing and made no complaint, which 
                is a sure sign. One morning he broke, and sunk down altogether; 
                and,<br>
                behold, where he had stood, something like a broomstick remained<br>
                sticking up in the ground. It was the pole round which the boys 
                had<br>
                built him up. &quot;Ah, now I understand why he had such a great 
                longing<br>
                for the stove,&quot; said the yard-dog. &quot;Why, there's the 
                shovel that is<br>
                used for cleaning out the stove, fastened to the pole.&quot; The 
                Snow Man<br>
                had a stove scraper in his body; that was what moved him so. &quot;But 
                it's all over now. Away, away.&quot; And soon the winter passed. 
                &quot;Away, away,&quot; barked the hoarse yard-dog. But the girls 
                in the house sang,</p>
              <p> &quot;Come from your fragrant home, green thyme;<br>
                Stretch your soft branches, willow-tree;<br>
                The months are bringing the sweet spring-time,<br>
                When the lark in the sky sings joyfully.<br>
                Come gentle sun, while the cuckoo sings,<br>
                And I'll mock his note in my wanderings.&quot;</p>
              <p> And nobody thought any more of the Snow Man.</p>

              <p class="h" align="center"> THE PEA BLOSSOM</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THERE were once five peas in one shell, they were green, the 
                shell<br>
                was green, and so they believed that the whole world must be green<br>
                also, which was a very natural conclusion. The shell grew, and 
                the<br>
                peas grew, they accommodated themselves to their position, and 
                sat all in a row. The sun shone without and warmed the shell, 
                and the rain<br>
                made it clear and transparent; it was mild and agreeable in broad<br>
                daylight, and dark at night, as it generally is; and the peas 
                as<br>
                they sat there grew bigger and bigger, and more thoughtful as 
                they<br>
                mused, for they felt there must be something else for them to 
                do.<br>
                &quot;Are we to sit here forever?&quot; asked one; &quot;shall 
                we not become hard<br>
                by sitting so long? It seems to me there must be something outside,<br>
                and I feel sure of it.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And as weeks passed by, the peas became yellow, and the shell<br>
                became yellow.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;All the world is turning yellow, I suppose,&quot; said 
                they,- and<br>
                perhaps they were right.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Suddenly they felt a pull at the shell; it was torn off, and<br>
                held in human hands, then slipped into the pocket of a jacket 
                in<br>
                company with other full pods.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now we shall soon be opened,&quot; said one,- just what 
                they all<br>
                wanted.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I should like to know which of us will travel furthest,&quot; 
                said the<br>
                smallest of the five; &quot;we shall soon see now.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What is to happen will happen,&quot; said the largest pea.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Crack&quot; went the shell as it burst, and the five peas 
                rolled out<br>
                into the bright sunshine. There they lay in a child's hand. A 
                little<br>
                boy was holding them tightly, and said they were fine peas for 
                his<br>
                pea-shooter. And immediately he put one in and shot it out.<br>
                &quot;Now I am flying out into the wide world,&quot; said he; 
                &quot;catch me if<br>
                you can;&quot; and he was gone in a moment.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I,&quot; said the second, &quot;intend to fly straight 
                to the sun, that<br>
                is a shell that lets itself be seen, and it will suit me exactly;&quot; 
                and<br>
                away he went.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;We will go to sleep wherever we find ourselves,&quot; said 
                the two<br>
                next, &quot;we shall still be rolling onwards;&quot; and they 
                did certainly fall<br>
                on the floor, and roll about before they got into the pea-shooter; 
                but<br>
                they were put in for all that. &quot;We shall go farther than 
                the<br>
                others,&quot; said they.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What is to happen will happen,&quot; exclaimed the last, 
                as he was<br>
                shot out of the pea-shooter; and as he spoke he flew up against 
                an old board under a garret-window, and fell into a little crevice, 
                which was almost filled up with moss and soft earth. The moss 
                closed itself<br>
                round him, and there he lay, a captive indeed, but not unnoticed 
                by<br>
                God.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What is to happen will happen,&quot; said he to himself.<br>
                Within the little garret lived a poor woman, who went out to clean<br>
                stoves, chop wood into small pieces and perform such-like hard 
                work, for she was strong and industrious. Yet she remained always 
                poor, and at home in the garret lay her only daughter, not quite 
                grown up, and very delicate and weak. For a whole year she had 
                kept her bed, and it seemed as if she could neither live nor die.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;She is going to her little sister,&quot; said the woman; 
                &quot;I had but<br>
                the two children, and it was not an easy thing to support both 
                of<br>
                them; but the good God helped me in my work, and took one of them 
                to Himself and provided for her. Now I would gladly keep the other 
                that was left to me, but I suppose they are not to be separated, 
                and my sick girl will very soon go to her sister above.&quot; 
                But the sick girl<br>
                still remained where she was, quietly and patiently she lay all 
                the<br>
                day long, while her mother was away from home at her work.<br>
                Spring came, and one morning early the sun shone brightly<br>
                through the little window, and threw its rays over the floor of 
                the<br>
                room. just as the mother was going to her work, the sick girl 
                fixed<br>
                her gaze on the lowest pane of the window- &quot;Mother,&quot; 
                she exclaimed,<br>
                &quot;what can that little green thing be that peeps in at the 
                window? It<br>
                is moving in the wind.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The mother stepped to the window and half opened it. &quot;Oh!&quot; 
                she<br>
                said, there is actually a little pea which has taken root and 
                is<br>
                putting out its green leaves. How could it have got into this 
                crack?<br>
              </p>
              <p>Well now, here is a little garden for you to amuse yourself with.&quot;<br>
                So the bed of the sick girl was drawn nearer to the window, that 
                she<br>
                might see the budding plant; and the mother went out to her work.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Mother, I believe I shall get well,&quot; said the sick 
                child in the<br>
                evening, &quot;the sun has shone in here so brightly and warmly 
                to-day, and the little pea is thriving so well: I shall get on 
                better, too, and go<br>
                out into the warm sunshine again.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;God grant it!&quot; said the mother, but she did not believe 
                it<br>
                would be so. But she propped up with the little stick the green<br>
                plant which had given her child such pleasant hopes of life, so 
                that<br>
                it might not be broken by the winds; she tied the piece of string 
                to<br>
                the window-sill and to the upper part of the frame, so that the<br>
                pea-tendrils might twine round it when it shot up. And it did 
                shoot<br>
                up, indeed it might almost be seen to grow from day to day.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now really here is a flower coming,&quot; said the old 
                woman one<br>
                morning, and now at last she began to encourage the hope that 
                her sick daughter might really recover. She remembered that for 
                some time the child had spoken more cheerfully, and during the 
                last few days had raised herself in bed in the morning to look 
                with sparkling eyes at her little garden which contained only 
                a single pea-plant. A week after, the invalid sat up for the first 
                time a whole hour, feeling<br>
                quite happy by the open window in the warm sunshine, while outside<br>
                grew the little plant, and on it a pink pea-blossom in full bloom. 
                The<br>
                little maiden bent down and gently kissed the delicate leaves. 
                This<br>
                day was to her like a festival.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Our heavenly Father Himself has planted that pea, and made 
                it<br>
                grow and flourish, to bring joy to you and hope to me, my blessed<br>
                child,&quot; said the happy mother, and she smiled at the flower, 
                as if<br>
                it had been an angel from God.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But what became of the other peas? Why the one who flew out into<br>
                the wide world, and said, &quot;Catch me if you can,&quot; fell 
                into a gutter<br>
                on the roof of a house, and ended his travels in the crop of a<br>
                pigeon. The two lazy ones were carried quite as far, for they 
                also<br>
                were eaten by pigeons, so they were at least of some use; but 
                the<br>
                fourth, who wanted to reach the sun, fell into a sink and lay 
                there<br>
                in the dirty water for days and weeks, till he had swelled to 
                a great<br>
                size.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I am getting beautifully fat,&quot; said the pea, &quot;I 
                expect I shall<br>
                burst at last; no pea could do more that that, I think; I am the<br>
                most remarkable of all the five which were in the shell.&quot; 
                And the sink<br>
                confirmed the opinion.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the young maiden stood at the open garret window, with<br>
                sparkling eyes and the rosy hue of health on her cheeks, she folded<br>
                her thin hands over the pea-blossom, and thanked God for what 
                He had done.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I,&quot; said the sink, &quot;shall stand up for my pea.&quot;</p>

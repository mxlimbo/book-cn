              <p class="h" align="center"> OLE THE TOWER-KEEPER</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> &quot;IN the world it's always going up and down; and now I 
                can't go up<br>
                any higher!&quot; So said Ole the tower-keeper. &quot;Most people 
                have to try<br>
                both the ups and the downs; and, rightly considered, we all get 
                to<br>
                be watchmen at last, and look down upon life from a height.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Such was the speech of Ole, my friend, the old tower-keeper, 
                a<br>
                strange, talkative old fellow, who seemed to speak out everything 
                that<br>
                came into his head, and who for all that had many a serious thought<br>
                deep in his heart. Yes, he was the child of respectable people, 
                and<br>
                there were even some who said that he was the son of a privy<br>
                councillor, or that he might have been. He had studied, too, and 
                had<br>
                been assistant teacher and deputy clerk; but of what service was 
                all<br>
                that to him? In those days he lived in the clerk's house, and 
                was to<br>
                have everything in the house- to be at free quarters, as the saying<br>
                is; but he was still, so to speak, a fine young gentleman. He 
                wanted<br>
                to have his boots cleaned with patent blacking, and the clerk 
                could<br>
                only afford ordinary grease; and upon that point they split. One 
                spoke<br>
                of stinginess, the other of vanity, and the blacking became the<br>
                black cause of enmity between them, and at last they parted.<br>
              </p>
              <p>This is what he demanded of the world in general, namely, patent<br>
                blacking, and he got nothing but grease. Accordingly, he at last<br>
                drew back from all men, and became a hermit; but the church tower 
                is<br>
                the only place in a great city where hermitage, office and bread 
                can<br>
                be found together. So he betook himself up thither, and smoked 
                his<br>
                pipe as he made his solitary rounds. He looked upward and downward, 
                and had his own thoughts, and told in his own way of what he read 
                in books and in himself. I often lent him books- good books; and 
                you may know by the company he keeps. He loved neither the English 
                governess novels nor the French ones, which he called a mixture 
                of empty wind and raisin-stalks: he wanted biographies, and descriptions 
                of the wonders of, the world. I visited him at least once a year, 
                generally directly after New Year's day, and then he always spoke 
                of this and that which the change of the year had put into his 
                head.<br>
              </p>
              <p>I will tell the story of three of these visits, and will reproduce<br>
                his own words whenever I can remember them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>FIRST VISIT</p>
              <p> Among the books which I had lately lent Ole, was one which had<br>
                greatly rejoiced and occupied him. It was a geological book,<br>
                containing an account of the boulders.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, they're rare old fellows, those boulders!&quot; he 
                said; &quot;and<br>
                to think that we should pass them without noticing them! And over<br>
                the street pavement, the paving stones, those fragments of the<br>
                oldest remains of antiquity, one walks without ever thinking about<br>
                them. I have done the very thing myself. But now I look respectfully<br>
                at every paving-stone. Many thanks for the book! It has filled 
                me with<br>
                thought, and has made me long to read more on the subject. The 
                romance of the earth is, after all, the most wonderful of all 
                romances. It's a pity one can't read the first volume of it, because 
                it is written in a<br>
                language that we don't understand. One must read in the different<br>
                strata, in the pebble-stones, for each separate period. Yes, it 
                is a<br>
                romance, a very wonderful romance, and we all have our place in 
                it. </p>
              <p>We grope and ferret about, and yet remain where we are; but the 
                ball<br>
                keeps turning, without emptying the ocean over us; the clod on 
                which<br>
                we move about, holds, and does not let us through. And then it's 
                a<br>
                story that has been acting for thousands upon thousands of years 
                and<br>
                is still going on. My best thanks for the book about the boulders.<br>
                Those are fellows indeed! They could tell us something worth<br>
                hearing, if they only knew how to talk. It's really a pleasure 
                now and<br>
                then to become a mere nothing, especially when a man is as highly<br>
                placed as I am. And then to think that we all, even with patent<br>
                lacquer, are nothing more than insects of a moment on that ant-hill<br>
                the earth, though we may be insects with stars and garters, places 
                and<br>
                offices! One feels quite a novice beside these venerable<br>
                million-year-old boulders. On last New Year's eve I was reading 
                the<br>
                book, and had lost myself in it so completely, that I forgot my<br>
                usual New Year's diversion, namely, the wild hunt to Amack. Ah, 
                you<br>
                don't know what that is!<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The journey of the witches on broomsticks is well enough 
                known-<br>
                that journey is taken on St. John's eve, to the Brocken; but we 
                have a<br>
                wild journey, also which is national and modern, and that is the<br>
                journey to Amack on the night of the New Year. All indifferent 
                poets<br>
                and poetesses, musicians, newspaper writers, and artistic<br>
                notabilities,- I mean those who are no good,- ride in the New 
                Year's<br>
                night through the air to Amack. They sit backwards on their painting<br>
                brushes or quill pens, for steel pens won't bear them- they're 
                too<br>
                stiff. As I told you, I see that every New Year's night, and could<br>
                mention the majority of the riders by name, but I should not like 
                to<br>
                draw their enmity upon myself, for they don't like people to talk<br>
                about their ride to Amack on quill pens. I've a kind of niece, 
                who<br>
                is a fishwife, and who, as she tells me, supplies three respectable<br>
                newspapers with the terms of abuse and vituperation they use, 
                and<br>
                she has herself been at Amack as an invited guest; but she was 
                carried<br>
                out thither, for she does not own a quill pen, nor can she ride. 
                She<br>
                has told me all about it. Half of what she said is not true, but 
                the<br>
                other half gives us information enough. When she was out there, 
                the<br>
                festivities began with a song; each of the guests had written 
                his<br>
                own song, and each one sang his own song, for he thought that 
                the<br>
                best, and it was all one, all the same melody. Then those came<br>
                marching up, in little bands, who are only busy with their mouths.<br>
              </p>
              <p>There were ringing bells that rang alternately; and then came 
                the<br>
                little drummers that beat their tattoo in the family circle; and<br>
                acquaintance was made with those who write without putting their<br>
                names, which here means as much as using grease instead of patent<br>
                blacking; and then there was the beadle with his boy, and the 
                boy<br>
                was worst off, for in general he gets no notice taken of him; 
                then,<br>
                too, there was the good street sweeper with his cart, who turns 
                over<br>
                the dust-bin, and calls it 'good, very good, remarkably good.' 
                And<br>
                in the midst of the pleasure that was afforded by the mere meeting<br>
                of these folks, there shot up out of the great dirt-heap at Amack 
                a<br>
                stem, a tree, an immense flower, a great mushroom, a perfect roof,<br>
                which formed a sort of warehouse for the worthy company, for in 
                it<br>
                hung everything they had given to the world during the Old Year. 
                Out<br>
                of the tree poured sparks like flames of fire; these were the 
                ideas<br>
                and thoughts, borrowed from others, which they had used, and which 
                now got free and rushed away like so many fireworks. They played 
                at 'the stick burns,' and the young poets played at 'heart-burns,' 
                and the<br>
                witlings played off their jests, and the jests rolled away with 
                a<br>
                thundering sound, as if empty pots were being shattered against 
                doors.<br>
              </p>
              <p>'It was very amusing!' my niece said; in fact, she said many 
                things<br>
                that were very malicious but very amusing, but I won't mention 
                them,<br>
                for a man must be good-natured, and not a carping critic. But 
                you will<br>
                easily perceive that when a man once knows the rights of the journey<br>
                to Amack, as I know them, it's quite natural that on the New Year's<br>
                night one should look out to see the wild chase go by. If in the 
                New<br>
                Year I miss certain persons who used to be there, I am sure to<br>
                notice others who are new arrivals; but this year I omitted taking<br>
                my look at the guests, I bowled away on the boulders, rolled back<br>
                through millions of years, and saw the stones break loose high 
                up in<br>
                the north, saw them drifting about on icebergs, long before Noah's 
                ark was constructed, saw them sink down to the bottom of the sea, 
                and re-appear with a sand-bank, with that one that peered forth 
                from the flood and said, 'This shall be Zealand!' I saw them become 
                the<br>
                dwelling-place of birds that are unknown to us, and then become 
                the<br>
                seat of wild chiefs of whom we know nothing, until with their 
                axes<br>
                they cut their Runic signs into a few of these stones, which then 
                came<br>
                into the calendar of time. But as for me, I had gone quite beyond<br>
                all lapse of time, and had become a cipher and a nothing. Then 
                three<br>
                or four beautiful falling stars came down, which cleared the air,<br>
                and gave my thoughts another direction. You know what a falling 
                star<br>
                is, do you not? The learned men are not at all clear about it. 
                I<br>
                have my own ideas about shooting stars, as the common people in 
                many parts call them, and my idea is this: How often are silent<br>
                thanksgivings offered up for one who has done a good and noble 
                action!<br>
              </p>
              <p>The thanks are often speechless, but they are not lost for all 
                that. I<br>
                think these thanks are caught up, and the sunbeams bring the silent,<br>
                hidden thankfulness over the head of the benefactor; and if it 
                be a<br>
                whole people that has been expressing its gratitude through a 
                long<br>
                lapse of time, the thankfulness appears as a nosegay of flowers, 
                and<br>
                at length falls in the form of a shooting star over the good man's<br>
                grave. I am always very much pleased when I see a shooting star,<br>
                especially in the New Year's night, and then find out for whom 
                the<br>
                gift of gratitude was intended. Lately a gleaming star fell in 
                the<br>
                southwest, as a tribute of thanksgiving to many- many! 'For whom 
                was that star intended?' thought I. It fell, no doubt, on the 
                hill by<br>
                the Bay of Plensberg, where the Danebrog waves over the graves 
                of<br>
                Schleppegrell, Lasloes, and their comrades. One star also fell 
                in<br>
                the midst of the land, fell upon Soro, a flower on the grave of<br>
                Holberg, the thanks of the year from a great many - thanks for 
                his<br>
                charming plays!<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is a great and pleasant thought to know that a shooting 
                star<br>
                falls upon our graves. On mine certainly none will fall- no sunbeam<br>
                brings thanks to me, for here there is nothing worthy of thanks. 
                I<br>
                shall not get the patent lacquer,&quot; said Ole, &quot;for my 
                fate on earth<br>
                is only grease, after all.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>SECOND VISIT</p>
              <p> It was New Year's day, and I went up on the tower. Ole spoke 
                of<br>
                the toasts that were drunk on the transition from the Old Year 
                into<br>
                the New- from one grave into the other, as he said. And he told 
                me a<br>
                story about the glasses, and this story had a very deep meaning. 
                It<br>
                was this:<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;When on the New Year's night the clock strikes twelve, 
                the people<br>
                at the table rise up with full glasses in their hands, and drain 
                these<br>
                glasses, and drink success to the New Year. They begin the year 
                with<br>
                the glass in their hands; that is a good beginning for drunkards. 
                They<br>
                begin the New Year by going to bed, and that's a good beginning 
                for<br>
                drones. Sleep is sure to play a great part in the New Year, and 
                the<br>
                glass likewise. Do you know what dwells in the glass?&quot; asked 
                Ole. &quot;I<br>
                will tell you. There dwell in the glass, first, health, and then<br>
                pleasure, then the most complete sensual delight; and misfortune 
                and<br>
                the bitterest woe dwell in the glass also. Now, suppose we count 
                the<br>
                glasses- of course I count the different degrees in the glasses 
                for<br>
                different people.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You see, the first glass, that's the glass of health, and 
                in that<br>
                the herb of health is found growing. Put it up on the beam in 
                the<br>
                ceiling, and at the end of the year you may be sitting in the 
                arbor of<br>
                health.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;If you take the second glass- from this a little bird soars<br>
                upward, twittering in guileless cheerfulness, so that a man may 
                listen<br>
                to his song, and perhaps join in 'Fair is life! no downcast looks!<br>
                Take courage, and march onward!'<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Out of the third glass rises a little winged urchin, who 
                cannot<br>
                certainly be called an angel child, for there is goblin blood 
                in his<br>
                veins, and he has the spirit of a goblin- not wishing to hurt 
                or<br>
                harm you, indeed, but very ready to play off tricks upon you. 
                He'll<br>
                sit at your ear and whisper merry thoughts to you; he'll creep 
                into<br>
                your heart and warm you, so that you grow very merry, and become 
                a wit, so far as the wits of the others can judge.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;In the fourth glass is neither herb, bird, nor urchin. 
                In that<br>
                glass is the pause drawn by reason, and one may never go beyond 
                that sign.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Take the fifth glass, and you will weep at yourself, you 
                will<br>
                feel such a deep emotion; or it will affect you in a different 
                way.<br>
                Out of the glass there will spring with a bang Prince Carnival, 
                nine<br>
                times and extravagantly merry. He'll draw you away with him; you'll<br>
                forget your dignity, if you have any, and you'll forget more than<br>
                you should or ought to forget. All is dance, song and sound: the 
                masks will carry you away with them, and the daughters of vanity, 
                clad in silk and satin, will come with loose hair and alluring 
                charms; but tear yourself away if you can!<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The sixth glass! Yes, in that glass sits a demon, in the 
                form<br>
                of a little, well dressed, attractive and very fascinating man, 
                who<br>
                thoroughly understands you, agrees with you in everything, and 
                becomes quite a second self to you. He has a lantern with him, 
                to give you light as he accompanies you home. There is an old 
                legend about a saint who was allowed to choose one of the seven 
                deadly sins, and who accordingly chose drunkenness, which appeared 
                to him the least, but which led him to commit all the other six. 
                The man's blood is<br>
                mingled with that of the demon. It is the sixth glass, and with 
                that<br>
                the germ of all evil shoots up within us; and each one grows up 
                with a<br>
                strength like that of the grains of mustard-seed, and shoots up 
                into a<br>
                tree, and spreads over the whole world: and most people have no 
                choice but to go into the oven, to be re-cast in a new form.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That's the history of the glasses,&quot; said the tower-keeper 
                Ole,<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;and it can be told with lacquer or only with grease; but 
                I give it<br>
                you with both!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>THIRD VISIT</p>
              <p> On this occasion I chose the general &quot;moving-day&quot; 
                for my visit<br>
                to Ole, for on that day it is anything but agreeable down in the<br>
                streets in the town; for they are full of sweepings, shreds, and<br>
                remnants of all sorts, to say nothing of the cast-off rubbish 
                in which<br>
                one has to wade about. But this time I happened to see two children<br>
                playing in this wilderness of sweepings. They were playing at 
                &quot;going<br>
                to bed,&quot; for the occasion seemed especially favorable for 
                this<br>
                sport. They crept under the straw, and drew an old bit of ragged<br>
                curtain over themselves by way of coverlet. &quot;It was splendid!&quot; 
                they<br>
                said; but it was a little too strong for me, and besides, I was<br>
                obliged to mount up on my visit to Ole.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It's moving-day to day,&quot; he said; &quot;streets and 
                houses are like<br>
                a dust-bin- a large dust-bin; but I'm content with a cartload. 
                I may<br>
                get something good out of that, and I really did get something 
                good<br>
                out of it once. Shortly after Christmas I was going up the street;<br>
                it was rough weather, wet and dirty- the right kind of weather 
                to<br>
                catch cold in. The dustman was there with his cart, which was 
                full,<br>
                and looked like a sample of streets on moving-day. At the back 
                of<br>
                the cart stood a fir tree, quite green still, and with tinsel 
                on its<br>
                twigs; it had been used on Christmas eve, and now it was thrown 
                out<br>
                into the street, and the dustman had stood it up at the back of 
                his<br>
                cart. It was droll to look at, or you may say it was mournful- 
                all<br>
                depends on what you think of when you see it; and I thought about<br>
                it, and thought this and that of many things that were in the 
                cart: or<br>
                I might have done so, and that comes to the same thing. There 
                was an<br>
                old lady's glove, too: I wonder what that was thinking of? Shall 
                I<br>
                tell you? The glove was lying there, pointing with its little 
                finger<br>
                at the tree. 'I'm sorry for the tree,' it thought; 'and I was 
                also<br>
                at the feast, where the chandeliers glittered. My life was, so 
                to<br>
                speak, a ball night- a pressure of the hand, and I burst! My memory<br>
                keeps dwelling upon that, and I have really nothing else to live 
                for!'<br>
              </p>
              <p>This is what the glove thought, or what it might have thought. 
                'That's<br>
                a stupid affair with yonder fir tree,' said the potsherds. You 
                see,<br>
                potsherds think everything is stupid. 'When one is in the<br>
                dust-cart,' they said, 'one ought not to give one's self airs 
                and wear<br>
                tinsel. I know that I have been useful in the world- far more 
                useful<br>
                than such a green stick.' This was a view that might be taken, 
                and I<br>
                don't think it quite a peculiar one; but for all that, the fir 
                tree<br>
                looked very well: it was like a little poetry in the dust-heap; 
                and<br>
                truly there is dust enough in the streets on moving-day. The way 
                is<br>
                difficult and troublesome then, and I feel obliged to run away 
                out<br>
                of the confusion; or, if I am on the tower, I stay there and look<br>
                down, and it is amusing enough.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There are the good people below, playing at 'changing houses.'<br>
                They toil and tug away with their goods and chattels, and the<br>
                household goblin sits in an old tub and moves with them. All the<br>
                little griefs of the lodging and the family, and the real cares 
                and<br>
                sorrows, move with them out of the old dwelling into the new; 
                and what gain is there for them or for us in the whole affair? 
                Yes, there was written long ago the good old maxim: 'Think on 
                the great moving-day of death!' That is a serious thought. I hope 
                it is not disagreeable to you that I should have touched upon 
                it? Death is the most certain messenger, after all, in spite of 
                his various occupations. Yes, Death is the omnibus conductor, 
                and he is the passport writer, and he countersigns our service-book, 
                and he is director of the savings bank of life. Do you understand 
                me? All the deeds of our life, the great and the little alike, 
                we put into this savings bank; and when<br>
                Death calls with his omnibus, and we have to step in, and drive 
                with<br>
                him into the land of eternity, then on the frontier he gives us 
                our<br>
                service-book as a pass. As a provision for the journey, he takes<br>
                this or that good deed we have done, and lets it accompany us; 
                and<br>
                this may be very pleasant or very terrific. Nobody has ever escaped<br>
                the omnibus journey. There is certainly a talk about one who was 
                not<br>
                allowed to go- they call him the Wandering Jew: he has to ride<br>
                behind the omnibus. If he had been allowed to get in, he would 
                have<br>
                escaped the clutches of the poets.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Just cast your mind's eye into that great omnibus. The 
                society is<br>
                mixed, for king and beggar, genius and idiot, sit side by side. 
                They<br>
                must go without their property and money; they have only the<br>
                service-book and the gift out of the savings bank with them. But 
                which of our deeds is selected and given to us? Perhaps quite 
                a little<br>
                one, one that we have forgotten, but which has been recorded- 
                small as a pea, but the pea can send out a blooming shoot. The 
                poor bumpkin who sat on a low stool in the corner, and was jeered 
                at and flouted, will perhaps have his worn-out stool given him 
                as a provision; and the stool may become a litter in the land 
                of eternity, and rise up then as a throne, gleaming like gold 
                and blooming as an arbor. He who always lounged about, and drank 
                the spiced draught of pleasure, that he might forget the wild 
                things he had done here, will have his barrel given to him on 
                the journey, and will have to drink from it as they go on; and 
                the drink is bright and clear, so that the thoughts remain pure, 
                and all good and noble feelings are awakened, and he sees and 
                feels what in life he could not or would not see; and then he 
                has within him the punishment, the gnawing worm, which will not 
                die through time incalculable. If on the glasses there stood written 
                'oblivion,' on the barrel 'remembrance' is inscribed.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;When I read a good book, an historical work, I always think 
                at<br>
                last of the poetry of what I am reading, and of the omnibus of<br>
                death, and wonder, which of the hero's deeds Death took out of 
                the<br>
                savings bank for him, and what provisions he got on the journey 
                into<br>
                eternity. There was once a French king- I have forgotten his name, 
                for<br>
                the names of good people are sometimes forgotten, even by me, 
                but it will come back some day;- there was a king who, during 
                a famine,<br>
                became the benefactor of his people; and the people raised up 
                to his<br>
                memory a monument of snow, with the inscription, 'Quicker than 
                this<br>
                melts didst thou bring help!' I fancy that Death, looking back 
                upon<br>
                the monument, gave him a single snow-flake as provision, a<br>
                snow-flake that never melts, and this flake floated over his royal<br>
                head, like a white butterfly, into the land of eternity. Thus, 
                too,<br>
                there was Louis XI. I have remembered his name, for one remembers 
                what is bad- a trait of him often comes into my thoughts, and 
                I wish one could say the story is not true. He had his lord high 
                constable<br>
                executed, and he could execute him, right or wrong; but he had 
                the<br>
                innocent children of the constable, one seven and the other eight<br>
                years old, placed under the scaffold so that the warm blood of 
                their<br>
                father spurted over them, and then he had them sent to the Bastille,<br>
                and shut up in iron cages, where not even a coverlet was given 
                them to protect them from the cold. And King Louis sent the executioner 
                to them every week, and had a tooth pulled out of the head of 
                each,<br>
                that they might not be too comfortable; and the elder of the boys<br>
                said, 'My mother would die of grief if she knew that my younger<br>
                brother had to suffer so cruelly; therefore pull out two of my<br>
                teeth, and spare him.' The tears came into the hangman's eyes, 
                but the<br>
                king's will was stronger than the tears; and every week two little<br>
                teeth were brought to him on a silver plate; he had demanded them, 
                and he had them. I fancy that Death took these two teeth out of 
                the<br>
                savings bank of life, and gave them to Louis XI, to carry with 
                him<br>
                on the great journey into the land of immortality; they fly before 
                him<br>
                like two flames of fire; they shine and burn, and they bite him, 
                the<br>
                innocent children's teeth.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, that's a serious journey, the omnibus ride on the 
                great<br>
                moving-day! And when is it to be undertaken? That's just the serious<br>
                part of it. Any day, any hour, any minute, the omnibus may draw 
                up.<br>
                Which of our deeds will Death take out of the savings bank, and 
                give<br>
                to us as provision? Let us think of the moving-day that is not<br>
                marked in the calendar.&quot;</p>

              <p class="h" align="center"> THE THISTLE'S EXPERIENCES</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> BELONGING to the lordly manor-house was beautiful, well-kept<br>
                garden, with rare trees and flowers; the guests of the proprietor<br>
                declared their admiration of it; the people of the neighborhood,<br>
                from town and country, came on Sundays and holidays, and asked<br>
                permission to see the garden; indeed, whole schools used to pay 
                visits to it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Outside the garden, by the palings at the road-side, stood a 
                great<br>
                mighty Thistle, which spread out in many directions from the root,<br>
                so that it might have been called a thistle bush. Nobody looked 
                at it,<br>
                except the old Ass which drew the milk-maid's cart. This Ass used 
                to<br>
                stretch out his neck towards the Thistle, and say, &quot;You are 
                beautiful;<br>
                I should like to eat you!&quot; But his halter was not long enough 
                to let<br>
                him reach it and eat it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>There was great company at the manor-house- some very noble people 
                from the capital; young pretty girls, and among them a young lady 
                who came from a long distance. She had come from Scotland, and 
                was of high birth, and was rich in land and in gold- a bride worth<br>
                winning, said more than one of the young gentlemen; and their 
                lady<br>
                mothers said the same thing.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The young people amused themselves on the lawn, and played at<br>
                ball; they wandered among the flowers, and each of the young girls<br>
                broke off a flower, and fastened it in a young gentleman's buttonhole.<br>
                But the young Scotch lady looked round, for a long time, in an<br>
                undecided way. None of the flowers seemed to suit her taste. Then<br>
                her eye glanced across the paling- outside stood the great thistle<br>
                bush, with the reddish-blue, sturdy flowers; she saw them, she 
                smiled, and asked the son of the house to pluck one for her.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is the flower of Scotland,&quot; she said. &quot;It 
                blooms in the<br>
                scutcheon of my country. Give me yonder flower.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And he brought the fairest blossom, and pricked his fingers as<br>
                completely as if it had grown on the sharpest rose bush.<br>
              </p>
              <p>She placed the thistle-flower in the buttonhole of the young<br>
                man, and he felt himself highly honored. Each of the other young<br>
                gentlemen would willingly have given his own beautiful flower 
                to<br>
                have worn this one, presented by the fair hand of the Scottish 
                maiden.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And if the son of the house felt himself honored, what were the<br>
                feelings of the Thistle bush? It seemed to him as if dew and<br>
                sunshine were streaming through him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I am something more than I knew of,&quot; said the Thistle 
                to<br>
                itself. &quot;I suppose my right place is really inside the palings, 
                and<br>
                not outside. One is often strangely placed in this world; but 
                now I<br>
                have at least managed to get one of my people within the pale, 
                and<br>
                indeed into a buttonhole!&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The Thistle told this event to every blossom that unfolded itself,<br>
                and not many days had gone by before the Thistle heard, not from<br>
                men, not from the twittering of the birds, but from the air itself,<br>
                which stores up the sounds, and carries them far around- out of 
                the<br>
                most retired walks of the garden, and out of the rooms of the 
                house,<br>
                in which doors and windows stood open, that the young gentleman 
                who had received the thistle-flower from the hand of the fair 
                Scottish<br>
                maiden had also now received the heart and hand of the lady in<br>
                question. They were a handsome pair- it was a good match.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That match I made up!&quot; said the Thistle; and he thought 
                of the<br>
                flower he had given for the buttonhole. Every flower that opened 
                heard of this occurrence.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I shall certainly be transplanted into the garden,&quot; 
                thought the<br>
                Thistle, and perhaps put into a pot, which crowds one in. That 
                is said<br>
                to be the greatest of all honors.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the Thistle pictured this to himself in such a lively<br>
                manner, that at last he said, with full conviction, &quot;I am 
                to be<br>
                transplanted into a pot.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then he promised every little thistle flower which unfolded itself<br>
                that it also should be put into a pot, and perhaps into a<br>
                buttonhole, the highest honor that could be attained. But not 
                one of<br>
                them was put into a pot, much less into a buttonhole. They drank 
                in<br>
                the sunlight and the air; lived on the sunlight by day, and on 
                the dew<br>
                by night; bloomed- were visited by bees and hornets, who looked<br>
                after the honey, the dowry of the flower, and they took the honey, 
                and left the flower where it was.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The thievish rabble!&quot; said the Thistle. &quot;If I 
                could only stab<br>
                every one of them! But I cannot.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>The flowers hung their heads and faded; but after a time new<br>
                ones came.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You come in good time,&quot; said the Thistle. &quot;I 
                am expecting every<br>
                moment to get across the fence.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>A few innocent daisies, and a long thin dandelion, stood and<br>
                listened in deep admiration, and believed everything they heard.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The old Ass of the milk-cart stood at the edge of the<br>
                field-road, and glanced across at the blooming thistle bush; but 
                his<br>
                halter was too short, and he could not reach it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the Thistle thought so long of the thistle of Scotland, to<br>
                whose family he said he belonged, that he fancied at last that 
                he<br>
                had come from Scotland, and that his parents had been put into 
                the<br>
                national escutcheon. That was a great thought; but, you see, a 
                great<br>
                thistle has a right to a great thought.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;One is often of so grand a family, that one may not know 
                it,&quot;<br>
                said the Nettle, who grew close by. He had a kind of idea that 
                he<br>
                might be made into cambric if he were rightly treated.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the summer went by, and the autumn went by. The leaves fell<br>
                from the trees, and the few flowers left had deeper colors and 
                less<br>
                scent. The gardener's boy sang in the garden, across the palings:</p>
              <p> &quot;Up the hill, down the dale we wend,<br>
                That is life, from beginning to end.&quot;</p>
              <p> The young fir trees in the forest began to long for Christmas, 
                but<br>
                it was a long time to Christmas yet.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Here I am standing yet!&quot; said the Thistle. &quot;It 
                is as if nobody<br>
                thought of me, and yet I managed the match. They were betrothed, 
                and they have had their wedding; it is now a week ago. I won't 
                take a<br>
                single step-because I can't.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>A few more weeks went by. The Thistle stood there with his last<br>
                single flower large and full. This flower had shot up from near 
                the<br>
                roots; the wind blew cold over it, and the colors vanished, and 
                the<br>
                flower grew in size, and looked like a silvered sunflower.<br>
              </p>
              <p>One day the young pair, now man and wife, came into the garden.<br>
                They went along by the paling, and the young wife looked across 
                it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There's the great thistle still growing,&quot; she said. 
                &quot;It has no<br>
                flowers now.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, yes, the ghost of the last one is there still,&quot; 
                said he.<br>
                And he pointed to the silvery remains of the flower, which looked 
                like<br>
                a flower themselves.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is pretty, certainly,&quot; she said. &quot;Such an 
                one must be carved<br>
                on the frame of our picture.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the young man had to climb across the palings again, and 
                to<br>
                break off the calyx of the thistle. It pricked his fingers, but 
                then<br>
                he had called it a ghost. And this thistle-calyx came into the 
                garden,<br>
                and into the house, and into the drawing-room. There stood a<br>
                picture- &quot;Young Couple.&quot; A thistle-flower was painted 
                in the<br>
                buttonhole of the bridegroom. They spoke about this, and also 
                about<br>
                the thistle-flower they brought, the last thistle-flower, now 
                gleaming<br>
                like silver, whose picture was carved on the frame.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the breeze carried what was spoken away, far away.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What one can experience!&quot; said the Thistle Bush. &quot;My 
                first born<br>
                was put into a buttonhole, and my youngest has been put in a frame.<br>
                Where shall I go?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the Ass stood by the road-side, and looked across at the<br>
                Thistle.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Come to me, my nibble darling!&quot; said he. &quot;I can't 
                get across to<br>
                you.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the Thistle did not answer. He became more and more<br>
                thoughtful- kept on thinking and thinking till near Christmas, 
                and<br>
                then a flower of thought came forth.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;If the children are only good, the parents do not mind 
                standing<br>
                outside the garden pale.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That's an honorable thought,&quot; said the Sunbeam. &quot;You 
                shall also<br>
                have a good place.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;In a pot or in a frame?&quot; asked the Thistle.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;In a story,&quot; replied the Sunbeam.</p>

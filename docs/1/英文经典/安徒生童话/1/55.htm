              <p class="h" align="center"> THE GARDEN OF PARADISE</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> THERE was once a king's son who had a larger and more beautiful<br>
                collection of books than any one else in the world, and full of<br>
                splendid copper-plate engravings. He could read and obtain information 
                respecting every people of every land; but not a word could he 
                find to explain the situation of the garden of paradise, and this 
                was just what he most wished to know. His grandmother had told 
                him when he was quite a little boy, just old enough to go to school, 
                that each flower in the garden of paradise was a sweet cake, that 
                the pistils were full of rich wine, that on one flower history 
                was written, on another geography or tables; so those who wished 
                to learn their<br>
                lessons had only to eat some of the cakes, and the more they ate,<br>
                the more history, geography, or tables they knew. He believed 
                it all<br>
                then; but as he grew older, and learnt more and more, he became 
                wise<br>
                enough to understand that the splendor of the garden of paradise<br>
                must be very different to all this. &quot;Oh, why did Eve pluck 
                the fruit<br>
                from the tree of knowledge? why did Adam eat the forbidden fruit?&quot;<br>
                thought the king's son: &quot;if I had been there it would never 
                have<br>
                happened, and there would have been no sin in the world.&quot; 
                The garden of paradise occupied all his thoughts till he reached 
                his<br>
                seventeenth year. One day he was walking alone in the wood, which 
                was his greatest pleasure, when evening came on. The clouds gathered, 
                and the rain poured down as if the sky had been a waterspout; 
                and it was as dark as the bottom of a well at midnight; sometimes 
                he slipped over the smooth grass, or fell over stones that projected 
                out of the rocky ground.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Every thing was dripping with moisture, and the poor prince had 
                not<br>
                a dry thread about him. He was obliged at last to climb over great<br>
                blocks of stone, with water spurting from the thick moss. He began<br>
                to feel quite faint, when he heard a most singular rushing noise,<br>
                and saw before him a large cave, from which came a blaze of light.<br>
                In the middle of the cave an immense fire was burning, and a noble<br>
                stag, with its branching horns, was placed on a spit between the<br>
                trunks of two pine-trees. It was turning slowly before the fire, 
                and<br>
                an elderly woman, as large and strong as if she had been a man 
                in<br>
                disguise, sat by, throwing one piece of wood after another into 
                the<br>
                flames.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Come in,&quot; she said to the prince; &quot;sit down by 
                the fire and dry<br>
                yourself.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There is a great draught here,&quot; said the prince, as 
                he seated<br>
                himself on the ground.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It will be worse when my sons come home,&quot; replied 
                the woman; </p>
              <p>&quot;you are now in the cavern of the Winds, and my sons are 
                the four Winds of heaven: can you understand that?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Where are your sons?&quot; asked the prince.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is difficult to answer stupid questions,&quot; said 
                the woman.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;My sons have plenty of business on hand; they are playing 
                at<br>
                shuttlecock with the clouds up yonder in the king's hall,&quot; 
                and she<br>
                pointed upwards.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, indeed,&quot; said the prince; &quot;but you speak 
                more roughly and<br>
                harshly and are not so gentle as the women I am used to.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, that is because they have nothing else to do; but 
                I am<br>
                obliged to be harsh, to keep my boys in order, and I can do it,<br>
                although they are so head-strong. Do you see those four sacks<br>
                hanging on the wall? Well, they are just as much afraid of those<br>
                sacks, as you used to be of the rat behind the looking-glass. 
                I can<br>
                bend the boys together, and put them in the sacks without any<br>
                resistance on their parts, I can tell you. There they stay, and 
                dare<br>
                not attempt to come out until I allow them to do so. And here 
                comes<br>
                one of them.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was the North Wind who came in, bringing with him a cold,<br>
                piercing blast; large hailstones rattled on the floor, and<br>
                snowflakes were scattered around in all directions. He wore a 
                bearskin dress and cloak. His sealskin cap was drawn over his 
                ears, long icicles hung from his beard, and one hailstone after 
                another rolled from the collar of his jacket.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Don't go too near the fire,&quot; said the prince, &quot;or 
                your hands<br>
                and face will be frost-bitten.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Frost-bitten!&quot; said the North Wind, with a loud laugh; 
                &quot;why frost<br>
                is my greatest delight. What sort of a little snip are you, and 
                how<br>
                did you find your way to the cavern of the Winds?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;He is my guest,&quot; said the old woman, &quot;and if 
                you are not<br>
                satisfied with that explanation you can go into the sack. Do you<br>
                understand me?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>That settled the matter. So the North Wind began to relate his<br>
                adventures, whence he came, and where he had been for a whole 
                month.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I come from the polar seas,&quot; he said; &quot;I have 
                been on the Bear's<br>
                Island with the Russian walrus-hunters. I sat and slept at the 
                helm of<br>
                their ship, as they sailed away from North Cape. Sometimes when 
                I<br>
                woke, the storm-birds would fly about my legs. They are curious 
                birds; they give one flap with their wings, and then on their 
                outstretched pinions soar far away.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Don't make such a long story of it,&quot; said the mother 
                of the<br>
                winds; &quot;what sort of a place is Bear's Island?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;A very beautiful place, with a floor for dancing as smooth 
                and<br>
                flat as a plate. Half-melted snow, partly covered with moss, sharp<br>
                stones, and skeletons of walruses and polar-bears, lie all about,<br>
                their gigantic limbs in a state of green decay. It would seem 
                as if<br>
                the sun never shone there. I blew gently, to clear away the mist,<br>
                and then I saw a little hut, which had been built from the wood 
                of a<br>
                wreck, and was covered with the skins of the walrus, the fleshy 
                side<br>
                outwards; it looked green and red, and on the roof sat a growling<br>
                bear. Then I went to the sea shore, to look after birds' nests, 
                and<br>
                saw the unfledged nestlings opening their mouths and screaming 
                for<br>
                food. I blew into the thousand little throats, and quickly stopped<br>
                their screaming. Farther on were the walruses with pig's heads, 
                and<br>
                teeth a yard long, rolling about like great worms.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You relate your adventures very well, my son,&quot; said 
                the mother,<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;it makes my mouth water to hear you.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;After that,&quot; continued the North Wind, &quot;the hunting 
                commenced.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The harpoon was flung into the breast of the walrus, so that 
                a smoking stream of blood spurted forth like a fountain, and besprinkled 
                the ice. Then I thought of my own game; I began to blow, and set 
                my own ships, the great icebergs sailing, so that they might crush 
                the boats.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Oh, how the sailors howled and cried out! but I howled louder 
                than<br>
                they. They were obliged to unload their cargo, and throw their<br>
                chests and the dead walruses on the ice. Then I sprinkled snow 
                over<br>
                them, and left them in their crushed boats to drift southward, 
                and<br>
                to taste salt water. They will never return to Bear's Island.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;So you have done mischief,&quot; said the mother of the 
                Winds.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I shall leave others to tell the good I have done,&quot; 
                he replied.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;But here comes my brother from the West; I like him best 
                of all,<br>
                for he has the smell of the sea about him, and brings in a cold, 
                fresh<br>
                air as he enters.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Is that the little Zephyr?&quot; asked the prince.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, it is the little Zephyr,&quot; said the old woman; 
                &quot;but he is not<br>
                little now. In years gone by he was a beautiful boy; now that 
                is all<br>
                past.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>He came in, looking like a wild man, and he wore a slouched hat 
                to<br>
                protect his head from injury. In his hand he carried a club, cut<br>
                from a mahogany tree in the American forests, not a trifle to 
                carry.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Whence do you come?&quot; asked the mother.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I come from the wilds of the forests, where the thorny 
                brambles<br>
                form thick hedges between the trees; where the water-snake lies 
                in the<br>
                wet grass, and mankind seem to be unknown.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;What were you doing there?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I looked into the deep river, and saw it rushing down from 
                the<br>
                rocks. The water drops mounted to the clouds and glittered in 
                the<br>
                rainbow. I saw the wild buffalo swimming in the river, but the<br>
                strong tide carried him away amidst a flock of wild ducks, which<br>
                flew into the air as the waters dashed onwards, leaving the buffalo 
                to<br>
                be hurled over the waterfall. This pleased me; so I raised a storm,<br>
                which rooted up old trees, and sent them floating down the river.&quot;<br>
                &quot;And what else have you done?&quot; asked the old woman.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I have rushed wildly across the savannahs; I have stroked 
                the<br>
                wild horses, and shaken the cocoa-nuts from the trees. Yes, I 
                have<br>
                many stories to relate; but I need not tell everything I know. 
                You<br>
                know it all very well, don't you, old lady?&quot; And he kissed 
                his<br>
                mother so roughly, that she nearly fell backwards. Oh, he was, 
                indeed, a wild fellow.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Now in came the South Wind, with a turban and a flowing Bedouin<br>
                cloak.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;How cold it is here!&quot; said he, throwing more wood 
                on the fire.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It is easy to feel that the North Wind has arrived here 
                before me.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Why it is hot enough here to roast a bear,&quot; said the 
                North Wind.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You are a bear yourself,&quot; said the other.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Do you want to be put in the sack, both of you?&quot; said 
                the old<br>
                woman. &quot;Sit down, now, on that stone, yonder, and tell me 
                where you have been.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;In Africa, mother. I went out with the Hottentots, who 
                were<br>
                lion-hunting in the Kaffir land, where the plains are covered 
                with<br>
                grass the color of a green olive; and here I ran races with the<br>
                ostrich, but I soon outstripped him in swiftness. At last I came 
                to<br>
                the desert, in which lie the golden sands, looking like the bottom<br>
                of the sea. Here I met a caravan, and the travellers had just 
                killed<br>
                their last camel, to obtain water; there was very little for them, 
                and<br>
                they continued their painful journey beneath the burning sun, 
                and over<br>
                the hot sands, which stretched before them a vast, boundless desert.<br>
                Then I rolled myself in the loose sand, and whirled it in burning<br>
                columns over their heads. The dromedarys stood still in terror,<br>
                while the merchants drew their caftans over their heads, and threw<br>
                themselves on the ground before me, as they do before Allah, their<br>
                god. Then I buried them beneath a pyramid of sand, which covers 
                them all. When I blow that away on my next visit, the sun will 
                bleach their bones, and travellers will see that others have been 
                there before<br>
                them; otherwise, in such a wild desert, they might not believe 
                it<br>
                possible.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;So you have done nothing but evil,&quot; said the mother. 
                &quot;Into the<br>
                sack with you;&quot; and, before he was aware, she had seized 
                the South<br>
                Wind round the body, and popped him into the bag. He rolled about 
                on the floor, till she sat herself upon him to keep him still.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;These boys of yours are very lively,&quot; said the prince.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied, &quot;but I know how to correct 
                them, when<br>
                necessary; and here comes the fourth.&quot; In came the East Wind,<br>
                dressed like a Chinese.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Oh, you come from that quarter, do you?&quot; said she; 
                &quot;I thought you<br>
                had been to the garden of paradise.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I am going there to-morrow,&quot; he replied; &quot;I have 
                not been there<br>
                for a hundred years. I have just come from China, where I danced 
                round the porcelain tower till all the bells jingled again. In 
                the streets<br>
                an official flogging was taking place, and bamboo canes were being<br>
                broken on the shoulders of men of every high position, from the<br>
                first to the ninth grade. They cried, 'Many thanks, my fatherly<br>
                benefactor;' but I am sure the words did not come from their hearts,<br>
                so I rang the bells till they sounded, 'ding, ding-dong.'&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;You are a wild boy,&quot; said the old woman; &quot;it 
                is well for you that<br>
                you are going to-morrow to the garden of paradise; you always 
                get<br>
                improved in your education there. Drink deeply from the fountain 
                of<br>
                wisdom while you are there, and bring home a bottleful for me.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That I will,&quot; said the East Wind; &quot;but why have 
                you put my<br>
                brother South in a bag? Let him out; for I want him to tell me 
                about<br>
                the phoenix-bird. The princess always wants to hear of this bird<br>
                when I pay her my visit every hundred years. If you will open 
                the<br>
                sack, sweetest mother, I will give you two pocketfuls of tea, 
                green<br>
                and fresh as when I gathered it from the spot where it grew.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well, for the sake of the tea, and because you are my own 
                boy,<br>
                I will open the bag.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>She did so, and the South Wind crept out, looking quite cast 
                down,<br>
                because the prince had seen his disgrace.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There is a palm-leaf for the princess,&quot; he said. &quot;The 
                old<br>
                phoenix, the only one in the world, gave it to me himself. He 
                has<br>
                scratched on it with his beak the whole of his history during 
                the<br>
                hundred years he has lived. She can there read how the old phoenix 
                set fire to his own nest, and sat upon it while it was burning, 
                like a<br>
                Hindoo widow. The dry twigs around the nest crackled and smoked 
                till the flames burst forth and consumed the phoenix to ashes. 
                Amidst the fire lay an egg, red hot, which presently burst with 
                a loud report,<br>
                and out flew a young bird. He is the only phoenix in the world, 
                and<br>
                the king over all the other birds. He has bitten a hole in the 
                leaf<br>
                which I give you, and that is his greeting to the princess.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now let us have something to eat,&quot; said the mother 
                of the<br>
                Winds. So they all sat down to feast on the roasted stag; and 
                as the<br>
                prince sat by the side of the East Wind, they soon became good<br>
                friends.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Pray tell me,&quot; said the prince, &quot;who is that 
                princess of whom you<br>
                have been talking! and where lies the garden of paradise?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Ho! ho!&quot; said the East Wind, &quot;would you like 
                to go there? Well,<br>
                you can fly off with me to-morrow; but I must tell you one thing- 
                no<br>
                human being has been there since the time of Adam and Eve. I suppose 
                you have read of them in your Bible.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Of course I have,&quot; said the prince.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Well,&quot; continued the East Wind, &quot;when they were 
                driven out of the<br>
                garden of paradise, it sunk into the earth; but it retained its 
                warm<br>
                sunshine, its balmy air, and all its splendor. The fairy queen 
                lives<br>
                there, in the island of happiness, where death never comes, and 
                all is<br>
                beautiful. I can manage to take you there to-morrow, if you will 
                sit<br>
                on my back. But now don't talk any more, for I want to go to sleep;&quot;<br>
                and then they all slept.<br>
              </p>
              <p>When the prince awoke in the early morning, he was not a little<br>
                surprised at finding himself high up above the clouds. He was 
                seated<br>
                on the back of the East Wind, who held him faithfully; and they 
                were<br>
                so high in the air that woods and fields, rivers and lakes, as 
                they<br>
                lay beneath them, looked like a painted map.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Good morning,&quot; said the East Wind. &quot;You might 
                have slept on a<br>
                while; for there is very little to see in the flat country over<br>
              </p>
              <p>which we are passing unless you like to count the churches; they<br>
                look like spots of chalk on a green board.&quot; The green board 
                was the<br>
                name he gave to the green fields and meadows.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;It was very rude of me not to say good-bye to your mother 
                and<br>
                your brothers,&quot; said the prince.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;They will excuse you, as you were asleep,&quot; said the 
                East Wind;<br>
                and then they flew on faster than ever.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The leaves and branches of the trees rustled as they passed.<br>
                When they flew over seas and lakes, the waves rose higher, and 
                the<br>
                large ships dipped into the water like diving swans. As darkness<br>
                came on, towards evening, the great towns looked charming; lights 
                were sparkling, now seen now hidden, just as the sparks go out 
                one after another on a piece of burnt paper. The prince clapped 
                his hands with pleasure; but the East Wind advised him not to 
                express his<br>
                admiration in that manner, or he might fall down, and find himself<br>
                hanging on a church steeple. The eagle in the dark forests flies<br>
                swiftly; but faster than he flew the East Wind. The Cossack, on 
                his<br>
                small horse, rides lightly o'er the plains; but lighter still 
                passed<br>
                the prince on the winds of the wind.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There are the Himalayas, the highest mountains in Asia,&quot; 
                said the<br>
                East Wind. &quot;We shall soon reach the garden of paradise now.&quot;<br>
                Then, they turned southward, and the air became fragrant with<br>
                the perfume of spices and flowers. Here figs and pomegranates 
                grew<br>
                wild, and the vines were covered with clusters of blue and purple<br>
                grapes. Here they both descended to the earth, and stretched<br>
                themselves on the soft grass, while the flowers bowed to the breath 
                of<br>
                the wind as if to welcome it. &quot;Are we now in the garden of<br>
                paradise?&quot; asked the prince.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;No, indeed,&quot; replied the East Wind; &quot;but we shall 
                be there very<br>
                soon. Do you see that wall of rocks, and the cavern beneath it, 
                over<br>
                which the grape vines hang like a green curtain? Through that 
                cavern<br>
                we must pass. Wrap your cloak round you; for while the sun scorches 
                you here, a few steps farther it will be icy cold. The bird flying 
                past the entrance to the cavern feels as if one wing were in the<br>
                region of summer, and the other in the depths of winter.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;So this then is the way to the garden of paradise?&quot; 
                asked the<br>
                prince, as they entered the cavern. It was indeed cold; but the 
                cold<br>
                soon passed, for the East Wind spread his wings, and they gleamed 
                like the brightest fire. As they passed on through this wonderful 
                cave, the prince could see great blocks of stone, from which water 
                trickled,<br>
                hanging over their heads in fantastic shapes. Sometimes it was 
                so<br>
                narrow that they had to creep on their hands and knees, while 
                at other<br>
                times it was lofty and wide, like the free air. It had the<br>
                appearance of a chapel for the dead, with petrified organs and<br>
                silent pipes. &quot;We seem to be passing through the valley of 
                death to<br>
                the garden of paradise,&quot; said the prince.<br>
              </p>
              <p>But the East Wind answered not a word, only pointed forwards 
                to<br>
                a lovely blue light which gleamed in the distance. The blocks 
                of stone<br>
                assumed a misty appearance, till at last they looked like white 
                clouds<br>
                in moonlight. The air was fresh and balmy, like a breeze from 
                the<br>
                mountains perfumed with flowers from a valley of roses. A river, 
                clear as the air itself, sparkled at their feet, while in its 
                clear depths<br>
                could be seen gold and silver fish sporting in the bright water, 
                and<br>
                purple eels emitting sparks of fire at every moment, while the 
                broad<br>
                leaves of the water-lilies, that floated on its surface, flickered<br>
                with all the colors of the rainbow. The flower in its color of 
                flame<br>
                seemed to receive its nourishment from the water, as a lamp is<br>
                sustained by oil. A marble bridge, of such exquisite workmanship<br>
                that it appeared as if formed of lace and pearls, led to the island 
                of<br>
                happiness, in which bloomed the garden of paradise. The East Wind 
                took the prince in his arms, and carried him over, while the flowers 
                and the leaves sang the sweet songs of his childhood in tones 
                so full<br>
                and soft that no human voice could venture to imitate. Within 
                the<br>
                garden grew large trees, full of sap; but whether they were palm-trees<br>
                or gigantic water-plants, the prince knew not. The climbing plants<br>
                hung in garlands of green and gold, like the illuminations on 
                the<br>
                margins of old missals or twined among the initial letters. Birds,<br>
                flowers, and festoons appeared intermingled in seeming confusion.<br>
                Close by, on the grass, stood a group of peacocks, with radiant<br>
                tails outspread to the sun. The prince touched them, and found, 
                to his<br>
                surprise, that they were not really birds, but the leaves of the<br>
                burdock tree, which shone with the colors of a peacock's tail. 
                The<br>
                lion and the tiger, gentle and tame, were springing about like 
                playful<br>
                cats among the green bushes, whose perfume was like the fragrant<br>
                blossom of the olive. The plumage of the wood-pigeon glistened 
                like<br>
                pearls as it struck the lion's mane with its wings; while the<br>
                antelope, usually so shy, stood near, nodding its head as if it 
                wished<br>
                to join in the frolic. The fairy of paradise next made her appearance.<br>
                Her raiment shone like the sun, and her serene countenance beamed 
                with happiness like that of a mother rejoicing over her child. 
                She was<br>
                young and beautiful, and a train of lovely maidens followed her,<br>
                each wearing a bright star in her hair. The East Wind gave her 
                the<br>
                palm-leaf, on which was written the history of the phoenix; and 
                her<br>
                eyes sparkled with joy. She then took the prince by the hand, 
                and<br>
                led him into her palace, the walls of which were richly colored,<br>
                like a tulip-leaf when it is turned to the sun. The roof had the<br>
                appearance of an inverted flower, and the colors grew deeper and<br>
                brighter to the gazer. The prince walked to a window, and saw 
                what<br>
                appeared to be the tree of knowledge of good and evil, with Adam 
                and Eve standing by, and the serpent near them. &quot;I thought 
                they were<br>
                banished from paradise,&quot; he said.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The princess smiled, and told him that time had engraved each<br>
                event on a window-pane in the form of a picture; but, unlike other<br>
                pictures, all that it represented lived and moved,- the leaves<br>
                rustled, and the persons went and came, as in a looking-glass. 
                He<br>
                looked through another pane, and saw the ladder in Jacob's dream, 
                on which the angels were ascending and descending with outspread 
                wings.<br>
              </p>
              <p>All that had ever happened in the world here lived and moved 
                on the<br>
                panes of glass, in pictures such as time alone could produce. 
                The<br>
                fairy now led the prince into a large, lofty room with transparent<br>
                walls, through which the light shone. Here were portraits, each 
                one<br>
                appearing more beautiful than the other- millions of happy beings,<br>
                whose laughter and song mingled in one sweet melody: some of these<br>
                were in such an elevated position that they appeared smaller than<br>
                the smallest rosebud, or like pencil dots on paper. In the centre 
                of<br>
                the hall stood a tree, with drooping branches, from which hung<br>
                golden apples, both great and small, looking like oranges amid 
                the<br>
                green leaves. It was the tree of knowledge of good and evil, from<br>
                which Adam and Eve had plucked and eaten the forbidden fruit, 
                and from each leaf trickled a bright red dewdrop, as if the tree 
                were weeping tears of blood for their sin. &quot;Let us now take 
                the boat,&quot; said the fairy: &quot;a sail on the cool waters 
                will refresh us. But we shall not<br>
                move from the spot, although the boat may rock on the swelling<br>
                water; the countries of the world will glide before us, but we 
                shall<br>
                remain still.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>It was indeed wonderful to behold. First came the lofty Alps,<br>
                snow-clad, and covered with clouds and dark pines. The horn resounded, 
                and the shepherds sang merrily in the valleys. The banana-trees 
                bent their drooping branches over the boat, black swans floated 
                on the water, and singular animals and flowers appeared on the 
                distant shore. New Holland, the fifth division of the world, now 
                glided by, with mountains in the background, looking blue in the 
                distance. They<br>
                heard the song of the priests, and saw the wild dance of the savage 
                to<br>
                the sound of the drums and trumpets of bone; the pyramids of Egypt<br>
                rising to the clouds; columns and sphinxes, overthrown and buried 
                in<br>
                the sand, followed in their turn; while the northern lights flashed<br>
                out over the extinguished volcanoes of the north, in fireworks 
                none<br>
                could imitate.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The prince was delighted, and yet he saw hundreds of other<br>
                wonderful things more than can be described. &quot;Can I stay 
                here<br>
                forever?&quot; asked he.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;That depends upon yourself,&quot; replied the fairy. &quot;If 
                you do not,<br>
                like Adam, long for what is forbidden, you can remain here always.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I should not touch the fruit on the tree of knowledge,&quot; 
                said<br>
                the prince; there is abundance of fruit equally beautiful.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Examine your own heart,&quot; said the princess, &quot;and 
                if you do not<br>
                feel sure of its strength, return with the East Wind who brought<br>
                you. He is about to fly back, and will not return here for a hundred<br>
                years. The time will not seem to you more than a hundred hours, 
                yet<br>
                even that is a long time for temptation and resistance. Every 
                evening,<br>
                when I leave you, I shall be obliged to say, 'Come with me,' and 
                to<br>
                beckon to you with my hand. But you must not listen, nor move 
                from<br>
                your place to follow me; for with every step you will find your<br>
                power to resist weaker. If once you attempted to follow me, you<br>
                would soon find yourself in the hall, where grows the tree of<br>
                knowledge, for I sleep beneath its perfumed branches. If you stooped<br>
                over me, I should be forced to smile. If you then kissed my lips,<br>
                the garden of paradise would sink into the earth, and to you it<br>
                would be lost. A keen wind from the desert would howl around you; 
                cold rain fall on your head, and sorrow and woe be your future 
                lot.&quot;<br>
                &quot;I will remain,&quot; said the prince.<br>
              </p>
              <p>So the East Wind kissed him on the forehead, and said, &quot;Be 
                firm;<br>
                then shall we meet again when a hundred years have passed. Farewell,<br>
                farewell.&quot; Then the East Wind spread his broad pinions, which 
                shone<br>
                like the lightning in harvest, or as the northern lights in a 
                cold<br>
                winter.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Farewell, farewell,&quot; echoed the trees and the flowers.<br>
                Storks and pelicans flew after him in feathery bands, to accompany<br>
                him to the boundaries of the garden.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Now we will commence dancing,&quot; said the fairy; and 
                when it is<br>
                nearly over at sunset, while I am dancing with you, I shall make 
                a<br>
                sign, and ask you to follow me: but do not obey. I shall be obliged 
                to<br>
                repeat the same thing for a hundred years; and each time, when 
                the<br>
                trial is past, if you resist, you will gain strength, till resistance 
                becomes easy, and at last the temptation will be quite overcome. 
                This evening, as it will be the first time, I have warned you.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>After this the fairy led him into a large hall, filled with<br>
                transparent lilies. The yellow stamina of each flower formed a 
                tiny<br>
                golden harp, from which came forth strains of music like the mingled<br>
                tones of flute and lyre. Beautiful maidens, slender and graceful 
                in<br>
                form, and robed in transparent gauze, floated through the dance, 
                and<br>
                sang of the happy life in the garden of paradise, where death 
                never<br>
                entered, and where all would bloom forever in immortal youth. 
                As the<br>
                sun went down, the whole heavens became crimson and gold, and 
                tinted the lilies with the hue of roses. Then the beautiful maidens 
                offered to the prince sparkling wine; and when he had drank, he 
                felt happiness greater than he had ever known before. Presently 
                the background of the hall opened and the tree of knowledge appeared, 
                surrounded by a halo of glory that almost blinded him. Voices, 
                soft and lovely as his mother's sounded in his ears, as if she 
                were singing to him, &quot;My child, my beloved child.&quot; Then 
                the fairy beckoned to him, and said in sweet accents, &quot;Come 
                with me, come with me.&quot; </p>
              <p>Forgetting his promise, forgetting it even on the very first 
                evening, he rushed towards her, while she continued to beckon 
                to him and to smile. The fragrance around him overpowered his 
                senses, the music from the harps sounded more entrancing, while 
                around the tree appeared millions of smiling faces, nodding and 
                singing. &quot;Man should know everything; man is the lord of 
                the earth.&quot; The tree of knowledge no longer wept tears of 
                blood, for the dewdrops shone like glittering stars.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Come, come,&quot; continued that thrilling voice, and the 
                prince<br>
                followed the call. At every step his cheeks glowed, and the blood<br>
                rushed wildly through his veins. &quot;I must follow,&quot; he 
                cried; &quot;it is not<br>
                a sin, it cannot be, to follow beauty and joy. I only want to 
                see<br>
                her sleep, and nothing will happen unless I kiss her, and that 
                I<br>
                will not do, for I have strength to resist, and a determined will.&quot;<br>
                The fairy threw off her dazzling attire, bent back the boughs, 
                and<br>
                in another moment was hidden among them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I have not sinned yet,&quot; said the prince, &quot;and 
                I will not;&quot; and<br>
                then he pushed aside the boughs to follow the princess. She was<br>
                lying already asleep, beautiful as only a fairy in the garden 
                of<br>
                paradise could be. She smiled as he bent over her, and he saw 
                tears<br>
                trembling out of her beautiful eyelashes. &quot;Do you weep for 
                me?&quot; he<br>
                whispered. &quot;Oh weep not, thou loveliest of women. Now do 
                I begin to understand the happiness of paradise; I feel it to 
                my inmost soul,<br>
                in every thought. A new life is born within me. One moment of 
                such<br>
                happiness is worth an eternity of darkness and woe.&quot; He stooped 
                and<br>
                kissed the tears from her eyes, and touched her lips with his.<br>
                A clap of thunder, loud and awful, resounded through the trembling<br>
                air. All around him fell into ruin. The lovely fairy, the beautiful<br>
                garden, sunk deeper and deeper. The prince saw it sinking down 
                in<br>
                the dark night till it shone only like a star in the distance 
                beneath him. Then he felt a coldness, like death, creeping over 
                him; his eyes closed, and he became insensible.<br>
              </p>
              <p>When he recovered, a chilling rain was beating upon him, and 
                a<br>
                sharp wind blew on his head. &quot;Alas! what have I done?&quot; 
                he sighed; &quot;I<br>
                have sinned like Adam, and the garden of paradise has sunk into 
                the<br>
                earth.&quot; He opened his eyes, and saw the star in the distance, 
                but it<br>
                was the morning star in heaven which glittered in the darkness.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Presently he stood up and found himself in the depths of the<br>
                forest, close to the cavern of the Winds, and the mother of the<br>
                Winds sat by his side. She looked angry, and raised her arm in 
                the air<br>
                as she spoke. &quot;The very first evening!&quot; she said. &quot;Well, 
                I expected<br>
                it! If you were my son, you should go into the sack.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And there he will have to go at last,&quot; said a strong 
                old man,<br>
                with large black wings, and a scythe in his hand, whose name was<br>
                Death. &quot;He shall be laid in his coffin, but not yet. I will 
                allow<br>
                him to wander about the world for a while, to atone for his sin, 
                and<br>
                to give him time to become better. But I shall return when he 
                least<br>
                expects me. I shall lay him in a black coffin, place it on my 
                head,<br>
                and fly away with it beyond the stars. There also blooms a garden 
                of<br>
                paradise, and if he is good and pious he will be admitted; but 
                if<br>
                his thoughts are bad, and his heart is full of sin, he will sink<br>
                with his coffin deeper than the garden of paradise has sunk. Once 
                in<br>
                every thousand years I shall go and fetch him, when he will either<br>
                be condemned to sink still deeper, or be raised to a happier life 
                in<br>
                the world beyond the stars.&quot;</p>

              <p class="h" align="center"> THE WINDMILL</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> A WINDMILL stood upon the hill, proud to look at, and it was 
                proud too.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I am not proud at all,&quot; it said, &quot;but I am very 
                much enlightened without and within. I have sun and moon for my 
                outward<br>
                use, and for inward use too; and into the bargain I have stearine<br>
                candles, train oil and lamps, and tallow candles. I may well say<br>
                that I'm enlightened. I'm a thinking being, and so well constructed<br>
                that it's quite delightful. I have a good windpipe in my chest, 
                and<br>
                I have four wings that are placed outside my head, just beneath 
                my<br>
                hat. The birds have only two wings, and are obliged to carry them 
                on<br>
                their backs. I am a Dutchman by birth, that may be seen by my<br>
                figure- a flying Dutchman. They are considered supernatural beings,<br>
                I know, and yet I am quite natural. I have a gallery round my 
                chest,<br>
                and house-room beneath it; that's where my thoughts dwell. My<br>
                strongest thought, who rules and reigns, is called by others 'The<br>
                Man in the Mill.' He knows what he wants, and is lord over the 
                meal<br>
                and the bran; but he has his companion, too, and she calls herself<br>
                'Mother.' She is the very heart of me. She does not run about 
                stupidly<br>
                and awkwardly, for she knows what she wants, she knows what she 
                can do, she's as soft as a zephyr and as strong as a storm; she 
                knows<br>
                how to begin a thing carefully, and to have her own way. She is 
                my<br>
                soft temper, and the father is my hard one. They are two, and 
                yet one;<br>
                they each call the other 'My half.' These two have some little 
                boys,<br>
                young thoughts, that can grow. The little ones keep everything 
                in<br>
                order. When, lately, in my wisdom, I let the father and the boys<br>
                examine my throat and the hole in my chest, to see what was going 
                on<br>
                there,- for something in me was out of order, and it's well to 
                examine<br>
                one's self,- the little ones made a tremendous noise. The youngest<br>
                jumped up into my hat, and shouted so there that it tickled me. 
                The<br>
                little thoughts may grow- I know that very well; and out in the<br>
                world thoughts come too, and not only of my kind, for as far as 
                I<br>
                can see, I cannot discern anything like myself; but the wingless<br>
                houses, whose throats make no noise, have thoughts too, and these 
                come to my thoughts, and make love to them, as it is called. It's 
                wonderful enough- yes, there are many wonderful things. Something 
                has come over me, or into me,- something has changed in the mill-work. 
                It seems as if the one half, the father, had altered, and had 
                received a better temper and a more affectionate helpmate- so 
                young and good, and yet the same, only more gentle and good through 
                the course of time. What was bitter has passed away, and the whole 
                is much more comfortable.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;The days go on, and the days come nearer and nearer to<br>
                clearness and to joy; and then a day will come when it will be 
                over<br>
                with me; but not over altogether. I must be pulled down that I 
                may<br>
                be built up again; I shall cease, but yet shall live on. To become<br>
                quite a different being, and yet remain the same! That's difficult 
                for<br>
                me to understand, however enlightened I may be with sun, moon,<br>
                stearine, train oil, and tallow. My old wood-work and my old<br>
                brick-work will rise again from the dust!<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;I will hope that I may keep my old thoughts, the father 
                in the<br>
                mill, and the mother, great ones and little ones- the family; 
                for I<br>
                call them all, great and little, the company of thoughts, because 
                I<br>
                must, and cannot refrain from it.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;And I must also remain 'myself,' with my throat in my chest, 
                my<br>
                wings on my head, the gallery round my body; else I should not 
                know<br>
                myself, nor could the others know me, and say, 'There's the mill 
                on<br>
                the hill, proud to look at, and yet not proud at all.'&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>That is what the mill said. Indeed, it said much more, but that 
                is<br>
                the most important part.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And the days came, and the days went, and yesterday was the last<br>
                day.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then the mill caught fire. The flames rose up high, and beat 
                out<br>
                and in, and bit at the beams and planks, and ate them up. The 
                mill<br>
                fell, and nothing remained of it but a heap of ashes. The smoke<br>
                drove across the scene of the conflagration, and the wind carried 
                it<br>
                away.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Whatever had been alive in the mill remained, and what had been<br>
                gained by it has nothing to do with this story.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The miller's family- one soul, many thoughts, and yet only one-<br>
                built a new, a splendid mill, which answered its purpose. It was 
                quite<br>
                like the old one, and people said, &quot;Why, yonder is the mill 
                on the<br>
                hill, proud to look at!&quot; But this mill was better arranged, 
                more<br>
                according to the time than the last, so that progress might be 
                made.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The old beams had become worm-eaten and spongy- they lay in dust 
                and ashes. The body of the mill did not rise out of the dust as 
                they had believed it would do. They had taken it literally, and 
                all things<br>
                are not to be taken literally.</p>

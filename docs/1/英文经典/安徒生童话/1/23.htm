              <p class="h" align="center"> LITTLE TUK</p>
              <p align="center"> by <i><b>Hans Christian Andersen</b></i></p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> YES, they called him Little Tuk, but it was not his real name;<br>
                he had called himself so before he could speak plainly, and he 
                meant<br>
                it for Charles. It was all very well for those who knew him, but 
                not<br>
                for strangers.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Little Tuk was left at home to take care of his little sister, 
                Gustava, who was much younger than himself, and he had to learn 
                his lessons at the same time, and the two things could not very 
                well be performed together. The poor boy sat there with his sister 
                on his lap, and sung to her all the songs he knew, and now and 
                then he looked into<br>
                his geography lesson that lay open before him. By the next morning<br>
                he had to learn by heart all the towns in Zealand, and all that 
                could be described of them.<br>
              </p>
              <p>His mother came home at last, and took little Gustava in her 
                arms.<br>
                Then Tuk ran to the window, and read so eagerly that he nearly 
                read<br>
                his eyes out; for it had become darker and darker every minute, 
                and<br>
                his mother had no money to buy a light.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;There goes the old washerwoman up the lane,&quot; said 
                the mother,<br>
                as she looked out of the window; &quot;the poor woman can hardly 
                drag<br>
                herself along, and now she had to drag a pail of water from the<br>
                well. Be a good boy, Tuk, and run across and help the old woman, 
                won't you?&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>So Tuk ran across quickly, and helped her, but when he came back<br>
                into the room it was quite dark, and there was not a word said 
                about a<br>
                light, so he was obliged to go to bed on his little truckle bedstead, 
                and there he lay and thought of his geography lesson, and of Zealand, 
                and of all the master had told him. He ought really to have read 
                it over again, but he could not for want of light. So he put the 
                geography book under his pillow, for he had heard that this was 
                a great help towards learning a lesson, but not always to be depended 
                upon. He still lay thinking and thinking, when all at once it 
                seemed as if some one kissed him on his eyes and mouth. He slept 
                and<br>
                yet he did not sleep; and it appeared as if the old washerwoman 
                looked at him with kind eyes and said, &quot;It would be a great 
                pity if you did not know your lesson to-morrow morning; you helped 
                me, and now I will help you, and Providence will always keep those 
                who help<br>
                themselves;&quot; and at the same time the book under Tuk's pillow 
                began to move about. &quot;Cluck, cluck, cluck,&quot; cried a 
                hen as she crept towards him. &quot;I am a hen from Kjoge,&quot; 
                and then she told him how many inhabitants the town contained, 
                and about a battle that had been<br>
                fought there, which really was not worth speaking of. &quot;Crack, 
                crack,&quot; down fell something. It was a wooden bird, the parrot 
                which is used as a target as Prastoe. He said there were as many 
                inhabitants in that town as he had nails in his body. He was very 
                proud, and said, &quot;Thorwalsden lived close to me, and here 
                I am now, quite comfortable.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>But now little Tuk was no longer in bed; all in a moment he<br>
                found himself on horseback. Gallop, gallop, away he went, seated 
                in<br>
                front of a richly-attired knight, with a waving plume, who held 
                him on<br>
                the saddle, and so they rode through the wood by the old town 
                of<br>
                Wordingburg, which was very large and busy. The king's castle 
                was<br>
                surrounded by lofty towers, and radiant light streamed from all 
                the<br>
                windows. Within there were songs and dancing; King Waldemar and 
                the young gayly-dressed ladies of the court were dancing together. 
                Morning dawned, and as the sun rose, the whole city and the king's 
                castle sank suddenly down together. One tower after another fell, 
                till at last only one remained standing on the hill where the 
                castle had formerly been.<br>
              </p>
              <p>The town now appeared small and poor, and the school-boys read<br>
                in their books, which they carried under their arms, that it contained<br>
                two thousand inhabitants; but this was a mere boast, for it did 
                not<br>
                contain so many.<br>
              </p>
              <p>And again little Tuk lay in his bed, scarcely knowing whether 
                he<br>
                was dreaming or not, for some one stood by him.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Tuk! little Tuk!&quot; said a voice. It was a very little 
                person who<br>
                spoke. He was dressed as a sailor, and looked small enough to 
                be a<br>
                middy, but he was not one. &quot;I bring you many greetings from 
                Corsor. It is a rising town, full of life. It has steamships and 
                mail-coaches. In<br>
                times past they used to call it ugly, but that is no longer true. 
                I<br>
                lie on the sea-shore,&quot; said Corsor; &quot;I have high-roads 
                and<br>
                pleasure-gardens; I have given birth to a poet who was witty and<br>
                entertaining, which they are not all. I once wanted to fit out 
                a<br>
                ship to sail round the world, but I did not accomplish it, though 
                most<br>
                likely I might have done so. But I am fragrant with perfume, for 
                close<br>
                to my gates most lovely roses bloom.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then before the eyes of little Tuk appeared a confusion of colors,<br>
                red and green; but it cleared off, and he could distinguish a 
                cliff<br>
                close to the bay, the slopes of which were quite overgrown with<br>
                verdure, and on its summit stood a fine old church with pointed<br>
                towers. Springs of water flowed out of the cliff in thick waterspouts,<br>
                so that there was a continual splashing. Close by sat an old king 
                with<br>
                a golden crown on his white head. This was King Hroar of the Springs 
                and near the springs stood the town of Roeskilde, as it is called.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Then all the kings and queens of Denmark went up the ascent to 
                the old church, hand in hand, with golden crowns on their heads, 
                while the organ played and the fountains sent forth jets of water.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Little Tuk saw and heard it all. &quot;Don't forget the names 
                of these towns,&quot; said King Hroar.<br>
              </p>
              <p>All at once everything vanished; but where! It seemed to him<br>
                like turning over the leaves of a book. And now there stood before 
                him an old peasant woman, who had come from Soroe where the grass 
                grows in the market-place. She had a green linen apron thrown 
                over her head and shoulders, and it was quite wet, as if it had 
                been raining heavily.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Yes, that it has,&quot; said she, and then, just as she 
                was going to<br>
                tell him a great many pretty stories from Holberg's comedies, 
                and<br>
                about Waldemar and Absalom, she suddenly shrunk up together, and<br>
                wagged her head as if she were a frog about to spring. &quot;Croak,&quot; 
                she<br>
                cried; &quot;it is always wet, and as quiet as death in Soroe.&quot; 
                Then little<br>
                Tuk saw she was changed into a frog. &quot;Croak,&quot; and again 
                she was an old woman. &quot;One must dress according to the weather,&quot; 
                said she. &quot;It is wet, and my town is just like a bottle. 
                By the cork we must go in, and by the cork we must come out again. 
                In olden times I had beautiful fish, and now I have fresh, rosy-cheeked 
                boys in the bottom of the bottle, and they learn wisdom, Hebrew 
                and Greek.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Croak.&quot; How it sounded like the cry of the frogs on 
                the moor,<br>
                or like the creaking of great boots when some one is marching,- 
                always the same tone, so monotonous and wearing, that little Tuk 
                at length fell fast asleep, and then the sound could not annoy 
                him. But even in this sleep came a dream or something like it. 
                His little sister<br>
                Gustava, with her blue eyes, and fair curly hair, had grown up 
                a<br>
                beautiful maiden all at once, and without having wings she could<br>
                fly. And they flew together over Zealand, over green forests and<br>
                blue lakes.<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;Hark, so you hear the cock crow, little Tuk. 'Cock-a-doodle-doo.'<br>
                The fowls are flying out of Kjoge. You shall have a large farm-yard.<br>
                You shall never suffer hunger or want. The bird of good omen shall<br>
                be yours, and you shall become a rich and happy man; your house<br>
                shall rise up like King Waldemar's towers, and shall be richly 
                adorned<br>
                with marble statues, like those at Prastoe. Understand me well; 
                your<br>
                name shall travel with fame round the world like the ship that 
                was<br>
                to sail from Corsor, and at Roeskilde,- Don't forget the names 
                of<br>
                the towns, as King Hroar said,- you shall speak well and clearly<br>
                little Tuk, and when at last you lie in your grave you shall sleep<br>
                peacefully, as-&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>&quot;As if I lay in Soroe,&quot; said little Tuk awaking. It 
                was bright<br>
                daylight, and he could not remember his dream, but that was not<br>
                necessary, for we are not to know what will happen to us in the<br>
                future. Then he sprang out of bed quickly, and read over his lesson 
                in<br>
                the book, and knew it all at once quite correctly. The old washerwoman 
                put her head in at the door, and nodded to him quite kindly, and 
                said, &quot;Many thanks, you good child, for your help yesterday. 
                I hope all your beautiful dreams will come true.&quot;<br>
              </p>
              <p>Little Tuk did not at all know what he had dreamt, but One above<br>
                did.</p>

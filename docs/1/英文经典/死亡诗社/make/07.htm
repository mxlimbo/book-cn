              <p>GLORIA<br>
                Yeah. If you guys don't have a meeting, how do we know if we wanna

              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                &amp;quot;Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more 
                lovely and more temperate.&amp;quot; </p>
              <p>TINA<br>
                That's so sweet. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                I made that up just for you. </p>
              <p>TINA<br>
                You did? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                I'll write one for you too, Gloria. She walks in beauty like the 
                night. She walks in beauty like the night. Of cloudless climes 
                and starry skies. All that's best, dark and bright, Meet in her 
                aspect and her eyes. </p>
              <p>GLORIA<br>
                That's beautiful. </p>

              <p>BUBBA<br>
                It's Mutt Sanders' brother. </p>

                Chet, no! You'll hurt him! No! No! Stop it! Leave him alone! </p>

              <p>TINA<br>
                Go ahead, pass it around. </p>
              <p>MEEKS<br>
                Me and Pitts are working on a hi-fi system. It shouldn't be that 
                hard to, uh, to put together. </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                Yeah. Uh, I might be going to Yale. Uh, uh, but, I, I might not. 
              </p>
              <p>GLORIA<br>
                Don't you guys miss having girls around here? </p>
              <p>MEEKS<br>
                Yeah. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                That's part of what this club is about. In fact, I'd like to announce 
                I published an article in the school paper, in the name of the 
                Dead Poets. </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                What? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Demanding girls be admitted to Welton. </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                You didn't. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                So we can all stop beating off. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                How did you do that? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                I'm one of the proofers. I slipped the article in. </p>
              <p>MEEKS<br>
                Look, uh, it's, it's over now. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Why? Nobody knows who we are. </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                Well, don't you think they're gonna figure out who wrote it? They're 
                gonna come to you and ask to know what the Dead Poets Society 
                is. Charlie, you had no right to do something like that. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                It's Nuwanda, Cameron. </p>
              <p>GLORIA<br>
                That's right. It's Nuwanda. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Are we just playing around out here, or do we mean what we say? 
                For all we do is come together and reach a bunch of poems to each 
                other. What the hell are we doing? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                All right, but you still shouldn't have done it, Charlie. This 
                could mean trouble. You don't speak for the club. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Hey, would you not worry about your precious little neck? If they 
                catch me, I'll tell them I made it up. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Sit. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                In this week of Welton's Honor there appeared a profane and unauthorized 
                article. Rather than spend my valuable time ferreting out the 
                guilty persons -- and let me assure you I will find them -- I'm 
                asking any and all students who knows anything about this article 
                to make themselves known here and now. Whoever the guilty persons 
                are, this is your only chance to avoid expulsion from this school. 
              </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Welton Academy. Hello. Yes, he is. Just a moment. Mr. Nolan, it's 
                for you. It's God. He says we should have girls at Welton. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Wipe that smirk off your face. If you think, Mr. Dalton, that 
                you're the first to try to get thrown out of this school, think 
                again. Others have had similar notions and have failed just as 
                surely as you will fail. Assume the position. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Count aloud, Mr. Dalton. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                One. Two. Three. Four. Five. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                What is this Dead Poets Society? I want names. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                You kicked out? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                No. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                So what happened? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                I'm to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will 
                be forgiven. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                So, what are you gonna do? Charlie! </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Damn it, Neil. The name is Nuwanda. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Excuse me. May we have a word, Mr. Keating? </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Certainly. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                This was my first classroom, John. Did you know that? My first 
                desk. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Didn't know you taught, Mr. Nolan. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                English. Oh, long before your time. It was hard giving it up, 
                I can tell you. I'm hearing rumors, John, about some unorthodox 
                teaching methods in your classroom. I'm not saying they've anything 
                to do with the Dalton boy's outburst. But I don't think I have 
                to warn you boys his age are very impressionable. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Well, your reprimand made quite an impression, I'm sure. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                What was going on in the courtyard the other day? </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Courtyard? </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Yeah. Boys marching, clapping in unison. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Oh, that. That was an exercise to prove a point. Dangers of conformity. 
              </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                Well, John, the curriculum here is set. It's proven it works. 
                If you question, what's to prevent them from doing the same? </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                I always thought the idea of educating was to learn to think for 
                yourself. </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                At these boys' ages? Not on your life! Tradition, John. Discipline. 
                Prepare them for college, and the rest will take care of itself.

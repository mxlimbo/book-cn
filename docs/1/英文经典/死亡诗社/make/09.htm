                Either I mistake your shape and making quite, Or else you are 
                that shrewd and knavish sprite Call'd Robin Goodfellow: </p>
              <p>PUCK<br>
                Thou speak'st aright; I am that merry wanderer of the night. I 
                jest to Oberon and make him smile When I a fat and bean-fed horse 
                beguile, Neighing in likeness of a filly foal: And sometime lurk 
                I in a gossip's bowl, In very likeness of a roasted crab, And 
                when she drinks, against her lips I bob And on her wither'd dewlap 
                pour the ale. The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale, </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                He's good. He's really good. </p>
              <p>PUCK<br>
                Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me; Then slip I from her 
                bum, down topples she, And &amp;quot;tailor&amp;quot; cries, and 
                falls into a cough; And then the whole quire hold their hips and 
                laugh, And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear A merrier 
                hour was never wasted there. But, room, Fairy! here comes Oberon. 
              </p>
              <p>FAIRY<br>
                And here my mistress. Would that he were gone! </p>
              <p>LYSANDER<br>
                Then by your side no bed-room me deny; For lying so, Hermia, I 
                do not lie </p>
              <p>HERMIA<br>
                Lysander riddles very prettily: Now much beshrew my manners and 
                my pride, If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied. But, gentle friend, 
                for love and courtesy Lie further off; in human modesty, Such 
                separation as may well be said Becomes a virtuous bachelor and 
                a maid, and, good night, sweet friend: Thy love ne'er alter till 
                thy sweet life end! </p>
              <p>LYSANDER<br>
                Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I; </p>
              <p>DIRECTOR<br>
                Neil. That's your cue, Neil. Come on, Neil. Here's your crown. 
                Let's go. </p>
              <p>PUCK<br>
                If we shadows have offended, Think but this, and all is mended, 
                That you have but slumber'd here While these visions did appear. 
                And this weak and idle theme, No more yielding but a dream, Gentles, 
                do not reprehend: If you pardon, we will mend: And, as I am an 
                honest Puck, If we have unearned luck Now to 'scape the serpent's 
                tongue, We will make amends ere long; Else the Puck a liar call; 
                So, good night unto you all. Give me your hands, if we be friends, 
                And Robin shall restore amends. </p>

                Yeah, Neil! </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                Excuse me, I'm Neil's father. I need to see him. </p>
              <p>DIRECTOR<br>
                Your father. He's- </p>
              <p>MAN<br>
                What did you think? WO<br>
                MAN<br>
                Really I thought you were all just wonderful! </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Neil, Neil, you were great. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                I can't, guys. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Neil! Neil! </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Neil. Neil. You have the gift. What a performance You left even 
                me speechless. You have to stay with- </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                Get in the car. Keating, you stay away from my son. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Neil! Neil! Mr. Perry, come on. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Don't make it any worse than it is. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Is it okay if we walk back? Captain? Knox. </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                We're trying very hard to understand why it is that you insist 
                on defying us. Whatever the reason, we're not gonna let you ruin 
                your life. Tomorrow I'm withdrawing you from Welton and enrolling 
                you in Braden Military School. You're going to Harvard and you're 
                gonna be a doctor. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                But that's ten more years. Father, that's a lifetime! </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                Oh, stop it. Don't be so dramatic. You make it sound like a prison 
                term. You don't understand, Neil. You have opportunities that 
                I never even dreamt of and I am not going to let you waste them. 
              </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                I've got to tell you what I feel. </p>
              <p>MRS. PERRY<br>
                We've been so worried about-- </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                What? What? Tell me what you feel. What is it? </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                Is it more of this, this acting business? Because you can forget 
                that. What? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Nothing. </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                Nothing. Well, then, let's go to bed. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                I was good. I was really good. </p>
              <p>MRS. PERRY<br>
                Go on, get some sleep. </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                It's all right. It's going to be all right. </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                What was that? </p>
              <p>MRS. PERRY<br>
                What? </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                That sound. </p>
              <p>MRS. PERRY<br>
                What sound? Tom? </p>
              <p>MRS. PERRY<br>
                What is it? What's wrong? </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                Neil. </p>
              <p>MRS. PERRY<br>
                Tom, what is it? What's wrong? Neil? </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                Neil? </p>
              <p>MRS. PERRY<br>
                I'll look outside. Neil? </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                No! </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                Oh, Neil! Oh, my God! </p>
              <p>MRS. PERRY<br>
                Oh! No! </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                Oh, my son! </p>
              <p>MRS. PERRY<br>
                He's all right. </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                My son! My poor son! </p>
              <p>MRS. PERRY<br>
                He's all right! He's all right! He's all right! He's all right! 
                He's all right! He's all right! </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                Stop it! Stop it! Stop it. </p>

                Todd? Todd. </p>

                Neil's dead. </p>

              <p>TODD<br>
                He wouldn't-- He wouldn't have done it. </p>
              <p>MEEKS<br>
                You can't explain it, Todd. </p>

                It was his father! </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                No! </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                He wouldn't have left us. If he knew-- He wouldn't have. His dad 
                was-- his, his father did it. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Todd. </p>

                His father killed him. </p>

              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Leave him be. </p>
              <p>BOYS<br>
                All my life Thy light shall surely follow me And in God's house 
                forevermore My dwelling place shall be Amen </p>
              <p>MR. NOLAN<br>
                The death of Neil Perry is a tragedy. He was a fine student. One 
                of Welton's best. And he will be missed. We've contacted each 
                of your parents to explain the situation. Naturally, they're all 
                quite concerned. At the request of Neil's family, I intend to 
                conduct a thorough inquiry into this matter. Your complete cooperation 
                is expected. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                You told him about this meeting? </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                Twice. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                That's it, guys. We're all fried. </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                How do you mean? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Cameron's a fink. He's in Nolan's office right now, finking. </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                About what? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                The club, Pissie. Think about it. The board of directors, the 
                trustees and Mr. Nolan. Do you think for one moment they're gonna 
                let this thing just blow over? Schools go down because of things 
                like this. They need a scapegoat.</p>

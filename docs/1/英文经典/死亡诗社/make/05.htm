                Okay, everybody on the bus. Let's go, boys. Come on, let's go. 
                On the bus, boys. Now! </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Now, devotees may argue that one sport or game is inherently better 
                than another. For me, sport is actually a chance for us to have 
                other human beings push us to excel. I want you all to come over 
                here and take a slip of paper and line up single file. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Mr. Meeks, time to inherit the earth. Mr. Pitts, rise above your 
                name. I want you to hand these out to the boys, one apiece. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                You know what to do, Pitts. </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                &amp;quot;Oh to struggle against great odds. To meet enemies undaunted.&amp;quot;

              <p>KEATING<br>
                Sounds to me like you're daunted. Say it again like you're undaunted.

                They need a letter of permission from my father and Mr. Nolan. 
              </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                You're not gonna write it. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Oh yes, I am. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Oh, Neil. Neil, you're crazy. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Okay. &amp;quot;I am writing to you on behalf of my son Neil Perry.&amp;quot; 
                This is great. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                &amp;quot;To Chris.&amp;quot; </p>
              <p>BOY 1<br>
                Who's Chris? </p>
              <p>BOY 2<br>
                Mmm, Chris. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                I see a sweetness in her smile. Blight light shines from her eyes. 
                But life is complete; contentment is mine, Just knowing that... 
                just knowing that she's alive. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Sorry, Captain. It's stupid. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                No, no. It's not stupid. It's a good effort. It touched on one 
                of the major themes, love. A major theme not only in poetry, but 
                life. Mr. Hopkins, you were laughing. You're up. </p>
              <p>HOPKINS<br>
                &amp;quot;The cat sat on the mat.&amp;quot; </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Congratulations, Mr. Hopkins. Yours is the first poem to ever 
                have a negative score on the Pritchard scale. We're not laughing 
                at you, we're laughing near you. I don't mind that your poem had 
                a simple theme. Sometimes the most beautiful poetry can be about 
                simple things, like a cat, or a flower or rain. You see, poetry 
                can come from anything with the stuff of revelation in it. Just 
                don't let your poems be ordinary. Now, who's next? </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Mr. Anderson, I see you sitting there in agony. Come on, Todd, 
                step up. Let's put you out of your misery. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                I, I didn't do it. I didn't write a poem. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Mr. Anderson thinks that everything inside of him is worthless 
                and embarrassing. Isn't that right, Todd? Isn't that your worst 
                fear? Well, I think you're wrong. I think you have something inside 
                of you that is worth a great deal. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                &amp;quot;I sound my barbaric yawp over the rooftops of the world.&amp;quot; 
                W. W. Uncle Walt again. Now, for those of you who don't know, 
                a yawp is a loud cry or yell. Now, Todd, I would like you to give 
                us a demonstration of a barbaric &amp;quot;yawp.&amp;quot; Come 
                on. You can't yawp sitting down. Let's go. Come on. Up. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                You gotta get in &amp;quot;yawping&amp;quot; stance. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                A yawp. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                No, not just a yawp. A barbaric yawp. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Yawp. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Come on, louder. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Yawp. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                No, that's a mouse. Come on. Louder. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Yawp. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Oh, good God, boy. Yell like a man! </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Yawp! </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                There it is. You see, you have a barbarian in you, after all. 
                Now, you don't get away that easy. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                The picture of Uncle Walt up there. What does he remind you of? 
                Don't think. Answer. Go on. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                A m-m-madman. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                What kind of madman? Don't think about it. Just answer again. 
              </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                A c-crazy madman. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                No, you can do better than that. Free up your mind. Use your imagination. 
                Say the first thing that pops into your head, even if it's total 
                gibberish. Go on, go on. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Uh, uh, a sweaty-toothed madman. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Good God, boy, there's a poet in you, after all. There, close 
                your eyes. Close your eyes. Close 'em. Now, describe what you 
                see. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Uh, I-I close my eyes. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Yes? </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Uh, and this image floats beside me. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                A sweaty-toothed madman? </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Oh, that's excellent. Now, give him action. Make him do something. 
              </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                H-His hands reach out and choke me. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                That's it. Wonderful. Wonderful. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                And, and all the time he's mumbling. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                What's he mumbling? </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                M-Mumbling, &amp;quot;Truth. Truth is like, like a blanket that 
                always leaves your feet cold.&amp;quot; </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Forget them, forget them. Stay with the blanket. Tell me about 
                that blanket. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Y-Y-Y-You push it, stretch it, it'll never be enough. You kick 
                at it, beat it, it'll never cover any of us. From the moment we 
                enter crying to the moment we leave dying, it will just cover 
                your face as you wail and cry and scream. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Don't you forget this. </p>

              <p>MEEKS<br>
                Smoke that. Put that in your pipe and smoke it. </p>

              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Laughing, crying, tumbling, mumbling. Gotta do more. Gotta be

              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Chaos screaming, chaos dreaming. Gotta do more! Gotta be more!

                Wow! </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                That was nice. That was great. Where did you learn to play like

                My parents made me take the clarinet for years. </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>

              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                I hated it. The saxophone. The saxophone is more sonorous. </p>

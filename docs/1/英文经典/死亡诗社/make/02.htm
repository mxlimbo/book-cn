              Why doesn't he let you do what you want?

                Yeah. Neil, tell him off. It couldn't get any worse. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Oh, that's rich! Like you guys tell your parents off, Mr. Future 
                Lawyer and Mr. Future Banker? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Well, stop telling me how to talk to my father. You guys are the 
                same way. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                All right, all right. Jesus. So what are you gonna do, then? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                What I have to do. Drop the annual. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Well, I wouldn't lose too much sleep over it. It's just a bunch 
                of jerks trying to impress Nolan. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                I don't care. I don't give a damn about any of it. </p>

                Well, uh, Latin, eight o'clock in my room? </p>

                Yeah. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                I guess so. </p>

                Your study of trigonometry requires absolute precision. Anyone 
                failing to turn in any homework assignment will be penalized one 
                point off their final grade. Let me urge you now not to test me 
                on this point. </p>
              <p>BOY 1<br>
                Hey, Spaz! Spaz! </p>
              <p>BOY 2<br>
                Brian damaged. </p>
              <p>KEATING</p>
              <p>Well, come on! </p>
              <p><br>
                BOY<br>
                Let's go. Let's go, guys. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                &amp;quot;O Captain! My Captain!&amp;quot; Who knows where that 
                comes from? Anybody. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Not a clue? It's from a poem by Walt Whitman about Mr. Abraham 
                Lincoln. Now, this class, you can either call me Mr. Keating, 
                or, if you're slightly more daring, &amp;quot;O Captain! My Captain.&amp;quot; 
              </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Now let me dispel a few rumors, so they don't fester into facts. 
                Yes, I, too, attended Hellton and have survived. And no, at that 
                time, I was not the mental giant you see before you. I was the 
                intellectual equivalent of a ninety-eight-pound weakling. I would 
                go to the beach, and people would kick copies of Byron in my face. 
              </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Now, Mr. Pitts. That's rather unfortunate name. Mr. Pitts, where 
                are you? </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Mr. Pitts, will you open your hymnal to page 542? Read the first 
                stanza of the poem you find there. </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                &amp;quot;To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time&amp;quot;? </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Yes. That's the one. Somewhat appropriate, isn't it? <br>
                PITTS<br>
                Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, Old time is still a-flying: And 
                this same flowers that smiles today, Tomorrow will be dying. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Thank you, Mr. Pitts. &amp;quot;Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.&amp;quot; 
                The Latin term for that sentiment is &amp;quot;Carpe diem&amp;quot;. 
                Now who knows what that means? </p>
              <p>MEEKS<br>
                Carpe diem. That's &amp;quot;seize the day.&amp;quot; </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Very good, Mr-- </p>
              <p>MEEKS<br>
                Meeks. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Meeks. Another unusual name. Seize the day. &amp;quot;Gather ye 
                rosebuds while ye may.&amp;quot; Why does the writer use these 
                lines? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Because he's in a hurry. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                No! Ding! Thank you for playing anyway. Because we are food for 
                worms, lads. Because, believe it or not, each and every one of 
                us in this room is, one day, gonna stop breathing, turn cold, 
                and die. I would like you to step forward over here and peruse 
                some of the faces from the past. You've walked past them many 
                times, but I don't think you've really looked at them. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                They're not that different from you, are they? Same haircuts, 
                full of hormones just like you. Invincible just like you feel. 
                The world is their oyster. They believe they're destined for great 
                things, just like many of you. Their eyes are full of hope, just 
                like you. Did they wait until it was too late to make from their 
                lives even one iota of what they were capable? Because, you see, 
                gentlemen, those boys are now fertilizing daffodils. But if you 
                listen real close, you can hear them whisper their legacy to you. 
                Go on, lean in. Listen. Do you hear it? </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Carpe. Hear it? Carpe. Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your 
                lives extraordinary. </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                That was weird. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                But different. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Spooky if you ask me. </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                He'll test us on that stuff? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Oh, come on, Cameron. Don't you get anything? </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                What? What? TEACHER: Let's go, boys. Hustle up in here. That means 
                you, Dalton. </p>
              <p>MEEKS<br>
                All right, who's up for our study group tonight, guys? </p>
              <p>BOY 1<br>
                Sure. </p>
              <p>BOY 2<br>
                Me. </p>
              <p>BOY 3<br>
                Me, me, me. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Well, I can't make it, guys. I have to have dinner at the Danburrys' 
                house tonight. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Ooh, the Danburrys. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Who are the Danburrys? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Big alums! How'd you swing that? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Friends of my dad's. They're probably in their nineties or something. 
                Sounds great, doesn't it? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Anything's better than Hellton hash. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                I'll second that. </p>
              <p>MEEKS<br>
                Yeah, well, we'll see. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Hey! Want to come to the study group tonight? </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Uh, no. No. I've, I-I've got some history I wanna do. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Suit yourself. </p>
              <p>HABER<br>
                Ready, Overstreet? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Ready to go, sir. </p>
              <p>MRS. DANBURRY <br>
                Chet, can you get that? </p>
              <p>CHET<br>
                I can't, Mom. </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                I'll get it. </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                Can I help you? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Hi. K-Knox Overstreet. Uh, Dr. Hager. </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                Hi. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                This is the Danburrys', right? </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                Are, are you here to see Chet? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Mrs. Danburry? </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                No. </p>
              <p>MRS. DANBURRY<br>
                I'm sorry. Thank you, Chris. I'm Mrs. Danburry. You must be Knox. 
              </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Yes. </p>
              <p>MRS. DANBURRY<br>
                Back by nine? Please, come on in. </p>
              <p>CHET<br>
                Chris, come on. What are you doing? </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                Chet, I'm coming. </p>
              <p>MR. DANBURRY<br>
                Knox! How are you? Joe Danburry. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Nice to meet you, sir. </p>
              <p>MR. DANBURRY<br>
                Well, he's the spitting image of his father, isn't he? How is 
                he? Come on in. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                He's great. He just did a big case for G.M. </p>
              <p>MR. DANBURRY<br>
                Yeah, I know where you're headed. Like father, like son, huh? 
              </p>
              <p>BOY 1<br>
                Yes! </p>
              <p>BOY 2<br>
                Oh, sacrifice bishop to queen six. </p>
              <p>BOY 1<br>
                Another game? </p>
              <p>BOY 2<br>
                What do you mean?<br>
                <br>
                PITTS<br>
                Boo! </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                Replace, uh, these numbers here with X-- For X and Y. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Of course. </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                Of course. So what's the problem? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                How was dinner? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Huh? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                How was dinner? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Terrible. Awful. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                What? What happened? <br>
                KNOX<br>
                Tonight I met the most beautiful girl I have ever seen in my entire 
                life. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Are you crazy? What's wrong with that? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                She's practically engaged. To Chet Danburry. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                The guy could eat a football. </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                Too bad. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Too bad? It's worse than too bad, Pitts. It's a tragedy. A girl 
                this beautiful in love with such a jerk? </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                All the good ones go for jerks, you know that. </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                Yeah, forget her. Open your trig book and try and figure out problem 
                five. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                I can't just forget her, Cameron. And I certainly can't think 
                about trig! </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                We got it! </p>
              <p>HABER<br>
                All right, gentlemen, five minutes. Let's go. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Did you see her naked? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Very funny, Dalton. </p>
              <p>HABER<br>
                That wouldn't be a, uh, radio in your lap, wouldn't it, Mr. Pitts? 
              </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                No, sir. A science experiment. Radar. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Gentlemen, open your texts to page 21 of this introduction. Mr. 
                Perry, will you read the opening paragraph of the preface entitled 
                &amp;quot;Understanding Poetry&amp;quot;? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                &amp;quot;'Understanding Poetry,' by Dr. J. Evans Pritchard, Ph.D. 
                To fully understand poetry, we must first be fluent with its meter, 
                rhyme and figures of speech, then ask two questions: 1) How artfully 
                has the objective of the poem been rendered and 2) How important 
                is that objective? Question 1 rates the poem's perfection; question 
                2 rates its importance. And once these questions have been answered, 
                determining the poem's greatness becomes a relatively simple matter.&amp;quot; 
              </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                &amp;quot;If the poem's score for perfection is plotted on the 
                horizontal of a graph and its importance is plotted on the vertical, 
                then calculating the total area of the poem yields the measure 
                of its greatness.&amp;quot; </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                &amp;quot;A sonnet by Byron might score high on the vertical but 
                only average on the horizontal. A Shakespearean sonnet, on the 
                other hand, would score high both horizontally and vertically, 
                yielding a massive total area, thereby revealing the poem to be 
                truly great. As you proceed through the poetry in this book, practice 
                this rating method. As your ability to evaluate poems in this 
                matter grows, so will, so will your enjoyment and understanding 
                of poetry.&amp;quot; </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Excrement. That's what I think of Mr. J. Evans Pritchard. We're 
                not laying pipe. We're talking about poetry. How can you describe 
                poetry like American Bandstand? &amp;quot;Oh, I like Byron. I 
                give him a 42, but I can't dance to it.&amp;quot; Now, I want 
                you to rip out that page. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Go on. Rip out the entire page. You heard me. Rip it out. Rip 
                it out! Go on. Rip it out! </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Thank you, Mr. Dalton. Gentlemen, tell you what. Don't just tear 
                out that page, tear out the entire introduction. I want it gone. 
                History. Leave nothing of it. Rip it out! Rip! Be gone, J. Evans 
                Pritchard, Ph.D. Rip. Shred. Tear. Rip it out! I want to hear 
                nothing but ripping of Mr. Pritchard. We'll perforate it, put 
                it on a roll. It's not the Bible. You're not gonna go to hell 
                for this. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Go on. Make a clean tear. I want nothing left of it. </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                We shouldn't be doing this. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Rip! Rip! Rip! Rip it out! Rip! </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Rip it out! </p>
              <p>McALLISTER<br>
                What the hell is going on here? </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                I don't hear enough rips! </p>
              <p>McALLISTER<br>
                Mr. Keating. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Mr. McAllister. </p>
              <p>McALLISTER<br>
                I'm sorry. I, I didn't know you were here. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                I am. Ah. </p>
              <p>McALLISTER<br>
                So you are. Excuse me. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Keep ripping, gentlemen! This is a battle. A war. And the casualties 
                could be your hearts and souls. Thank you, Dalton. Armies of academics 
                going forward, measuring poetry. No! We'll not have that here. 
                No more Mr. J. Evans Pritchard. Now, my class, you will learn 
                to think for yourselves again. You will learn to savor words and 
                language. No matter what anybody tells you, words and ideas can 
                change the world. Now I see that look in Mr. Pitts' eye, like 
                19th-century literature has nothing to do with going to business 
                school or medical school. Right? Maybe. Mr. Hopkins, you may agree 
                with him, thinking, &amp;quot;Yes, we should simply study our 
                Mr. Pritchard and learn our rhyme and meter and go quietly about 
                the business of achieving other ambitions.&amp;quot; I've a little 
                secret for you. Huddle up. Huddle up! </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and 
                write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the 
                human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, 
                engineering -- these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain 
                life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love -- these are what we stay 
                alive for. To quote from Whitman O me! O life! of the question 
                of these recurring, Of the endless trains of the faithless, of 
                cities fill'd with the foolish... What good amid these O me, O 
                life? Answer That you are here--That life exists and identity, 
                That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse. 
              </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                &amp;quot;That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute 
                a verse.&amp;quot; What will your verse be? </p>
              <p>BOYS<br>
                For what we are about to receive, may the Lord make us truly grateful. 
                Amen.</p>

              Creak. He started walking around towards my left. Creak. Creak. 
              &amp;quot;Assume the position, Mr. Dalton.&amp;quot; 
              <p>KEATING<br>
                It's all right, gentlemen. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Mr. Keating. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Mr. Dalton. That was a pretty lame stunt you pulled today. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                You're siding with Mr. Nolan? What about Carpe diem and sucking 
                all the marrow out of life and all that? </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Sucking the marrow out of life doesn't mean choking on the bone. 
                Sure there's a time for daring and there's a time for caution, 
                and a wise man understands which is called for. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                But I thought you'd like that. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                No. You being expelled from school is not daring to me. It's stupid, 
                'cause you'll miss some golden opportunities. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Yeah. Like what? </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes. Got 
                it, Ace? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Aye, aye, Captain. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Keep your head about you. That goes for the lot of you. </p>
              <p>BOYS<br>
                Yes, Captain. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Phone call from God. If it had been collect, it wouldn't been 
                daring. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                All right. Go on, play. </p>
              <p>DIRECTOR<br>
                We're trying to rehearse, okay? Start. </p>
              <p>LYSANDER<br>
                A good persuasion, therefore hear me, Hermia. </p>
              <p>DIRECTOR<br>
                Wait, please. Excitement. I don't hear any excitement about this 
                play. And take her hand. Bring her down the stage and stop. And 
                &amp;quot;There, gentle Hermia.&amp;quot; Okay? Try again. </p>
              <p>BOY 1<br>
                What's for dinner? </p>
              <p>BOY 2<br>
                Spaghetti and meatballs! </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Save some for me. &amp;quot;But, room, Fairy! Here comes Oberon.&amp;quot;

              <p>NEIL<br>
                Father. </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                Neil. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Wait a minute. Before you say anything, please let me ex- </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                Don't you dare talk back to me! It's bad enough that you've wasted 
                your time with this, this absurd acting business. But you deliberately 
                deceived me! How, how, how did you expect to get away with this? 
                Answer me. Who put you up to it? Was it this new man? This, uh, 
                Mr. Keating? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                No. Nobody-- I thought I'd surprise you. I've gotten all A's in 
                every class. </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                Did you think I wasn't going to find out? &amp;quot;Oh, my niece 
                is in a play with your son,&amp;quot; says Mrs. Marks. &amp;quot;No, 
                no, no,&amp;quot; I say, &amp;quot;you must be mistaken. My son's 
                not in a play.&amp;quot; You made me a liar of me, Neil! Now, 
                tomorrow you go to them and you tell them that you're quitting. 
              </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                No, I can't. I have the main part. The performance is tomorrow 
                night. </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                I don't care if the world comes to an end tomorrow night. You 
                are through with that play. Is that clear? Is that clear? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Yes, sir. </p>
              <p>MR. PERRY<br>
                I made a great many sacrifices to get you here, Neil, and you 
                will not let me down. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                No, sir. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                It's open. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Neil, what's up? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Can I speak to you a minute? </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Certainly. Sit down. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                I'm sorry. Here. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Excuse me. Get you some tea? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Tea. Sure. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Like some milk or sugar in that? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                No, thanks. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Gosh, they don't give you much room around here. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                No, it's part of the monastic oath. They don't want worldly things 
                distracting me from my teaching. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                She's pretty. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                She's also in London. Makes it a little difficult. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                How can you stand it? </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Stand what? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                You can go anywhere. You can do anything. How can you stand being 
                here? </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                'Cause I love teaching. I don't wanna be anywhere else. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                What's up? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                I just talked to my father. He's making me quit the play at Henley 
                Hall. Acting's everything to me. I-- But he doesn't know. He-- 
                I can see his point. We're not a rich family like Charlie's, and 
                we-- But he's planning the rest of my life for me, and I-- H-He's 
                never asked me what I want. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Have you ever told your father what you just told me? About your 
                passion for acting. You ever show him that? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                I can't. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Why not? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                I can't talk to him this way. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Then you're acting for him, too. You're playing the part of the 
                dutiful son. I know this sounds impossible, but you have to talk 
                to him. You have to show him who you are, what your heart is. 
              </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                I know what he'll say. He'll tell me that acting's a whim, and 
                I should forget it. That how they're counting on me. He'll just 
                tell me to put it out of my mind, &amp;quot;for my own good.&amp;quot; 
              </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                You are not an indentured servant. If it's not a whim for you, 
                you prove it to him by your conviction and your passion. You show 
                him that And if he still doesn't believe you, well, by then you'll 
                be out of school and you can do anything you want. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                No. What about the play? The show's tomorrow night. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Well, you have to talk to him before tomorrow night. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Isn't there an easier way? </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                No. </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                I'm trapped. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                No, you're not. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Chris! </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Chris Noel. Do you know where she is? </p>
              <p>GIRL<br>
                Um, I think she's in room 111. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Thanks. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Excuse me. Chris. </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                Knox, what are you doing here? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                I came to apologize for the other night. I brought you these and 
                a poem I wrote for you. </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                Knox, don't you know that, if Chet finds you here he'll kill you? 
              </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                I can't care. I love you, Chris. </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                Knox, you're crazy. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Look, I acted like a jerk and I know it. Please, accept these. 
                Please. </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                No. No-- I, I can't. Forget it. </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                Knox, I don't believe this. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                All I'm asking you to do is listen. The heavens made a girl named 
                Chris With hair and skin of gold. To touch her would be paradise. 
              </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Get out of here. Cameron, you fool. Hey, how'd it go? Did you 
                read it to her? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Yeah. </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                What'd she say? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Nothing. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Nothing. But I did it. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                What did she say? I know she had to say something. </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                Come here, Knox. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Seize the day! </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Did you talk to your father? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Uh, he didn't like it one bit, but at least he's letting me stay 
                in the play. He won't be able to make, make it. He's in Chicago. 
                But, uh, I think he's gonna let me stay with acting. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Really? You told him what you told me? </p>
              <p>NEIL<br>
                Yeah. He wasn't happy. But he'll be gone at least four days. I 
                don't think he'll make the show, but I think he'll let me stay 
                with it. &amp;quot;Keep up the school work.&amp;quot; Thanks. 
              </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                Beautiful baby. </p>
              <p>MEEKS<br>
                Beautiful baby. Henley Hall, here I come. </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                Excuse me, just a moment. Yes. You're so cute. Come on, Todd. 
                I'm trying to fix this. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Come on, Nuwanda. You're gonna miss Neil's entrance. </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                He said something about getting red before we left. </p>
              <p>CAMERON<br>
                Getting red? What does that mean? </p>
              <p>PITTS<br>
                I, uh-- Well, you know Charlie. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                So, Charlie, what's this &amp;quot;getting red&amp;quot; bit? 
              </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                W-What is that? </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                It's an Indian warrior symbol for virility. Makes me feel potent, 
                like it can drive girls crazy. </p>
              <p>TODD<br>
                Oh, come on, Charlie. The girls are waiting. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Chris. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                What are you doing here? </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Gentlemen, let's go. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Go ahead, guys. I'll catch up. </p>
              <p>CHARLIE<br>
                Yeah, come on, guys. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Chris, you can't be in here. I-If they catch you, we're both gonna 
                be in big trouble. </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                Oh, but it's fine-- </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                It's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete 
                fool out of me? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                I don't mean to make a fool out of you. </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                Well, you did. Chet found out. And it took everything I could 
                do to keep him from coming here and killing you. Knox, you have 
                got to stop this stuff. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                I can't, Chris. I love you. </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                Knox, you say that over and over. You don't, you don't even know 
                me. </p>
              <p>KEATING<br>
                Will you be joining us, Mr. Overstreet? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Go ahead, Captain. I'll walk. </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                Knox, Knox, it just so happens that I could care less about you? 
              </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet. </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                I have to go. I'm gonna be late for the play. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Are you going with him? </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                Chet? To a play? Are you kidding? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Then come with me. </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                Knox, you are so infuriating. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Come on, Chris. Just give me one chance. If you don't like me 
                after tonight, I'll stay away forever. </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                Uh-huh. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                I promise. Dead Poets Honor. You come with me tonight. And then, 
                if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out. <br>
                CHRIS<br>
                You know what would happen if Chet found out? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                He won't know anything. We'll sit in the back and sneak away as 
                soon as it's over. </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                And I suppose you would promise that this would be the end of 
                it. </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                Dead Poets Honor. </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                What is that? </p>
              <p>KNOX<br>
                My word. </p>
              <p>CHRIS<br>
                You are so infuriating. </p>

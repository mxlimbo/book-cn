              <p><br>
                On the day of the wedding, according to the Russian custom (the 
                Princess and Darya Alexandrovna insisted on strictly keeping all 
                the customs), Levin did not see his betrothed, and dined at his 
                hotel with three bachelor friends, casually brought together at 
                his rooms. These were Sergei Ivanovich, Katavassov, a university 
                friend, now professor of natural science, whom Levin had met in 
                the street and insisted on taking home with him, and Chirikov, 
                his best man, a Moscow justice of the peace, Levin's companion 
                in his bear hunts. The dinner was a very merry one: Sergei Ivanovich 
                was in his happiest mood, and was much amused by Katavassov's 
                originality. Katavassov, feeling his originality was appreciated 
                and understood, made the most of it. Chirikov always gave a lively 
                and good-humored support to conversation of any sort. </p>
              <p>`See, now,' said Katavassov, drawling his words from a habit 
                acquired in the lecture room, `what a capable fellow was our friend 
                Konstantin Dmitrievich. I'm speaking of absent company - he doesn't 
                exist for us now. At the time he left the university he was fond 
                of science, took an interest in humanity; now one-half of his 
                abilities is devoted to deceiving himself, and the other to justifying 
                the deceit.' </p>
              <p> `A more determined enemy of matrimony than you I never saw,' 
                said Sergei Ivanovich. </p>
              <p> `Oh, no, I'm not an enemy of matrimony. I'm in favor of division 
                of labor. People who can do nothing else ought to rear people, 
                while the rest work for their happiness and enlightenment. That's 
                how I look at it. To muddle up two trades there are too many amateurs; 
                I'm not one of their number.' </p>
              <p> `How happy I shall be when I hear that you're in love!' said 
                Levin. `Please invite me to the wedding.' </p>
              <p> `I'm in love now.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, with a cuttlefish! You know,' Levin turned to his brother, 
                `Mikhail Semionovich is writing a work on the digestive organs 
                of the...' </p>
              <p> `Now, make a muddle of it! It doesn't matter what about. And 
                the fact is, I certainly do love cuttlefish.' </p>
              <p> `But that's no hindrance to your loving your wife.' </p>
              <p> `The cuttlefish is no hindrance. The wife is the hindrance.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Why so?' </p>
              <p> `Oh, you'll see! You care about farming, hunting - well, you'll 
                see!...' </p>
              <p> `Arkhip was here today; he said there were no end of elk in 
                Prudnoe, and two bears,' said Chirikov. </p>
              <p> `Well, you must go and get them without me.' </p>
              <p> `Ah, that's the truth,' said Sergei Ivanovich. `And you may 
                say good-by to bear hunting for the future - your wife won't allow 
                it!' </p>
              <p> Levin smiled. The picture of his wife not letting him go was 
                so pleasant that he was ready to renounce forever the delights 
                of looking upon bears. </p>
              <p> `Still, it's a pity they should get those two bears without 
                you. Do you remember last time at Khapilovo? And now it would 
                be a delightful hunt!' said Chirikov. </p>
              <p> Levin had not the heart to disillusion him of the notion that 
                there could be something delightful apart from her, and so said 
                nothing. </p>
              <p> `There's some sense in this custom of saying good-by to bachelor 
                life,' said Sergei Ivanovich. `However happy you may be, you must 
                regret your freedom.' </p>
              <p> `And confess there is a feeling that you want to jump out of 
                the window, like Gogol's bridegroom?' </p>
              <p> `Of course there is, but he won't confess,' said Katavassov, 
                and he broke into loud laughter. </p>
              <p> `Oh, well, the window's open.... Let's start off this instant 
                to Tver! There's a big she-bear; one can go right up to the lair. 
                Seriously, let's go by the five o'clock! And here let them do 
                what they like,' said Chirikov smiling. </p>
              <p> `Well, now, on my honor,' said Levin smiling, `I can't find 
                in my heart that feeling of regret for my freedom.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, there's such a chaos in your heart just now that you can't 
                find anything there,' said Katavassov. `Wait a bit, when you set 
                it to rights a little, you'll find it!' </p>
              <p> `No; if so, I should have felt a little, apart from my feeling' 
                (he could not say `love' before them) `and happiness, a certain 
                regret at losing my freedom.... On the contrary, I am glad at 
                the very loss of my freedom.' </p>
              <p> `Awful! It's a hopeless case!' said Katavassov. `Well, let's 
                drink to his recovery, or wish that a hundredth part of his dreams 
                may be realized - and that would be happiness such as never has 
                been seen on earth!' </p>
              <p> Soon after dinner the guests went away to dress in time for 
                the wedding. </p>
              <p> When he was left alone, and recalled the conversation of these 
                bachelor friends, Levin asked himself: Had he in his heart that 
                regret for his freedom of which they had spoken? He smiled at 
                the question. `Freedom! What is freedom for? Happiness is only 
                in loving and wishing her wishes, thinking her thoughts; that 
                is to say, not freedom at all - that's happiness!' </p>
              <p> `But do I know her thoughts, her wishes, her feelings?' some 
                voice suddenly whispered to him. The smile died away from his 
                face, and he grew thoughtful. And suddenly a strange feeling came 
                upon him. There came over him a dread and doubt - doubt of everything. 
              </p>
              <p> `What if she does not love me? What if she's marrying me simply 
                to be married? What if she doesn't see herself what she's doing?' 
                he asked himself. `She may come to her senses, and only when she 
                is being married realize that she does not and cannot love me.' 
                And strange, most evil thoughts of her began to come to him. He 
                was jealous of Vronsky, as he had been a year ago, as though the 
                evening he had seen her with Vronsky had been yesterday. He suspected 
                she had not told him everything. </p>
              <p> He jumped up quickly. `No, this can't go on!' he said to himself 
                in despair. `I'll go to her; I'll ask her; I'll say for the last 
                time: We are free, and hadn't we better stay so? Anything's better 
                than endless misery, disgrace, unfaithfulness!' With despair in 
                his heart and bitter anger against all men, against himself, against 
                her, he went out of the hotel and drove to her house. </p>
              <p> He found her in one of the rear rooms. She was sitting on a 
                chest and making some arrangements with her maid, sorting over 
                heaps of dresses of different colors, spread on the backs of chairs 
                and on the floor. </p>
              <p> `Ah!' she cried, seeing him, and beaming with delight. `Kostia! 
                Konstantin Dmitrievich!' (These latter days she used these names 
                almost alternately.) `I didn't expect you! I'm going through my 
                girlish wardrobe to see what's for whom....' </p>
              <p> `Oh! That's very lovely!' he said gloomily, looking at the maid. 
              </p>
              <p> `You can go, Duniasha, I'll call you presently,' said Kitty. 
                `Kostia, what's the matter?' she asked, definitely adopting this 
                familiar name as soon as the maid had gone out. She noticed his 
                strange face, agitated and gloomy, and a panic came over her. 
              </p>
              <p> `Kitty! I'm in torture. I can't be in torture alone,' he said 
                with despair in his voice, standing before her and looking imploringly 
                into her eyes. He saw already from her loving, truthful face, 
                that nothing could come of what he had meant to say, but yet he 
                wanted her to reassure him herself. `I've come to say that there's 
                still time. This can all be stopped and set right.' </p>
              <p> `What? I don't understand. What is the matter?' </p>
              <p> `What I have said a thousand times over, and can't help thinking... 
                that I'm not worthy of you. You couldn't consent to marry me. 
                Think a little. You've made a mistake. Think it over thoroughly. 
                You can't love me... if... Better say so,' he said, without looking 
                at her. `I shall be wretched. Let people say what they like; anything's 
                better than misery.... Far better now while there's still time....' 
              </p>
              <p> `I don't understand,' she answered, panic-stricken; `you mean 
                you want to give it up... that you don't want it?' </p>
              <p> `Yes - if you don't love me.' </p>
              <p> `You're out of your mind!' she cried, turning crimson with vexation. 
                But his face was so piteous that she restrained her vexation, 
                and flinging some clothes off an armchair, she sat down beside 
                him. `What are you thinking? Tell me all.' </p>
              <p> `I am thinking you can't love me. What can you love me for?' 
              </p>
              <p> `My God! What can I do?...' she said, and burst into tears. 
              </p>
              <p> `Oh! What have I done?' he cried, and kneeling before her, he 
                fell to kissing her hands. </p>
              <p> When the old Princess came into the room five minutes later, 
                she found them completely reconciled. Kitty had not simply assured 
                him that she loved him, but had gone so far - in answer to his 
                question, what she loved him for - as to explain what for. She 
                told him that she loved him because she understood him completely, 
                because she knew what he would like, and because everything he 
                liked was good. And this seemed to him perfectly clear. When the 
                Princess came to them, they were sitting side by side on the chest, 
                sorting the dresses and disputing over Kitty's wanting to give 
                Duniasha the brown dress she had been wearing when Levin proposed 
                to her, while he insisted that that dress must never be given 
                away, but that Duniasha should have the blue one. </p>
              <p> `How is it you don't see? She's a brunette, and it won't suit 
                her.... I've worked it all out.' </p>
              <p> Hearing why he had come, the Princess was half-humorously, half-seriously 
                angry with him, and sent him home to dress and not to hinder Kitty's 
                hairdressing, as Charles the coiffeur was just coming. </p>
              <p> `As it is, she's been eating nothing lately and is losing her 
                looks, and then you must come and upset her with your nonsense,' 
                she said to him. `Get along with you, my dear!' </p>
              <p> Levin, guilty and shamefaced, but pacified, went back to his 
                hotel. His brother, Darya Alexandrovna, and Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                all in full dress, were waiting for him to bless him with an icon. 
                There was no time to lose. Darya Alexandrovna had to drive home 
                again to fetch her curled and pomaded son, who was to carry the 
                icon in the bride's carriage. Then a carriage had to be sent for 
                the best man, and another, that would take Sergei Ivanovich away, 
                would have to be sent back.... Altogether there were a great many 
                most complicated matters to be considered and arranged. One thing 
                was unmistakable - that there must be no delay, as it was already 
                half-past six. </p>
              <p> Nothing special happened at the ceremony of benediction with 
                the icon. Stepan Arkadyevich stood in a comically solemn pose 
                beside his wife, took the icon, and, telling Levin to bow down 
                to the ground, he blessed him with his kindly, ironical smile, 
                and kissed him three times; Darya Alexandrovna did the same, and 
                immediately was in a hurry to get off, and again plunged into 
                the intricate question of the due order of the various carriages. 
              </p>
              <p> `Come, I'll tell you how we'll manage: you drive in our carriage 
                to fetch him, and Sergei Ivanovich, if he'll be so good, will 
                drive there and then send his carriage.' </p>
              <p> `Of course; I shall be delighted.' </p>
              <p> `We'll come on directly with him. Are your things sent off?' 
                asked Stepan Arkadyevich. </p>
              <p> `Yes,' answered Levin, and he told Kouzma to lay out his clothes 
                for him to dress. </p>

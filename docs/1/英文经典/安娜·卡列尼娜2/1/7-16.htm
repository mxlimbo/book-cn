              <p><br>
                At ten o'clock the old Prince, Sergei Ivanovich, and Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                were sitting at Levin's. Having inquired after Kitty, they had 
                dropped into conversation upon other subjects. Levin heard them, 
                and unconsciously, as they talked, going over the past, over what 
                they had been up to that morning, he thought of himself as he 
                had been yesterday till that point. It was as though a hundred 
                years had passed since then. He felt himself exalted to unattainable 
                heights, from which he studiously lowered himself so as not to 
                wound the people he was talking to. He talked, and was all the 
                time thinking of his wife, of her present condition, of his son, 
                in whose existence he tried to school himself into believing. 
                The whole world of woman, which had taken for him since his marriage 
                a new value he had never suspected before, was now so exalted 
                that his imagination could not embrace it. He heard them talk 
                of yesterday's dinner at the club, and thought: `What is happening 
                with her now? Is she asleep? How is she? What is she thinking 
                of? Is he crying - my son Dmitrii?' And in the middle of the conversation, 
                in the middle of a sentence, he jumped up and went out of the 
                room. </p>
              <p>`Send me word if I can see her,' said the Prince. </p>
              <p> `Very well, in a minute,' answered Levin, and without stopping, 
                he went to her room. </p>
              <p> She was not asleep, she was talking gently with her mother, 
                making plans about the christening. </p>
              <p> Carefully set to rights, with hair well brushed, in a smart 
                little cap with some blue in it, her arms out on the quilt, she 
                was lying on her back. Meeting his eyes, her eyes drew him to 
                her. Her face, bright before, brightened still more as he drew 
                near her. There was the same change in it from earthly to unearthly 
                that is seen in the face of the dead. But there it means farewell 
                - here it meant welcome. Again a rush of emotion, such as he had 
                felt at the moment of the child's birth, flooded his heart. She 
                took his hand and asked him if he had slept. He could not answer, 
                and turned away, realizing his weakness. </p>
              <p> `I have had a nap, Kostia!' she said to him. `And I am so comfortable 
                now.' </p>
              <p> She looked at him, but suddenly her expression changed. </p>
              <p> `Give him to me,' she said, hearing the baby's cry. `Give him 
                to me, Lizaveta Petrovna, and he shall look at him.' </p>
              <p> `To be sure, his papa shall look at him,' said Lizaveta Petrovna, 
                getting up and bringing something red, and queer and wriggling. 
                `Wait a minute, we'll array ourselves first,' and Lizaveta Petrovna 
                laid the red wobbling thing on the bed, began untrussing and trussing 
                up the baby, lifting it up and turning it over with one finger 
                and powdering it with something. </p>
              <p> Levin, looking at the tiny, pitiful creature, made strenuous 
                efforts to discover in his heart some traces of fatherly feeling 
                for it. He felt nothing toward it but disgust. But when it was 
                undressed and he caught a glimpse of wee, wee, little hands, little 
                feet, saffron-colored, with little toes, too; and even with a 
                little big toe different from the rest, and when he saw Lizaveta 
                Petrovna closing the wide-open little hands, as though they were 
                soft springs, and putting them into linen garments, such pity 
                for the little creature came upon him, and such terror that she 
                would hurt it, that he held her hand back. </p>
              <p> Lizaveta Petrovna laughed. </p>
              <p> `Don't be frightened, don't be frightened!' </p>
              <p> When the baby had been arrayed and transformed into a solid 
                doll, Lizaveta Petrovna dandled it as though proud of her handiwork, 
                and stood a little away so that Levin might see his son in all 
                his glory. </p>
              <p> Kitty looked sideways in the same direction, never taking her 
                eyes off the baby. `Give him to me! Give him to me!' she said, 
                and even made as though she would sit up. </p>
              <p> `What are you thinking of, Katerina Alexandrovna, you mustn't 
                move like that! Wait a minute. I'll give him to you. Here we're 
                showing papa what a fine fellow we are!' </p>
              <p> And Lizaveta Petrovna, with one hand supporting the wobbling 
                head, lifted up on the other arm the strange, limp, red creature, 
                whose head was lost in its swaddling clothes. But it had a nose, 
                too, and slanting eyes, and smacking lips. </p>
              <p> `A splendid baby!' said Lizaveta Petrovna. </p>
              <p> Levin sighed with mortification. This splendid baby excited 
                in him no feeling but disgust and compassion. It was not at all 
                the feeling he had looked forward to. </p>
              <p> He turned away while Lizaveta Petrovna put the baby to the unaccustomed 
                breast. </p>
              <p> Suddenly laughter made him look round. The baby had taken the 
                breast. </p>
              <p> `Come that's enough, that's enough!' said Lizaveta Petrovna, 
                but Kitty would not let the baby go. He fell asleep in her arms. 
              </p>
              <p> `Look, now,' said Kitty, turning the baby so that he could see 
                it. The aged-looking little face suddenly puckered up still more, 
                and the baby sneezed. </p>
              <p> Smiling, hardly able to restrain his tears, Levin kissed his 
                wife and went out of the dark room. </p>
              <p> What he felt toward this little creature was utterly unlike 
                what he had expected. There was nothing cheerful and joyous in 
                the feeling; on the contrary, it was a new torture of apprehension. 
                It was the consciousness of a new sphere of liability to pain. 
                And this sense was so painful at first, the apprehension lest 
                this helpless creature should suffer was so intense, that it prevented 
                him from noticing the strange thrill of senseless joy and even 
                pride that he had felt when the baby had sneezed. </p>

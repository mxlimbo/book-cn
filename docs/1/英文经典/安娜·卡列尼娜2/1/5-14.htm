              <p><br>
                Levin had been married two months. He was happy, but not at all 
                in the way he had expected to be. At every step he found disenchantment 
                in his former dreams, and new, unexpected enchantment. He was 
                happy; but on entering upon family life he saw at every step that 
                it was utterly different from what he had imagined. At every step 
                he experienced what a man would experience who, after admiring 
                the smooth, happy course of a little boat on a lake, should get 
                himself into that little boat. He saw that it was not all sitting 
                still, and floating smoothly; that one had to think too, not for 
                an instant forgetting where one was floating; and that there was 
                water under one, and that one must row; and that his unaccustomed 
                hands would be sore; and that it was only easy to look at; but 
                that doing it, though very delightful was very difficult. <br>
                As a bachelor, when he had watched other people's married life, 
                had seen the petty cares, the squabbles, the jealousy, he had 
                only smiled contemptuously in his heart. In his future married 
                life there could be, he was convinced, nothing of that sort; even 
                the external forms, indeed, he fancied, must be utterly unlike 
                the life of others in everything. And all of a sudden, instead 
                of his life with his wife being made on an individual pattern, 
                it was, on the contrary, entirely made up of the pettiest details, 
                which he had so despised before, but which now, by no will of 
                his own, had gained an extraordinary and indisputable importance. 
                And Levin saw that the organization of all these details was by 
                no means so easy as he had fancied before. Although Levin believed 
                himself to have the most exact conceptions of domestic life, unconsciously, 
                like all men, he pictured domestic life only as enjoyment of love, 
                with nothing to hinder and no petty cares to distract. He ought, 
                as he conceived the position, to do his work, and to find repose 
                from it in the happiness of love. She ought to be beloved, and 
                nothing more. But, like all men, he forgot that she too would 
                want work. And he was surprised that she, his poetic, exquisite 
                Kitty, could not merely in the first weeks, but even in the first 
                days of their married life, think, remember, and busy herself 
                about tablecloths, and furniture, about mattresses for visitors, 
                about a tray, about the cook, and the dinner, and so on. While 
                they were still engaged, he had been struck by the definiteness 
                with which she had declined the tour abroad and decided to go 
                into the country, as though she knew of something she wanted, 
                and could still think of something outside her love. This had 
                jarred upon him then, and now her trivial cares and anxieties 
                jarred upon him several times. But he saw that this was essential 
                for her. And, loving her as he did, though he did not understand 
                the reason for them, and jeered at these domestic pursuits, he 
                could not help admiring them. He jeered at the way in which she 
                arranged the furniture they had brought from Moscow; rearranged 
                their rooms; hung up curtains; prepared rooms for visitors, and 
                for Dolly; saw after an abode for her new maid; ordered dinner 
                of the old cook; came into collision with Agathya Mikhailovna, 
                taking from her the charge of the stores. He saw how the old cook 
                smiled, admiring her, and listening to her inexperienced, impossible 
                orders; how mournfully and tenderly Agathya Mikhailovna shook 
                her head over the young mistress's new arrangements in the pantry. 
                He saw that Kitty was extraordinarily sweet when, laughing and 
                crying, she came to tell him that her maid, Masha, was used to 
                looking upon her as her young lady, and so no one obeyed her. 
                It seemed to him sweet, but strange, and he thought it would have 
                been better without this. </p>
              <p> He did not know how great a sense of change she was experiencing; 
                she, who at home had sometimes wanted some pickled cabbage, or 
                sweets, without the possibility of getting either, now could order 
                what she liked, buy pounds of sweets, spend as much money as she 
                liked, and order any cakes she pleased. </p>
              <p> She was dreaming with delight now of Dolly's coming to them 
                with her children, especially because she would order for the 
                children their favorite cakes, and Dolly would appreciate all 
                her new housekeeping. She did not know herself why and wherefore, 
                but the arranging of her house had an irresistible attraction 
                for her. Instinctively feeling the approach of spring, and knowing 
                that there would be days of rough weather too, she built her nest 
                as best she could, and was in haste at the same time to build 
                and to learn how to do it. </p>
              <p> This care for domestic details in Kitty, so opposed to Levin's 
                ideal of exalted happiness, was at first one of the disenchantments; 
                and this sweet care of her household, the aim of which he did 
                not understand, but could not help loving, was one of the new 
                enchantments. </p>
              <p> Another disenchantment and enchantment consisted of their quarrels. 
                Levin could never have conceived that between him and his wife 
                any relations could arise other than tender, respectful and loving, 
                and all at once, in the very early days, they quarreled, so that 
                she said he did not care for her, that he cared for no one but 
                himself, burst into tears, and waved her hands. </p>
              <p> This first quarrel arose from Levin's having gone out to a new 
                grange and having been away half an hour too long, because he 
                had tried to get home by a short cut and had lost his way. He 
                drove home thinking of nothing but her, of her love, of his own 
                happiness, and, the nearer he drew to home, the warmer was his 
                tenderness for her. He ran into the room with the same feeling, 
                with an even stronger feeling, than he had had when he reached 
                the Shcherbatskys' house to propose. And suddenly he was met by 
                a lowering expression he had never seen in her. He would have 
                kissed her, she pushed him away. </p>
              <p> `What is it?' </p>
              <p> `You've been enjoying yourself...' she began, trying to be calm 
                and spiteful. </p>
              <p> But as soon as she opened her mouth, she burst into a stream 
                of reproach, of senseless jealousy, of all that had been torturing 
                her during that half-hour which she had spent sitting motionless 
                at the window. It was only then, for the first time, that he clearly 
                understood what he had not understood when he led her out of the 
                church after the wedding. He felt now that he was not simply close 
                to her, but that he did not know where he ended and she began. 
                He felt this from the agonizing sensation of division that he 
                experienced at that instant. He was offended for the first instant, 
                but the very same second he felt that he could not be offended 
                by her, that she was himself. He felt for the first moment as 
                a man feels when, having suddenly received a violent blow from 
                behind, he turns round, angry and eager to avenge himself, to 
                look for his antagonist, and finds that it is he himself who has 
                accidentally struck himself, that there is no one to be angry 
                with, and that he must put up with and try to soothe the pain. 
              </p>
              <p> Never afterward did he feel it with such intensity, but this 
                first time he could not for a long while get over it. His natural 
                feeling urged him to defend himself, to prove to her she was wrong; 
                but to prove her wrong would mean irritating her still more and 
                making the rupture greater that was the cause of all his suffering. 
                One habitual feeling impelled him to get rid of the blame and 
                to pass it on her; another feeling, even stronger, impelled him 
                as quickly as possible to smooth over the rupture without letting 
                it grow greater. To remain under such undeserved reproach was 
                wretched, but to make her suffer by justifying himself was worse 
                still. Like a man half-awake in an agony of pain, he wanted to 
                tear out, to fling away the seat of pain, and, coming to his senses, 
                he felt that the seat of pain was himself. He could do nothing 
                but try to help the seat of pain bear it, and this he tried to 
                do. </p>
              <p> They made peace. She, recognizing that she was wrong, though 
                she did not say so, became tenderer to him, and they experienced 
                new, redoubled happiness in their love. But that did not prevent 
                such quarrels from happening again, and exceedingly often too, 
                on the most unexpected and trivial grounds. These quarrels frequently 
                arose from the fact that they did not yet know what was of importance 
                to each, and that all this early period they were both often in 
                a bad temper. When one was in a good temper, and the other in 
                a bad temper, the peace was not broken; but when both happened 
                to be in an ill-humor, quarrels sprang up from such incomprehensibly 
                trifling causes that they could never remember afterward what 
                they had quarreled about. It is true that when they were both 
                in a good temper their enjoyment of life was redoubled. But still 
                this first period of their married life was a difficult time for 
                them. </p>
              <p> During all this early period they had a peculiarly vivid sense 
                of tension, as it were, a tugging in opposite directions of the 
                chain by which they were bound. Altogether their honeymoon - that 
                is to say, the month after their wedding - from which, through 
                tradition, Levin had expected so much, was not merely not a time 
                of sweetness, but remained in the memories of both as the bitterest 
                and most humiliating period in their lives. They both alike tried 
                in later life to blot out from their memories all the monstrous, 
                shameful incidents of that morbid period, when both were rarely 
                in a normal frame of mind, when both were rarely quite themselves. 
              </p>
              <p> It was only in the third month of their married life, after 
                their return from Moscow, where they had been staying for a month, 
                that their life began to go more smoothly. </p>

              <p><br>
                Getting up from the table, Levin walked with Gaghin through the 
                lofty rooms to the billiard room, feeling his arms swing as he 
                walked with a peculiar lightness and ease. As he crossed the big 
                room, he came upon his father-in-law. </p>
              <p>`Well, how do you like our Temple of Indolence?' said the Prince, 
                taking his arm. `Come along, come along!' </p>
              <p> `Yes, I wanted to walk about and look at everything. It's interesting.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, it's interesting for you. But its interest for me is quite 
                different. You look at such little ancients, now,' he said, pointing 
                to a club member with bent back and pendulous lip, shuffling toward 
                them in his soft boots, `and imagine that they were shlupiks like 
                that from their birth up.' </p>
              <p> `Shlupiks?' </p>
              <p> `I see you don't know that name. That's our club designation. 
                You know the game of rolling eggs: when one's rolled a long while 
                it becomes a shlupik. So it is with us; one goes on coming and 
                coming to the club, and ends by becoming a shlupik. Ah, you laugh! 
                but we look out, for fear of dropping into it ourselves. You know 
                Prince Chechensky?' inquired the Prince; and Levin saw by his 
                face that he was just going to relate something funny. </p>
              <p> `No, I don't know him.' </p>
              <p> `You don't say so! Well, Prince Chechensky is a well-known figure. 
                No matter, though. He's always playing billiards here. Only three 
                years ago he was not a shlupik, and kept up his spirits, and even 
                used to call other people shlupiks. But one day he turns up, and 
                our porter... You know Vassilii? Why, that fat one; he's famous 
                for his bons mots. And so Prince Chechensky asks him, ``Come, 
                Vassilii who's here? Any shlupiks here yet?' And he says: ``You're 
                the third.' Yes, my dear boy, that he did!' </p>
              <p> Talking and greeting the friends they met, Levin and the Prince 
                walked through all the rooms: the great room where tables had 
                already been set, and the usual partners were playing for small 
                stakes; the divan room, where they were playing chess, and Sergei 
                Ivanovich was sitting talking to somebody; the billiard room, 
                where, about the sofa in a recess, there was a lively party drinking 
                champagne - Gaghin was one of them. They peeped into the `infernal 
                regions,' where a good many men were crowding round one table, 
                at which Iashvin was sitting. Trying not to make a noise, they 
                walked into the dark reading room, where under the shaded lamps 
                there sat a young man with a wrathful countenance, turning over 
                one journal after another, and a bald general buried in a book. 
                They went, too, into what the Prince called the intellectual room, 
                where three gentlemen were engaged in a heated discussion of the 
                latest political news. </p>
              <p> `Prince, please come, we're ready,' said one of his card party, 
                who had come to look for him, and the Prince went off. Levin sat 
                down and listened, but recalling all the conversation of the morning 
                he felt all of a sudden fearfully bored. He got up hurriedly, 
                and went to look for Oblonsky and Turovtsin, with whom it had 
                been so pleasant. </p>
              <p> Turovtsin was one of the circle drinking in the billiard room, 
                and Stepan Arkadyevich was talking with Vronsky near the door 
                at the farther corner of the room. </p>
              <p> `It's not that she's dull; but this undefined, this unsettled 
                position,' Levin caught, and he was going to hurry away, but Stepan 
                Arkadyevich called him. </p>
              <p> `Levin!' said Stepan Arkadyevich; and Levin noticed that his 
                eyes were not full of tears exactly, but moist, which always happened 
                when he had been drinking, or when he was touched. Today it was 
                due to both causes. `Levin, don't go,' he said, and he warmly 
                squeezed his arm above the elbow, obviously not at all wishing 
                to let him go. </p>
              <p> `This is a true friend of mine - almost my greatest friend,' 
                he said to Vronsky. `You also are still closer and dearer to me. 
                And I want you, and I know you ought, to be friends, and great 
                friends, because you're both splendid fellows.' </p>
              <p> `Well, there's nothing for us now but to kiss and be friends,' 
                Vronsky said, with good-natured playfulness, holding out his hand. 
              </p>
              <p> Levin quickly took the offered hand, and squeezed it warmly. 
              </p>
              <p> `I'm very, very glad,' said Levin. </p>
              <p> `Waiter, a bottle of champagne,' said Stepan Arkadyevich. </p>
              <p> `And I'm very glad,' said Vronsky. </p>
              <p> But in spite of Stepan Arkadyevich's desire, and their own desire, 
                they had nothing to talk about, and both felt it. </p>
              <p> `Do you know, he has never met Anna?' Stepan Arkadyevich said 
                to Vronsky. `And I want above everything to take him to see her. 
                Let us go, Levin!' </p>
              <p> `Really?' said Vronsky. `She will be very glad to see you. I 
                should be going home at once,' he added, `but I'm worried about 
                Iashvin, and I want to stay on till he finishes.' </p>
              <p> `Why, is he losing?' </p>
              <p> `He keeps losing, and I'm the only friend that can restrain 
                him.' </p>
              <p> `Well, what do you say to pyramids? Levin, will you play? Capital!' 
                said Stepan Arkadyevich. `Get the table ready,' he said to the 
                marker. </p>
              <p> `It has been ready a long while,' answered the marker, who had 
                already set the balls in a triangle, and was knocking the red 
                one about for his own diversion. </p>
              <p> `Well, let us begin.' </p>
              <p> After the game Vronsky and Levin sat down at Gaghin's table, 
                and at Stepan Arkadyevich's suggestion Levin took a hand in the 
                game. Vronsky sat down at the table, surrounded by friends, who 
                were incessantly coming up to him. Every now and then he went 
                to the `infernal' to keep an eye on Iashvin. Levin was enjoying 
                a delightful sense of repose after the mental fatigue of the morning. 
                He was glad that all hostility was at an end with Vronsky, and 
                the sense of peace, decorum and comfort never left him. </p>
              <p> When the game was over, Stepan Arkadyevich took Levin's arm. 
              </p>
              <p> `Well, let us go to Anna's, then. At once? Eh? She is at home. 
                I promised her long ago to bring you. Where were you intending 
                to spend the evening?' </p>
              <p> `Oh, nowhere specially. I promised Sviiazhsky to go to the Society 
                of Agriculture. By all means, let us go,' said Levin. </p>
              <p> `Very good; come along. Find out if my carriage is here,' Stepan 
                Arkadyevich said to the waiter. </p>
              <p> Levin went up to the table, paid the forty roubles he had lost; 
                paid his bill, the amount of which was in some mysterious way 
                ascertained by the little old waiter who stood at the counter, 
                and, swinging his arms, he walked through all the rooms to the 
                exit. </p>

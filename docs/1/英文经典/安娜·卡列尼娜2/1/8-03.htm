              <p><br>
                Having said good-by to the Princess, Sergei Ivanovich was joined 
                by Katavassov; together they got into a carriage full to overflowing, 
                and the train started. </p>
              <p>At Czaritsino station the train was met by a chorus of young 
                men singing `Hail to Thee!' Again the volunteers bowed and poked 
                their heads out, but Sergei Ivanovich paid no attention to them. 
                He had had so much to do with the volunteers that the type was 
                familiar to him and did not interest him. Katavassov, whose scientific 
                work had prevented his having a chance of observing them hitherto, 
                was very much interested in them and questioned Sergei Ivanovich. 
              </p>
              <p> Sergei Ivanovich advised him to go into the second class and 
                talk to them himself. At the next station Katavassov acted on 
                this suggestion. </p>
              <p> At the first stop he moved into the second class and made the 
                acquaintance of the volunteers. They were sitting in a corner 
                of the carriage, talking loudly and obviously aware that the attention 
                of the passengers, and of Katavassov, as he got in, was concentrated 
                upon them. More loudly than all talked the tall, hollow-chested 
                young man. He was unmistakably tipsy, and was relating some story 
                that had occurred at his school. Facing him sat a middle-aged 
                officer in the Austrian military jacket of the Guards' uniform. 
                He was listening with a smile to the hollow-chested youth, and 
                occasionally pulling him up. The third, in an artillery uniform, 
                was sitting on a portmanteau beside them. A fourth was asleep. 
              </p>
              <p> Entering into conversation with the youth, Katavassov learned 
                that he was a wealthy Moscow merchant who had run through a large 
                fortune before he was two-and-twenty. Katavassov did not like 
                him, because he was unmanly and effeminate and sickly. He was 
                obviously convinced, especially now after drinking, that he was 
                performing a heroic action, and he bragged of it in the most unpleasant 
                way. </p>
              <p> The second, the retired officer, made an unpleasant impression 
                too upon Katavassov. He was, it seemed, a man who had tried everything. 
                He had been on a railway, had been a land steward, and had started 
                factories, and he talked, quite without necessity, of everything, 
                and used learned expressions quite inappropriately. </p>
              <p> The third, the artilleryman, on the contrary, struck Katavassov 
                very favorably. He was a quiet, modest fellow, unmistakably impressed 
                by the knowledge of the officer and the heroic self-sacrifice 
                of the merchant, and saying nothing about himself. When Katavassov 
                asked him what had impelled him to go to Servia, he answered modestly: 
              </p>
              <p> `Oh, well, everyone's going. The Servians want help, too. I'm 
                sorry for them.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, you artillerymen are especially scarce there,' said Katavassov. 
              </p>
              <p> `Oh, I wasn't long in the artillery; maybe they'll put me into 
                the infantry or the cavalry.' </p>
              <p> `Into the infantry, when they need artillery more than anything?' 
                said Katavassov, fancying from the artilleryman's apparent age 
                that he must have reached a fairly high grade. </p>
              <p> `I wasn't long in the artillery; I'm a junker, in reserve,' 
                he said, and he began to explain how he had failed in his examination. 
              </p>
              <p> All of this together made a disagreeable impression on Katavassov, 
                and when the volunteers got out at a station for a drink, Katavassov 
                would have liked to compare his unfavorable impression in conversation 
                with someone. There was an old man in the carriage, wearing a 
                military overcoat, who had been listening all the while to Katavassov's 
                conversation with the volunteers. When they were left alone, Katavassov 
                addressed him. </p>
              <p> `What different positions they come from, all those fellows 
                who are going off there,' Katavassov said vaguely, not wishing 
                to express his own opinion, and at the same time anxious to find 
                out the old man's views. </p>
              <p> The old man was an officer who had served in two campaigns. 
                He knew what makes a soldier, and, judging by the appearance and 
                the talk of those persons, by the swagger with which they had 
                recourse to the bottle on the journey, he considered them poor 
                soldiers. Moreover, he lived in a district town, and he was longing 
                to tell how one soldier had volunteered from his town, a drunkard 
                and a thief whom no one would employ as a laborer. But knowing 
                by experience that in the present condition of the public temper 
                it was dangerous to express an opinion opposed to the general 
                one, and especially to criticize the volunteers unfavorably, he 
                too watched Katavassov without committing himself. </p>
              <p> `Well, men are wanted there,' he said, laughing with his eyes. 
                And they fell to talking of the last war news, and each concealed 
                from the other his perplexity as to the engagement expected next 
                day, since the Turks had been beaten, according to the latest 
                news, all along the line. And so they parted, neither giving expression 
                to his opinion. </p>
              <p> Katavassov went back to his own carriage, and with reluctant 
                hypocrisy reported to Sergei Ivanovich his observations of the 
                volunteers, from which it would appear that they were capital 
                fellows. </p>
              <p> At a big station at a town the volunteers were again greeted 
                with shouts and singing, again men and women with collection boxes 
                appeared, and provincial ladies brought bouquets to the volunteers 
                and followed them into the refreshment room; but all this was 
                on a much smaller and feebler scale than in Moscow. </p>

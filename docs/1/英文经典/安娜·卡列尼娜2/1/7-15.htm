                He did not know whether it was late or early. The candles had 
                all burned out. Dolly had just been in the study and had suggested 
                to the doctor that he should lie down. Levin sat listening to 
                the doctor's stories of a quack mesmerizer and looking at the 
                ashes of his cigarette. There had been a period of repose, and 
                he had sunk into oblivion. He had completely forgotten what was 
                going on now. He heard the doctor's chat and understood it. Suddenly 
                there came an unearthly shriek. The shriek was so awful that Levin 
                did not even jump up, but, holding his breath, gazed in terrified 
                inquiry at the doctor. The doctor put his head on one side, listened, 
                and smiled approvingly. Everything was so extraordinary that nothing 
                could strike Levin as strange. `I suppose it must be so,' he thought, 
                and still sat where he was. Whose scream was this? He jumped up, 
                ran on tiptoe to the bedroom, edged round Lizaveta Petrovna and 
                the Princess, and took up his position at Kitty's pillow. The 
                scream had subsided, but there was some change now. What it was 
                he did not see and did not comprehend, and he had no wish to see 
                or comprehend. But he saw it by the face of Lizaveta Petrovna. 
                Lizaveta Petrovna's face was stern and pale, and still as resolute, 
                though her jaws were twitching, and her eyes were fixed intently 
                on Kitty. Kitty's swollen and agonized face, a tress of hair clinging 
                to her moist brow, was turned to him and sought his eyes. Her 
                lifted hands asked for his hands. Clutching his chill hands in 
                her moist ones, she began squeezing them to her face. </p>
              <p>`Don't go, don't go! I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid!' she said 
                rapidly. `Mamma, take my earrings. They bother me. You're not 
                afraid? Soon, soon, Lizaveta Petrovna...' </p>
              <p> She spoke quickly, very quickly, and tried to smile. But suddenly 
                her face was drawn - she pushed him away. </p>
              <p> `Oh, this is awful! I'm dying, I'm dying! Go away!' she shrieked, 
                and again he heard that unearthly scream. </p>
              <p> Levin clutched at his head and ran out of the room. </p>
              <p> `It's nothing, it's nothing, it's all right,' Dolly called after 
                him. </p>
              <p> But they might say what they liked, he knew now that all was 
                over. He stood in the next room, his head leaning against the 
                doorpost, and heard shrieks, howls, such as he had never heard 
                before, and he knew that what had been Kitty was uttering these 
                shrieks. He had long ago ceased to wish for the child. By now 
                he loathed this child. He did not even pray for her life now - 
                all he longed for was the cessation of this awful anguish. </p>
              <p> `Doctor! What is it? What is it? My God!' he said, snatching 
                at the doctor's hand as he came up. </p>
              <p> `It's the end,' said the doctor. And the doctor's face was so 
                grave as he said it that Levin took the end as meaning her death. 
              </p>
              <p> Beside himself, he ran into the bedroom. The first thing he 
                saw was the face of Lizaveta Petrovna. It was even more frowning 
                and stern. Kitty's face he did not know. In the place where it 
                had been was something that was fearful in its strained distortion 
                and in the sounds that came from it. He fell down with his head 
                on the wooden framework of the bed, feeling that his heart was 
                bursting. The awful scream never paused, it became still more 
                awful, and as though it had reached the utmost limit of terror, 
                suddenly it ceased. Levin could not believe his ears, but there 
                could be no doubt; the scream had ceased and he heard a subdued 
                stir and bustle, and hurried breathing, and her voice, gasping, 
                alive, tender, and blissful, uttered softly: `It's over!' </p>
              <p> He lifted his head. With her hands hanging exhausted on the 
                quilt, looking extraordinarily lovely and serene, she looked at 
                him in silence and tried to smile, and could not. </p>
              <p> And suddenly, from the mysterious and awful faraway world in 
                which he had been living for the last twenty-two hours, Levin 
                felt himself all in an instant borne back to the old everyday 
                world, though glorified now by such a radiance of happiness that 
                he could not bear it. The strained chords snapped; sobs and tears 
                of joy which he had never foreseen rose up with such violence 
                that his whole body shook, and for long they prevented him from 
                speaking. </p>
              <p> Falling on his knees before the bed, he held his wife's hand 
                before his lips and kissed it, and the hand, with a weak movement 
                of the fingers, responded to his kiss. And meanwhile, there at 
                the foot of the bed, in the deft hands of Lizaveta Petrovna, like 
                a flickering light in a lamp, lay the life of a human creature, 
                which had never existed before, and which would now with the same 
                right, with the same importance to itself, live and create in 
                its own image. </p>
              <p> `Alive! alive! And a boy too! Set your mind at rest!' Levin 
                heard Lizaveta Petrovna saying, as she slapped the baby's back 
                with a shaking hand. </p>
              <p> `Mamma, is it true?' said Kitty's voice. </p>
              <p> The Princess's sobs were all the answer she could make. </p>
              <p> And in the midst of the silence there came in unmistakable reply 
                to the mother's question, a voice quite unlike the subdued voices 
                speaking in the room. It was the bold, clamorous, self-assertive 
                squall of the new human being, which had so incomprehensibly appeared. 
              </p>
              <p> If Levin had been told before that Kitty was dead, and that 
                he had died with her, and that their children were angels, and 
                that God was standing before him, he would have been surprised 
                at nothing. But now, coming back to the world of reality, he had 
                to make great mental efforts to take in that she was alive and 
                well, and that the creature squalling so desperately was his son. 
                Kitty was alive, her agony was over. And he was unutterably happy. 
                That he understood; and he was completely happy in it. But the 
                baby? Whence, why, who was he?... He could not get used to the 
                idea. It seemed to him something extraneous, superfluous, to which 
                he could not accustom himself. </p>

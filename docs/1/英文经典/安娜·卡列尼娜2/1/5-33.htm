              <p><br>
                Vronsky for the first time experienced a feeling of anger against 
                Anna, almost a hatred for her intentional refusal to understand 
                her own position. This feeling was aggravated by his being unable 
                to tell her plainly the cause of his anger. If he had told her 
                directly what he was thinking, he would have said: `In that dress, 
                with a Princess only too well known to everyone, to show yourself 
                at the theater is equivalent not merely to acknowledging your 
                position as a fallen woman, but is flinging down a challenge to 
                society - that is to say, cutting yourself off from it forever.' 
              </p>
              <p>He could not say that to her. `But how can she fail to see it, 
                and what is going on within her?' he said to himself He felt at 
                the same time that his respect for her was diminished while his 
                sense of her beauty was intensified. </p>
              <p> He went back scowling to his rooms, and, sitting down beside 
                Iashvin, who, with his long legs stretched out on a chair, was 
                drinking cognac and Seltzer water, he ordered a glass of the same 
                for himself. </p>
              <p> `You were talking of Lankovsky's Powerful. That's a fine horse, 
                and I would advise you to buy him,' said Iashvin, glancing at 
                his comrade's gloomy face. `His hindquarters aren't quite first-rate, 
                but the legs and head - one couldn't wish for anything better.' 
              </p>
              <p> `I think I will take him,' answered Vronsky. </p>
              <p> Their conversation about horses interested him, but he did not 
                for an instant forget Anna, and could not help listening to the 
                sound of steps in the corridor and looking at the clock on the 
                chimney piece. </p>
              <p> `Anna Arkadyevna gave orders to announce that she has gone to 
                the theater.' </p>
              <p> Iashvin, tipping another glass of cognac into the bubbling water, 
                drank it and got up, buttoning his coat. </p>
              <p> `Well, let's go,' he said, faintly smiling under his mustache, 
                and showing by this smile that he knew the cause of Vronsky's 
                gloominess, and did not attach any significance to it. </p>
              <p> `I'm not going,' Vronsky answered gloomily. </p>
              <p> `Well, I must - I promised to. Good-by then. If you do, come 
                to the stalls; you can take Krassinsky's stall,' added Iashvin 
                as he went out. </p>
              <p> `No, I'm busy.' </p>
              <p> `A wife is a care, but it's worse when she's not a wife,' thought 
                Iashvin, as he walked out of the hotel. </p>
              <p> Vronsky, left alone, got up from his chair and began pacing 
                up and down the room. </p>
              <p> `And what's today? The fourth series.... Iegor and his wife 
                are there, and my mother, most likely. Of course all Peterburg's 
                there. Now she's gone in, taken off her cloak and come into the 
                glare. Tushkevich, Iashvin, Princess Varvara,' he pictured them 
                to himself.... `What about me? Either that I'm frightened, or 
                have given up to Tushkevich the right to protect her? From every 
                point of view - stupid, stupid!... And why is she putting me in 
                such a position?' he said with a gesture of despair. </p>
              <p> With that gesture he knocked against the table, on which there 
                was standing the Seltzer water and the decanter of cognac, and 
                almost upset it. He tried to catch it, let it slip, and angrily 
                kicked the table over and rang. </p>
              <p> `If you care to be in my service,' he said to the valet who 
                came in, `you had better remember your duties. This shouldn't 
                be here. You ought to have cleared away.' </p>
              <p> The valet, conscious of his own innocence, would have defended 
                himself, but, glancing at his master, he saw from his face that 
                the only thing to do was to be silent, and hurriedly threading 
                his way in and out, dropped down on the carpet and began gathering 
                up the whole and broken glasses and bottles. </p>
              <p> `That's not your duty; send the waiter to clear away, and get 
                my dress coat out.' </p>
              <p> Vronsky arrived at the theater at half-past eight The performance 
                was in full swing. The little old boxkeeper, recognizing Vronsky 
                as he helped him off with his fur coat, called him `Your Excellency,' 
                and suggested he should not take a check but should simply call 
                Fiodor. In the brightly lighted corridor there was no one but 
                the box opener and two footmen with fur cloaks on their arms listening 
                at the doors. Through the closed doors came the sounds of the 
                discreet staccato accompaniment of the orchestra, and a single 
                female voice rendering distinctly a musical phrase. The door opened 
                to let the box opener slip through, and the phrase drawing to 
                the end reached Vronsky's hearing clearly. But the doors were 
                closed again at once, and Vronsky did not hear the end of the 
                phrase and the cadence of the accompaniment, though he knew from 
                the thunder of applause that it was over. When he entered the 
                hall, brilliantly lighted with chandeliers and gas jets, the noise 
                was still going on. On the stage the singer, bowing and smiling, 
                flashing with bare shoulders and with diamonds, was, with the 
                help of the tenor who had given her his arm, gathering up the 
                bouquets that were clumsily flying over the footlights. Then she 
                went up to a gentleman with glossy pomaded hair parted down the 
                middle, who was stretching across the footlights holding out something 
                to her, and all the public in the stalls as well as in the boxes 
                was in excitement, craning forward, shouting and clapping. The 
                conductor in his high chair assisted in passing the offering, 
                and straightened his white tie. Vronsky walked into the middle 
                of the stalls, and, standing still, began looking about him. That 
                day less than ever was his attention turned upon the familiar, 
                habitual surroundings, the stage, the noise, all the familiar, 
                uninteresting, particolored herd of spectators in the packed theater. 
              </p>
              <p> There were, as always, the same ladies of some sort with officers 
                of some sort in the back of the boxes; the same gaily dressed 
                women - God knows who - and uniforms and black coats; the same 
                dirty crowd in the upper gallery, and among the crowd, in the 
                boxes and in the front rows, were some forty of the real people, 
                men and women. And to those oases Vronsky at once directed his 
                attention, and with them he entered at once into relation. </p>
              <p> The act was over when he went in, and so he did not go straight 
                to his brother's box, but going up to the first row of stalls 
                stopped at the footlights with Serpukhovskoy, who, standing with 
                one knee, raised and his heel on the footlights, caught sight 
                of him in the distance and beckoned to him, smiling. </p>
              <p> Vronsky had not yet seen Anna. He purposely avoided looking 
                in her direction. But he knew by the direction of people's eyes 
                where she was. He looked round discreetly, but he was not seeking 
                her; expecting the worst, his eyes sought for Alexei Alexandrovich. 
                To his relief Alexei Alexandrovich was not in the theater that 
                evening. </p>
              <p> `How little of the military man there is left in you!' Serpukhovskoy 
                was saying to him. `A diplomat, an artist, something of that sort, 
                one would say.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, it was like going back home when I put on a dress coat,' 
                answered Vronsky, smiling and slowly taking out his opera glasses. 
              </p>
              <p> `Well, I'll own I envy you there. When I come back from abroad 
                and put on this,' he touched his shoulder knot, `I regret my freedom.' 
              </p>
              <p> Serpukhovskoy had long given up all hope of Vronsky's career, 
                but he liked him as before, and was now particularly cordial to 
                him. </p>
              <p> `What a pity you were not in time for the first act!' </p>
              <p> Vronsky, listening with half an ear, moved his opera glasses 
                from the stalls and scanned the boxes. Near a lady in a turban 
                and a bald old man, who seemed to blink angrily in the moving 
                opera glasses, Vronsky suddenly caught sight of Anna's head, proud, 
                strikingly beautiful, and smiling in its frame of lace. She was 
                in the fifth box, twenty paces from him. She was sitting in front, 
                and, slightly turning, was saying something to Iashvin. The setting 
                of her head on her handsome, broad shoulders, and the restrained 
                excitement and brilliance of her eyes and her whole face reminded 
                him of her just as he had seen her at the ball in Moscow. But 
                he felt utterly different toward her beauty now. In his feeling 
                for her now there was no element of mystery, and so her beauty, 
                though it attracted him even more intensely than before, gave 
                him now a sense of injury. She was not looking in his direction, 
                but Vronsky felt that she had seen him already. </p>
              <p> When Vronsky turned the opera glasses again in that direction, 
                he noticed that Princess Varvara was particularly red, and kept 
                laughing unnaturally and looking round at the next box. Anna, 
                folding her fan and tapping it on the red velvet, was gazing away 
                and did not see, and obviously did not wish to see, what was taking 
                place in the next box. Iashvin's face wore the expression which 
                was common when he was losing at cards. Scowling, he sucked the 
                left tip of his mustache further and further into his mouth, and 
                cast sidelong glances at the next box. </p>
              <p> In that box on the left were the Kartassovs. Vronsky knew them, 
                and knew that Anna was acquainted with them. Madame Kartassova, 
                a thin little woman, was standing up in her box, and, her back 
                turned upon Anna, she was putting on a mantle that her husband 
                was holding for her. Her face was pale and angry, and she was 
                talking excitedly. Kartassov, a fat, bald man, was continually 
                looking round at Anna, while he attempted to soothe his wife. 
                When the wife had gone out, the husband lingered a long while, 
                and tried to catch Anna's eye, obviously anxious to bow to her. 
                But Anna, with unmistakable intention, avoided noticing him, and 
                talked to Iashvin, whose cropped head was bent down to her. Kartassov 
                went out without making his salutation, and the box was left empty. 
              </p>
              <p> Vronsky could not understand exactly what had passed between 
                the Kartassovs and Anna, but he saw that something humiliating 
                for Anna had happened. He knew this both from what he had seen, 
                and most of all from the face of Anna, who, he could see, was 
                taxing every nerve to carry through the part she had taken up. 
                And in maintaining this attitude of external composure she was 
                completely successful. Anyone who did not know her and her circle, 
                who had not heard all the utterances of the women expressive of 
                commiseration, indignation and amazement, that she should show 
                herself in society, and show herself so conspicuously with her 
                lace and her beauty, would have admired the serenity and loveliness 
                of this woman without a suspicion that she was undergoing the 
                sensations of a man in the stocks. </p>
              <p> Knowing that something had happened, but not knowing precisely 
                what, Vronsky felt a thrill of agonizing anxiety, and hoping to 
                find out something, he went toward his brother's box. Purposely 
                choosing the way round farthest from Anna's box, he jostled as 
                he came out against the colonel of his old regiment, talking to 
                two acquaintances. Vronsky heard the name of Karenin, and noticed 
                how the colonel hastened to address Vronsky loudly by name, with 
                a meaning glance at his companions. </p>
              <p> `Ah, Vronsky! When are you coming to the regiment? We can't 
                let you off without a supper. You're our - one of the most thorough,' 
                said the colonel of his regiment. </p>
              <p> `I can't stop, awfully sorry, another time,' said Vronsky, and 
                he ran upstairs toward his brother's box. </p>
              <p> The old countess, Vronsky's mother, with her steel-gray curls, 
                was in his brother's box. Varia with the young Princess Sorokina 
                met him in the corridor. </p>
              <p> Leaving the Princess Sorokina with her mother, Varia held out 
                her hand to her brother-in-law, and began immediately to speak 
                of what interested him. She was more excited than he had ever 
                seen her. </p>
              <p> `I think it's mean and hateful, and Madame Kartassova had no 
                right to do it. Madame Karenina...' she began. </p>
              <p> `But what is it? I don't know.' </p>
              <p> `What? You haven't heard?' </p>
              <p> `You know I should be the last person to hear of it.' </p>
              <p> `There isn't a more spiteful creature than that Madame Kartassova!' 
              </p>
              <p> `But what did she do?' </p>
              <p> `My husband told me.... She has insulted Madame Karenina. Her 
                husband began talking to her across the box, and Madame Kartassova 
                made a scene. She said something aloud, they say, something insulting, 
                and went away.' </p>
              <p> `Count, your maman is asking for you,' said the young Princess 
                Sorokina, peeping out of the door of the box. </p>
              <p> `I've been expecting you all the while,' said his mother, smiling 
                sarcastically. `You were nowhere to be seen.' </p>
              <p> Her son saw that she could not suppress a smile of delight. 
              </p>
              <p> `Good evening, maman. I have come to you,' he said coldly. </p>
              <p> `Why aren't you going to faire la cour à Madame Karenina?' she 
                went on, when Princess Sorokina had moved away. `Elle fait sensation. 
                On oublie la Patti pour elle.' </p>
              <p> `Maman, I have asked you not to say anything to me of that,' 
                he answered, scowling. </p>
              <p> `I'm only saying what everyone's saying.' </p>
              <p> Vronsky made no reply, and saying a few words to Princess Sorokina, 
                he went away. At the door he met his brother. </p>
              <p> `Ah, Alexei!' said his brother. `How disgusting! Idiot of a 
                woman, nothing else.... I wanted to go straight to her. Let's 
                go together.' </p>
              <p> Vronsky did not hear him. With rapid steps he went downstairs; 
                he felt that he must do something, but he did not know what. Anger 
                with her for having put herself and him in such a false position, 
                together with pity for her suffering, filled his heart. He went 
                down, and made straight for Anna's box. At her box stood Stremov, 
                talking to her. </p>
              <p> `There are no more tenors. Le moule en est brise!' </p>
              <p> Vronsky bowed to her and stopped to greet Stremov. </p>
              <p> `You came in late, I think, and have missed the best song,' 
                Anna said to Vronsky, glancing ironically, he thought, at him. 
              </p>
              <p> `I am a poor judge of music,' he said, looking sternly at her. 
              </p>
              <p> `Like Prince Iashvin,' she said smiling, `who considers that 
                Patti sings too loud. - Thank you,' she said, her little hand 
                in its long glove taking the playbill Vronsky picked up, and suddenly 
                at that instant her lovely face quivered. She got up and went 
                into the interior of the box. </p>
              <p> Noticing in the next act that her box was empty, Vronsky, rousing 
                many an indignant `Hush!' in the silent audience, went out in 
                the middle of a solo and drove home. </p>
              <p> Anna was already at home. When Vronsky went up to her, she was 
                in the same dress she had worn at the theater. She was sitting 
                in the first armchair against the wall, looking straight before 
                her. She looked at him, and at once resumed her former position. 
              </p>
              <p> `Anna,' he said. </p>
              <p> `You, you are to blame for everything!' she cried, with tears 
                of despair and hatred in her voice, getting up. </p>
              <p> `I begged, I implored you not to go; I knew it would be unpleasant...' 
              </p>
              <p> `Unpleasant?' she cried. `Hideous! As long as I live I shall 
                never forget it. She said it was a disgrace to sit beside me.' 
              </p>
              <p> `A silly woman's chatter,' he said, `but why risk it, why provoke?...' 
              </p>
              <p> `I hate your calm. You ought not to have brought me to this. 
                If you had loved me...' </p>
              <p> `Anna! How does the question of my love come in?...' </p>
              <p> `Oh, if you loved me, as I love, if you were tortured as I am...' 
                she said, looking at him with an expression of terror. </p>
              <p> He was sorry for her, and angry notwithstanding. He assured 
                her of his love because he saw that this was the only means of 
                soothing her, and he did not reproach her in words, but in his 
                heart he reproached her. </p>
              <p> And the asseverations of his love, which seemed to him so trivial 
                that he was ashamed to utter them, she drank in eagerly, and gradually 
                became calmer. The next day, completely reconciled, they left 
                for the country. </p>

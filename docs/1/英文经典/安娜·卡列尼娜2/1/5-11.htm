                On entering the studio, Mikhailov once more scanned his visitors 
                and noted down in his imagination Vronsky's expression too, and 
                especially his jaws. Although his artistic sense was unceasingly 
                at work collecting materials, although he felt a continually increasing 
                excitement as the moment of criticizing his work drew nearer, 
                he rapidly and subtly formed, from imperceptible signs, a mental 
                image of these three persons. That fellow (Golenishchev) was a 
                Russian living here. Mikhailov did not remember his surname nor 
                where he had met him, nor what he had said to him. He only remembered 
                his face as he remembered all the faces he had ever seen; but 
                he remembered, too, that it was one of the faces laid by in his 
                memory in the immense class of the falsely consequential and poor 
                in expression. The abundant hair and very open forehead gave an 
                appearance of consequence to the face, which had only one expression 
                - a petty, childish, peevish expression, concentrated just above 
                the bridge of the narrow nose. Vronsky and Madame Karenina must 
                be, Mikhailov supposed, distinguished and wealthy Russians, knowing 
                nothing about art, like all those wealthy Russians, but posing 
                as amateurs and connoisseurs. `Most likely they've already looked 
                at all the antiques, and now they're making the round of the studios 
                of the new people - the German humbug, and the cracked Pre-Raphaelite 
                English fellow - and have only come to me to make the point of 
                view complete,' he thought. He was well acquainted with the way 
                dilettanti have (the cleverer they were the worse he found them) 
                of looking at the works of contemporary artists with the sole 
                object of being in a position to say that art is lost, and the 
                more one sees of the new men the more one sees how inimitable 
                the works of the great old masters have remained. He expected 
                all this; he saw it all in their faces, he saw it in the careless 
                indifference with which they talked among themselves, stared at 
                the lay figures and busts, and walked about in leisurely fashion, 
                waiting for him to uncover his picture. But in spite of this, 
                while he was turning over his studies, pulling up the blinds and 
                taking off the sheet, he was in intense excitement, especially 
                as, in spite of his conviction that all distinguished and wealthy 
                Russians were certain to be beasts and fools, he liked Vronsky, 
                and still more Anna. </p>
              <p>`Here, if you please,' he said, moving on one side with his nimble 
                gait and pointing to his picture, `it's the exhortation by Pilate. 
                Matthew, chapter 27,' he said, feeling his lips were beginning 
                to tremble with emotion. He moved away and stood behind them. 
              </p>
              <p> For the few seconds during which the visitors were gazing at 
                the picture in silence, Mikhailov too gazed at it with the indifferent 
                eye of an outsider. For those few seconds he was sure in anticipation 
                that a higher, juster criticism would be uttered by them, by those 
                very visitors whom he had been despising so a moment before. He 
                forgot all he had thought about his picture before, during the 
                three years he had been painting it; he forgot all its qualities, 
                which had been absolutely certain to him - he saw the picture 
                with their indifferent, new, outside eyes, and saw nothing good 
                in it. He saw in the foreground Pilate's irritated face and the 
                serene face of Christ, and in the background the figures of Pilate's 
                retinue and the face of John watching what was happening. Every 
                face that, with such exertion, such blunders and corrections had 
                grown up within him with its special character, every face that 
                had given him such torments and such raptures, and all these faces 
                so many times transposed for the sake of the harmony of the whole, 
                all the shades of color and tones that he had attained with such 
                labor - all of this together seemed to him now, looking at it 
                with their eyes, the merest vulgarity, something that had been 
                done a thousand times over. The face dearest to him, the face 
                of Christ, the center of the picture, which had given him such 
                ecstasy as it unfolded itself to him, was utterly lost to him 
                when he glanced at the picture with their eyes. He saw a well-painted 
                (no, not even that - he distinctly saw now a mass of defects) 
                repetition of those endless Christs of Titian, Raphael, Rubens, 
                and the same soldiers and Pilate . It was all common, poor, and 
                stale, and badly painted - weak and motley. They would be justified 
                in repeating hypocritically courteous speeches in the presence 
                of the painter, and pitying him and laughing at him when they 
                were alone again. </p>
              <p> The silence (though it lasted no more than a minute) became 
                too intolerable to him. To break it, and to show he was not agitated, 
                he made an effort and addressed Golenishchev. </p>
              <p> `I think I've had the pleasure of meeting you,' he said, looking 
                uneasily first at Anna, then at Vronsky, in fear of losing any 
                shade of their expression. </p>
              <p> `To be sure! We met at Rossi's; do you remember, at that soiree 
                when that Italian lady recited - the new Rachel?' Golenishchev 
                answered easily, removing his eyes without the slightest regret 
                from the picture and turning to the artist. </p>
              <p> Noticing, however, that Mikhailov was expecting a criticism 
                of the picture, he said: </p>
              <p> `Your picture has got on a great deal since I saw it last time; 
                and what strikes me particularly now, as it did then, is the figure 
                of Pilate. One so knows the man: a good-natured, capital fellow, 
                but an official through and through, who knows not what he doth. 
                But I fancy...' </p>
              <p> All of Mikhailov's mobile face beamed at once; his eyes sparkled. 
                He tried to say something, but he could not speak for excitement, 
                and pretended to be coughing. Low as was his opinion of Golenishchev's 
                capacity for understanding art, trifling as was the true remark 
                upon the fidelity of the expression of Pilate as an official, 
                and offensive as might have seemed the utterance of so unimportant 
                an observation while nothing was said of more serious points, 
                Mikhailov was in an ecstasy of delight at this observation. He 
                had himself thought about Pilate's figure just what Golenishchev 
                had said. The fact that this reflection was but one of millions 
                of reflections, which, as Mikhailov knew for certain, would be 
                true, did not diminish for him the significance of Golenishchev's 
                remark. His heart warmed to Golenishchev for this remark, and 
                from a state of depression he suddenly passed to ecstasy. At once 
                the whole of his picture lived before him in all the indescribable 
                complexity of everything living. Mikhailov again tried to say 
                that that was how he understood Pilate, but his lips quivered 
                intractably, and he could not pronounce the words. Vronsky and 
                Anna too said something in that subdued voice which (partly to 
                avoid hurting the artist's feelings and partly to avoid giving 
                loud utterance to something silly - so easily done when talking 
                of art) people use at exhibitions of pictures. Mikhailov fancied 
                that the picture had made an impression on them too. He went up 
                to them. </p>
              <p> `How marvelous Christ's expression is!' said Anna. Of all she 
                saw she liked that expression most of all, and she felt that it 
                was the center of the picture, and so praise of it would be pleasant 
                to the artist. `One can see that He is pitying Pilate.' </p>
              <p> This again was one of the million true reflections that could 
                be found in his picture and in the figure of Christ. She said 
                that He was pitying Pilate. In Christ's expression there ought 
                to be indeed an expression of pity, since there is an expression 
                of love, of unearthly peace, of preparedness for death, and a 
                sense of the vanity of words. Of course, there is the expression 
                of an official in Pilate, and of pity in Christ, considering that 
                one is the incarnation of the fleshly, and the other of the spiritual, 
                life. All this and much more flashed into Mikhailov's thoughts. 
                And his face beamed with delight again. </p>
              <p> `Yes, and how that figure is done - what atmosphere! One can 
                walk round it,' said Golenishchev, unmistakably betraying by this 
                remark that he did not approve of the meaning and idea of the 
                figure. </p>
              <p> `Yes, there's a wonderful mastery!' said Vronsky. `How those 
                figures in the background stand out! There you have technique,' 
                he said, addressing Golenishchev, alluding to a conversation between 
                them about Vronsky's despair of attaining this technique. </p>
              <p> `Yes, yes, marvelous!' Golenishchev and Anna assented. </p>
              <p> In spite of the excited condition in which he was, the sentence 
                about technique had sent a pang to Mikhailov's heart, and looking 
                angrily at Vronsky he suddenly scowled. He had often heard this 
                word `technique,' and was utterly unable to understand what was 
                meant by it. He knew that by this term was meant a mechanical 
                dexterity for painting or drawing, entirely apart from its subject. 
                He had noticed often that even in actual praise technique was 
                opposed to essential quality, as though one could paint well something 
                that was bad. He knew that a great deal of attention and care 
                was necessary in taking off the veils, to avoid injuring the creation 
                itself, and to take off all the veils; but there was no art of 
                painting - no technique of any sort - about it. If to a little 
                child or to his cook were revealed what he saw, either would have 
                been able to peel the veils off what was seen. And the most experienced 
                and adroit painter could not by mere mechanical faculty paint 
                anything if the lines of the subject were not revealed to him 
                first. Besides, he saw that if it came to talking about technique, 
                it was impossible to praise him for it. In all he had painted 
                he saw faults that hurt his eyes, coming from want of care in 
                taking off the veils - faults he could not correct now without 
                spoiling the whole. And in almost all the figures and faces he 
                saw, too, remnants of the veils not perfectly removed that spoiled 
                the picture. </p>
              <p> `One thing might be said, if you will allow me to make the remark...' 
                observed Golenishchev. </p>
              <p> `Oh, I shall be delighted, I beg of you to do so,' said Mikhailov 
                with a forced smile. </p>
              <p> `That is, you make Him the man-god, and not the God-man. But 
                I know that was what you meant to do.' </p>
              <p> `I cannot paint a Christ that is not in my heart,' said Mikhailov 
                morosely. </p>
              <p> `Yes; but in that case, if you will allow me to say what I think... 
                Your picture is so fine that my observation cannot detract from 
                it, and, besides, it is only my personal opinion. With you it 
                is different. Your very motive is different. But let us take Ivanov. 
                I imagine that if Christ is brought down to the level of an historical 
                character, it would have been better for Ivanov to select some 
                other historical subject, fresh, untouched.' </p>
              <p> `But if this is the greatest subject presented to art?' </p>
              <p> `If one looked one would find others. But the point is that 
                art cannot suffer doubt and discussion. And before the picture 
                of Ivanov the question arises for the believer and the unbeliever 
                alike, ``Is it God, or is it not God?' and the unity of the impression 
                is destroyed.' </p>
              <p> `Why so? I think that, for educated people,' said Mikhailov, 
                `the question cannot exist.' </p>
              <p> Golenishchev did not agree with this, and confounded Mikhailov 
                by his support of his first idea of the unity of the impression 
                being essential to art. </p>
              <p> Mikhailov was greatly perturbed, but he could say nothing in 
                defense of his own idea. </p>

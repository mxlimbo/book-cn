              <p><br>
                The old neglected palazzo, with its lofty plastic plafonds and 
                frescoes on the walls, with its floors of mosaic, with its heavy 
                yellow stuff curtains on the windows, with its vases on pedestals, 
                and its open fireplaces, its carved doors and gloomy reception 
                rooms hung with pictures - this palazzo did much, by its very 
                appearance after they had moved into it, to confirm in Vronsky 
                the agreeable illusion that he was not so much a Russian country 
                gentleman, a retired officer of the life guards, as an enlightened 
                amateur and patron of the arts, himself a modest artist who had 
                renounced the world, his connections, and his ambition for the 
                sake of the woman he loved. </p>
              <p>The pose chosen by Vronsky with their removal into the palazzo 
                was completely successful, and having, through Golenishchev, made 
                the acquaintance of a few interesting people, for a time he was 
                satisfied. He painted studies from nature under the guidance of 
                an Italian professor of painting, and studied medieval Italian 
                life. Medieval Italian life so fascinated Vronsky that even his 
                hat, and a plaid flung over his shoulder, were worn in the medieval 
                style, which, indeed, was extremely becoming to him. </p>
              <p> `Here we live, and know nothing of what's going on,' Vronsky 
                said to Golenishchev, when the latter came to see him one morning. 
                `Have you seen Mikhailov's picture?' he said, handing him a Russian 
                gazette he had received that morning, and pointing to an article 
                on a Russian artist, living in the very same town, and just finishing 
                a picture which had long been talked about, and had been bought 
                beforehand. The article reproached the government and the academy 
                for letting so remarkable an artist be left without encouragement 
                and support. </p>
              <p> `I've seen it,' answered Golenishchev. `Of course, he's not 
                without talent, but it's all in a wrong direction. It's all the 
                Ivanov-Strauss-Renan attitude to Christ and to religious painting.' 
              </p>
              <p> `What is the subject of the picture?' asked Anna. </p>
              <p> `Christ before Pilate. Christ is represented as a Jew with all 
                the realism of the new school.' </p>
              <p> And the question of the subject of the picture having brought 
                him to one of his favorite theories, Golenishchev launched forth 
                into a disquisition on it. </p>
              <p> `I can't understand how they can fall into such a gross mistake. 
                Christ always has His definite embodiment in the art of the great 
                masters. And therefore, if they want to depict, not God, but a 
                revolutionist or a sage, let them take from history a Socrates, 
                a Franklin, a Charlotte Corday, but not Christ. They take the 
                very figure which cannot be taken for their art, and then...' 
              </p>
              <p> `And is it true that this Mikhailov is in such poverty?' asked 
                Vronsky, thinking that, as a Russian Maecenas, it was his duty 
                to assist the artist regardless of whether the picture were good 
                or bad. </p>
              <p> `Hardly. He's a remarkable portrait painter. Have you ever seen 
                his portrait of Madame Vassilkova? But I believe he doesn't care 
                about painting any more portraits, and so, likely as not, he may 
                be in want. I maintain that...' </p>
              <p> `Couldn't we ask him to paint a portrait of Anna Arkadyevna?' 
                said Vronsky. </p>
              <p> `Why mine?' said Anna. `After yours I don't want another portrait. 
                Better have one of Annie' (so she called her baby girl). `Here 
                she is,' she added, looking out of the window at the handsome 
                Italian nurse, who was carrying the child out into the garden, 
                and immediately glancing, unperceived, at Vronsky. The handsome 
                nurse, from whom Vronsky was painting a head for his picture, 
                was the one hidden grief in Anna's life. He painted with her as 
                his model, admired her beauty and medievalism, and Anna dared 
                not confess to herself that she was afraid of becoming jealous 
                of this nurse, and was for that reason particularly gracious and 
                condescending both to her and her little son. </p>
              <p> Vronsky, too, glanced out of the window and into Anna's eyes, 
                and, turning at once to Golenishchev, he said: </p>
              <p> `Do you know this Mikhailov?' </p>
              <p> `I have met him. But he's a queer fish, and quite without breeding. 
                You know, one of those savage new people one is forever coming 
                across nowadays; one of those freethinkers, you know, who are 
                reared d'emblee in theories of atheism, negation, and materialism. 
                In former days,' said Golenishchev, not observing, or not willing 
                to observe, that both Anna and Vronsky wanted to speak, `in former 
                days the freethinker was a man who had been brought up in ideas 
                of religion, law, and morality, and only through conflict and 
                struggle came to free thought; but now there has sprung up a new 
                type of native freethinker who grows up without even having heard 
                of principles of morality or of religion, of the existence of 
                authorities, who grows up directly in ideas of negation in everything, 
                that is to say, a savage. Well, he's of that class. He's the son, 
                it appears, of some Moscow butler, and has never had any sort 
                of bringing-up. When he got into the academy and made his reputation 
                he tried, as he's no fool, to educate himself. And he turned to 
                what seemed to him the very source of culture - the magazines. 
                In old times, you see, a man who wanted to educate himself - a 
                Frenchman, for instance - would have set to work to study all 
                the classics: theologians and tragedians and historians and philosophers, 
                and, you see, all the intellectual work that came in his way. 
                But in our day he goes straight for the literature of negation, 
                very quickly assimilates all the extracts of the science of negation, 
                and he's all set. And that's not all - twenty years ago he would 
                have found in that literature traces of conflict with authorities, 
                with the creeds of the ages; he would have perceived from this 
                conflict that there was something else; but now he comes at once 
                upon a literature in which the old creeds do not even furnish 
                matter for discussion, but it is stated baldly that there is nothing 
                else; just evolution, natural selection, the struggle for existence 
                - and that's all. In my article I've...' </p>
              <p> `I tell you what,' said Anna, who had for a long while been 
                exchanging wary glances with Vronsky, and knew that he was not 
                in the least interested in the education of this artist, but was 
                simply absorbed by the idea of assisting him, and ordering a portrait 
                of him; `I tell you what,' she said, resolutely interrupting Golenishchev, 
                who was still talking away, `let's go and see him!' </p>
              <p> Golenishchev recovered his self-possession and readily agreed. 
                But, as the artist lived in a remote ward of the town, it was 
                decided to take a carriage. </p>
              <p> An hour later Anna, with Golenishchev by her side and Vronsky 
                on the front seat of the carriage, facing them, drove up to an 
                ugly new house in a remote ward. On learning from the porter's 
                wife, who came out to them, that Mikhailov saw visitors at his 
                studio, but that at that moment he was in his lodging only a couple 
                of steps off, they sent her to him with their cards, asking permission 
                to see his pictures. </p>

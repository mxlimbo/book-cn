                Levin could not look calmly at his brother; he could not himself 
                be natural and calm in his presence. When he went in to the sick 
                man, his eyes and his attention were unconsciously dimmed, and 
                he did not see and did not distinguish the details of his brother's 
                position. He smelt the awful odor, saw the dirt, disorder, and 
                miserable condition, and heard the groans, and felt that nothing 
                could be done to help. It never entered his head to analyze the 
                details of the sick man's situation, to consider how that body 
                was lying under the quilt, how those emaciated legs and thighs 
                and spine were lying huddled up, and whether they could not be 
                made more comfortable, whether anything could not be done to make 
                things, if not better, at least not so bad. It made his blood 
                run cold when he began to think of all these details. He was absolutely 
                convinced that nothing could be done to prolong his brother's 
                life or to relieve his suffering. But a consciousness of Levin's 
                regarding all aid as out of the question was felt by the sick 
                man, and exasperated him. And this made it still more painful 
                for Levin. To be in the sickroom was agony to him, not to be there 
                was still worse. And he was continually, on various pretexts, 
                going out of the room, and coming in again, because he was unable 
                to remain alone. </p>
              <p>But Kitty thought, and felt, and acted quite differently. On 
                seeing the sick man she pitied him. And pity in her womanly heart 
                did not arouse at all that feeling of horror and loathing that 
                it aroused in her husband, but a desire to act, to find out all 
                the details of his state, and to remedy them. And since she had 
                not the slightest doubt that it was her duty to help him, she 
                had no doubt either that it was possible, and immediately set 
                to work. The very details, the mere thought of which reduced her 
                husband to terror, immediately engaged her attention. She sent 
                for the doctor, sent to the chemist's, set the maid who had come 
                with her and Marya Nikolaevna to sweep and dust and scrub; she 
                herself washed up something, washed out something else, laid something 
                under the quilt. Something was by her direction brought into the 
                sickroom, something else was carried out. She herself went several 
                times to her room, regardless of the men she met in the corridor, 
                got out and brought in sheets, pillowcases, towels, and shirts. 
              </p>
              <p> The waiter, who was busy with a party of engineers dining in 
                the dining hall, came several times with an irate countenance 
                in answer to her summons, and could not avoid carrying out her 
                orders, as she gave them with such gracious insistence that there 
                was no evading her. Levin did not approve of all this; he did 
                not believe it would be of any good to the patient. Above all, 
                he was afraid the patient would be angry at it. But the sick man, 
                though he seemed to be indifferent about it, was not angry, but 
                only abashed and on the whole seemed interested in what she was 
                doing with him. Coming back from the doctor to whom Kitty had 
                sent him, Levin, on opening the door, came upon the sick man at 
                the instant when, by Kitty's direction, they were changing his 
                linen. The long white ridge of his spine, with the huge, prominent 
                shoulder blades and jutting ribs and vertebrae, was bare, and 
                Marya Nikolaevna and the waiter were struggling with the sleeve 
                of the nightshirt, and could not get the long, limp arm into it. 
                Kitty, hurriedly closing the door after Levin, did not look in 
                that direction, but the sick man groaned, and she moved rapidly 
                toward him. </p>
              <p> `Come, a little quicker,' she said. </p>
              <p> `Oh, don't you come,' said the sick man angrily. `I'll do it 
                myself....' </p>
              <p> `What did you say?' queried Marya Nikolaevna. </p>
              <p> But Kitty heard and saw he was ashamed and uncomfortable at 
                being naked before her. </p>
              <p> `I'm not looking, I'm not looking!' she said, putting the arm 
                in. `Marya Nikolaevna, you come this side - you do it,' she added. 
              </p>
              <p> `Please, run over for me, there's a little bottle in my small 
                bag,' she said, turning to her husband, `you know, in the side 
                pocket; bring it, please, and meanwhile they'll finish clearing 
                up here.' </p>
              <p> Returning with the bottle, Levin found the sick man settled 
                comfortably and everything about him completely changed. The heavy 
                smell was replaced by the smell of aromatic vinegar, which Kitty 
                with pouting lips and puffed-out, rosy cheeks was squirting through 
                a small tube. There was no dust visible anywhere; a rug was laid 
                by the bedside. On the table stood medicine bottles and decanters 
                tidily arranged, and the linen needed was folded up there, and 
                Kitty's broderie anglaise. On the other table by the patient's 
                bed there were candles, and drink, and powders. The sick man himself, 
                washed and combed, lay in clean sheets on high raised pillows, 
                in a clean nightshirt with a white collar about his astoundingly 
                thin neck, and, with a new expression of hope, was looking fixedly 
                at Kitty. </p>
              <p> The doctor brought by Levin, and found by him at the club, was 
                not the one who had been attending Nikolai Levin, and whom he 
                disliked. The new doctor took up a stethoscope and sounded the 
                patient, shook his head, prescribed medicine, and with extreme 
                minuteness explained first how to take the medicine and then what 
                diet was to be adhered to. He advised eggs, raw or hardly cooked, 
                and Seltzer water, with new milk at a certain temperature. When 
                the doctor had gone away the sick man said something to his brother, 
                of which Levin could distinguish only the last words: `Your Katia.' 
                By the expression with which he gazed at her, Levin saw that he 
                was praising her. He beckoned to him Katia, as he called her. 
              </p>
              <p> `I'm much better already,' he said. `Why, with you I should 
                have got well long ago. How fine everything is!' He took her hand 
                and drew it toward his lips, but, as though afraid she would dislike 
                it, he changed his mind, let it go, and only stroked it. Kitty 
                took his hand in both of hers and squeezed it. </p>
              <p> `Now turn me over on the left side and go to bed,' he said. 
              </p>
              <p> No one could make out what he said but Kitty; she alone understood. 
                She understood because she was all the while mentally keeping 
                watch on what he needed. </p>
              <p> `On the other side,' she said to her husband, `he always sleeps 
                on that side. Turn him over - it's so disagreeable calling the 
                servants. I'm not strong enough. Can you?' she said to Marya Nikolaevna. 
              </p>
              <p> `I'm afraid....' answered Marya Nikolaevna. </p>
              <p> Terrible as it was to Levin to put his arms round that terrible 
                body, to take hold, under the quilt, of that of which he preferred 
                to know nothing, under his wife's influence he made his resolute 
                face that she knew so well, and, putting his arms into the bed 
                took hold of the body, but in spite of his own strength, he was 
                struck by the strange heaviness of those powerless limbs. While 
                he was turning him over, conscious of the huge emaciated arm about 
                his neck, Kitty swiftly and noiselessly turned the pillow, beat 
                it up, and settled in it the sick man's head, smoothing back his 
                hair, which was sticking again to his moist brow. </p>
              <p> The sick man kept his brother's hand in his own. Levin felt 
                that he meant to do something with his hand and was pulling it 
                somewhere. Levin yielded with a sinking heart: yes, he drew it 
                to his mouth and kissed it. Levin, shaking with sobs and unable 
                to articulate a word, went out of the room. </p>

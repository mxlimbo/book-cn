              <p><br>
                When Levin and Stepan Arkadyevich reached the peasant's hut where 
                Levin always used to stay, Veslovsky was already there. He was 
                sitting in the middle of the hut, clinging with both hands to 
                the bench from which he was being pulled by a soldier, the brother 
                of the peasant's wife, who was helping him off with his miry boots. 
                Veslovsky was laughing his infectious, good-humored laugh. </p>
              <p>`I've only just come. Ils ont été charmants. Just fancy they 
                gave me drink, and fed me! Such bread - it was exquisite! Délicieux! 
                And the vodka - I never tasted any better. And they would not 
                take a penny for anything. And they kept saying: ``Excuse our 
                homely ways.'' </p>
              <p> `What should they take anything for? They were entertaining 
                you, to be sure. Do you suppose they keep vodka for sale?' said 
                the soldier, succeeding at last in pulling the soaked boot off, 
                together with the blackened stocking. </p>
              <p> In spite of the dirtiness of the hut, which was all muddied 
                by their boots and the filthy dogs licking themselves clean, and 
                the smells of the marsh and the powder that filled the room, and 
                the absence of knives and forks, the party drank their tea and 
                ate their supper with a relish only known to sportsmen. Washed 
                and clean, they went into a hay barn swept ready for them, where 
                the coachmen had been making up beds for the gentlemen. </p>
              <p> Though it was dusk, not one of them wanted to go to sleep. </p>
              <p> After wavering among reminiscences and anecdotes of guns, of 
                dogs, and of former shooting parties, the conversation rested 
                on a topic that interested all of them. After Vassenka had several 
                times over expressed his appreciation of this delightful sleeping 
                place among the fragrant hay, this delightful broken telega (he 
                supposed it to be broken because the shafts had been taken out), 
                of the good nature of the peasants who had treated him to vodka, 
                of the dogs who lay at the feet of their respective masters, Oblonsky 
                began telling them of a delightful shooting party at Malthus's 
                where he had stayed the previous summer. Malthus was a well-known 
                capitalist, who had made his money by speculation in railway shares. 
                Stepan Arkadyevich described what snipe moors this Malthus had 
                taken on lease in the Tver province, and how they were preserved, 
                and of the carriages and dogcarts in which the shooting party 
                had been driven, and the luncheon pavilion that had been rigged 
                up at the marsh. </p>
              <p> `I don't understand you,' said Levin, sitting up in the hay; 
                `how is it such people don't disgust you? I can understand a lunch 
                with Lafitte is all very pleasant, but don't you dislike just 
                that very sumptuousness? All these people, just like our tax farmers 
                in the old days, get their money in a way that gains them the 
                contempt of everyone. They don't care for their contempt, and 
                then they use their dishonest gains to buy off the contempt they 
                have deserved.' </p>
              <p> `Perfectly true!' chimed in Vassenka Veslovsky. `Perfectly! 
                Oblonsky, of course, goes out of bonhomie, but other people say: 
                ``Well, Oblonsky stays with them.'' </p>
              <p> `Not a bit of it.' Levin could hear that Oblonsky was smiling 
                as he spoke. `I simply don't consider him more dishonest than 
                any other wealthy merchant or nobleman. They've all made their 
                money alike - by their work and their intelligence.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, by what work? Do you call it work to get hold of concessions 
                and speculate with them?' </p>
              <p> `Of course it's work. Work in this sense, that if it were not 
                for him and others like him, there would have been no railways.' 
              </p>
              <p> `But that's not work, like the work of a peasant, or in a learned 
                profession.' </p>
              <p> `Granted, but it's work in the sense that his activity produces 
                a result - the railways. But of course you think the railways 
                useless.' </p>
              <p> `No, that's another question; I am disposed to admit that they're 
                useful. But all profit that is out of proportion to the labor 
                expended is dishonest.' </p>
              <p> `But who is to define what is proportionate?' </p>
              <p> `Making profit by dishonest means, by trickery,' said Levin, 
                conscious that he could not draw a distinct line between honesty 
                and dishonesty. `Such as banking, for instance,' he went on. `It's 
                an evil - the amassing of huge fortunes without labor, just the 
                same thing as with the tax farmers - it's only the form that's 
                changed. Le roi est mort, vive le roi! No sooner were the tax 
                farmers abolished than the railways came up, and banking companies; 
                that, too, is profit without work.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, that may all be very true and clever.... Lie down, Krak!' 
                Stepan Arkadyevich called to his dog, who was scratching and turning 
                over all the hay. He was obviously convinced of the correctness 
                of his position, and so talked serenely and without haste. `But 
                you have not drawn the line between honest and dishonest work. 
                That I receive a bigger salary than my chief clerk, though he 
                knows more about the work than I do - that's dishonest, I suppose?' 
              </p>
              <p> `I can't say.' </p>
              <p> `Well, but I can tell you: your receiving some five thousand, 
                let's say, for your work on the land, while our host, the peasant 
                here, however hard he works, can never get more than fifty roubles, 
                is just as dishonest as my earning more than my chief clerk, and 
                Malthus getting more than a railway expert. No, quite the contrary; 
                I see that society takes up a sort of antagonistic attitude to 
                these people, which is utterly baseless, and I fancy there's envy 
                at the bottom of it....' </p>
              <p> `No, that's unfair,' said Veslovsky; `how could envy come in? 
                There is something unclean about that sort of business.' </p>
              <p> `You say,' Levin went on, `that it's unjust for me to receive 
                five thousand, while the peasant has fifty roubles; that's true. 
                It is unfair, and I feel it, but...' </p>
              <p> `It really is. Why is it we spend our time riding, drinking, 
                shooting, doing nothing while they are forever at work?' said 
                Vassenka Veslovsky, obviously for the first time in his life reflecting 
                on the question, and consequently considering it with perfect 
                sincerity. </p>
              <p> `Yes, you feel it, but you don't give him your property,' said 
                Stepan Arkadyevich, intentionally, as it seemed, provoking Levin. 
              </p>
              <p> There had arisen of late something like a secret antagonism 
                between the two brothers-in-law; as though, since they had married 
                sisters, a kind of rivalry had sprung up between them as to which 
                was ordering his life best, and now this hostility showed itself 
                in the conversation, as it began to take a personal note. </p>
              <p> `I don't give it away, because no one demands that from me, 
                and if I wanted to, I could not give it away,' answered Levin, 
                `and have no one to give it to.' </p>
              <p> `Give it to this peasant, he would not refuse it.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, but how am I to give it up? Am I to go to him and make 
                a title deed?' </p>
              <p> `I don't know; but if you are convinced that you have no right...' 
              </p>
              <p> `I'm not at all convinced. On the contrary, I feel have no right 
                to give it up, that I have duties both to the land and to my family.' 
              </p>
              <p> `No, excuse me, but if you consider this inequality is unjust, 
                why is it you don't act accordingly?...' </p>
              <p> `Well, I do act negatively on that idea, so far as not trying 
                to increase the difference of position existing between him and 
                me.' </p>
              <p> `No, excuse me, that's a paradox.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, there's something of a sophistry about that,' Veslovsky 
                agreed. `Ah! Our host!' he said to the peasant who came into the 
                barn, opening the creaking door. `How is it you're not asleep 
                yet?' </p>
              <p> `No, how's one to sleep! I thought our gentlemen would be asleep, 
                but I heard them chattering. I want to get a hook from here. She 
                won't bite?' he added, stepping cautiously with his bare feet. 
              </p>
              <p> `And where are you going to sleep?' </p>
              <p> `We are going out for night watching.' </p>
              <p> `Ah, what a night!' said Veslovsky, looking out at the edge 
                of the hut and the unharnessed droshky that could be seen in the 
                faint light of the evening glow in the great frame of the open 
                doors. `But listen, there are women's voices singing, and, on 
                my word, not badly too! Who's that singing, my friend?' </p>
              <p> `That's the housemaids from hard by here.' </p>
              <p> `Let's go - let's take a walk! We shan't go to sleep, you know. 
                Oblonsky, come along!' </p>
              <p> `If one could only do both, lie here and go,' answered Oblonsky, 
                stretching. `It's capital lying here.' </p>
              <p> `Well, I shall go by myself,' said Veslovsky, getting up eagerly, 
                and putting on his boots and stockings. `Good-by, gentlemen. If 
                it's fun, I'll fetch you. You've treated me to some good sport, 
                and I won't forget you.' </p>
              <p> `He really is a capital fellow, isn't he?' said Stepan Arkadyevich 
                when Veslovsky had gone out and the peasant had closed the door 
                after him. </p>
              <p> `Yes, capital,' answered Levin, still thinking of the subject 
                of their conversation just before. It seemed to him that he had 
                clearly expressed his thoughts and feelings to the best of his 
                capacity, and yet both of them, straightforward men and not fools, 
                had said with one voice that he was comforting himself with sophistries. 
                This disconcerted him. </p>
              <p> `It's just this, my dear boy. One must do one of two things: 
                either admit that the existing order of society is just, and then 
                stick up for one's rights in it; or acknowledge that you are enjoying 
                unjust privileges, as I do, and then enjoy them and be satisfied.' 
              </p>
              <p> `No, if it were unjust, you could not enjoy these advantages 
                and be satisfied - at least I could not. The great thing for me 
                is to feel that I'm not to blame.' </p>
              <p> `What do you say - why not go after all?' said Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                evidently weary of the strain of thought. `We shan't go to sleep, 
                you know. Come, let's go!' </p>
              <p> Levin did not answer. What they had said in the conversation 
                that he acted justly only in a negative sense absorbed his thoughts. 
                `Can it be that it's only possible to be just negatively?' he 
                was asking himself. </p>
              <p> `How strong the smell of the fresh hay is, though,' said Stepan 
                Arkadyevich, getting up. `There's not a chance of sleeping. Vassenka 
                has been getting up some fun there. Do you hear the laughter and 
                his voice? Hadn't we better go? Come along!' </p>
              <p> `No, I'm not coming,' answered Levin. </p>
              <p> `Surely that's not a matter of principle too,' said Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                smiling, as he felt about in the dark for his cap. </p>
              <p> `It's not a matter of principle, but why should I go?' </p>
              <p> `But do you know you are preparing trouble for yourself,' said 
                Stepan Arkadyevich, finding his cap and getting up. </p>
              <p> `How so?' </p>
              <p> `Do you suppose I don't see the line you've taken up with your 
                wife? I heard how it's a question of the greatest consequence, 
                whether or not you're to be away for a couple of days' shooting. 
                That's all very well as an idyllic episode, but for your whole 
                life that won't answer. A man must be independent; he has his 
                masculine interests. A man has to be manly,' said Oblonsky, opening 
                the door. </p>
              <p> `In what way? To go running after servant girls?' said Levin. 
              </p>
              <p> `Why not, if it amuses him? ?a ne tire pas à consequence. It 
                won't do my wife any harm, and it'll amuse me. The great thing 
                is to respect the sanctity of the home. There should be nothing 
                in the home. But don't tie your own hands.' </p>
              <p> `Perhaps so,' said Levin dryly, and he turned on his side. `Tomorrow, 
                early, I want to go shooting, and I won't wake anyone, and shall 
                set off at daybreak.' </p>
              <p> `Messieurs, venez vite!' they heard the voice of Veslovsky coming 
                back. `Charmante! I've made such a discovery. Charmante! A perfect 
                Gretchen, and I've already made friends with her. Really, exceedingly 
                pretty,' he declared in a tone of approval, as though she had 
                been made pretty entirely on his account, and he were expressing 
                his satisfaction with the entertainment that had been provided 
                for him. </p>
              <p> Levin pretended to be asleep, while Oblonsky, putting on his 
                slippers, and lighting a cigar, walked out of the barn, and soon 
                their voices were lost. </p>
              <p> For a long while Levin could not get to sleep. He heard his 
                horses munching hay, then he heard the peasant and his elder boy 
                getting ready, and then going off for the night watching, then 
                he heard the soldier arranging his bed on the other side of the 
                barn, with his nephew, the younger son of their peasant host. 
                He heard the boy in his shrill little voice telling his uncle 
                what he thought about the dogs, who seemed to him huge and terrible 
                creatures, and asking what the dogs were going to hunt next day, 
                and the soldier in a husky, sleepy voice, telling him the sportsmen 
                were going in the morning to the marsh, and would shoot with their 
                guns; and then, to check the boy's questions, he said, `Go to 
                sleep, Vaska; go to sleep or you'll catch it,' and soon after 
                he began snoring himself, and everything was still. He could only 
                hear the neigh of the horses, and the guttural cry of a snipe. 
                `Is it really only negative? he repeated to himself. `Well, what 
                of it? It's not my fault.' And he began thinking about the next 
                day. </p>
              <p> `Tomorrow I'll go out early, and I'll make a point of keeping 
                cool. There are lots of snipe; and there are double snipe too. 
                When I come back there'll be the note from Kitty. Yes, Stiva may 
                be right, I'm not manly with her, I'm tied to her apron strings.... 
                Well, it can't be helped! Negative again....' </p>
              <p> Half asleep, he heard the laughter and mirthful talk of Veslovsky 
                and Stepan Arkadyevich. For an instant he opened his eyes: the 
                moon was up, and in the open doorway, brightly lighted up by the 
                moonlight, they were standing talking. Stepan Arkadyevich was 
                saying something of the freshness of one girl, comparing her to 
                a freshly peeled nut, and Veslovsky with his infectious laugh 
                was repeating some words, probably said to him by a peasant: `Ah, 
                you'd better get round your own wife!' Levin, half asleep, said: 
              </p>
              <p> `Gentlemen, tomorrow before daylight!' and fell asleep. </p>

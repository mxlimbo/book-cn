                Going out of the nursery and being again alone, Levin went back 
                at once to the thought, in which there was something not clear. 
              </p>
              <p>Instead of going into the drawing room, where he heard voices, 
                he stopped on the terrace, and, leaning his elbows on the parapet, 
                he gazed up at the sky. </p>
              <p> It was quite dark now, and in the south, where he was looking, 
                there were no clouds. The storm had drifted on to the opposite 
                side of the sky, and there were flashes of lightning and distant 
                thunder from that quarter. Levin listened to the monotonous drip 
                from the linden trees in the garden, and looked at the triangle 
                of stars he knew so well, and the Milky Way with its branches, 
                that ran through its midst. At each flash of lightning the Milky 
                Way, and even the bright stars, vanished, but as soon as the lightning 
                died away, they reappeared in their places as though some hand 
                had flung them back with careful aim. </p>
              <p> `Well, what is it that perplexes me?' Levin said to himself, 
                feeling beforehand that the solution of his difficulties was ready 
                in his soul, though he did not know it yet. </p>
              <p> `Yes, the one unmistakable, incontestable manifestation of the 
                Divinity is the law of right and wrong, which has come into the 
                world by revelation, and which I feel within myself, and in the 
                recognition of which I not so much make myself but, willy-nilly, 
                am made, one with other men in one body of believers, which is 
                called the Church. Well, but the Jews, the Mohammedans, the Confucians, 
                the Buddhists - what of them?' he put to himself the question 
                he had feared to face. `Can these hundreds of millions of men 
                be deprived of that highest blessing without which life has no 
                meaning?' He pondered a moment, but immediately corrected himself. 
                `But what am I questioning?' he said to himself. `I am questioning 
                the relation to Divinity of all the different religions of all 
                mankind. I am questioning the universal manifestation of God to 
                all the world with all these nebulae. What am I about? To me individually, 
                to my heart has been revealed a knowledge beyond all doubt, and 
                unattainable by reason, and here I am obstinately trying to express 
                that knowledge in reason and words. </p>
              <p> `Don't I know that the stars don't move?' he asked himself, 
                gazing at the bright planet which had shifted its position up 
                to the topmost twig of a birch tree. `But looking at the movements 
                of the stars, I can't picture to myself the rotation of the earth, 
                and I'm right in saying that the stars move. </p>
              <p> `And could the astronomers have understood and calculated anything, 
                if they had taken into account all the complicated and varied 
                motions of the earth? - All the marvelous conclusions they have 
                reached about the distances, weights, revolutions, and perturbations 
                of the heavenly bodies, are only founded on the apparent motions 
                of the heavenly bodies round the stationary earth, on that very 
                motion I see before me now, which has been so for millions of 
                men during long ages - has been and always will be alike, and 
                can always be verified. And just as the conclusions of the astronomers 
                would have been vain and uncertain if not founded on observations 
                of the visible heavens, in relation to a single meridian and a 
                single horizon, so would my conclusions be vain and uncertain 
                if not founded on that conception of right, which has been and 
                will always be alike for all men, which has been revealed to me 
                by Christianity, and which can always be verified in my soul. 
                The question of other religions and their relations to Divinity 
                I have no right to decide, and no possibility of deciding.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, you haven't gone in then?' he heard Kitty's voice suddenly, 
                as she came by the same way to the drawing room. `What is it? 
                You're not worried about anything?' she said, looking intently 
                at his face in the starlight. </p>
              <p> But she could not have seen his face if a flash of lightning 
                had not hidden the stars and revealed it. In that flash she saw 
                his face distinctly, and seeing him calm and happy, she smiled 
                at him. </p>
              <p> `She understands,' he thought; `she knows what I'm thinking 
                about. Shall I tell her or not? Yes, I'll tell her.' But at the 
                moment he was about to speak, she began speaking. </p>
              <p> `Kostia! Do something for me,' she said; `go into the corner 
                room and see if they've made it all ready for Sergei Ivanovich. 
                I can't very well. See if they've put the new washstand in it.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Very well, I'll go directly,' said Levin, standing up and kissing 
                her. </p>
              <p> `No, I'd better not speak of it,' he thought, when she had gone 
                in before him. `It is a secret for me alone, of vital importance 
                for me, and not to be put into words. </p>
              <p> `This new feeling has not changed me, has not made me happy 
                and enlightened all of a sudden, as I had dreamed, just like the 
                feeling for my child. There was no surprise in this either. Whether 
                it is faith or not - I don't know what it is - but this feeling 
                has come just as imperceptibly through suffering, and has taken 
                firm root in my soul. </p>
              <p> `I shall go on in the same way, losing my temper with Ivan the 
                coachman, falling into angry discussions, expressing my opinions 
                tactlessly; there will be still the same wall between the holy 
                of holies of my soul and other people, even my wife; I shall still 
                go on scolding her for my own fright and being remorseful for 
                it; I shall still be as unable to understand with my reason why 
                I pray, and I shall still go on praying; but my life now, my whole 
                life apart from anything that can happen to me, every minute of 
                it is no more meaningless, as it was before, but it has the positive 
                meaning of goodness, which I have the power to put into it.' </p>
              <p> </p>

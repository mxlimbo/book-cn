              <p><br>
                The hotel of the provincial town where Nikolai Levin was lying 
                ill was one of those provincial hotels which are constructed on 
                the newest model of modern improvements, with the best intentions 
                of cleanliness, comfort, and even elegance, but, owing to the 
                public that patronizes them, are with astounding rapidity transformed 
                into filthy taverns with a pretension of modern improvement and 
                made by the very pretension worse than the old-fashioned, honestly 
                filthy hotels. This hotel had already reached that stage, and 
                the soldier in a filthy uniform smoking in the entry, supposed 
                to stand for a hall porter, and the cast-iron, perforated, somber 
                and disagreeable staircase, and the free and easy waiter in a 
                filthy dress coat, and the common dining room with a dusty bouquet 
                of wax flowers adorning the table, and filth, dust and disorder 
                everywhere, and, at the same time, the sort of modern, up-to-date, 
                self-complacent, railway uneasiness of this hotel, aroused a most 
                painful feeling in Levin after their fresh young life, especially 
                because the impression of falsity made by the hotel was so out 
                of keeping with what awaited them. <br>
                As is invariably the case, after they had been asked at what price 
                they wanted rooms, it appeared that there was not one decent room 
                for them; one decent room had been taken by the inspector of railroads, 
                another by a lawyer from Moscow, a third by Princess Astafieva 
                just arrived from the country. There remained only one filthy 
                room, next to which they promised that another should be empty 
                by the evening. Feeling angry with his wife because what he had 
                expected had come to pass - that at the moment of arrival, when 
                his heart throbbed with emotion and anxiety to know how his brother 
                was getting on, he should have to be seeing after her, instead 
                of rushing straight to his brother - Levin conducted her to the 
                room assigned them. </p>
              <p> `Go, do go!' she said, looking at him with timid and guilty 
                eyes. </p>
              <p> He went out of the door without a word, and at once stumbled 
                over Marya Nikolaevna, who had heard of his arrival and had not 
                dared to go in to see him. She was just the same as when he had 
                seen her in Moscow; the same woolen gown, and bare arms and neck, 
                and the same good-naturedly stupid, pock-marked face, only a little 
                plumper. </p>
              <p> `Well, how is he? How is he?' </p>
              <p> `Very bad. He can't get up. He has been expecting you all this 
                while. He... Are you... with your wife?' </p>
              <p> Levin did not for the first moment understand what confused 
                her, but she immediately enlightened him. </p>
              <p> `I'll go away. I'll go down to the kitchen,' she brought out. 
                `Nikolai Dmitrievich will be delighted. He heard about it, and 
                knows her, and remembers her abroad.' </p>
              <p> Levin realized that she meant his wife, and did not know what 
                answer to make. </p>
              <p> `Come along, come along to him!' he said. </p>
              <p> But, as soon as he moved, the door of his room opened and Kitty 
                peeped out. Levin crimsoned both from shame and anger at his wife, 
                who had put herself and him in such a difficult position; but 
                Marya Nikolaevna crimsoned still more. She positively shrank together 
                and flushed to the point of tears, and, clutching the ends of 
                her shawl in both hands, twisted them in her red fingers without 
                knowing what to say and what to do. </p>
              <p> For the first instant Levin saw an expression of eager curiosity 
                in the eyes with which Kitty looked at this incomprehensible to 
                her, awful woman; but it lasted only a single instant. </p>
              <p> `Well! How is he?' she turned to her husband and then to her. 
              </p>
              <p> `But one can't go on talking in the passage like this!' Levin 
                said, looking angrily at a gentleman who walked jauntily at that 
                instant across the corridor, as though about his affairs. </p>
              <p> `Well then, come in,' said Kitty, turning to Marya Nikolaevna, 
                who had recovered herself - but, noticing her husband's face of 
                dismay - `or go on; go, and then come for me,' she said, and went 
                back into the room. Levin went to his brother's room. </p>
              <p> He had not in the least expected what he saw and felt in his 
                brother's room. He had expected to find him in the same state 
                of self-deception which he had heard was so frequent with the 
                consumptive, and which had struck him so much during his brother's 
                visit in the autumn. He had expected to find the physical signs 
                of the approach of death more marked - greater weakness, greater 
                emaciation, but still almost the same condition of things. He 
                had expected himself to feel the same distress at the loss of 
                the brother he loved and the same horror in face of death as he 
                had felt then, only in a greater degree. And he had prepared himself 
                for this; but he found something utterly different. </p>
              <p> In a little dirty room with the painted panels of its walls 
                filthy with spittle; with conversation audible from the next room 
                through the thin partition, in a stifling atmosphere saturated 
                with impurities, on a bedstead moved away from the wall, there 
                lay, covered with a quilt, a body. One arm of this body was above 
                the quilt, and the wrist, huge as a rake handle, was attached, 
                inconceivably it seemed, to the thin, long bobbin smooth from 
                the beginning to the middle. The head lay sideways on the pillow. 
                Levin could see the scanty locks wet with sweat on the temples 
                and the tensed, seemingly transparent forehead. </p>
              <p> `It cannot be that that fearful body was my brother Nikolai?' 
                thought Levin. But he went closer, saw the face, and doubt became 
                impossible. In spite of the terrible change in the face, Levin 
                had only to glance at those eager eyes at his approach, only to 
                catch the faint movement of the mouth under the sticky mustache, 
                to realize the terrible truth that this dead body was his living 
                brother. </p>
              <p> The glittering eyes looked sternly and reproachfully at the 
                brother as he drew near. And immediately this glance established 
                a living relationship between living men. Levin immediately felt 
                the reproach in the eyes fixed on him, and felt remorse at his 
                own happiness. </p>
              <p> When Konstantin took him by the hand, Nikolai smiled. The smile 
                was faint, scarcely perceptible, and in spite of the smile the 
                stern expression of the eyes was unchanged. </p>
              <p> `You did not expect to find me like this,' he articulated with 
                effort. </p>
              <p> `Yes... no,' said Levin, hesitating over his words. `How was 
                it you didn't let me know before - that is, at the time of my 
                wedding? I made inquiries in all directions.' </p>
              <p> He had to talk so as not to be silent, and he did not know what 
                to say, especially as his brother made no reply, and simply stared 
                without dropping his eyes, and apparently penetrated to the inner 
                meaning of each word. Levin told his brother that his wife had 
                come with him. Nikolai expressed pleasure, but said he was afraid 
                of frightening her by his condition. A silence followed. Suddenly 
                Nikolai stirred, and began to say something. Levin expected something 
                of peculiar gravity and importance from the expression of his 
                face, but Nikolai began speaking of his health. He found fault 
                with the doctor, regretting he had not a celebrated Moscow doctor. 
                Levin saw that he still had hopes. </p>
              <p> Seizing the first moment of silence, Levin got up, anxious to 
                escape, if only for an instant, from his agonizing emotion, and 
                said that he would go and fetch his wife. </p>
              <p> `Very well, and I'll tell Masha to tidy up here. It's dirty 
                and stinking here, I expect. Masha! Clear up the room,' the sick 
                man said with effort. `And when you've cleared up, you go away,' 
                he added, looking inquiringly at his brother. </p>
              <p> Levin made no answer. Going out into the corridor, he stopped 
                short. He had said he would fetch his wife, but now, taking stock 
                of the emotion he was feeling, he decided that, on the contrary, 
                he would try to persuade her not to go in to the sick man. `Why 
                should she suffer as I am suffering?' he thought. </p>
              <p> `Well, how is he?' Kitty asked with a frightened face. </p>
              <p> `Oh, it's awful, it's awful! What did you come for?' said Levin. 
              </p>
              <p> Kitty was silent for a few seconds, looking timidly and ruefully 
                at her husband; then she went up and took him by the elbow with 
                both hands. </p>
              <p> `Kostia! Take me to him; it will be easier for us to bear it 
                together. Only take me, take me to him, please, and go away,' 
                she said. `You must understand that for me to see you, and not 
                to see him, is far more painful. There I might be a help to you 
                and to him. Please, let me!' she besought her husband, as though 
                the happiness of her life depended on it. </p>
              <p> Levin was obliged to agree, and, regaining his composure, and 
                completely forgetting about Marya Nikolaevna by now, he went again 
                in to his brother with Kitty. </p>
              <p> Stepping lightly, and continually glancing at her husband, showing 
                him a valorous and sympathetic face, Kitty went into the sickroom, 
                and, turning without haste, noiselessly closed the door. With 
                inaudible steps she went quickly to the sick man's bedside, and 
                going up so that he would not have to turn his head, she immediately 
                clasped in her fresh young hand the skeleton of his huge hand, 
                pressed it, and began speaking with that soft eagerness, sympathetic 
                and inoffensive, which is peculiar merely to women. </p>
              <p> `We have met, though we were not acquainted, at Soden,' she 
                said. `You never thought I was to be your sister.' </p>
              <p> `You would not have recognized me?' he said, with a smile which 
                had become radiant at her entrance. </p>
              <p> `Yes, I should. What a good thing you let us know! Not a day 
                has passed that Kostia has not mentioned you, and been anxious.' 
              </p>
              <p> But the sick man's interest did not last long. </p>
              <p> Before she had finished speaking, there had come back into his 
                face the stern, reproachful expression of the dying man's envy 
                of the living. </p>
              <p> `I am afraid you are not quite comfortable here,' she said, 
                turning away from his fixed stare, and looking about the room. 
                `We must ask about another room,' she said to her husband, `so 
                that we might be nearer.' </p>
              <p> </p>

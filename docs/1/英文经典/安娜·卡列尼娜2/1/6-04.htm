              <p><br>
                Varenka, with her white kerchief on her black hair, surrounded 
                by the children, gaily and good-humoredly looking after them, 
                and at the same time visibly excited at the possibility of receiving 
                a declaration from the man she cared for, was very attractive. 
                Sergei Ivanovich walked beside her, and never left off admiring 
                her. Looking at her, he recalled all the delightful things he 
                had heard from her lips, all the good he knew about her, and became 
                more and more conscious that the feeling he had for her was something 
                special that he had felt long, long ago, and only once, in his 
                early youth. The feeling of happiness in being near her continually 
                grew, and at last reached such a point that, as he put a huge, 
                slender-stalked mushroom with rolled brims, in her basket, he 
                looked straight into her face, and noticing the flush of glad 
                and alarmed excitement that overspread her face, he was confused 
                himself, and smiled to her in silence a smile that said too much. 
              </p>
              <p>`If so,' he said to himself, `I ought to think it over and make 
                up my mind, and not give way like a boy to the impulse of a moment.' 
              </p>
              <p> `I'm going to pick by myself apart from all the rest, or else 
                my efforts will make no show,' he said, and he left the edge of 
                the forest where they were walking on low silky grass between 
                old birch trees standing far apart, and went more into the heart 
                of the wood, where between the white birch trunks there were gray 
                trunks of aspen and dark bushes of hazel. Walking some forty paces 
                away, Sergei Ivanovich, knowing he was out of sight, stood still 
                behind a bushy spindle tree in full flower with its rosy-red catkins. 
                It was perfectly still all round him. Only overhead, in the birches 
                under which he stood, the flies, like a swarm of bees, buzzed 
                unceasingly, and from time to time the children's voices floated 
                across to him. All at once he heard, not far from the edge of 
                the wood, the sound of Varenka's contralto voice, calling Grisha, 
                and a smile of delight passed over Sergei Ivanovich's face. Conscious 
                of this smile, he shook his head disapprovingly at his own state 
                and, taking out a cigar, he began lighting it. For a long while 
                he could not get a match to light against the trunk of a birch 
                tree. The soft pellicle of the white bark stuck around the phosphorus, 
                and the light went out. At last one of the matches burned, and 
                the fragrant cigar smoke, hovering uncertainly in flat, wide coils, 
                stretched away forward and upward over a bush under the overhanging 
                branches of a birch tree. Watching the streak of smoke, Sergei 
                Ivanovich walked gently on, deliberating on his position. </p>
              <p> `Why not?' he thought. `If it were only a flash in the pan, 
                or a passion, if it were only this attraction - this mutual attraction 
                (I can call it a mutual attraction), yet if I felt that it was 
                in contradiction with the whole bent of my life; if I felt that 
                in giving way to this attraction I should be false to my vocation 
                and my duty... But it's not so. The only thing I can say against 
                it is that, when I lost Marie, I said to myself that I would remain 
                faithful to her memory. That's the only thing I can say against 
                my feeling.... That's a great thing,' Sergei Ivanovich said to 
                himself, feeling at the same time that this consideration had 
                not the slightest importance for him personally, but would only 
                perhaps detract from his romantic character in the eyes of others. 
                `But apart from that, however much I searched, I should never 
                find anything to say against my feeling. If I were choosing by 
                considerations of intellect alone, I could not have found anything 
                better.' </p>
              <p> However many women and girls he thought of whom he knew, he 
                could not think of a girl who united to such a degree all - positively 
                all - the qualities he would wish to see in his wife. She had 
                all the charm and freshness of youth, but she was not a child; 
                and if she loved him, she loved him consciously, as a woman ought 
                to love; that was one thing. Another point: she was not only far 
                from being worldly, but had an unmistakable distaste for worldly 
                society, and at the same time she knew the world, and had all 
                the ways of a woman of the best society, which were absolutely 
                essential to Sergei Ivanovich's conception of the woman who was 
                to share his life. Thirdly: she was religious, and not like a 
                child, unconsciously religious and good, as Kitty, for example, 
                was, but her life was founded on religious principles. Even in 
                trifling matters, Sergei Ivanovich found in her all that he wanted 
                in his wife: she was poor and alone in the world, so she would 
                not bring with her a mass of relations and their influence into 
                her husband's house, as he saw now in Kitty's case. She would 
                owe everything to her husband, which was what he had always desired, 
                too, for his future family life. And this girl, who united all 
                these qualities, loved him. He was a modest man, but he could 
                not help seeing it. And he loved her. There was one consideration 
                against it - his age. But he came of a long-lived family, he had 
                not a single gray hair, no one would have taken him for forty, 
                and he remembered Varenka's saying that it was only in Russia 
                that men of fifty thought themselves old, and that in France a 
                man of fifty considers himself dans la force de l'age, while a 
                man of forty is un jeune homme. But what did the mere reckoning 
                of years matter when he felt as young in heart as he had been 
                twenty years ago? Was it not youth to feel as he felt now, when 
                coming from the other side to the edge of the wood he saw in the 
                glowing light of the slanting sunbeams the graceful figure of 
                Varenka in her yellow gown with her basket, walking lightly by 
                the trunk of an old birch tree, and when this impression of the 
                sight of Varenka blended so harmoniously with the beauty of the 
                view, of the yellow oat field lying bathed in the slanting sunshine, 
                and, beyond it, the distant ancient forest, flecked with yellow 
                and melting into the blue of the distance? His heart throbbed 
                joyously. A softened feeling came over him. He felt that he had 
                made up his mind. Varenka, who had just crouched down to pick 
                a mushroom, rose with a supple movement and looked round. Flinging 
                away the cigar, Sergei Ivanovich advanced with resolute steps 
                toward her. </p>

              <p><br>
                Never before had a day been passed in quarrel. Today was the first 
                time. And this was not a quarrel. It was the open acknowledgment 
                of complete coldness. Was it possible to glance at her as he had 
                glanced when he came into the room for the guarantee? - to look 
                at her, see her heart was breaking with despair, and go out without 
                a word with that face of callous composure? He was not merely 
                cold to her, he hated her because he loved another woman - that 
                was clear. </p>
              <p>And remembering all the cruel words he had said, Anna supplied, 
                too, the words that he had unmistakably wished to say and could 
                have said to her, and she grew more and more exasperated. </p>
              <p> `I won't prevent you,' he might say. `You can go where you like. 
                You were unwilling to be divorced from your husband, no doubt 
                so that you might go back to him. Go back to him. If you want 
                money, I'll give it to you. How many roubles do you want?' </p>
              <p> All the most cruel words that a brutal man could say, he said 
                to her in her imagination, and she could not forgive him for them, 
                as though he had actually said them. </p>
              <p> `But didn't he only yesterday swear he loved me, he, a truthful 
                and sincere man? Haven't I despaired for nothing many times already?' 
                she said to herself right after this. </p>
              <p> All that day, except for the visit to Wilson's, which occupied 
                two hours, Anna spent in doubts whether everything were over or 
                whether there were still hope of reconciliation; whether she should 
                go away at once or see him once more. She was expecting him the 
                whole day, and in the evening, as she went to her own room, leaving 
                a message for him that her head ached, she said to herself, `If 
                he comes in spite of what the maid says, it means that he loves 
                me still. If not, it means that all is over, and then I will decide 
                what I am to do!...' </p>
              <p> In the evening she heard the rumbling of his carriage stop at 
                the entrance, his ring, his steps, and his conversation with the 
                servant; he believed what was told him, did not care to find out 
                more, and went to his own room. So then, everything was at an 
                end. </p>
              <p> And death rose clearly and vividly before her mind as the sole 
                means of bringing back love for her in his heart, of punishing 
                him and of gaining the victory in that strife which the evil spirit 
                in possession of her heart was waging with him. </p>
              <p> Now nothing mattered: going or not going to Vozdvizhenskoe, 
                getting or not getting a divorce from her husband - all that did 
                not matter. The one thing that mattered was punishing him. </p>
              <p> When she poured herself out her usual dose of opium, and thought 
                that she had only to drink off the whole bottle to die, it seemed 
                to her so simple and easy, that she began musing with enjoyment 
                on how he would suffer, and repent, and love her memory when it 
                would be too late. She lay in bed with open eyes, by the light 
                of a single guttering candle, gazing at the carved cornice of 
                the ceiling and at the shadow of the screen that covered part 
                of it, while she vividly pictured to herself how he would feel 
                when she would be no more, when she would be only a memory to 
                him. `How could I say such cruel things to her?' he would say. 
                `How could I go out of the room without saying anything to her? 
                But now she is no more. She has gone away from us forever. She 
                is...' Suddenly the shadow of the screen wavered, pounced on the 
                whole cornice, the whole ceiling; other shadows from the other 
                side swooped to meet it; for an instant the shadows flitted back, 
                but then with fresh swiftness they darted forward, wavered, mingled, 
                and all was darkness. `Death!' she thought. And such horror came 
                upon her that for a long while she could not realize where she 
                was, and for a long while her trembling hands could not find the 
                matches and light another candle, instead of the one that had 
                burned down and gone out. `No, anything - only to live! Why, I 
                love him! Why, he loves me! This has been before and will pass,' 
                she said, feeling that tears of joy at the return to life were 
                trickling down her cheeks. And to escape from her panic she went 
                hurriedly to his room. </p>
              <p> He was asleep there, and sleeping soundly. She went up to him, 
                and holding the light above his face, she gazed a long while at 
                him. Now when he was asleep, she loved him so that at the sight 
                of him she could not keep back tears of tenderness. But she knew 
                that if he waked up he would look at her with cold eyes, convinced 
                that he was right, and that before telling him of her love, she 
                would have to prove to him that he had been wrong in his treatment 
                of her. Without waking him, she went back, and after a second 
                dose of opium she fell toward morning into a heavy, incomplete 
                sleep, during which she never quite lost consciousness. </p>
              <p> In the morning she was waked by a horrible nightmare, which 
                had recurred several times in her dreams, even before her connection 
                with Vronsky. A little old man with unkempt beard was doing something, 
                stooping over some iron, muttering meaningless French words, and 
                she, as she always did in this nightmare (it was what made the 
                horror of it), felt that this peasant was taking no notice of 
                her, but was doing something horrible with the iron - over her. 
                And she waked up in a cold sweat. </p>
              <p> When she got up, the previous day came back to her as though 
                veiled in mist. </p>
              <p> `There was a quarrel. Just what has happened several times. 
                I said I had a headache, and he did not come in to see me. Tomorrow 
                we're going away; I must see him and get ready for the journey,' 
                she said to herself. And learning that he was in his study, she 
                went down to him. As she passed through the drawing room she heard 
                a carriage stop at the entrance, and looking out of the window 
                she saw the carriage, from which a young girl in a lilac hat was 
                leaning out, giving some direction to the footman who was ringing 
                the bell. After a parley in the hall, someone came upstairs, and 
                Vronsky's steps could be heard passing the drawing room. He went 
                rapidly downstairs. Anna went again to the window. She saw him 
                come out on the steps without his hat and go up to the carriage. 
                The young girl in the lilac hat handed him a parcel. Vronsky, 
                smiling, said something to her. The carriage drove away; he ran 
                rapidly upstairs again. </p>
              <p> The mists that had shrouded everything in her soul parted suddenly. 
                The feelings of yesterday pierced the sick heart with a fresh 
                pang. She could not understand now how she could have lowered 
                herself by spending a whole day with him in his house. She went 
                into his room to announce her determination. </p>
              <p> `That was Madame Sorokina and her daughter. They came and brought 
                me the money and the deeds from maman. I couldn't get them yesterday. 
                How is your head, better?' he said quietly, not wishing to see 
                and to understand the gloomy and solemn expression of her face. 
              </p>
              <p> She looked silently, intently at him, standing in the middle 
                of the room. He glanced at her, frowned for a moment, and went 
                on reading a letter. She turned, and went deliberately out of 
                the room. He still might have turned her back, but she had reached 
                the door, he was still silent, and the only sound audible was 
                the rustling of the note paper as he turned it. </p>
              <p> `Oh, by the way,' he said at the very moment she was in the 
                doorway, `we're going tomorrow for certain, aren't we?' </p>
              <p> `You, but not I,' she said, turning round to him. </p>
              <p> `Anna, we can't go on like this...' </p>
              <p> `You, but not I,' she repeated. </p>
              <p> `This is getting unbearable!' </p>
              <p> `You... You will be sorry for this,' she said, and went out. 
              </p>
              <p> Frightened by the desperate expression with which these words 
                were uttered, he jumped up and would have run after her, but on 
                second thoughts he sat down and scowled, setting his teeth. This 
                vulgar - as he thought it - threat of something vague exasperated 
                him. `I've tried everything,' he thought; `the only thing left 
                is not to pay attention,' and he began to get ready to drive into 
                town, and again to his mother's, to get her signature to the deeds. 
              </p>
              <p> She heard the sound of his steps about the study and the dining 
                room. At the drawing room he stood still. But he did not turn 
                in to see her; he merely gave an order that the horse should be 
                given to Voitov if he came while he was away. Then she heard the 
                carriage brought round, the door opened, and he came out again. 
                But he went back into the porch again, and someone was running 
                upstairs. It was the valet running up for his forgotten gloves. 
                She went to the window and saw him take the gloves without looking, 
                and, touching the coachman on the back, he said something to him. 
                Then, without looking up at the window, he settled himself in 
                his usual attitude in the carriage, with his legs crossed, and, 
                drawing on his gloves, he vanished round the corner. </p>

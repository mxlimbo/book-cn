              <p><br>
                Before Vronsky's departure for the elections, Anna had reflected 
                that the scenes constantly repeated between them each time he 
                left home might only make him cold to her instead of attaching 
                him to her, and resolved to do all she could to control herself 
                so as to bear the parting with composure. But the cold, severe 
                glance with which he had looked at her when he came to tell her 
                he was going had wounded her, and before he had started her peace 
                of mind was destroyed. </p>
              <p>In solitude, later, thinking over that glance which had expressed 
                his right to freedom, she came, as she always did, to the same 
                point - the sense of her own humiliation. `He has the right to 
                go away when and where he chooses. Not simply to go away, but 
                to leave me. He has every right, and I have none. But knowing 
                that, he ought not to do it. What has he done, though?... He looked 
                at me with a cold, severe expression. Of course that is something 
                indefinable, impalpable, but it has never been so before, and 
                that glance means a great deal,' she thought. `That glance shows 
                the beginning of coolness.' </p>
              <p> And though she felt sure that a coolness was beginning, there 
                was nothing she could do; she could not in any way alter her relations 
                to him. Just as before, only by love and by charm could she keep 
                him. And so, just as before, only by occupation in the day, by 
                morphine at night, could she stifle the fearful thought of what 
                would come if he ceased to love her. It is true there was still 
                one means; not to keep him - for that she wanted nothing more 
                than his love - but to be nearer to him, to be in such a position 
                that he would not leave her. That means was divorce and marriage. 
                And she began to long for that, and made up her mind to agree 
                to it the first time he or Stiva approached her on the subject. 
              </p>
              <p> Absorbed in such thoughts, she passed five days without him, 
                the five days that he was to be absent. </p>
              <p> Walks, conversation with Princess Varvara, visits to the hospital, 
                and, most of all, reading - reading of one book after another 
                - filled up her time. But on the sixth day, when the coachman 
                came back without him, and she felt that now she was utterly incapable 
                of stifling the thought of him and of what he was doing there 
                - just at that time her little girl was taken ill. Anna began 
                to look after her, but even that did not distract her mind, especially 
                as the illness was not serious. However hard she tried, she could 
                not love this little child, and to feign love was beyond her powers. 
                Toward the evening of that day, still alone, Anna was in such 
                a panic about him that she decided to start for the town, but 
                on second thought wrote him the contradictory letter that Vronsky 
                received, and, without reading it through, sent it off by a special 
                messenger. The next morning she received his letter and regretted 
                her own. She dreaded a repetition of the severe look he had flung 
                at her at parting, especially when he would learn that the baby 
                was not dangerously ill. But still, she was glad she had written 
                to him. By now Anna was admitting to herself that she was a burden 
                to him, that he would relinquish his freedom regretfully to return 
                to her, and in spite of that she was glad he was coming. Let him 
                weary of her, but he would be here with her, so that she would 
                see him, would know of every action he took. </p>
              <p> She was sitting in the drawing room near a lamp, with a new 
                volume of Taine, and, as she read, listening to the sound of the 
                wind outside, and every minute expecting the carriage to arrive. 
                Several times she had fancied she heard the sound of wheels, but 
                she had been mistaken. At last she heard not the sound of wheels, 
                but the coachman's shout and the dull rumble in the covered entry. 
                Even Princess Varvara, playing solitaire, confirmed this, and 
                Anna, flushing hotly, got up; but, instead of going down, as she 
                had done twice before, she stood still. She suddenly felt ashamed 
                of her duplicity, but even more she dreaded how he might meet 
                her. All feeling of wounded pride had passed now; she was only 
                afraid of the expression of his displeasure. She remembered that 
                her child had been perfectly well again for the last day. She 
                felt positively vexed with her for getting better from the very 
                moment her letter was sent off. Then she thought of him, that 
                he was here - all of him, with his hands, his eyes. She heard 
                his voice. And forgetting everything, she ran joyfully to meet 
                him. </p>
              <p> `Well, how is Annie?' he said apprehensively from below, looking 
                up to Anna as she ran down to him. </p>
              <p> He was sitting on a chair, and a footman was pulling off his 
                warm overboots. </p>
              <p> `Oh, she is better.' </p>
              <p> `And you?' he said, shaking himself. </p>
              <p> She took his hand in both of hers, and drew it to her waist, 
                never taking her eyes off him. </p>
              <p> `Well, I'm glad,' he said, coldly scanning her, her hair, her 
                dress, which he knew she had put on for him. All was charming, 
                but how many times it had charmed him! And the stern, stony expression 
                that she so dreaded settled upon his face. </p>
              <p> `Well, I'm glad. And are you well?' he said, wiping his damp 
                beard with his handkerchief and kissing her hand. </p>
              <p> `Never mind,' she thought, `only let him be here, and so long 
                as he's here he cannot, he dare not, cease to love me.' </p>
              <p> The evening was spent happily and gaily in the presence of Princess 
                Varvara, who complained to him that Anna had been taking morphine 
                in his absence. </p>
              <p> `What am I to do? I couldn't sleep.... My thoughts prevented 
                me. When he's here I never take it - hardly ever.' </p>
              <p> He told her about the election, and Anna knew how by adroit 
                questions to bring him to what gave him most pleasure - his own 
                success. She told him of everything that interested him at home; 
                and all that she told him was of the most cheerful description. 
              </p>
              <p> But late in the evening, when they were alone, Anna, seeing 
                that she had regained complete possession of him, wanted to erase 
                the painful impression of the glance he had given her for her 
                letter. She said: </p>
              <p> `Tell me frankly, you were vexed at getting my letter, and you 
                didn't believe me?' </p>
              <p> As soon as she had said it, she felt that however warm his feelings 
                were to her, he had not forgiven her for that. </p>
              <p> `Yes,' he said, `the letter was so strange. First, Annie ill, 
                and then you thought of coming yourself.' </p>
              <p> `It was all the truth.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, I don't doubt it.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, you do doubt it. You are vexed, I see.' </p>
              <p> `Not for one moment. I'm only vexed, that's true, that you seem 
                somehow unwilling to admit that there are duties...' </p>
              <p> `The duty of going to a concert....' </p>
              <p> `But we won't talk about it,' he said. </p>
              <p> `Why not talk about it?' she said. </p>
              <p> `I only meant to say that matters of real importance may turn 
                up. Now, for instance, I shall have to go to Moscow to arrange 
                about the house.... Oh, Anna, why are you so irritable? Don't 
                you know that I can't live without you?' </p>
              <p> `If so,' said Anna, her voice suddenly changing, `it means that 
                you are sick of this life.... Yes, you will come for a day and 
                go away, as men do....' </p>
              <p> `Anna, that's cruel. I am ready to give up my whole life.' </p>
              <p> But she did not hear him. </p>
              <p> `If you go to Moscow, I will go too. I will not stay here. Either 
                we must separate or else live together.' </p>
              <p> `Why, you know, that's my one desire. But to do that...' </p>
              <p> `We must get a divorce. I will write to him. I see I cannot 
                go on like this.... But I will come with you to Moscow.' </p>
              <p> `You talk as if you were threatening me. But I desire nothing 
                so much as never to be parted from you,' said Vronsky, smiling. 
              </p>
              <p> But as he said these words there gleamed in his eyes not merely 
                a cold look, but the vindictive look of a man persecuted and made 
                cruel. </p>
              <p> She saw the look and correctly divined its meaning. </p>
              <p> `And, if things have come to such a pass, it's a calamity!' 
                that glance told her. It was a moment's impression, but she never 
                forgot it. </p>
              <p> Anna wrote to her husband asking him about a divorce, and toward 
                the end of November, taking leave of Princess Varvara, who wanted 
                to go to Peterburg, she went with Vronsky to Moscow. Expecting 
                every day an answer from Alexei Alexandrovich, and after that 
                the divorce, they now established themselves together, like married 
                people. </p>

              <p><br>
                Almost two months had passed. The hot summer was half over, but 
                Sergei Ivanovich was only just preparing to leave Moscow. </p>
              <p>Sergei Ivanovich's life had not been uneventful during this time. 
                A year ago he had finished his book, the fruit of six years' labor. 
                An Inquiry Concerning the Principles and Forms of Government in 
                Europe and Russia. Several sections of this book and its introduction 
                had appeared in periodical publications, and other parts had been 
                read by Sergei Ivanovich to persons of his circle, so that the 
                leading ideas of the work could not be entirely novel to the public. 
                But still, Sergei Ivanovich had expected that on its appearance 
                his book would be sure to make a serious impression on society, 
                and if it did not cause a revolution in social science it would, 
                at any rate, make a great stir in the scientific world. </p>
              <p> After the most conscientious revision the book had last year 
                been published, and had been distributed among the booksellers. 
              </p>
              <p> Though he asked no one about it, reluctantly and with feigned 
                indifference answered his friends' inquiries as to how the book 
                was going, and did not even inquire of the booksellers how the 
                book was selling, Sergei Ivanovich was all on the alert, with 
                strained attention, watching for the first impression his book 
                would make in the world and in literature. </p>
              <p> But a week passed, a second, a third, and in society no impression 
                whatever could be detected. Those of his friends, who were specialists 
                and savants, occasionally - unmistakably from politeness - alluded 
                to it. The rest of his acquaintances, not interested in a book 
                on a learned subject, did not talk of it at all. And society generally 
                - just now especially absorbed in other things - was absolutely 
                indifferent. In the press, too, for a whole month there was not 
                a word about his book. </p>
              <p> Sergei Ivanovich had calculated to a nicety the time necessary 
                for writing a review, but a month passed, and a second, and still 
                there was silence. </p>
              <p> Only in the Northern Beetle, in a comic article on the singer 
                Drabanti, who had lost his voice, there was a contemptuous allusion 
                to Koznishev's book, suggesting that the book had been long ago 
                seen through by everyone, and was a subject of general ridicule. 
              </p>
              <p> At last, in the third month, a critical article appeared in 
                a serious review. Sergei Ivanovich knew the author of the article. 
                He had met him once at Golubtsov's. </p>
              <p> The author of the article was a young man, an invalid, very 
                bold as a writer, but extremely deficient in breeding and shy 
                in personal relations. </p>
              <p> In spite of his absolute contempt for the author, it was with 
                complete respect that Sergei Ivanovich set about reading the article. 
                The article was awful. </p>
              <p> The critic had undoubtedly put an interpretation upon the book 
                which could not possibly be put on it. But he had selected quotations 
                so adroitly that for people who had not read the book (and obviously 
                scarcely anyone had read it) it seemed absolutely clear that the 
                whole book was nothing but a medley of high-flown phrases, not 
                even - as suggested by marks of interrogation - used appropriately, 
                and that the author of the book was a person absolutely without 
                knowledge of the subject. And all this was so wittily done that 
                Sergei Ivanovich would not have disowned such wit himself. But 
                that was just what was so awful. </p>
              <p> In spite of the scrupulous conscientiousness with which Sergei 
                Ivanovich verified the correctness of the critic's arguments, 
                he did not for a minute stop to ponder over the faults and mistakes 
                which were ridiculed; but unconsciously he began immediately trying 
                to recall every detail of his meeting and conversation with the 
                author of the article. </p>
              <p> `Didn't I offend him in some way?' Sergei Ivanovich wondered. 
              </p>
              <p> And remembering that when they met he had corrected the young 
                man about something he had said that betrayed ignorance, Sergei 
                Ivanovich found the explanation for the trend of the article. 
              </p>
              <p> This article was followed by a deadly silence about the book 
                both in the press and in conversation, and Sergei Ivanovich saw 
                that his six years' task, toiled at with such love and labor, 
                had gone, leaving no trace. </p>
              <p> Sergei Ivanovich's position was still more difficult from the 
                fact that, since he had finished his book, he had had more literary 
                work to do, such as had hitherto occupied the greater part of 
                his time. </p>
              <p> Sergei Ivanovich was clever, cultivated healthy and energetic, 
                and he did not know what use to make of his energy. Conversations 
                in drawing rooms, in meetings, assemblies, and committees - everywhere 
                where talk was possible - took up part of his time. But being 
                used for years to town life, he did not waste all his energies 
                in talk, as his less experienced younger brother did, when he 
                was in Moscow. He had a great deal of leisure and intellectual 
                energy still to dispose of. </p>
              <p> Fortunately for him, at this period so difficult for him because 
                of the failure of his book, the various public questions of the 
                dissenting sects, of the American Friends, of the Samara famine, 
                of exhibition, and of spiritualism, were definitely replaced in 
                public interest by the Slavonic question, which had hitherto rather 
                languidly interested society, and Sergei Ivanovich, who had been 
                one of the first to raise this subject, threw himself into it 
                heart and soul. </p>
              <p> In the circle to which Sergei Ivanovich belonged, nothing was 
                talked of or written about just now but the Servian war. Everything 
                that the idle crowd usually does to kill time was done now for 
                the benefit of the Slavonic peoples. Balls, concerts, dinners, 
                speeches, ladies' dresses, beer, taverns - everything testified 
                to sympathy with the Slavonic peoples. </p>
              <p> From much of what was spoken and written on the subject, Sergei 
                Ivanovich differed on various points. He saw that the Slavonic 
                question had become one of those fashionable distractions which 
                succeed one another in providing society with an object and an 
                occupation. He saw, too, that a great many people were taking 
                up the subject from motives of self-interest and self-advertisement. 
                He recognized that the newspapers published a great deal that 
                was superfluous and exaggerated, with the sole aim of attracting 
                attention and talking one another down. He saw that in this general 
                movement those who thrust themselves most forward and shouted 
                the loudest were men who had failed and were smarting under a 
                sense of injury - generals without armies, ministers not in the 
                ministry, journalists not on any paper, party leaders without 
                followers. He saw that there was a great deal in it that was frivolous 
                and absurd. But he saw and recognized an unmistakable growing 
                enthusiasm, uniting all classes, with which it was impossible 
                not to sympathize. The massacre of men who were fellow Christians, 
                and of the same Slavonic race, excited sympathy for the sufferers 
                and indignation against the oppressors. And the heroism of the 
                Servians and Montenegrins struggling for a great cause begot in 
                the whole people a longing to help their brothers not in word 
                but in deed. </p>
              <p> But in this there was another aspect that made Sergei Ivanovich 
                rejoice. That was the manifestation of public opinion. The public 
                had definitely expressed its desire. The soul of the people had, 
                as Sergei Ivanovich said, found expression. And the more he worked 
                in this cause, the more incontestable it seemed to him that it 
                was a cause destined to assume vast dimensions, to create an epoch. 
              </p>
              <p> He threw himself heart and soul into the service of this great 
                cause, and forgot to think about his book. </p>
              <p> His whole time now was engrossed by it, so that he could scarcely 
                manage to answer all the letters and appeals addressed to him. 
              </p>
              <p> He worked the whole spring and part of the summer, and it was 
                only in July that he prepared to go away to his brother's country 
                place. </p>
              <p> He was going both to rest for a fortnight, and in the very heart 
                of the people, in the farthest wilds of the country, to enjoy 
                the sight of that uplifting of the spirit of the people, of which, 
                like all residents in the capital and big towns, he was fully 
                persuaded. Katavassov had long intended to carry out his promise 
                to stay with Levin, and so he was going with him. </p>

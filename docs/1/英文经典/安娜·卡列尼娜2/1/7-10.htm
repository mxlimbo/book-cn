              <p><br>
                She had risen to meet him, without concealing her pleasure at 
                seeing him; and in the quiet ease with which she held out her 
                little and vigorous hand, introduced him to Vorkuev, and indicated 
                a red-haired, pretty little girl who was sitting at work, calling 
                her her pupil, Levin recognized and liked the manners of a woman 
                of the great world, always self-possessed and natural. <br>
                `I am delighted, delighted,' she repeated, and on her lips these 
                simple words took for Levin's ears a special significance. `I 
                have known you and liked you for a long while, both from your 
                friendship with Stiva and for your wife's sake.... I knew her 
                for a very short time, but she left on me the impression of an 
                exquisite flower - just a flower. And to think she will soon be 
                a mother!' </p>
              <p> She spoke easily and without haste, looking now and then from 
                Levin to her brother, and Levin felt that the impression he was 
                making was good, and he felt immediately at home, at ease and 
                happy with her, as though he had known her from childhood. </p>
              <p> `Ivan Petrovich and I settled in Alexei's study,' she said in 
                answer to Stepan Arkadyevich's question whether he might smoke, 
                `just so as to be able to smoke' - and glancing at Levin, instead 
                of asking whether he would smoke, she pulled closer a tortoise-shell 
                cigarette case and took a corn-leaf cigarette. </p>
              <p> `How are you feeling today?' her brother asked her. </p>
              <p> `Oh, nothing. Nerves, as usual.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, isn't it extraordinarily fine?' said Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                noticing that Levin was glancing at the picture. </p>
              <p> `I have never seen a better portrait.' </p>
              <p> `And extraordinarily like, isn't it?' said Vorkuev. </p>
              <p> Levin looked from the portrait to the original. A peculiar brilliance 
                lighted up Anna's face when she felt his eyes on her. Levin flushed, 
                and to cover his confusion would have asked whether she had seen 
                Darya Alexandrovna lately; but at that moment Anna spoke: </p>
              <p> `We were just talking, Ivan Petrovich and I, of Vashchenkov's 
                last pictures. Have you seen them?' </p>
              <p> `Yes, I have seen them,' answered Levin. </p>
              <p> `But, I beg your pardon, I interrupted you... You were saying?...' 
              </p>
              <p> Levin asked if she had seen Dolly lately. </p>
              <p> `She was here yesterday. She was very indignant with the high 
                school people on Grisha's account. The Latin teacher, it seems, 
                had been unfair to him.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, I have seen his pictures. I didn't care for them very 
                much,' Levin went back to the subject she had started. </p>
              <p> Levin talked now not at all with that purely businesslike attitude 
                to the subject with which he had been talking all the morning. 
                Every word in his conversation with her had a special significance. 
                And talking to her was pleasant; still pleasanter was it to listen 
                to her. </p>
              <p> Anna talked not merely naturally and cleverly, but cleverly 
                and carelessly, attaching no value to her own ideas and giving 
                great weight to the ideas of the person she was talking to. </p>
              <p> The conversation turned on the new movement in art, on the new 
                illustrations of the Bible by a French artist. Vorkuev attacked 
                the artist for a realism carried to the point of coarseness. Levin 
                said that the French had carried conventionality further than 
                anyone, and that consequently they see a great merit in the return 
                to realism. In the fact of not lying they see poetry. </p>
              <p> Never had anything clever said by Levin given him so much pleasure 
                as this remark. Anna's face lighted up at once, as she immediately 
                appreciated the thought. She laughed. </p>
              <p> `I laugh,' she said, `as one laughs when one sees a very true 
                portrait. What you said so perfectly hits off French art now, 
                painting - and literature too, indeed - Zola, Daudet. But perhaps 
                it is always so, that men form their conceptions from fictitious, 
                conventional types, and then - all the combinaisons made - they 
                are tired of the fictitious figures and begin to invent more natural, 
                true figures.' </p>
              <p> `That's perfectly true,' said Vorkuev. </p>
              <p> `So you've been at the club?' she said to her brother. </p>
              <p> `Yes, yes, this a woman!' Levin thought, forgetting himself 
                and staring persistently at her lovely, mobile face, which at 
                that moment was all at once completely transformed. Levin did 
                not hear what she was talking of as she leaned over to her brother, 
                but he was struck by the change of her expression. Her face - 
                so handsome a moment before in its repose - suddenly wore a look 
                of strange curiosity, anger, and pride. But this lasted only an 
                instant. She half-closed her eyes, as though recollecting something. 
              </p>
              <p> `Oh, well, but that's of no interest to anyone,' she said, and 
                she turned to the English girl. </p>
              <p> `Please order the tea in the drawing room,' she said in English. 
              </p>
              <p> The girl got up and went out. </p>
              <p> `Well, how did she get through her examination?' asked Stepan 
                Arkadyevich. </p>
              <p> `Splendidly! She's a very gifted child and a sweet character.' 
              </p>
              <p> `It will end in your loving her more than your own.' </p>
              <p> `There a man speaks. In love there's no such thing as more or 
                less. I love my daughter with one love, and her with another.' 
              </p>
              <p> `I was just telling Anna Arkadyevna,' said Vorkuev, `that if 
                she were to put a hundredth part of the energy she devotes to 
                this English girl to the public question of the education of Russian 
                children, she would be doing a great and useful work.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, but I can't help it; I couldn't do it. Count Alexei Kirillovich 
                urged me very much' (as she uttered the words Count Alexei Kirillovich 
                she glanced with appealing timidity at Levin, and he unconsciously 
                responded with a respectful and reassuring look), `he urged me 
                to take up the school in the village. I visited it several times. 
                The children were very dear, but I could not feel drawn to the 
                work. You speak of energy. Energy rests upon love; and, come as 
                it will, there's no forcing it. I took to this child - I could 
                not myself say why.' </p>
              <p> And she glanced again at Levin. And her smile and her glance 
                - all told him that it was to him only she was addressing her 
                words, valuing his good opinion, and at the same time sure beforehand 
                that they understood one another. </p>
              <p> `I quite understand that,' Levin answered. `It's impossible 
                to give one's heart to a school or such institutions in general, 
                and I believe that that's just why philanthropic institutions 
                always give such poor results.' </p>
              <p> She was silent for a while, then she smiled. `Yes, yes,' she 
                agreed; `I never could. Je n'ai pas le coeur assez large to love 
                a whole asylum of horrid little girls. Cela ne m'a jamais réussi. 
                There are so many women who have made themselves une position 
                sociale in that way. And now more than ever,' she said with a 
                mournful, confiding expression, ostensibly addressing her brother, 
                but unmistakably intending her words only for Levin, `now when 
                I have such need of some occupation, I cannot.' And suddenly frowning 
                (Levin saw that she was frowning at herself for talking about 
                herself) she changed the subject. `I know about you,' she said 
                to Levin; `that you're not a public-spirited citizen, and I have 
                defended you to the best of my ability.' </p>
              <p> `How have you defended me?' </p>
              <p> `Oh, according to the attacks made on you. But won't you have 
                some tea?' She rose and took up a book bound in morocco. </p>
              <p> `Give it to me, Anna Arkadyevna,' said Vorkuev, indicating the 
                book. `It's well worth taking up.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, no, it's all so sketchy.' </p>
              <p> `I told him about it,' Stepan Arkadyevich said to his sister, 
                nodding at Levin. </p>
              <p> `You shouldn't have. My writing is something after the fashion 
                of those little baskets and carvings which Liza Mertsalova used 
                to sell me from the prisons. She had the direction of the prison 
                department in that society,' she turned to Levin; `and they were 
                miracles of patience, the work of those poor wretches.' </p>
              <p> And Levin saw a new trait in this woman, who attracted him so 
                extraordinarily. Besides wit, grace, and beauty, she had truth. 
                She had no wish to hide from him all the bitterness of her position. 
                As she said that she sighed, and her face, suddenly assuming a 
                hard expression, looked, as it were, turned to stone. With that 
                expression on her face she was more beautiful than ever; but the 
                expression was new; it was utterly unlike that expression, radiant 
                with happiness and creating happiness, which had been caught by 
                the painter in her portrait. Levin looked more than once at the 
                portrait and at her figure, as taking her brother's arm she walked 
                with him to the high doors, and he felt for her a tenderness and 
                pity at which he wondered himself. </p>
              <p> She asked Levin and Vorkuev to go into the drawing room, while 
                she stayed behind to say a few words to her brother. `About her 
                divorce, about Vronsky, and what he's doing at the club, about 
                me?' wondered Levin. And he was so keenly interested by the question 
                of what she was saying to Stepan Arkadyevich, that he scarcely 
                heard what Vorkuev was telling him of the qualities of the story 
                for children Anna Arkadyevna had written. </p>
              <p> At tea the same pleasant sort of talk, full of interesting matter, 
                continued. There was not a single instant when a subject for conversation 
                was to seek; on the contrary, it was felt that one had hardly 
                time to say what one had to say, and eagerly held back to hear 
                what the others were saying. And all that was said, not only by 
                her, but by Vorkuev and Stepan Arkadyevich - all, so it seemed 
                to Levin, gained peculiar significance from her attention to him 
                and her criticism. </p>
              <p> While he followed this interesting conversation, Levin was all 
                the time admiring her - her beauty, her intelligence, her culture, 
                and at the same time her directness and her cordiality. He listened 
                and talked, and all the while he was thinking of her inner life, 
                trying to divine her feelings. And though he had judged her so 
                severely hitherto, now by some strange chain of reasoning he was 
                justifying her and also was sorry for her, and afraid that Vronsky 
                did not fully understand her. At ten o'clock, when Stepan Arkadyevich 
                got up to go (Vorkuev had left earlier), it seemed to Levin that 
                he had only just come. Regretfully Levin too rose. </p>
              <p> `Good-by,' she said, holding his hand and glancing into his 
                face with a winning look. `I am very glad que la glace est rompue.' 
              </p>
              <p> She dropped his hand, and half-closed her eyes. </p>
              <p> `Tell your wife that I love her as before, and that if she cannot 
                pardon me my position, then my wish for her is that she may never 
                pardon me. To pardon it, one must go through what I have gone 
                through, and may God spare her that.' </p>
              <p> `Certainly, yes, I will tell her...' Levin said, blushing. </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br>
                `No, I think the Princess is tired, and horses don't interest 
                her,' Vronsky said to Anna, who wanted to go on to the stud farm, 
                where Sviiazhsky wished to see the new stallion. `You go on, while 
                I escort the Princess home, and we'll have a little talk,' he 
                said. `If you would like that?' he added, turning to her. <br>
                `I know nothing about horses, and I shall be delighted to go back 
                with you,' answered Darya Alexandrovna, rather astonished. </p>
              <p> She saw by Vronsky's face that he wanted something from her. 
                She was not mistaken. As soon as they had passed through the little 
                gate back into the garden, he looked in the direction Anna had 
                taken, and, having made sure that she could neither hear nor see 
                them, he began: </p>
              <p> `You guess that I have something I want to say to you,' he said, 
                looking at her with laughing eyes. `I am not wrong in believing 
                you to be a friend of Anna's.' He took off his hat, and taking 
                out his handkerchief, wiped his head, which was growing bald. 
              </p>
              <p><br>
                Darya Alexandrovna made no answer, and merely stared at him with 
                dismay. When she was left alone with him, she suddenly felt afraid; 
                his laughing eyes and stern expression scared her. </p>
              <p> The most diverse suppositions as to what he was about to say 
                to her flashed into her brain. `He is going to beg me to come 
                to stay with them with the children, and I shall have to refuse; 
                or to create a set that will receive Anna in Moscow.... Or isn't 
                it Vassenka Veslovsky and his relations with Anna? Or perhaps 
                about Kitty - that he feels he was to blame?' All her conjectures 
                were unpleasant, but she did not guess what he really wanted to 
                talk about to her. </p>
              <p> `You have so much influence with Anna, she is so fond of you,' 
                he said; `do help me.' </p>
              <p> Darya Alexandrovna looked with timid inquiry into his energetic 
                face, which under the linden trees was continually being lighted 
                up in patches by the sunshine, and then passing into complete 
                shadow again. She waited for him to say more, but he walked in 
                silence beside her, scratching with his cane in the gravel. </p>
              <p> `You have come to see us, you, the only woman of Anna's former 
                friends - I don't count Princess Varvara - but I know that you 
                have done this not because you regard our position as normal, 
                but because, understanding all the difficulty of the position, 
                you still love her and want to be a help to her. Have I understood 
                you rightly?' he asked, looking round at her. </p>
              <p> `Oh, yes,' answered Darya Alexandrovna, putting down her sunshade, 
                `but...' </p>
              <p> `No,' he broke in, and unconsciously, oblivious of the awkward 
                position in which he was putting his companion, he stopped abruptly, 
                so that she had to stop short too. `No one feels more deeply and 
                intensely than I do all the difficulty of Anna's position; and 
                that you may well understand, if you do me the honor of supposing 
                I have any heart. I am to blame for that position, and that is 
                why I feel it.' </p>
              <p> `I understand,' said Darya Alexandrovna, involuntarily admiring 
                the sincerity and firmness with which he said this. `But just 
                because you feel yourself responsible, you exaggerate it, I am 
                afraid,' she said. `Her position in the world is difficult, I 
                can well understand.' </p>
              <p> `In the world it is hell!' he brought out quickly, frowning 
                darkly. `You can't imagine moral sufferings greater than what 
                she went through in Peterburg during that fortnight.... And I 
                beg you to believe it.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, but here, so long as neither Anna... nor you want society...' 
              </p>
              <p> `Society!' he said contemptuously. `How could I want society?' 
              </p>
              <p> `So far - and it may be so always - you are happy and at peace. 
                I see in Anna that she is happy, perfectly happy - she has had 
                time to tell me so much already,' said Darya Alexandrovna, smiling; 
                and involuntarily, as she said this, at the same moment a doubt 
                entered her mind whether Anna really were happy. </p>
              <p> But Vronsky, it appeared, had no doubts on that score. </p>
              <p> `Yes, yes,' he said, `I know that she has revived after all 
                her sufferings; she is happy. She is happy in the present. But 
                I?... I am afraid of what is before us... I beg your pardon - 
                you would like to walk on?' </p>
              <p> `No, I don't mind.' </p>
              <p> `Well, then, let us sit here.' </p>
              <p> Darya Alexandrovna sat down on a garden seat in a corner of 
                the avenue. He stood up, facing her. </p>
              <p> `I see that she is happy,' he repeated, and the doubt whether 
                she were happy sank more deeply into Darya Alexandrovna's mind. 
                `But can it last? Whether we have acted rightly or wrongly is 
                another question, but the die is cast,' he said, passing from 
                Russian to French, `and we are bound together for life. We are 
                united by all the ties of love that we hold most sacred. We have 
                a child, we may have other children. But the law and all the conditions 
                of our position are such that thousands of complications arise 
                which she does not see at present, and does not want to see, setting 
                her heart at rest after all these sufferings and ordeals. And 
                that one can well understand. But I can't help seeing them. My 
                daughter is by law not my daughter, but Karenin's. I cannot bear 
                this falsity!' he said, with a vigorous gesture of refusal, and 
                he looked with gloomy inquiry toward Darya Alexandrovna. </p>
              <p> She made no answer, but simply gazed at him. He went on: </p>
              <p> `One day a son may be born, my son, and he will be legally a 
                Karenin; he will not be the heir of my name nor of my property; 
                and however happy we may be in our home life, and however many 
                children we may have, there will be no real tie between us. They 
                will be Karenin's. You will understand the bitterness and horror 
                of this position! I have tried to speak of this to Anna. It irritates 
                her. She does not understand, and to her I cannot speak plainly 
                of all this. Now look at another side. I am happy, happy in her 
                love, but I must have occupation. I have found occupation, and 
                am proud of what I am doing, and consider it nobler than the pursuits 
                of my former companions at Court and in the army. And most certainly 
                I would not change the work I am doing for theirs. I am working 
                here, settled in my own place, and I am happy and contented, and 
                we need nothing more to make us happy. I love my work here. Ce 
                n'est pas un pis-aller , on the contrary...' </p>
              <p> Darya Alexandrovna noticed that at this point in his explanation 
                he grew confused, and she did not quite understand this digression, 
                but she felt that having once begun to speak of matters near his 
                heart, of which he could not speak to Anna, he was now making 
                a clean breast of everything, and that the question of his pursuits 
                in the country fell into the same compartment of his intimate 
                meditations as the question of his relations with Anna. </p>
              <p> `Well, I will go on,' he said, collecting himself. `The great 
                thing is that as I work I want to have a conviction that what 
                I am doing will not die with me, that I shall have heirs to come 
                after me - and this I have not. Conceive the position of a man 
                who knows that his children, the children of the woman he loves, 
                will not be his, but will belong to someone who hates them and 
                cares nothing about them! It is awful! </p>
              <p> He paused, evidently much moved. </p>
              <p> `Yes, indeed, I see that. But what can Anna do?' queried Darya 
                Alexandrovna. </p>
              <p> `Yes, that brings me to the object of my conversation,' he said, 
                calming himself with an effort. `Anna can, it depends on her.... 
                Even to petition the Czar for legitimization, a divorce is essential. 
                And that depends on Anna. Her husband agreed to a divorce - at 
                that time your husband had arranged it completely. And now, I 
                know, he would not refuse it. It is only a matter of writing to 
                him. He said plainly at that time that if she expressed the desire, 
                he would not refuse. Of course,' he said gloomily, `it is one 
                of those Pharisaical cruelties of which only such heartless men 
                are capable. He knows what agony any recollection of him must 
                give her, and knowing her, he must have a letter from her. I can 
                understand that it is agony to her. But the matter is of such 
                importance, that one must passer pardessus toutes ces finesses 
                de sentiment. Il y va du bonheur et de l'existence d'Anne et de 
                ses enfants. I won't speak of myself, though it's hard for me, 
                very hard,' he said, with an expression as though he were threatening 
                someone for its being hard for him. `And so it is, Princess, that 
                I am shamelessly clutching at you as an anchor of salvation. Help 
                me to persuade her to write to him and ask for a divorce.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, of course,' Darya Alexandrovna said dreamily, as she vividly 
                recalled her last interview with Alexei Alexandrovich. `Yes, of 
                course,' she repeated with decision, thinking of Anna. </p>
              <p> `Use your influence with her, make her write. I don't like - 
                I'm almost unable to speak about this to her.' </p>
              <p> `Very well, I will talk to her. But how is it she does not think 
                of it herself?' said Darya Alexandrovna, and for some reason she 
                suddenly at that point recalled Anna's strange new habit of half-closing 
                her eyes. And she remembered that Anna drooped her eyelids just 
                when the deeper questions of life were touched upon. `Just as 
                though she half-shut her eyes to her own life, so as not to see 
                everything,' thought Dolly. `Yes, indeed, for my own sake and 
                for hers, I will talk to her,' Dolly said in reply to his expression 
                of gratitude. </p>
              <p> They got up and walked to the house. </p>

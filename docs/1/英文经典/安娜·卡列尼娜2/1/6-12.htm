              <p><br>
                Waking up at earliest dawn, Levin tried to wake his companions. 
                Vassenka, lying on his stomach, with one leg in a stocking thrust 
                out, was sleeping so soundly that he could elicit no response. 
                Oblonsky, half asleep, declined to get up so early. Even Laska, 
                who was asleep, curled up in the hay, got up unwillingly, and 
                lazily stretched out and straightened her hind legs one after 
                the other. Getting on his boots, taking his gun, and carefully 
                opening the creaking door of the barn, Levin went out into the 
                road. The coachmen were sleeping near their carriages; the horses 
                were dozing. Only one was lazily eating oats, scattering them 
                in the manger when snorting. It was still gray out-of-doors. </p>
              <p>`Why are you up so early, my dear?' the old woman, their hostess, 
                said, coming out of the hut and addressing him affectionately 
                as an old friend. </p>
              <p> `Going shooting, auntie. Do I go this way to the marsh?' </p>
              <p> `Straight out at the back; by our threshing floor, my dear, 
                and hemp patches; there's a little footpath.' </p>
              <p> Stepping carefully with her sunburned, bare feet, the old woman 
                conducted Levin, and moved back the gate for him by the threshing 
                floor. </p>
              <p> `Straight ahead, and you'll come to the marsh. Our lads drove 
                the horses there yesterday evening.' </p>
              <p> Laska ran eagerly forward along the little path. Levin followed 
                her with a light, rapid step, continually looking at the sky. 
                He hoped the sun would not be up before he reached the marsh. 
                But the sun did not delay. The moon, which had been bright when 
                he went out, by now shone only like a crescent of quicksilver. 
                The rosy flush of dawn, which one could not help seeing before, 
                now had to be sought to be discerned at all. What before had been 
                undefined, vague blurs in the distant countryside, could now be 
                distinctly seen. They were sheaves of rye. The dew, not visible 
                till the sun was up, wetted Levin's legs and his blouse above 
                his belt in the high-growing, fragrant hemp patch, from which 
                the male plants had already been gathered in. In the transparent 
                stillness of morning the smallest sounds were audible. A bee flew 
                by Levin's ear with the whizzing sound of a bullet. He looked 
                carefully, and saw a second and a third. They were all flying 
                from the beehives behind the hedge, and they disappeared over 
                the hemp patch in the direction of the marsh. The path led straight 
                to the marsh. The marsh could be recognized by the mist which 
                rose from it, thicker in one place and thinner in another, so 
                that the sedge and willow bushes swayed like islands in this mist. 
                At the edge of the marsh and the road peasant boys and men, who 
                had been herding for the night, were lying, and in the dawn all 
                were asleep under their coats. Not far from them were three hobbled 
                horses. One of them clanked a chain. Laska walked beside her master, 
                pressing a little forward and looking round. Passing the sleeping 
                peasants and reaching the first reeds, Levin examined his percussion 
                caps and unleashed his dog. One of the horses, a sleek, dark-brown 
                three-year-old, seeing the dog, started away, switched its tail 
                and snorted. The other horses too were frightened, and splashing 
                through the water with their hobbled legs, and drawing their hoofs 
                out of the thick mud with a squelching sound, they bounded out 
                of the marsh. Laska stopped, looking ironically at the horses 
                and inquiringly at Levin. Levin patted Laska, and whistled as 
                a sign that she might begin. </p>
              <p> Laska ran joyfully and anxiously through the quagmire that quaked 
                under her. </p>
              <p> Running into the marsh among the familiar scents of roots, marsh 
                plants, and dross, and the extraneous smell of horse manure, Laska 
                detected at once a smell that pervaded the whole marsh, the scent 
                of that strong-smelling bird that always excited her more than 
                any other. Here and there among the moss and marsh plants this 
                scent was very strong, but it was impossible to determine in which 
                direction it grew stronger or fainter. To find the direction, 
                she had to get farther away from the wind. Not feeling the motion 
                of her legs, Laska bounded with a still gallop, so that at each 
                bound she could stop short, to the right, away from the wind that 
                blew from the east before sunrise, and turned facing the wind. 
                Sniffing in the air with dilated nostrils, she felt at once that 
                not their traces only, but they themselves, were here before her 
                - not one, but many. Laska slackened her speed. They were here, 
                but where precisely she could not yet determine. To find the very 
                spot, she began to make a circle, when suddenly her master's voice 
                drew her off. `Laska! Here!' he said, pointing her to a different 
                direction. She stopped, asking him if she had better not go on 
                doing as she had begun. But he repeated his command in an angry 
                voice, pointing to a hummock spot covered with water, where there 
                could not be anything. She obeyed him, pretending she was searching 
                so as to please him, went round it, and went back to her former 
                position, and was at once aware of the scent again. Now when he 
                was not hindering her, she knew what to do, and, without looking 
                at what was under her feet, and to her vexation stumbling over 
                a hummock into the water, but righting herself with her strong, 
                supple legs, she began making the circuit which was to make all 
                clear to her. The scent of them reached her, stronger and stronger, 
                and more and more defined, and all at once it became perfectly 
                clear to her that one of them was here, behind this hummock, five 
                paces in front of her; she stopped, and her whole body was still 
                and rigid. On her short legs she could see nothing in front of 
                her, but by the scent she knew it was sitting not more than five 
                paces off. She stood still, feeling more and more conscious of 
                it, and enjoying it in anticipation. Her tail was stretched straight 
                and tense, and only wagged at the extreme tip. Her mouth was slightly 
                open, her ears raised. One ear had been turned wrong side out 
                as she ran up, and she breathed heavily but warily, and still 
                more warily she turned around, but more with her eyes than her 
                head, to her master. He was coming along with the face she knew 
                so well, though the eyes were always terrible to her. He stumbled 
                over the hummocks as he came, and moved, as she thought, extraordinarily 
                slowly. She thought he came slowly, but he was running. </p>
              <p> Noticing Laska's special attitude as she crouched on the ground, 
                as it were, scratching big prints with her hind paws, and with 
                her mouth slightly open, Levin knew she was pointing at double 
                snipe, and with an inward prayer for luck, especially with the 
                first bird, he ran up to her. Coming quite close up to her, he 
                could from his height look beyond her, and he saw with his eyes 
                what she was seeing with her nose. In a space between two little 
                hummocks, at a couple of yards' distance, he could see a double 
                snipe. Turning its head, it was listening. Then lightly preening 
                and folding its wings, it disappeared round a corner with a clumsy 
                wag of its tail. </p>
              <p> `Fetch it, fetch it!' shouted Levin, giving Laska a shove from 
                behind. </p>
              <p> `But I can't go,' thought Laska. `Where am I to go? From here 
                I feel them, but if I move forward I shall know nothing of where 
                they are, or who they are.' But then he shoved her with his knee, 
                and in an excited whisper said, `Fetch it, Lassochka, fetch it.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Well, if that's what he wishes, I'll do it, but I can't answer 
                for myself now,' she thought, and darted forward as fast as her 
                legs would carry her between the hummocks. She scented nothing 
                now; she could only see and hear, without understanding anything. 
              </p>
              <p> Ten paces from her former place a double snipe rose with a guttural 
                cry and the peculiar convex sound of its wings. And immediately 
                after the shot it splashed heavily with its white breast on the 
                wet mire. Another bird did not linger, but rose behind Levin, 
                without the dog's offices. </p>
              <p> When Levin turned toward it, it was already some way off. But 
                his shot caught it. Flying twenty paces farther, the second double 
                snipe rose upward, and, whirling round like a ball, dropped heavily 
                on a dry place. </p>
              <p> `Come, this is going to be some good!' thought Levin, packing 
                the warm and fat snipe into his gamebag. `Eh, Laska, will it be 
                good?' </p>
              <p> When Levin, after reloading his gun, moved on, the sun had fully 
                risen, though unseen behind clouds. The moon had lost all of its 
                luster, and was like a white cloud in the sky. Not a single star 
                could be seen. The soggy places, silvery with dew before, now 
                shone like gold. The rusty pools were all like amber. The blue 
                of the grass had changed to yellow green. The marsh birds twittered 
                and swarmed about the brook and upon the bushes that glittered 
                with dew and cast long shadows. A hawk woke up and settled on 
                a haycock, turning its head from side to side and looking discontentedly 
                at the marsh. Crows were flying about the field, and a barelegged 
                boy was driving the horses to an old man, who had got up from 
                under his long coat and was combing his hair. The smoke from the 
                gun was white as milk over the green of the grass. </p>
              <p> One of the boys ran up to Levin. </p>
              <p> `Uncle, there were ducks here yesterday!' he shouted to him, 
                and he walked a little way off behind him. </p>
              <p> And Levin was doubly pleased, in sight of the boy, who expressed 
                his approval, at killing three jacksnipe, one after another, straight 
                off. </p>

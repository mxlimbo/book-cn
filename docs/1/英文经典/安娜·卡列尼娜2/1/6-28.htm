              <p><br>
                Levin was standing rather far off. A nobleman breathing heavily 
                and hoarsely at his side, and another whose thick boots were creaking, 
                prevented him from hearing distinctly. He could only hear the 
                soft voice of the marshal faintly, then the shrill voice of the 
                venomous gentleman, and then the voice of Sviiazhsky. They were 
                disputing, as far as he could make out, as to the interpretation 
                to be put on the act and the exact meaning of the words: `liable 
                to be called up for trial.' </p>
              <p>The crowd parted to make way for Sergei Ivanovich approaching 
                the table. Sergei Ivanovich, waiting till the venomous gentleman 
                had finished speaking, said that he thought the best solution 
                would be to refer to the act itself, and asked the secretary to 
                find the act. The act said that in case of difference of opinion, 
                there must be a ballot. </p>
              <p> Sergei Ivanovich read the act and began to explain its meaning, 
                but at that point a tall, stout, stoop-shouldered landowner, with 
                dyed mustache, in a tight uniform that made the back of his neck 
                bulge up, interrupted him. He went up to the table, and striking 
                it with his finger ring, he shouted loudly: </p>
              <p> `A ballot! Put it to the vote! No need for more talking!' </p>
              <p> Then several voices began to talk all at once, and the tall 
                nobleman with the ring, getting more and more exasperated, shouted 
                more and more loudly. But it was impossible to make out what he 
                said. </p>
              <p> He was shouting for the very course Sergei Ivanovich had proposed; 
                but it was evident that he hated him and all his party, and this 
                feeling of hatred spread through the whole party and roused in 
                opposition to it the same vindictiveness, though in a more seemly 
                form, on the other side. Shouts were raised, and for a moment 
                all was confusion, so that the marshal of the province had to 
                call for order. </p>
              <p> `A ballot! A ballot! Whoever is a nobleman understands! We shed 
                our blood for our country!... The confidence of the Monarch.... 
                No checking of the accounts of the marshal - he's not a cashier!... 
                But that's not the point.... Votes, please! What vileness!...' 
                shouted furious and violent voices on all sides. Looks and faces 
                were even more violent and furious than their words. They expressed 
                the most implacable hatred. Levin did not in the least understand 
                what it was all about, and he marveled at the passion with which 
                it was disputed whether or not the decision about Fliorov should 
                be put to the vote. He forgot, as Sergei Ivanovich explained to 
                him afterward, this syllogism: that it was necessary for the public 
                good to get rid of the marshal of the province; that to get rid 
                of the marshal it was necessary to have a majority of votes; that 
                to get a majority of votes it was necessary to secure Fliorov's 
                right to vote; that to secure the recognition of Fliorov's right 
                to vote they must decide on the interpretation to be put on the 
                act. </p>
              <p> `And one vote may decide the whole question, and one must be 
                serious and consecutive, if one wants to be of use in public life,' 
                concluded Sergei Ivanovich. But Levin forgot all that, and it 
                was painful to him to see all these excellent persons, for whom 
                he had respect, in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement. 
                To escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other 
                room where there was nobody except the waiters at the refreshment 
                bar. Seeing the waiters busy washing up the crockery and setting 
                in order their plates and wineglasses, seeing their alert and 
                vivacious faces, Levin felt an unexpected sense of relief, as 
                though he had come out of a stuffy room into the fresh air. He 
                began walking up and down, looking with pleasure at the waiters. 
                He particularly liked the way one gray-whiskered waiter, who showed 
                his scorn for the other younger ones, and was jeered at by them, 
                was teaching them how to fold napkins properly. Levin was just 
                about to enter into conversation with the old waiter, when the 
                secretary of the court of wardship, a little old man whose speciality 
                it was to know all the noblemen of the province by name and patronymic, 
                drew him away. </p>
              <p> `Please come, Konstantin Dmitrievich,' he said, `your brother's 
                looking for you. They are voting on the legal point.' </p>
              <p> Levin walked into the room, received a white ball, and followed 
                his brother, Sergei Ivanovich, to the table where Sviiazhsky was 
                standing with a significant and ironical face, holding his beard 
                in his fist and sniffing at it. Sergei Ivanovich put his hand 
                into the box, put the ball somewhere, and, making room for Levin, 
                stopped. Levin advanced, but utterly forgetting what he was to 
                do, and much embarrassed, he turned to Sergei Ivanovich with the 
                question, `Where am I to put it?' He asked this softly, at a moment 
                when there was talking going on near, so that he had hoped his 
                question would not be overheard. But the persons speaking paused, 
                and his improper question was overheard. Sergei Ivanovich frowned. 
              </p>
              <p> `That is a matter for each man's own decision,' he said severely. 
              </p>
              <p> Several people smiled. Levin crimsoned, hurriedly thrust his 
                hand under the cloth, and put the ball to the right as it was 
                in his right hand. Having put it in, he recollected that he ought 
                to have thrust his left hand in too, and so he thrust it in though 
                too late, and, still more overcome with confusion, he beat a hasty 
                retreat into the background. </p>
              <p> `A hund'ed and twenty-six fo' admission! Ninety-eight against!' 
                sang out the voice of the secretary, who could not pronounce the 
                letter r. Then there was a laugh; a button and two hazelnuts were 
                found in the box. The nobleman was allowed the right to vote, 
                and the new party had conquered. </p>
              <p> But the old party did not consider themselves conquered. Levin 
                heard that they were asking Snetkov to be candidate, and he saw 
                that a crowd of noblemen was surrounding the marshal, who was 
                saying something. Levin went nearer. In reply Snetkov spoke of 
                the trust the noblemen of the province had placed in him, the 
                affection they had shown him, which he did not deserve, as his 
                only merit had been his attachment to the nobility, to whom he 
                had devoted twelve years of service. Several times he repeated 
                the words: `I have served to the best of my powers with truth 
                and good faith; I value your goodness and thank you,' and suddenly 
                he stopped short from the tears that choked him, and went out 
                of the room. Whether these tears came from a sense of the injustice 
                being done him, from his love for the nobility, or from the strain 
                of the position he was placed in, feeling himself surrounded by 
                enemies, his emotion infected the assembly, the majority were 
                touched, and Levin felt a tenderness for Snetkov. </p>
              <p> In the doorway the marshal of the province jostled against Levin. 
              </p>
              <p> `Beg pardon - excuse me, please,' he said as to a stranger, 
                but, recognizing Levin, he smiled timidly. It seemed to Levin 
                that he would have liked to say something, but could not speak 
                for emotion. His face and his whole figure in his uniform with 
                the crosses, and white trousers striped with galloons, as he moved 
                hurriedly along, reminded Levin of some hunted beast who sees 
                that he is in evil plight. This expression on the marshal's face 
                was particularly touching to Levin, because, only the day before, 
                he had been at his house about his guardianship business and had 
                seen him in all his grandeur, a kindhearted, fatherly man. The 
                big house with the old family furniture; the rather slovenly, 
                far from stylish, but respectful footmen - unmistakably old house 
                serfs who had stuck to their master; the stout, good-natured wife 
                in a cap with lace and a Turkish shawl, petting her pretty grandchild, 
                her daughter's daughter; the young son, a sixth-form high school 
                boy, coming home from school, and greeting his father by kissing 
                his big hand; the genuine, cordial words and gestures of the old 
                man - all this had the day before roused an instinctive feeling 
                of respect and sympathy in Levin. This old man was a touching 
                and pathetic figure to Levin now, and he longed to say something 
                pleasant to him. </p>
              <p> `So you're our marshal again,' he said. </p>
              <p> `It's not likely,' said the marshal, looking round with a scared 
                expression. `I'm worn-out, I'm old. If there are men younger and 
                more deserving than I, let them serve.' </p>
              <p> And the marshal disappeared through a side door. </p>
              <p> The most solemn moment was at hand. They were to proceed immediately 
                to the election. The leaders of both parties were reckoning white 
                and black on their fingers. </p>
              <p> The discussion upon Fliorov had given the new party not only 
                Fliorov's vote, but had also gained time for them, so that they 
                could send to fetch three noblemen who had been rendered unable 
                to take part in the elections by the wiles of the other party. 
                Two noble gentlemen, who had a weakness for strong drink, had 
                been made drunk by the partisans of Snetkov, and a third had been 
                relieved of his uniform. </p>
              <p> On learning this, the new party had made haste, during the dispute 
                about Fliorov, to send some of their men in a cab to clothe the 
                stripped gentleman, and to bring along one of the intoxicated 
                to the meeting. </p>
              <p> `I've brought one after bringing him to by throwing water - 
                over him,' said the landowner who had gone on this errand, to 
                Sviiazhsky. `Never mind - he'll do.' </p>
              <p> `Not too drunk - he won't fall down?' said Sviiazhsky, shaking 
                his head. </p>
              <p> `No, he's first-rate. If only they don't give him any more here.... 
                I've told the barman not to give him anything, on any account.' 
              </p>

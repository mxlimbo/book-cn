              <p><br>
                After a capital dinner and a great deal of cognac drunk at Bartniansky's, 
                Stepan Arkadyevich, only a little later than the appointed time, 
                went in to Countess Lidia Ivanovna's. </p>
              <p>`Who else is with the countess? A Frenchman?' Stepan Arkadyevich 
                asked the hall porter, as he glanced at the familiar overcoat 
                of Alexei Alexandrovich and a queer, rather na?ve-looking overcoat 
                with clasps. </p>
              <p> `Alexei Alexandrovich Karenin and Count Bezzubov,' the porter 
                answered austerely. </p>
              <p> `Princess Miaghkaia guessed right,' thought Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                as he went upstairs. `Curious! It would be quite as well, though, 
                to get on friendly terms with her. She has immense influence. 
                If she would say a word to Pomorsky, the thing would be a certainty.' 
              </p>
              <p> It was still quite light out-of-doors, but in Countess Lidia 
                Ivanovna's little drawing room the blinds were drawn and the lamps 
                lighted. </p>
              <p> At a round table under a lamp sat the Countess and Alexei Alexandrovich, 
                talking softly. A short, thinnish man, very pale and handsome, 
                with feminine hips and knock-kneed legs, with fine brilliant eyes 
                and long hair lying on the collar of his coat, was standing at 
                the other end of the room gazing at the portraits on the wall. 
                After greeting the lady of the house and Alexei Alexandrovich, 
                Stepan Arkadyevich could not resist glancing once more at the 
                unknown man. </p>
              <p> `Monsieur Landau!' the Countess addressed him with a suavity 
                and circumspection that impressed Oblonsky. And she introduced 
                them. </p>
              <p> Landau looked round hurriedly, came up, and, smiling, laid his 
                moist, lifeless hand in Stepan Arkadyevich's outstretched hand 
                and immediately walked away, and fell to gazing at the portraits 
                again. The Countess and Alexei Alexandrovich looked at each other 
                significantly. </p>
              <p> `I am very glad to see you, particularly today,' said Countess 
                Lidia Ivanovna, pointing out to Stepan Arkadyevich a seat beside 
                Karenin. </p>
              <p> `I introduced you to him as Landau,' she said in a soft voice, 
                glancing at the Frenchman and again immediately after at Alexei 
                Alexandrovich, `but he is really Count Bezzubov, as you're probably 
                aware. Only he does not like the title.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, I heard so,' answered Stepan Arkadyevich; `they say he 
                completely cured Countess Bezzubova.' </p>
              <p> `She was here today, poor thing!' the Countess said, turning 
                to Alexei Alexandrovich. `This separation is awful for her. It's 
                such a blow to her!' </p>
              <p> `And he positively is going?' queried Alexei Alexandrovich. 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, he's going to Paris. He heard a voice yesterday,' said 
                Countess Lidia Ivanovna, looking at Stepan Arkadyevich. </p>
              <p> `Ah, a voice!' repeated Oblonsky, feeling that he must be as 
                circumspect as he possibly could in this society, where something 
                peculiar was happening, or was about to happen, to which he had 
                not the key. </p>
              <p> A moment's silence followed, after which Countess Lidia Ivanovna, 
                as though approaching the main topic of conversation, said with 
                a fine smile to Oblonsky: </p>
              <p> `I've known you for a long while, and am very glad to make a 
                closer acquaintance with you. Les amis de nos amis sont nos amis. 
                But to be a true friend, one must enter into the spiritual state 
                of one's friend, and I fear that you are not doing so in the case 
                of Alexei Alexandrovich. You understand what I mean?' she said, 
                lifting her fine pensive eyes. </p>
              <p> `In part, Countess, I understand the position of Alexei Alexandrovich...' 
                said Oblonsky. Having no clear idea what they were talking about, 
                he wanted to confine himself to generalities. </p>
              <p> `The change is not in his external position,' Countess Lidia 
                Ivanovna said sternly, following with eyes of love the figure 
                of Alexei Alexandrovich as he got up and crossed over to Landau; 
                `his heart is changed, a new heart has been vouchsafed him, and 
                I fear you don't fully apprehend the change that has taken place 
                in him.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, well, in general outlines I can conceive the change. We 
                have always been friendly, and now...' said Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                responding with a sympathetic glance to the expression of the 
                Countess, and mentally balancing the question with which of the 
                two ministers she was more intimate, so as to know which to have 
                her speak to. </p>
              <p> `The change that has taken place in him cannot lessen his love 
                for his neighbors; on the contrary, that change can only intensify 
                love in his heart. But I am afraid you do not understand me. Won't 
                you have some tea?' she said, with her eyes indicating the footman, 
                who was handing round tea on a tray. </p>
              <p> `Not quite, Countess. Of course, his misfortune...' </p>
              <p> `Yes, a misfortune which has proved the highest happiness, when 
                his heart was made new, was filled to the full with it,' she said, 
                gazing with eyes full of love at Stepan Arkadyevich. </p>
              <p> `I do believe I might ask her to speak to both of them,' thought 
                Stepan Arkadyevich. </p>
              <p> `Oh, of course, Countess,' he said; `but I imagine such changes 
                are a matter so private that no one, even the most intimate friend, 
                would care to speak of them.' </p>
              <p> `On the contrary! We ought to speak freely and help one another.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, undoubtedly so, but there is such a difference of convictions, 
                and besides...' said Oblonsky with a soft smile. </p>
              <p> `There can be no difference where it is a question of holy truth.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Oh, no, of course; but...' and Stepan Arkadyevich paused in 
                confusion. He understood at last that they were talking of religion. 
              </p>
              <p> `I fancy he will go into a trance immediately,' said Alexei 
                Alexandrovich in a whisper full of meaning, going up to Lidia 
                Ivanovna. </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich looked round. Landau was sitting at the window, 
                leaning on his elbow and the back of his chair, his head drooping. 
                Noticing that all eyes were turned on him, he raised his head 
                and smiled a smile of childlike artlessness. </p>
              <p> `Don't take any notice,' said Lidia Ivanovna, and she lightly 
                moved a chair up for Alexei Alexandrovich. `I have observed...' 
                she was beginning, when a footman came into the room with a letter. 
                Lidia Ivanovna rapidly ran her eyes over the note, and, excusing 
                herself, wrote an answer with extraordinary rapidity, handed it 
                to the man, and came back to the table. `I have observed,' she 
                went on, `that Moscow people, especially the men, are more than 
                all others indifferent to religion.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, no, Countess, I thought Moscow people had the reputation 
                of being the firmest in the faith,' answered Stepan Arkadyevich. 
              </p>
              <p> `But as far as I can make out, you are unfortunately one of 
                the indifferent ones,' said Alexei Alexandrovich, turning to him 
                with a weary smile. </p>
              <p> `How anyone can be indifferent!' said Lidia Ivanovna. </p>
              <p> `I am not so much indifferent on that subject as I am waiting 
                in suspense,' said Stepan Arkadyevich, with his most deprecating 
                smile. `I hardly think that the time for such questions has come 
                yet for me.' </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich and Lidia Ivanovna looked at each other. 
              </p>
              <p> `We can never tell whether the time has come for us or not,' 
                said Alexei Alexandrovich sternly. `We ought not to think whether 
                we are ready or not ready. God's grace is not guided by human 
                considerations: sometimes it comes not to those who strive for 
                it, and comes to those who are unprepared, like Saul.' </p>
              <p> `No, I believe it won't be just yet,' said Lidia Ivanovna, who 
                had been meanwhile watching the movements of the Frenchman. Landau 
                got up and came to them. </p>
              <p> `Do you allow me to listen?' he asked. </p>
              <p> `Oh, yes; I did not want to disturb you,' said Lidia Ivanovna, 
                gazing tenderly at him; `sit here with us.' </p>
              <p> `One has only not to close one's eyes to shut out the light,' 
                Alexei Alexandrovich went on. </p>
              <p> `Ah, if you knew the happiness we know, feeling His presence 
                ever in our hearts!' said Countess Lidia Ivanovna with a rapturous 
                smile. </p>
              <p> `But a man may feel himself inapt sometimes to rise to that 
                height,' said Stepan Arkadyevich, conscious of hypocrisy in admitting 
                this religious height, but at the same time unable to bring himself 
                to acknowledge his freethinking views before a person who, by 
                a single word to Pomorsky, might procure him the coveted appointment. 
              </p>
              <p> `That is, you mean that sin keeps him back?' said Lidia Ivanovna. 
                `But that is a false idea. There is no sin for believers, their 
                sin has been atoned for. Pardon,' she added, looking at the footman, 
                who came in again with another letter. She read it and gave a 
                verbal answer: `Tomorrow at the Grand Duchess's, say. - For the 
                believer sin is not,' she went on. </p>
              <p> `Yes, but faith without works is dead,' said Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                recalling the phrase from the catechism, and only by his smile 
                clinging to his independence. </p>
              <p> `There you have it - from the epistle of St. James,' said Alexei 
                Alexandrovich, addressing Lidia Ivanovna, with a certain reproachfulness 
                in his tone. It was unmistakably a subject they had discussed 
                more than once before. `What harm has been done by the false interpretation 
                of that passage! Nothing holds men back from belief like that 
                misinterpretation. ``I have not works, so I cannot believe,' though 
                all the while that's not what is said, but the very opposite.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Striving for God, saving the soul by fasting,' said Countess 
                Lidia Ivanovna, with disgusted contempt, `those are the crude 
                ideas of our monks.... Yet that is nowhere said. It is far simpler 
                and easier,' she added, looking at Oblonsky with the same encouraging 
                smile with which at Court she encouraged youthful maids of honor, 
                disconcerted by the new surroundings of the Court. </p>
              <p> `We are saved by Christ who suffered for us. We are saved by 
                faith,' Alexei Alexandrovich chimed in, with a glance of approval 
                at her words. </p>
              <p> `Vous comprenez l'anglais?' asked Lidia Ivanovna, and receiving 
                a reply in the affirmative, she got up and began looking through 
                a shelf of books. </p>
              <p> `I want to read him Safe and Happy, or Under the Wing,' she 
                said, looking inquiringly at Karenin. And finding the book, and 
                sitting down again in her place, she opened it. `It's very short. 
                In it is described the way by which faith can be reached, and 
                the happiness, above all earthly bliss, with which it fills the 
                soul. The believer cannot be unhappy because he is not alone. 
                But you will see.' She was just settling herself to read when 
                the footman came in again. `Madame Borozdina? Tell her tomorrow, 
                at two o'clock. Yes,' she said, marking the place in the book 
                by inserting a finger, and gazing before her with her fine pensive 
                eyes, `that is how true faith acts. You know Marie Sanina? You 
                know about her trouble? She lost her only child. She was in despair. 
                And what happened? She found this comforter, and she thanks God 
                now for the death of her child. Such is the happiness faith brings!' 
              </p>
              <p> `Oh, yes, that is most...' said Stepan Arkadyevich, glad they 
                were going to read, and let him have a chance to collect his faculties. 
                `No, I see I'd better not ask her about anything today,' he thought. 
                `If only I can get out of this without putting my foot in it!' 
              </p>
              <p> `It will be dull for you,' said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, addressing 
                Landau; `you don't know English - but it's short.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, I shall understand,' said Landau, with the same smile, 
                and he closed his eyes. </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich and Lidia Ivanovna exchanged meaning glances, 
                and the reading began. </p>

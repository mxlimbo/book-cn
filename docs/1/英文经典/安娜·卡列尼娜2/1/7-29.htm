                Anna got into the carriage again in an even worse frame of mind 
                than when she set out from home. To her previous tortures was 
                added now that sense of mortification and of being an outcast, 
                which she had felt so distinctly on meeting Kitty. </p>
              <p>`Where to? Home?' asked Piotr. </p>
              <p> `Yes, home,' she said, not even thinking now where she was going. 
              </p>
              <p> `How they looked at me as something dreadful, incomprehensible, 
                and curious! What can he be telling the other with such warmth?' 
                she thought, staring at two men who walked by. `Can one ever tell 
                anyone what one is feeling? I meant to tell Dolly, and it's a 
                good thing I didn't tell her. How pleased she would have been 
                at my misery! She would have concealed it, but her chief feeling 
                would have been delight at my being punished for the happiness 
                she envied me for. Kitty - she would have been even more pleased. 
                How I can see through her! She knows I was more than usually kind 
                to her husband. And she's jealous and hates me. And she despises 
                me. In her eyes I'm an immoral woman. If I were an immoral woman 
                I could have made her husband fall in love with me.... If I'd 
                cared to. And, indeed, I did care to. There's someone who's pleased 
                with himself,' she thought, as she saw a fat, rubicund gentleman 
                coming toward her. He took her for an acquaintance, and lifted 
                his glossy hat above his bald, glossy head, and then perceived 
                his mistake. `He thought he knew me. Well, he knows me as well 
                as anyone in the world knows me. I don't know myself. I know my 
                appetites, as the French say. They want that hokey-pokey, that 
                they do know for certain,' she thought, looking at two boys stopping 
                an ice-cream seller, who took a barrel off his head and began 
                wiping his perspiring face with a towel. `We all want what is 
                sweet and tastes good. If there are no sweetmeats, then a hokey-pokey 
                will do. And Kitty's the same - if not Vronsky, then Levin. And 
                she envies me. And hates me. And we all hate each other. I Kitty 
                - Kitty me. Yes, that's the truth. Tiutkin, coiffeur.... Je me 
                fais coiffer par Tiutkin.... I'll tell him that when he comes,' 
                she thought and smiled. But the same instant she remembered that 
                she had no one now to tell anything amusing to. `And there's nothing 
                amusing, nothing mirthful, really. It's all hateful. Vesper bells 
                - and how carefully that merchant crosses himself! As if he were 
                afraid of missing something. Why these churches, and these bells, 
                and this humbug? Simply to conceal that we all hate each other 
                like these cabdrivers, who are abusing each other so angrily. 
                Iashvin says, ``He wants to strip me of my shirt, and I wish him 
                the same.' Yes, that's the truth!' </p>
              <p> She was plunged in these thoughts, which so engrossed her that 
                she left off thinking of her own position, when the carriage drew 
                up at the steps of her house. It was only when she saw the porter 
                running out to meet her that she remembered she had sent the note 
                and the telegram. </p>
              <p> `Is there any answer?' she inquired. </p>
              <p> `I'll see this minute,' answered the porter, and, glancing into 
                his room, he took out and gave her the thin square envelope of 
                a telegram. `I can't come before ten o'clock. - Vronsky,' she 
                read. </p>
              <p> `And hasn't the messenger come back?' </p>
              <p> `No,' answered the porter. </p>
              <p> `Then, since it's so, I know what I must do,' she said, and 
                feeling a vague fury and craving for revenge rising up within 
                her, she ran upstairs. `I'll go to him myself. Before going away 
                forever, I'll tell him all. Never have I hated anyone as I hate 
                that man!' she thought. Seeing his hat on the rack, she shuddered 
                with aversion. She did not consider that this telegram was an 
                answer to her telegram and that he had not yet received her note. 
                She pictured him to herself as talking calmly to his mother and 
                Princess Sorokina, and rejoicing at her sufferings. `Yes, I must 
                go quickly,' she said, not knowing yet where she was going. She 
                longed to get away as quickly as possible from the feelings she 
                had gone through in that awful house. The servants, the walls, 
                the things in that house - all aroused repulsion and hatred in 
                her and lay like a weight upon her. </p>
              <p> `Yes, I must go to the railway station, and if he's not there, 
                then go there and catch him.' Anna looked at the railway timetable 
                in the newspapers. An evening train went at two minutes past eight. 
                `Yes, I shall be in time.' She gave orders for the other horses 
                to be put in the carriage, and packed in a traveling bag the things 
                needed for a few days. She knew she would never come back here 
                again. </p>
              <p> Among the plans that came into her head she vaguely determined 
                that after what would happen at the station or at the Countess's 
                house, she would go as far as the first town on the Nizhny-Novgorod 
                railway and stop there. </p>
              <p> Dinner was on the table; she went up, but the smell of the bread 
                and cheese was enough to make her feel that all food was disgusting. 
                She ordered the carriage and went out. The house threw a shadow 
                now right across the street, but it was a bright evening and still 
                warm in the sunshine. Annushka, who came down with her things, 
                and Piotr, who put the things in the carriage, and the coachman, 
                evidently out of humor, were all hateful to her, and irritated 
                her by their words and actions. </p>
              <p> `I don't want you, Piotr.' </p>
              <p> `But how about the ticket?' </p>
              <p> `Well, as you like, it doesn't matter,' she said crossly. </p>
              <p> Piotr jumped on the box, and putting his arms akimbo, told the 
                coachman to drive to the station. </p>

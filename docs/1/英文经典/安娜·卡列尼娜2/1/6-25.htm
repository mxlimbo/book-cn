              <p><br>
                Vronsky and Anna spent the whole summer and part of the autumn 
                in the country, living in just the same condition, and still taking 
                no steps to obtain a divorce. It was a decided thing between them 
                that they should not go away anywhere; but both felt, the longer 
                they lived alone, especially in the autumn, and without guests 
                in the house, that they could not stand this existence, and that 
                they would have to change it. </p>
              <p>Their life was apparently such that nothing better could be desired. 
                They had the fullest abundance of everything; they had a child, 
                and both had occupation. Anna devoted just as much care to her 
                appearance when they had no visitors, and she did a great deal 
                of reading, both of novels and of what serious literature was 
                in fashion. She ordered all the books that were praised in the 
                foreign papers and journals she received, and read them with that 
                concentrated attention which is only given to what is read in 
                seclusion. Moreover, every subject that was of interest to Vronsky, 
                she studied in books and special journals, so that he often went 
                straight to her with questions relating to agriculture or architecture, 
                sometimes even with questions relating to horse breeding or sport. 
                He was amazed at her knowledge, her memory, and at first was disposed 
                to doubt it, to ask for confirmation of her facts; and she would 
                find what he asked for in some book, and show it to him. </p>
              <p> The building of the hospital, too, interested her. She did not 
                merely assist, but planned and suggested a great deal herself. 
                But her chief thought was still of herself - how far she was dear 
                to Vronsky, how far she could make up to him for all he had given 
                up. Vronsky appreciated this desire not only to please, but to 
                serve him, which had become the sole aim of her existence, but 
                at the same time he wearied of the loving snares in which she 
                tried to hold him fast. As time went on, and he saw himself more 
                and more often held fast in these snares, he had an ever-growing 
                desire, not so much to escape from them, as to try whether they 
                hindered his freedom. Had it not been for this growing desire 
                to be free, not to have scenes every time he wanted to go to the 
                town to a session or a race, Vronsky would have been perfectly 
                satisfied with his life. The role he had taken up, the role of 
                a wealthy landowner, one of that class which ought to be the very 
                heart of the Russian aristocracy, was entirely to his taste; and 
                now, after spending six months in that role, he derived even greater 
                satisfaction from it. And his management of his estate, which 
                occupied and absorbed him more and more, was most successful. 
                In spite of the immense sums which the hospital, the machinery, 
                the cows ordered from Switzerland, and many other things, cost 
                him, he was convinced that he was not wasting but increasing his 
                substance. In all matters affecting income, the sales of timber, 
                wheat, and wool, the letting of lands, Vronsky was hard as a rock, 
                and knew well how to keep up prices. In all operations on a large 
                scale on this and his other estates, he kept to the simplest methods 
                involving no risk, and in trifling details he was careful and 
                exacting to an extreme degree. In spite of all the cunning and 
                ingenuity of the German steward, who would try to tempt him into 
                purchases by making his original estimate always far larger than 
                really required, and then representing to Vronsky that he might 
                get the thing cheaper, and so make a profit, Vronsky did not give 
                in. He listened to his steward, cross-examined him, and only agreed 
                to his suggestions when the implement to be ordered or constructed 
                was the very newest, not yet known in Russia, and likely to excite 
                wonder. Apart from such exceptions, he resolved upon an increased 
                outlay only where there was a surplus, and in making such an outlay 
                he went into the minutest details, and insisted on getting the 
                very best for his money; so that by the method on which he managed 
                his affairs, it was clear that he was not wasting, but increasing 
                his substance. </p>
              <p> In October there were the provincial nobility elections in the 
                Kashinsky province, where were the estates of Vronsky, Sviiazhsky, 
                Koznishev, Oblonsky, and a small part of Levin's land. </p>
              <p> These elections were attracting public attention from several 
                circumstances connected with them, and also from the people taking 
                part in them. There had been a great deal of talk about these 
                elections, and great preparations were being made for them. Persons 
                who never attended the elections were coming from Moscow, from 
                Peterburg, and from abroad to attend these. </p>
              <p> Vronsky had long before promised Sviiazhsky to go to them. </p>
              <p> Before the elections Sviiazhsky, who often visited Vozdvizhenskoe, 
                drove over to fetch Vronsky. </p>
              <p> On the day before there had been almost a quarrel between Vronsky 
                and Anna over this proposed expedition. It was the very dullest 
                autumn weather, which is so dreary in the country, and so, preparing 
                himself for a struggle, Vronsky, with a hard and cold expression, 
                informed Anna of his departure as he had never spoken to her before. 
                But, to his surprise, Anna accepted the information with great 
                composure, and merely asked when he would be back. He looked intently 
                at her, at a loss to explain this composure. She smiled at his 
                look. He knew that way she had of withdrawing into herself, and 
                knew that it only happened when she had determined upon something 
                without letting him know her plans. He was afraid of this; but 
                he was so anxious to avoid a scene that he kept up appearances, 
                and half sincerely believed in what he longed to believe in - 
                her reasonableness. </p>
              <p> `I hope you won't be dull?' </p>
              <p> `I hope not,' said Anna. `I got a box of books yesterday from 
                Gautier's. No, I shan't be dull.' </p>
              <p> `She's trying to take that tone, and so much the better,' he 
                thought, `or else it would be the same thing over and over again.' 
              </p>
              <p> And he set off for the elections without appealing to her for 
                a candid explanation. It was the first time since the beginning 
                of their intimacy that he had parted from her without a full explanation. 
                From one point of view this troubled him, but on the other side 
                he felt that it was better so. `At first there will be, as this 
                time, something undefined, kept back, and then she will get used 
                to it. In any case I can give up anything for her, but not my 
                masculine independence,' he thought. </p>

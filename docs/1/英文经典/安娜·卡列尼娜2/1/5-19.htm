              <p align="center" class="h">Chapter 19</p>
              <p><br>
                `Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast 
                revealed them unto babes.' So Levin thought about his wife as 
                he talked to her that evening. <br>
                Levin thought of the text, not because he considered himself `wise 
                and prudent.' He did not consider himself wise and prudent, but 
                he could not help knowing that he had more intellect than his 
                wife and Agathya Mikhailovna, and he could not help knowing that 
                when he thought of death, he thought with all the force of his 
                intellect. He knew too that the brains of many great men, whose 
                thoughts he had read, had brooded over death and yet knew not 
                a hundredth part of what his wife and Agathya Mikhailovna knew 
                about it. Different as those two women were, Agathya Mikhailovna 
                and Katia, as his brother Nikolai had called her, and as Levin 
                particularly liked to call her now, they were quite alike in this. 
                Both knew, without a shade of doubt, what sort of thing life was, 
                and what was death, and though neither of them could have answered, 
                and would not even have understood the questions that presented 
                themselves to Levin, both had no doubt of the significance of 
                this event, and were precisely alike in their way of looking at 
                it, which they shared with millions of people. The proof that 
                they knew for a certainty the nature of death lay in the fact 
                that they knew without a second of hesitation how to deal with 
                the dying, and were not frightened by them. Levin, and other men 
                like him, though they could have said a great deal about death, 
                obviously did not know this since they were afraid of death, and 
                were absolutely at a loss what to do when people were dying. If 
                Levin had been alone now with his brother Nikolai, he would have 
                looked at him with terror, and with still greater terror waited, 
                and would not have known what else to do. </p>
              <p> More than that, he did not know what to say, how to look, how 
                to move. To talk of outside things seemed to him shocking, impossible; 
                to talk of death and depressing subjects - also impossible. To 
                be silent was also impossible. `If I look at him he will think 
                I am studying him, I am afraid of him; if I don't look at him, 
                he'll think I'm thinking of other things. If I walk on tiptoe, 
                he will be vexed; to tread firmly, I'm ashamed.' Kitty evidently 
                did not think of herself, and had no time to think about herself: 
                she was thinking about him because she knew something, and all 
                went well. She even told him about herself and about her wedding, 
                and smiled and sympathized with him, and petted him, and talked 
                of cases of recovery, and all went well; therefore, she must know. 
                The proof that her behavior and Agathya Mikhailovna's was not 
                instinctive, animal, irrational, lay in that apart from the physical 
                treatment, the relief of suffering, both Agathya Mikhailovna and 
                Kitty required for the dying man something else more important 
                than the physical treatment, and something which had nothing in 
                common with physical conditions. Agathya Mikhailovna, speaking 
                of a man recently dead, had said: `Well, thank God, he took the 
                sacrament and received Extreme Unction; God grant each one of 
                us such a death.' Katia, in just the same way, besides all her 
                care about linen, bedsores, drink, found time the very first day 
                to persuade the sick man of the necessity of taking the sacrament 
                and receiving Extreme Unction. </p>
              <p> On getting back from the sickroom to their own two rooms for 
                the night, Levin sat with hanging head, not knowing what to do. 
                To say nothing of supper, of preparing for bed, of considering 
                what they were going to do, he could not even talk to his wife; 
                he was ashamed to. Kitty, on the contrary, was more active than 
                usual. She was even livelier than usual. She ordered supper to 
                be brought, herself unpacked their things, and herself helped 
                to make the beds, and did not even forget to sprinkle them with 
                Persian insecticide. She showed that alertness, that swiftness 
                of reflection which comes out in men before a battle, in conflict, 
                in the dangerous and decisive moments of life - those moments 
                when a man shows once and for all his value, and that all his 
                past has not been wasted but has been a preparation for these 
                moments. </p>
              <p> Everything went rapidly in her hands, and before it was twelve 
                o'clock all their things were arranged tidily and orderly in such 
                a way that the hotel rooms seemed like home, like her rooms: the 
                beds were made, brushes, combs, looking glasses were put out, 
                table napkins were spread. </p>
              <p> Levin felt that it was unpardonable to eat, to sleep, to talk 
                even now, and it seemed to him that every movement he made was 
                unseemly. She arranged the brushes, but she did it all so that 
                there was nothing shocking in it. </p>
              <p> They could neither of them eat, however, and for a long while 
                they could not sleep, and did not even go to bed. </p>
              <p> `I am very glad I persuaded him to receive Extreme Unction tomorrow,' 
                she said, sitting in her dressing jacket before her folding looking 
                glass, combing her soft, fragrant hair with a small-toothed comb. 
                `I have never seen it, but I know, mamma has told me, there are 
                prayers said for recovery.' </p>
              <p> `Do you suppose he can possibly recover?' said Levin, watching 
                a slender tress at the back of her round little head that was 
                continually hidden when she passed the comb through the front. 
              </p>
              <p> `I asked the doctor; he said he couldn't live more than three 
                days. But can they be sure? I'm very glad, anyway, that I persuaded 
                him,' she said, looking askance at her husband through her hair. 
                `Anything is possible,' she added with that peculiar, rather sly 
                expression that was always in her face when she spoke of religion. 
              </p>
              <p> Since their conversation about religion during their engagement 
                neither of them had ever started a discussion of the subject, 
                but she performed all the ceremonies of going to church, saying 
                her prayers, and so on, always with the unvarying conviction that 
                this ought to be so. In spite of his assertion to the contrary, 
                she was firmly persuaded that he was as much a Christian as she, 
                and indeed a far better one; and all that he said about it was 
                simply one of his absurd masculine freaks, just as he would say 
                about her broderie anglaise - that good people patch holes but 
                that she cut them out on purpose, and so on. </p>
              <p> `Yes, you see this woman, Marya Nikolaevna, did not know how 
                to manage all this,' said Levin. `And... I must own I'm very, 
                very glad you came. You are such purity that...' He took her hand 
                and did not kiss it (to kiss her hand in such closeness to death 
                seemed to him improper); he merely squeezed it with a penitent 
                air, looking at her brightening eyes. </p>
              <p> `It would have been miserable for you to be alone,' she said, 
                and lifting her hands which hid her cheeks, flushing with pleasure, 
                twisted her coil of hair on the nape of her neck and pinned it 
                there. `No,' she went on, `she did not know how.... Luckily, I 
                learned lot at Soden.' </p>
              <p> `Surely there are no people there so ill?' </p>
              <p> `Worse.' </p>
              <p> `What's so awful to me is that I can't but see him as he was 
                when he was young. You would not believe how charming he was as 
                a youth, but I did not understand him then.' </p>
              <p> `I can quite, quite believe it. How I feel that we might have 
                been friends!' she said; and, distressed at what she had said, 
                she looked round at her husband, and tears came into her eyes. 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, might have been,' he said mournfully. `He's just one of 
                those people of whom they say that they are not for this world.' 
              </p>
              <p> `But we have many days before us; we must go to bed,' said Kitty, 
                glancing at her tiny watch. </p>

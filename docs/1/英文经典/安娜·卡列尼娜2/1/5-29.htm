              <p><br>
                One of Anna's objects in coming back to Russia had been to see 
                her son. From the day she left Italy the thought of seeing him 
                had never ceased to agitate her. And, as she got nearer to Peterburg, 
                the delight and importance of this meeting grew ever greater in 
                her imagination. She did not even put to herself the problem of 
                how to arrange it. It seemed to her natural and simple to see 
                her son when she should be in the same town with him. But on her 
                arrival in Peterburg she was suddenly made distinctly aware of 
                her present position in society, and she grasped the fact that 
                to arrange this meeting was no easy matter. </p>
              <p>She had now been two days in Peterburg. The thought of her son 
                never left her for a single instant, but she had not yet seen 
                him. To go straight to the house, where she might meet Alexei 
                Alexandrovich - that she felt she had no right to do. She might 
                be refused admittance and insulted. To write and so enter into 
                relations with her husband - the thought of doing that made her 
                miserable; she could only be at peace when she did not think of 
                her husband. To get a glimpse of her son out walking, finding 
                out where and when he went out, was not enough for her; she had 
                so looked forward to this meeting, she had so much she must say 
                to him, she so longed to embrace him, to kiss him. Seriozha's 
                old nurse might be a help to her and show her what to do. But 
                the nurse was not now living in Alexei Alexandrovich's house. 
                In this uncertainty, and in efforts to find the nurse, two days 
                had slipped by. </p>
              <p> Hearing of the close intimacy between Alexei Alexandrovich and 
                Countess Lidia Ivanovna, Anna decided on the third day to write 
                her a letter, which cost her great pains, and in which she intentionally 
                said that permission to see her son must depend on her husband's 
                magnanimity. She knew that if the letter were shown to her husband, 
                he would keep up his role of magnanimity, and would not refuse 
                her request. </p>
              <p> The commissionaire who took the letter had brought her back 
                the most cruel and unexpected answer - that there was no answer. 
                She had never felt so humiliated as at the moment when, sending 
                for commissionaire, she heard from him the exact account of how 
                he had waited, and how afterward he had been told there was no 
                answer. Anna felt humiliated, insulted, but she saw that from 
                her point of view Countess Lidia Ivanovna was right. Her suffering 
                was the more poignant since she had to bear it in solitude. She 
                could not and would not share it with Vronsky. She knew that to 
                him, although he was the primary cause of her distress, the question 
                of her seeing her son would seem a matter of very little consequence. 
                She knew that he would never be capable of understanding all the 
                depth of her suffering, that for his cool tone at any allusion 
                to it she would begin to hate him. And she dreaded that more than 
                anything in the world, and so she hid from him everything that 
                related to her son. </p>
              <p> Spending the whole day at home she considered ways of seeing 
                her son, and had reached a decision to write to her husband. She 
                was just composing this letter when she was handed the letter 
                from Lidia Ivanovna. The Countess's silence had subdued and depressed 
                her, but the letter, all that she read between the lines in it, 
                so exasperated her, this malice was so revolting beside her passionate, 
                legitimate tenderness for her son, that she turned against other 
                people and left off blaming herself. </p>
              <p> `This coldness is simulation of feeling!' she said to herself. 
                `They must needs insult me and torture the child, and I am to 
                submit to it! Not on any consideration! She is worse than I am. 
                I don't lie, anyway.' And she decided on the spot that next day, 
                Seriozha's birthday, she would go straight to her husband's house, 
                bribe the servants, deceive the people, but at any cost see her 
                son and overturn the hideous deception with which they were encompassing 
                the unhappy child. </p>
              <p> She went to a toyshop, bought toys, and thought over a plan 
                of action. She would go early in the morning at eight o'clock, 
                when Alexei Alexandrovich would be certain not to be up. She would 
                have money in her hand to give the hall porter and the footman, 
                so that they should let her in, and, without raising her veil, 
                she would say that she had come from Seriozha's godfather to congratulate 
                him, and that she had been charged to leave the toys at his bedside. 
                She had prepared everything but the words she should say to her 
                son. Often she dreamed of it, she could never think of anything. 
              </p>
              <p> The next day, at eight o'clock in the morning, Anna got out 
                of a hired coach and rang at the front entrance of her former 
                home. </p>
              <p> `Run and see what's wanted. Some lady,' said Kapitonich, who, 
                not yet dressed, in his overcoat and galoshes, had peeped out 
                of the window and seen a lady in a veil standing close up to the 
                door. His assistant, a lad Anna did not know, had no sooner opened 
                the door to her than she came in, and pulling a three-rouble note 
                out of her muff put it hurriedly into his hand. </p>
              <p> `Seriozha - Sergei Alexeich,' she said, and was going on. Scrutinizing 
                the note, the porter's assistant stopped her at the second glass 
                door. </p>
              <p> `Whom do you want?' he asked. </p>
              <p> She did not hear his words and made no answer. </p>
              <p> Noticing the embarrassment of the unknown lady, Kapitonich went 
                out to her, opened the second door for her, and asked her what 
                she was pleased to want. </p>
              <p> `From Prince Skorodumov for Sergei Alexeich,' she said. </p>
              <p> `He's not up yet,' said the porter, looking at her attentively. 
              </p>
              <p> Anna had not anticipated that the absolutely unchanged hall 
                of the house where she had lived for nine years would so greatly 
                affect her. Memories sweet and painful rose one after another 
                in her heart, and for a moment she forgot what she was here for. 
              </p>
              <p> `Would you kindly wait?' said Kapitonich, taking off her fur 
                cloak. </p>
              <p> As he took off the cloak, Kapitonich glanced at her face, recognized 
                her, and made her a low bow in silence. </p>
              <p> `Please walk in, Your Excellency,' he said to her. </p>
              <p> She tried to say something, but her voice refused to utter any 
                sound; with a guilty and imploring glance at the old man she went 
                with light, swift steps up the stairs. Bent double, and his galoshes 
                catching in the steps, Kapitonich ran after her, trying to overtake 
                her. </p>
              <p> `The tutor's there; maybe he's not dressed. I'll let him know.' 
              </p>
              <p> Anna still mounted the familiar staircase, not understanding 
                what the old man was saying. </p>
              <p> `This way, to the left, if you please. Excuse its not being 
                tidy. He's in the former smoking room now,' the hall porter said, 
                panting. `Excuse me, wait a little, Your Excellency; I'll just 
                see,' he said, and overtaking her, he opened the high door and 
                disappeared behind it. Anna stood still waiting. `He's only just 
                awake,' said the hall porter, coming out. </p>
              <p> And at the very instant the porter said this, Anna caught the 
                sound of a childish yawn. From the sound of this yawn alone she 
                knew her son and seemed to see him living before her eyes. </p>
              <p> `Let me in; go away!' she said and went in through the high 
                doorway. On the right of the door stood a bed, and sitting up 
                in the bed was the boy. His little body bent forward, his nightshirt 
                unbuttoned, he was stretching and still yawning. The instant his 
                lips came together they curved into a blissfully sleepy smile, 
                and with that smile he slowly and deliciously rolled back again. 
              </p>
              <p> `Seriozha!' she whispered, walking noiselessly up to him. </p>
              <p> When she was parted from him, and all this latter time when 
                she had been feeling a fresh rush of love for him, she had pictured 
                him as he was at four years old, when she had loved him most of 
                all. Now he was not even the same as when she had left him; he 
                was farther than ever from the four-year-old baby, more grown 
                and thinner. How thin his face was, how short his hair was! What 
                long hands! How he had changed since she left him! But it was 
                he with his head, his lips, his soft neck and broad little shoulders. 
              </p>
              <p> `Seriozha!' she repeated, in the child's very ear. </p>
              <p> He raised himself again on his elbow, turned his tousled head 
                from side to side, as though looking for something, and opened 
                his eyes. Quietly and inquiringly he looked for several seconds 
                at his mother standing motionless before him, then all at once 
                he smiled a blissful smile, and shutting his eyes again, rolled 
                not backward but toward her, into her arms. </p>
              <p> `Seriozha! My darling boy!' she said, breathing hard and putting 
                her arms around his plump little body. </p>
              <p> `Mother!' he said, wriggling about in her arms so as to touch 
                her hands with different parts of him. </p>
              <p> Smiling sleepily still, with closed eyes, he flung his fat little 
                arms round her shoulders, rolled toward her, with the delicious 
                sleepy warmth and fragrance that is only found in children, and 
                began rubbing his face against her neck and shoulders. </p>
              <p> `I knew,' he said, opening his eyes. `It's my birthday today. 
                I knew you'd come. I'll get up directly.' </p>
              <p> And saying that he dropped asleep. </p>
              <p> Anna looked at him hungrily; she saw how he had grown and changed 
                in her absence. She knew, and did not know, the bare legs so long 
                now, that were thrust out below the quilt; she knew those short-cropped 
                curls on his neck in which she had so often kissed him. She touched 
                all this and could say nothing; tears choked her. </p>
              <p> `What are you crying for, mother?' he said, waking up completely. 
                `Mother, what are you crying for?' he cried in a tearful voice. 
              </p>
              <p> `I?... I won't cry... I'm crying for joy. It's so long since 
                I've seen you. I won't, I won't,' she said, gulping down her tears 
                and turning away. `Come, it's time for you to dress now,' she 
                added, after a pause, and, never letting go his hands, she sat 
                down by his bedside on the chair, where his clothes were put ready 
                for him. </p>
              <p> `How do you dress without me? How...' she made an attempt to 
                talk simply and cheerfully, but she could not, and again she turned 
                away. </p>
              <p> `I don't have a cold bath - papa didn't order it. And you've 
                not seen Vassilii Lukich? He'll come in soon. Why, you're sitting 
                on my clothes!' </p>
              <p> And Seriozha went off into a peal of laughter. She looked at 
                him and smiled. </p>
              <p> `Mother, darling, sweet one!' he shouted, flinging himself on 
                her again and hugging her. It was as if only now, on seeing her 
                smile, he fully grasped what had happened. `I don't want that 
                on,' he said, taking off her hat. And, as it were, seeing her 
                afresh without her hat, he fell to kissing her again. </p>
              <p> `But what did you think about me? You didn't think I was dead?' 
              </p>
              <p> `I never believed it.' </p>
              <p> `You didn't believe it, my sweet?' </p>
              <p> `I knew, I knew!' he repeated his favorite phrase, and snatching 
                the hand that was stroking his hair, he pressed the open palm 
                to his mouth and kissed it. </p>
              <p> </p>

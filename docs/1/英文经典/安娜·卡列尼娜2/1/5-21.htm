              <p><br>
                From the moment when Alexei Alexandrovich understood from his 
                interviews with Betsy and with Stepan Arkadyevich that all that 
                was expected of him was to leave his wife in peace, without burdening 
                her with his presence, and that his wife herself desired this, 
                he felt so distraught that he could come to no decision by himself; 
                he did not know himself what he wanted now, and, putting himself 
                in the hands of those who were so pleased to interest themselves 
                in his affairs, he met everything with unqualified assent. It 
                was only when Anna had left his house, and the English governess 
                sent to ask him whether she should dine with him or separately, 
                that for the first time he clearly comprehended his position, 
                and was appalled by it. </p>
              <p>Most difficult of all in this position was the fact that he could 
                not in any way connect and reconcile his past with the present. 
                It was not the past when he had lived happily with his wife that 
                troubled him. The transition from that past to a knowledge of 
                his wife's unfaithfulness he had already lived through miserably; 
                that state had been painful, but he could understand it. If his 
                wife had then, on declaring to him her unfaithfulness, left him, 
                he would have been wounded, unhappy, but he would not have been 
                in the hopeless position - incomprehensible to himself - in which 
                he felt himself now. He could not now reconcile his immediate 
                past, his tenderness, his love for his sick wife, and for the 
                other man's child with what was now the case - with the fact that, 
                seemingly in return for all this, he now found himself alone, 
                put to shame, a laughingstock, needed by no one, and despised 
                by everyone. </p>
              <p> For the first two days after his wife's departure Alexei Alexandrovich 
                received petitioners and his head clerk, drove to the committee, 
                and went down to dinner in the dining room as usual. Without giving 
                himself a reason for what he was doing, he strained every nerve 
                of his being for those two days, simply to preserve an appearance 
                of composure, and even of indifference. Answering inquiries about 
                the disposition of Anna Arkadyevna's rooms and belongings, he 
                had exercised immense self-control to appear like a man in whose 
                eyes what had occurred was not unforeseen nor out of the ordinary 
                course of events, and he attained his aim: no one could have detected 
                in him any signs of despair. But on the second day after her departure, 
                when Kornei gave him a bill from a fashionable draper's shop, 
                which Anna had forgotten to pay, and announced that the shopman 
                was waiting, Alexei Alexandrovich told him to show the man up. 
              </p>
              <p> `Excuse me, Your Excellency, for venturing to trouble you. But 
                if you direct us to apply to Her Excellency, would you graciously 
                oblige us with her address?' </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich pondered, as it seemed to the shopman, 
                and all at once, turning round, he sat down to the table. Burying 
                his head in his hands, he sat for a long while in that position, 
                made several attempts to speak, and stopped short. </p>
              <p> Kornei, perceiving his master's emotion, asked the shopman to 
                call another time. Left alone, Alexei Alexandrovich realized that 
                he had not the strength to keep up the role of firmness and composure 
                any longer. He gave orders for the carriage that was awaiting 
                him to be taken back, and for no one to be admitted, and he did 
                not go down to dinner. </p>
              <p> He felt that he could not endure the weight of universal contempt 
                and exasperation, which he had distinctly seen in the faces of 
                the shopman and of Kornei and of everyone, without exception, 
                whom he had met during these two days. He felt that he could not 
                turn aside from himself the hatred of men, because that hatred 
                did not come from his being bad (in that case he could have tried 
                to be better), but from his being shamefully and repulsively unhappy. 
                He knew that for this, for the very fact that his heart was torn 
                with grief, they would be merciless to him. He felt that men would 
                crush him as dogs strangle a mangled dog, yelping with pain. He 
                knew that his sole means of security against people was to hide 
                his wounds from them, and instinctively he tried to do this for 
                two days, but now he felt incapable of keeping up the unequal 
                struggle. </p>
              <p> His despair was even intensified by the consciousness that he 
                was utterly alone in his sorrow. In all Peterburg there was not 
                a human being to whom he could express what he was feeling, who 
                would feel for him, not as a high official, not as a member of 
                society, but simply as a suffering man; indeed, he had not such 
                a one in the whole world. </p>
              <p> Alexei Alexandrovich grew up an orphan. There were two brothers. 
                They did not remember their father, and their mother died when 
                Alexei Alexandrovich was ten years old. The property was a small 
                one. Their uncle, Karenin, a government official of high standing, 
                at one time a favorite of the late Czar, had brought them up. 
              </p>
              <p> On completing his high school and university courses with medals, 
                Alexei Alexandrovich had, with his uncle's aid, immediately started 
                in a prominent position in the service, and from that time forward 
                he had devoted himself exclusively to political ambition. In the 
                high school and the university, and afterward in the service, 
                Alexei Alexandrovich had never formed a close friendship with 
                anyone. His brother had been the person nearest to his heart, 
                but he had a post in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and was 
                always abroad, where he had died shortly after Alexei Alexandrovich's 
                marriage. </p>
              <p> While he was governor of a province, Anna's aunt, a wealthy 
                provincial lady, had brought him - middle-aged as he was, though 
                young for a governor - together with her niece, and had succeeded 
                in putting him in such a position that he had either to declare 
                himself or to leave town. Alexei Alexandrovich hesitated a great 
                while. There were at the time as many reasons for the step as 
                against it, and there was no overbalancing consideration to outweigh 
                his invariable rule of abstaining when in doubt. But Anna's aunt 
                had through a common acquaintance insinuated that he had already 
                compromised the girl, and that he was in honor bound to propose 
                to her. He proposed, and concentrated on his betrothed and his 
                wife all the feeling of which he was capable. </p>
              <p> The attachment he felt to Anna precluded in his heart every 
                need of intimate relations with others. And now, among all his 
                acquaintances, he had not one friend. He had plenty of so-called 
                connections, but no friendships. Alexei Alexandrovich had plenty 
                of people whom he could invite to dinner, to whose sympathy he 
                could appeal in any public affair he was concerned about, whose 
                interest he could reckon upon for anyone he wished to help, with 
                whom he could candidly discuss other people's business and affairs 
                of state. But his relations with these people were confined to 
                one clearly defined channel, and had a certain routine from which 
                it was impossible to depart. There was one man, a comrade of his 
                at the university, with whom he had become friendly later, and 
                with whom he could have spoken of a personal sorrow; but this 
                friend had a post in the Department of Education in a remote part 
                of Russia. Of the people in Peterburg the most intimate and most 
                likely were his head clerk and his doctor. </p>
              <p> Mikhail Vassilievich Sludin, the head clerk, was a straightforward, 
                intelligent, goodhearted and conscientious man, and Alexei Alexandrovich 
                was aware of his personal good will. But their five years of official 
                work together seemed to have put a barrier between them that cut 
                off warmer relations. </p>
              <p> After signing the papers brought him, Alexei Alexandrovich had 
                sat for a long while in silence, glancing at Mikhail Vassilievich, 
                and several times he attempted to speak, but could not. He had 
                already prepared the phrase: `You have heard of my trouble?' But 
                he ended by saying as usual: `So you'll get this ready for me?' 
                and with that dismissed him. </p>
              <p> The other person was the doctor, who had also a kindly feeling 
                for him; but there had long existed a silent understanding between 
                them that both were weighed down by work, and always in a hurry. 
              </p>
              <p> Of his women friends, foremost among them Countess Lidia Ivanovna, 
                Alexei Alexandrovich never thought. All women, simply as women, 
                were terrible and distasteful to him. </p>

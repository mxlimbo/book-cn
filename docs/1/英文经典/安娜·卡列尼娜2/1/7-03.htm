              <p><br>
                Levin had on this visit to town seen a great deal of his old friend 
                at the university, Professor Katavassov, whom he had not seen 
                since his marriage. He liked in Katavassov the clearness and simplicity 
                of his conception of life. Levin thought that the clearness of 
                Katavassov's conception of life was due to the poverty of his 
                nature; Katavassov thought that the disconnectedness of Levin's 
                ideas was due to his lack of intellectual discipline; but Levin 
                enjoyed Katavassov's clearness, and Katavassov enjoyed the abundance 
                of Levin's untrained ideas, and they liked to meet and to dispute. 
              </p>
              <p>Levin had read to Katavassov some parts of his book, and he had 
                liked them. On the previous day Katavassov had met Levin at a 
                public lecture and told him that the celebrated Metrov, whose 
                article Levin had so much liked, was in Moscow, that he had been 
                much interested by what Katavassov had told him about Levin's 
                work, and that he was coming to see him tomorrow at eleven, and 
                would be very glad to make Levin's acquaintance. </p>
              <p> `You're positively a reformed character, my dear, I'm glad to 
                see,' said Katavassov, meeting Levin in the little drawing room. 
                `I heard the bell and thought: Impossible! It can't be he at the 
                exact time!... Well, what do you say to the Montenegrins now? 
                They're a race of warriors.' </p>
              <p> `Why, what's happened?' asked Levin. </p>
              <p> Katavassov in a few words told him the last piece of news from 
                the war, and, going into his study, introduced Levin to a short, 
                thickset man of pleasant appearance. This was Metrov. The conversation 
                touched for a brief space on politics and on how recent events 
                were looked at in the higher spheres in Peterburg. Metrov repeated 
                a saying that had reached him through a most trustworthy source, 
                reported as having been uttered on this subject by the Czar and 
                one of the ministers. Katavassov had heard also on excellent authority 
                that the Czar had said something quite different. Levin tried 
                to imagine circumstances in which both sayings might have been 
                uttered, and the conversation on that topic dropped. </p>
              <p> `Yes, here he's practically written a book on the natural conditions 
                of the laborer in relation to the land,' said Katavassov; `I'm 
                not a specialist, but I, as a student of natural science, was 
                pleased at his not taking mankind as something outside biological 
                laws; but, on the contrary, perceiving his dependence on his surroundings, 
                and in that dependence seeking the laws of his development.' </p>
              <p> `That's very interesting,' said Metrov. </p>
              <p> `To tell the truth, I began to write a book on agriculture; 
                but, studying the chief instrument of agriculture, the laborer,' 
                said Levin, reddening, `I could not help coming to quite unexpected 
                results.' </p>
              <p> And Levin began carefully, as though feeling his ground, to 
                expound his views. He knew Metrov had written an article against 
                the generally accepted theory of political economy, but to what 
                extent he could reckon on his sympathy with his own new views 
                he did not know and could not guess from the clever and serene 
                face of the savant. </p>
              <p> `But in what do you see the special characteristics of the Russian 
                laborer?' said Metrov; `in his biological characteristics, so 
                to speak, or in the condition in which he is placed?' </p>
              <p> Levin saw that there was an idea underlying this question with 
                which he did not agree. But he went on explaining his own idea 
                that the Russian laborer has a quite special view of the land, 
                different from that of other people; and to support this proposition 
                he made haste to add that in his opinion this attitude of the 
                Russian peasant was due to the consciousness of his vocation to 
                settle vast unoccupied expanses in the East. </p>
              <p> `One may easily be led into error in basing any conclusion on 
                the general vocation of a people,' said Metrov, interrupting Levin. 
                `The condition of the laborer will always depend on his relation 
                to the land and to capital.' </p>
              <p> And without letting Levin finish explaining his idea, Metrov 
                began expounding to him the special point of his own theory. </p>
              <p> In what the point of his theory lay, Levin did not understand, 
                because he did not take the trouble to understand. He saw that 
                Metrov, like other people, in spite of his own article, in which 
                he had attacked the current theory of political economy, looked 
                at the position of the Russian peasant simply from the point of 
                view of capital, wages, and rent. He would indeed have been obliged 
                to admit that in the eastern - much the larger - part of Russia 
                rent was as yet nil, that for nine-tenths of the eighty millions 
                of the Russian peasants wages took the form simply of food provided 
                for themselves, and that capital does not so far exist except 
                in the form of the most primitive tools. Yet it was only from 
                that point of view that he considered every laborer, though in 
                many points he differed from the economists and had his own theory 
                of the wage fund, which he expounded to Levin. </p>
              <p> Levin listened reluctantly, and at first made objections. He 
                would have liked to interrupt Metrov, to explain his own thought, 
                which in his opinion would have rendered further exposition of 
                Metrov's theories superfluous. But later on, feeling convinced 
                that they looked at the matter so differently, that they could 
                never understand one another, he did not even oppose his statements, 
                but simply listened. Although what Metrov was saying was by now 
                utterly devoid of interest for him, he yet experienced a certain 
                satisfaction in listening to him. It flattered his vanity that 
                such a learned man should explain his ideas to him so eagerly, 
                with such intensity and confidence in Levin's understanding of 
                the subject, sometimes with a mere hint referring him to a whole 
                aspect of the subject. He put this down to his own credit, unaware 
                that Metrov, who had already discussed his theory over and over 
                again with all his intimate friends, talked of it with special 
                eagerness to every new person, and in general was eager to talk 
                to anyone of any subject that interested him, even if still obscure 
                to himself. </p>
              <p> `We are late though,' said Katavassov, looking at his watch 
                directly Metrov had finished his discourse. </p>
              <p> `Yes, there's a meeting of the Society of Amateurs today in 
                commemoration of the fifty-year jubilee of Svintich,' said Katavassov 
                in answer to Levin's inquiry. `Piotr Ivanovich and I were going. 
                I've promised to deliver an address on his labors in zoology. 
                Come along with us, it's very interesting.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, and it's really time to start,' said Metrov. `Come with 
                us, and from there, if you care to, come to my place. I should 
                very much like to hear your work.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, no! It's no good yet - it's unfinished. But I shall be 
                very glad to go to the meeting.' </p>
              <p> `I say, my dear, have you heard? He has handed in a minority 
                report,' Katavassov called from the other room, where he was putting 
                on his dress coat. </p>
              <p> And a conversation sprang up on the university question. </p>
              <p> The university question was a very important event that winter 
                in Moscow. Three old professors in the council had not accepted 
                the opinion of the younger professors. The young ones had registered 
                a separate resolution. This resolution, in the judgment of some 
                people, was monstrous, in the judgment of others it was the simplest 
                and most just thing to do, and the professors were split into 
                two parties. </p>
              <p> One party, to which Katavassov belonged, saw in the opposite 
                party a scoundrelly betrayal and treachery, while the opposite 
                party saw in them childishness and lack of respect for the authorities. 
                Levin, though he did not belong to the university, had several 
                times already during his stay in Moscow heard and talked about 
                this matter, and had his own opinion on the subject. He took part 
                in the conversation that was continued in the street, as all three 
                walked to the old buildings of the university. </p>
              <p> The meeting had already begun. Round the cloth-covered table, 
                at which Katavassov and Metrov seated themselves, there were some 
                half-dozen persons, and one of these was bending close over a 
                manuscript, reading something aloud. Levin sat down in one of 
                the empty chairs that were standing round the table, and in a 
                whisper asked a student sitting near what was being read. The 
                student, eying Levin with displeasure, said: </p>
              <p> `The biography.' </p>
              <p> Though Levin was not interested in the biography, he could not 
                help listening, and learned some new and interesting facts about 
                the life of the distinguished man of science. </p>
              <p> When the reader had finished, the chairman thanked him and read 
                some verses of the poet Ment, sent him on the jubilee, and said 
                a few words by way of thanks to the poet. Then Katavassov in his 
                loud, ringing voice read his address on the scientific labors 
                of the man whose jubilee was being kept. </p>
              <p> When Katavassov had finished, Levin looked at his watch, saw 
                it was past one, and thought that there would not be time before 
                the concert to read his paper to Metrov, and indeed, he did not 
                now care to do so. During the reading he had thought over their 
                conversation. He saw distinctly now that though Metrov's ideas 
                might perhaps have value, his own ideas had a value too, and their 
                ideas could only be made clear and lead to something if each worked 
                separately in his chosen path, and that nothing would be gained 
                by communicating these ideas. And having made up his mind to refuse 
                Metrov's invitation, Levin went up to him at the end of the meeting. 
                Metrov introduced Levin to the chairman, with whom he was talking 
                of the political news. Metrov told the chairman what he had already 
                told Levin, and Levin made the same remarks on his news that he 
                had already made that morning, but for the sake of variety he 
                expressed also a new opinion which had only just struck him. After 
                that the conversation turned again on the university question. 
                As Levin had already heard it all, he made haste to tell Metrov 
                that he was sorry he could not take advantage of his invitation, 
                took leave, and drove to Lvov's. </p>

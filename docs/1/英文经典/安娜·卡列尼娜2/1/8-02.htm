              <p><br>
                Sergei Ivanovich and Katavassov had just reached the station of 
                the Kursk line, which was particularly busy and full of people 
                that day, when, looking round for the groom who was following 
                with their things, they saw a party of volunteers driving up in 
                four cabs. Ladies met them with bouquets of flowers, and, followed 
                by the rushing crowd, they went into the station. </p>
              <p>One of the ladies who had met the volunteers, came out of the 
                hall and addressed Sergei Ivanovich. </p>
              <p> `You also come to see them off?' she asked in French. </p>
              <p> `No, I'm going away myself, Princess. To my brother's for a 
                holiday. Do you always see them off?' said Sergei Ivanovich with 
                a barely perceptible smile. </p>
              <p> `Oh, that would be impossible!' answered the Princess. `Is it 
                true that eight hundred have been sent from us already? Malvinsky 
                wouldn't believe me.' </p>
              <p> `More than eight hundred. If you reckon those who have been 
                sent not directly from Moscow, over a thousand,' answered Sergei 
                Ivanovich. </p>
              <p> `There! That's just what I said!' exclaimed the lady joyously. 
                `And it's true too, I suppose, that about a million has been subscribed?' 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, Princess.' </p>
              <p> `What do you say to today's telegram? The Turks have been overwhelmed 
                again.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, so I saw,' answered Sergei Ivanovich. They were speaking 
                of the last telegram stating that the Turks had been for three 
                days in succession beaten at all points and put to flight, and 
                that tomorrow a decisive engagement was expected. </p>
              <p> `Ah, by the way, a splendid young fellow has asked leave to 
                go, and they've made some difficulty - I don't know why. I meant 
                to ask you; I know him; please write a note about his case. He's 
                being sent by Countess Lidia Ivanovna.' </p>
              <p> Sergei Ivanovich asked for all the details the Princess knew 
                about the young man, and, going into the first-class waiting room, 
                wrote a note to the person on whom the granting of leave of absence 
                depended, and handed it to the Princess. </p>
              <p> `You know Count Vronsky, the notorious one... is going by this 
                train?' said the Princess with a smile full of triumph and meaning, 
                when he found her again and gave her the letter. </p>
              <p> `I had heard he was going, but I did not know when. By this 
                train?' </p>
              <p> `I've seen him. He's here: there's only his mother seeing him 
                off. It's the best thing, anyway, that he could do.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, yes, of course.' </p>
              <p> While they were talking the crowd streamed by them toward the 
                dining table. They went forward too, and heard a gentleman with 
                a glass in his hand delivering a loud discourse to the volunteers. 
                `In the service of religion, humanity, and our brethren,' the 
                gentleman said, his voice growing louder and louder; `to this 
                great cause mother Moscow dedicates you with her blessing. Jivio!' 
                he concluded, concluded, loudly and tearfully. </p>
              <p> Everyone shouted Jivio! and a fresh crowd dashed into the hall, 
                almost carrying the Princess off her feet. </p>
              <p> `Ah, Princess! That was something like!' said Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                suddenly appearing in the midst of the crowd and beaming upon 
                them with a delighted smile. `Capitally, warmly said, wasn't it? 
                Bravo! And Sergei Ivanovich! Why, you ought to have said something 
                - just a few words, you know, to encourage them; you do that so 
                well,' he added with a soft, respectful, and discreet smile, moving 
                Sergei Ivanovich forward a little by the arm. </p>
              <p> `No, I'm just off.' </p>
              <p> `Where to?' </p>
              <p> `To the country, to my brother's,' answered Sergei Ivanovich. 
              </p>
              <p> `Then you'll see my wife. I've written to her, but you'll see 
                her first. Please tell her that they've seen me and that it's 
                ``all right,' as the English say. She'll understand. Oh, and be 
                so good as to tell her I'm appointed member of the committee.... 
                But she'll understand! You know, les petites mis√®res de la vie 
                humaine,' he said, as it were apologizing to the Princess. `And 
                Princess Miaghkaia - not Liza, but Bibish - is sending a thousand 
                guns and twelve nurses, after all. Did I tell you?' </p>
              <p> `Yes, I heard so,' answered Koznishev indifferently. </p>
              <p> `It's a pity you're going away,' said Stepan Arkadyevich. `Tomorrow 
                we're giving a dinner to two who are setting off - Dimer-Biartniansky 
                from Peterburg and our Veslovsky, Grisha. They're both going. 
                Veslovsky's only lately married. There's a fine fellow for you! 
                Eh, Princess?' he turned to the lady. </p>
              <p> The Princess looked at Koznishev without replying. But the fact 
                that Sergei Ivanovich and the Princess seemed anxious to get rid 
                of him did not in the least disconcert Stepan Arkadyevich. Smiling, 
                he stared at the feather in the Princess's hat, and then about 
                him as though he were going to pick something up. Seeing a lady 
                approaching with a collection box, he beckoned her up and put 
                in a five-rouble note. </p>
              <p> `I can never see these collection boxes unmoved while I've money 
                in my pocket,' he said. `And how about today's telegram? Fine 
                chaps those Montenegrins!' </p>
              <p> `You don't say so!' he cried, when the Princess told him that 
                Vronsky was going by this train. For an instant Stepan Arkadyevich's 
                face looked sad, but a minute later, when, stroking his whiskers 
                and swinging as he walked, he went into the hall where Vronsky 
                was, he had completely forgotten his own despairing sobs over 
                his sister's corpse, and he saw in Vronsky only a hero and an 
                old friend. </p>
              <p> `With all his faults one can't refuse to do him justice,' said 
                the Princess to Sergei Ivanovich, as soon as Stepan Arkadyevich 
                had left them. `What a typically Russian, Slav nature! Only, I'm 
                afraid it won't be pleasant for Vronsky to see him. Say what you 
                will, I'm touched by that man's fate. Do talk to him a little 
                on the way,' said the Princess. </p>
              <p> `Yes, perhaps, if the occasion arises.' </p>
              <p> `I never liked him. But this atones for a great deal. He's not 
                merely going himself - he's taking a squadron at his own expense.' 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, so I heard.' </p>
              <p> A bell sounded. Everyone crowded to the doors. </p>
              <p> `Here he is!' said the Princess, indicating Vronsky, who, with 
                his mother on his arm walked by, wearing a long overcoat and wide-brimmed 
                black hat. Oblonsky was walking beside him, talking eagerly of 
                something. </p>
              <p> Vronsky was frowning and looking straight before him, as though 
                he did not hear what Stepan Arkadyevich was saying. </p>
              <p> Probably on Oblonsky's pointing them out, he looked round in 
                the direction where the Princess and Sergei Ivanovich were standing, 
                and, without speaking, lifted his hat. His face, aged and worn 
                by suffering, looked stony. </p>
              <p> Going onto the platform, Vronsky left his mother and disappeared 
                into a compartment. </p>
              <p> On the platform there rang out `God save the Czar,' then shouts 
                of `Hurrah!' and `Jivio!' One of the volunteers, a tall, very 
                young man with a hollow chest, was particularly conspicuous, bowing 
                and waving his felt hat and a nosegay over his head. Then two 
                officers emerged, bowing too, and a stout man with a big beard, 
                wearing a greasy forage cap. </p>

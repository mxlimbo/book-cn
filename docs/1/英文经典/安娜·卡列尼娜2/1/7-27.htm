                `He has gone! It is the end!' Anna said to herself, standing at 
                the window; and in answer to this question the impression of the 
                darkness when the candle had flickered out and of her fearful 
                dream, mingling into one, filled her heart with cold terror. </p>
              <p>`No, that cannot be!' she cried, and crossing the room she rang 
                the bell. She was afraid now of being alone, that, without waiting 
                for the servant to come in, she went out to meet him. </p>
              <p> `Inquire where the Count has gone,' she said. </p>
              <p> The servant answered that the Count had gone to the stable. 
              </p>
              <p> `His Honor left word that if you cared to drive out, the carriage 
                would be back immediately.' </p>
              <p> `Very good. Wait a minute. I'll write a note at once. Send Mikhail 
                with the note to the stables. Make haste.' </p>
              <p> She sat down and wrote: </p>
              <p> `I was wrong. Come back home; I must explain. For God's sake 
                come! I'm afraid.' </p>
              <p> She sealed it up and gave it to the servant. </p>
              <p> She was afraid of being left alone now; she followed the servant 
                out of the room, and went to the nursery. </p>
              <p> `Why, this isn't it - this isn't he! Where are his blue eyes, 
                his sweet, shy smile?' was her first thought when she saw her 
                chubby, rosy little girl, with her black, curly hair, instead 
                of Seriozha, whom in the tangle of her ideas she had expected 
                to see in the nursery. The little girl sitting at the table was 
                obstinately and violently battering on it with a cork, and staring 
                aimlessly at her mother with her pitch-black eyes. Answering the 
                English nurse that she was quite well, and that she was going 
                to the country tomorrow, Anna sat down by the little girl and 
                began spinning the cork to show her. But the child's loud, ringing 
                laugh, and the motion of her eyebrows, recalled Vronsky so vividly 
                that she got up hurriedly, restraining her sobs, and went away. 
                `Can it be all over? No, it cannot be!' she thought. `He will 
                come back. But how can he explain that smile, that excitement 
                after he had been talking to her? But even if he doesn't explain, 
                I will believe. If I don't believe, there's only one thing left 
                for me... and I can't do it.' </p>
              <p> She looked at her watch. Twenty minutes had passed. `By now 
                he has received the note and is coming back. Not long, ten minutes 
                more.... But what if he doesn't come? No, that cannot be. He mustn't 
                see me with tear-stained eyes. I'll go and wash. Yes, yes; did 
                I do my hair or not?' she asked herself. And she could not remember. 
                She felt her head with her hand. `Yes, my hair has been done, 
                but when I did it I can't in the least remember.' She could not 
                believe the evidence of her hand, and went up to the pier glass 
                to see whether she really had done her hair. She certainly had, 
                but she could not think when she had done it. `Who's that?' she 
                thought, looking in the looking glass at the swollen face with 
                strangely glittering eyes, that looked in a scared way at her. 
                `Why, it's I!' she suddenly understood, and, looking round, she 
                seemed all at once to feel his kisses on her, and twitched her 
                shoulders, shuddering. Then she lifted her hand to her lips and 
                kissed it. </p>
              <p> `What is it? Why, I'm going out of my mind!' And she went into 
                her bedroom, where Annushka was tidying the room. </p>
              <p> `Annushka,' she said, coming to a standstill before her, and 
                she stared at the maid, not knowing what to say to her. </p>
              <p> `You meant to go and see Darya Alexandrovna,' said the maid, 
                as though she understood. </p>
              <p> `Darya Alexandrovna? Yes, I'll go.' </p>
              <p> `Fifteen minutes there, fifteen minutes back. He's coming, he'll 
                be here soon.' She took out her watch and looked at it. `But how 
                could he go away, leaving me in such a state? How can he live, 
                without making it up with me?' She went to the window and began 
                looking into the street. Judging by the time, he might be back 
                now. But her calculations might be wrong, and she began once more 
                to recall when he had started and to count the minutes. </p>
              <p> At the moment when she had moved away to the big clock to compare 
                it with her watch, someone drove up. Glancing out of the window, 
                she saw his carriage. But no one came upstairs, and voices could 
                be heard below. It was the messenger who had come back in the 
                carriage. She went down to him. </p>
              <p> `We didn't catch the Count. The Count had driven off on the 
                Nizhny-Novgorod line.' </p>
              <p> `What do you say? What!...' she said to the rosy, good-humored 
                Mikhail, as he handed her back her note. </p>
              <p> `Why, then, he has never received it!' she thought. </p>
              <p> `Go with this note to Countess Vronsky's place in the country 
                - do you know where it is? And bring an answer back immediately,' 
                she said to the messenger. </p>
              <p> `And I - what am I going to do?' she thought. `Yes, I'm going 
                to Dolly's - that's best, or else I shall go out of my mind. Yes, 
                and I can telegraph, too.' And she wrote a telegram: </p>
              <p> `I absolutely must talk to you; come at once.' </p>
              <p> After sending off the telegram, she went to dress. When she 
                was dressed and in her hat, she glanced again into the eyes of 
                the plump, comfortable-looking Annushka. There was unmistakable 
                sympathy in those good-natured little gray eyes. </p>
              <p> `Annushka, dear, what am I to do?' said Anna, sobbing and sinking 
                helplessly into a chair. </p>
              <p> `Why fret yourself so, Anna Arkadyevna? Why, there's nothing 
                out of the way. You drive out a little, and it'll cheer you up,' 
                said the maid. </p>
              <p> `Yes, I'm going,' said Anna, rousing herself and getting up. 
                `And if there's a telegram while I'm away, send it on to Darya 
                Alexandrovna's.... But no, I shall be back myself.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, I mustn't think; I must do something, drive somewhere, 
                and, most of all, get out of this house,' she said, feeling with 
                terror the strange turmoil going on in her own heart, and she 
                made haste to go out, and get into the carriage. </p>
              <p> `Where to?' asked Piotr before getting on the box. </p>
              <p> `The Znamenka - the Oblonskys'.' </p>

              <p><br>
                On arriving in Peterburg, Vronsky and Anna stayed at one of the 
                best hotels; Vronsky apart in a lower story, Anna above with her 
                child, its nurse, and her maid, in a large suite of four rooms. 
              </p>
              <p>On the day of his arrival Vronsky went to his brother's. There 
                he found his mother, who had come from Moscow on business. His 
                mother and sister-in-law greeted him as usual: they asked him 
                about his stay abroad, and talked of their common acquaintances, 
                but did not let drop a single word in allusion to his connection 
                with Anna. His brother came next morning to see Vronsky, and of 
                his own accord asked him about her, and Alexei Vronsky told him 
                directly that he looked upon his connection with Madame Karenina 
                as marriage; that he hoped to arrange a divorce, and then to marry 
                her, and until then he considered her as much a wife as any other 
                wife, and he begged him to tell their mother and his wife so. 
              </p>
              <p> `If the world disapproves, I don't care,' said Vronsky; `but 
                if my relations want to be on terms of relationship with me, they 
                will have to be on the same terms with my wife.' </p>
              <p> The elder brother, who had always a respect for his younger 
                brother's judgment, could not well tell whether he was right or 
                not till the world had decided the question; for his part he had 
                nothing against it, and with Alexei he went up to see Anna. </p>
              <p> Before his brother, as before everyone, Vronsky addressed Anna 
                with a certain formality, treating her as he might a very intimate 
                friend, but it was understood that his brother knew their real 
                relations, and they talked about Anna's going to Vronsky's estate. 
              </p>
              <p> In spite of all his social experience Vronsky was, in consequence 
                of the new position in which he was placed, laboring under a strange 
                misapprehension. One would have thought he must have understood 
                that society was closed for him and Anna; but now some vague ideas 
                had sprung up in his brain that this was only the case in old-fashioned 
                days, and that now, with the rapidity of modern progress (he had 
                unconsciously become by now a partisan of every sort of progress), 
                the views of society had changed, and that the question of their 
                reception by society was far from decided. `Of course,' he thought, 
                `she would not be received at Court, but intimate friends can, 
                and must, look at it in the proper light.' </p>
              <p> One may sit for several hours at a stretch with one's legs crossed 
                in the same position, if one knows that there's nothing to prevent 
                one's changing one's position; but if a man knows that he must 
                remain sitting so with crossed legs, then cramps come on, the 
                legs begin to twitch and to strain toward the spot to which one 
                would like to draw them. This was what Vronsky was experiencing 
                in regard to the world. Though at the bottom of his heart he knew 
                that the world was shut on them, he put it to the test whether 
                the world had not changed by now and would not receive them. But 
                he very quickly perceived that though the world was open for him 
                personally, it was closed for Anna. Just as in the game of cat 
                and mouse, the hands raised for him were dropped to bar the way 
                for Anna. </p>
              <p> One of the first ladies of Peterburg society whom Vronsky saw 
                was his cousin Betsy. </p>
              <p> `At last!' she greeted him joyfully. `And Anna? How glad I am! 
                Where are you stopping? I can fancy after your delightful travels 
                you must find our poor Peterburg horrid. I can fancy your honeymoon 
                in Rome. How about the divorce? Is that all over?' </p>
              <p> Vronsky noticed that Betsy's enthusiasm waned when she learned 
                that no divorce had as yet taken place. </p>
              <p> `People will cast a stone at me, I know,' she said, `but I shall 
                come and see Anna; yes, I shall certainly come. You won't be here 
                long, I suppose?' </p>
              <p> And she did certainly come to see Anna the same day, but her 
                tone was not at all the same as in former days. She unmistakably 
                prided herself on her courage, and wished Anna to appreciate the 
                fidelity of her friendship. She only stayed ten minutes, talking 
                of society news, and on leaving she said: </p>
              <p> `You've never told me when the divorce is to be? Supposing I'm 
                ready to fling my cap over the mill, other starchy people will 
                give you the cold shoulder until you're married. And that's so 
                simple nowadays. Ca se fait. So you're going on Friday? Sorry 
                we shan't see each other again.' </p>
              <p> From Betsy's tone Vronsky might have grasped what he had to 
                expect from the world; but he made another effort in his own family. 
                His mother he did not reckon upon. He knew that his mother, who 
                had been so enthusiastic over Anna at their first acquaintance, 
                would have no mercy on her now for having ruined her son's career. 
                But he had more hope of Varia, his brother's wife. He fancied 
                she would not cast a stone, and would go simply and directly to 
                see Anna, and would receive her in her own house. </p>
              <p> The day after his arrival Vronsky went to her, and finding her 
                alone, expressed his wishes directly. </p>
              <p> `You know, Alexei,' she said after hearing him, `how fond I 
                am of you, and how ready I am to do anything for you; but I have 
                not spoken, because I knew I could be of no use to you and to 
                Anna Arkadyevna,' she said, articulating the name `Anna Arkadyevna' 
                with particular care. `Don't suppose, please, that I judge her. 
                Never! Perhaps in her place I should have done the same. I don't 
                and can't enter into that,' she said, glancing timidly at his 
                gloomy face. `But one must call things by their names. You want 
                me to go and see her, to ask her here, and to rehabilitate her 
                in society; but do understand that I cannot do so. I have daughters 
                growing up, and I must live in the world for my husband's sake. 
                Well, I'm ready to come and see Anna Arkadyevna - she will understand 
                that I can't ask her here, or I should have to do so in such a 
                way that she would not meet people who look at things differently; 
                that would offend her. I can't raise her...' </p>
              <p> `Oh, I don't regard her as having fallen more than hundreds 
                of women you do receive!' Vronsky interrupted her still more gloomily, 
                and he got up in silence, understanding that his sister-in-law's 
                decision was not to be shaken. </p>
              <p> `Alexei! Don't be angry with me. Please understand that I'm 
                not to blame,' began Varia, looking at him with a timid smile. 
              </p>
              <p> `I'm not angry with you,' he said still as gloomily; `but this 
                is doubly painful to me. I'm sorry, too, that this means breaking 
                up our friendship - if not breaking up, at least weakening it. 
                You will understand that for me, too, it cannot be otherwise.' 
              </p>
              <p> And with that he left her. </p>
              <p> Vronsky knew that further efforts were useless, and that he 
                had to spend these few days in Peterburg as though in a strange 
                town, avoiding every sort of relation with his own old circle 
                in order not to be exposed to the annoyances and humiliations 
                which were so intolerable to him. One of the most unpleasant features 
                of his position in Peterburg was that Alexei Alexandrovich and 
                his name seemed to meet him everywhere. He could not begin to 
                talk of anything without the conversation turning on Alexei Alexandrovich, 
                he could not go anywhere without risk of meeting him. So at least 
                it seemed to Vronsky, just as it seems to a man with a sore finger 
                that he is continually, as though on purpose, grazing his sore 
                finger against everything. </p>
              <p> Their stay in Peterburg was the more painful to Vronsky because 
                he perceived all the time a sort of new mood he could not understand 
                in Anna. At one time she would seem in love with him, and the 
                next she would become cold, irritable, and impenetrable. She was 
                worrying over something, and keeping something back from him, 
                and did not seem to notice the humiliations which poisoned his 
                existence, and which for her, with her delicate intuition, must 
                have been still more unbearable. </p>

              <p><br>
                When Alexei Alexandrovich came into the Countess Lidia Ivanovna's 
                snug little boudoir, decorated with old china and hung with portraits, 
                the lady herself had not yet made her appearance. </p>
              <p>She was changing her dress. </p>
              <p> A cloth was laid on a round table, and on it stood a china tea 
                service and a silver teakettle and spirit lamp. Alexei Alexandrovich 
                looked idly about at the endless familiar portraits which adorned 
                the room, and, sitting down to the table, he opened a New Testament 
                lying upon it. The rustle of the Countess's silk skirt drew his 
                attention off. </p>
              <p> `Well, now, we can sit quietly,' said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, 
                slipping hurriedly with an agitated smile between the table and 
                the sofa, `and talk over our tea.' </p>
              <p> After some words of preparation, Countess Lidia Ivanovna, breathing 
                hard and flushing crimson, gave into Alexei Alexandrovich's hands 
                the letter she had received. </p>
              <p> After reading the letter, he sat a long while in silence. </p>
              <p> `I don't think I have the right to refuse her,' he said, timidly 
                lifting his eyes. </p>
              <p> `Dear friend, you never see evil in anyone!' </p>
              <p> `On the contrary, I see that all is evil. But whether it is 
                just...' </p>
              <p> His face showed irresolution, and a seeking for counsel, support, 
                and guidance, in a matter he did not understand. </p>
              <p> `No,' Countess Lidia Ivanovna interrupted him; `there are limits 
                to everything. I can understand immorality,' she said, not quite 
                truthfully, since she never could understand that which leads 
                women to immorality; `but I don't understand cruelty - to whom? 
                To you! How can she stay in the town where you are? No, the longer 
                one lives the more one learns. And I'm learning to understand 
                your loftiness and her baseness.' </p>
              <p> `Who is to cast a stone?' said Alexei Alexandrovich, unmistakably 
                pleased with the part he had to play. `I have forgiven all, and 
                so I cannot deprive her of what is exacted by love in her - by 
                her love for her son....' </p>
              <p> `But is that love, my friend? Is it sincere? Admitting that 
                you have forgiven - that you forgive... have we the right to work 
                on the soul of that angel? He looks on her as dead. He prays for 
                her, and beseeches God to have mercy on her sins. And it is better 
                so. But now what will he think?' </p>
              <p> `I had not thought of that,' said Alexei Alexandrovich, evidently 
                agreeing. </p>
              <p> Countess Lidia Ivanovna hid her face in her hands and was silent. 
                She was praying. </p>
              <p> `If you ask my advice,' she said, having finished her prayer 
                and uncovered her face, `I do not advise you to do this. Do you 
                suppose I don't see how you are suffering, how this has torn open 
                your wounds? But supposing that, as always, you don't think of 
                yourself - what can it lead to? - To fresh suffering for you, 
                to torture for the child. If there were a trace of humanity left 
                in her, she ought not to wish it herself. No, I have no hesitation 
                in saying I advise against it, and if you will intrust it to me, 
                I will write to her.' </p>
              <p> And Alexei Alexandrovich consented, and Countess Lidia Ivanovna 
                sent the following letter in French: </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>`DEAR MADAME - To be reminded of you might result in your son's 
                asking questions, which could not be answered without implanting 
                in the child's soul a spirit of censure toward what should be 
                for him sacred, and therefore I beg you to interpret your husband's 
                refusal in the spirit of Christian love. I pray to Almighty God 
                to have mercy on you. <br>
              </p>
              <p>COUNTESS LIDIA'<br>
                This letter attained the secret object which Countess Lidia Ivanovna 
                had concealed from herself. It wounded Anna to the quick. <br>
                For his part, Alexei Alexandrovich, on returning home from Lidia 
                Ivanovna's, could not all that day concentrate himself on his 
                usual pursuits, and find that spiritual peace of one saved and 
                believing which he had felt of late. </p>
              <p> The thought of his wife, who had so greatly sinned against him, 
                and toward whom he had been so saintly, as Countess Lidia Ivanovna 
                had so justly told him, ought not to have troubled him; but he 
                was not easy; he could not understand the book he was reading; 
                he could not drive away harassing recollections of his relations 
                with her, of the mistake which, as it now seemed, he had made 
                in regard to her. The memory of how he had received her confession 
                of infidelity on their way home from the races (especially his 
                having insisted only on the observance of external decorum, and 
                not having sent a challenge) tortured him like a remorse. He was 
                tortured, too, by the thought of the letter he had written her; 
                and, most of all, his forgiveness, which nobody wanted, and his 
                care of the other man's child, seared his heart with shame and 
                remorse. </p>
              <p> And just the same feeling of shame and remorse he felt now, 
                as he reviewed all his past with her, recalling the awkward words 
                in which, after long wavering, he proposed to her. </p>
              <p> `But how have I been to blame?' he said to himself. And this 
                question always excited another question in him - whether they 
                felt differently, did their loving and marrying differently, these 
                Vronskys and Oblonskys... these gentlemen of the bedchamber, with 
                their fine calves. And there passed before his mind a whole series 
                of these succulent, vigorous, self-confident men, who always and 
                everywhere drew his inquisitive attention in spite of himself. 
                He tried to dispel these thoughts, he tried to persuade himself 
                that he was not living for this transient life, but for the life 
                of eternity, and that there was peace and love in his heart. But 
                the fact that he had in this transient, trivial life made, as 
                it seemed to him, a few trivial mistakes, tortured him as though 
                the eternal salvation in which he believed had no existence. But 
                this temptation did not last long, and soon there was reestablished 
                once more in Alexei Alexandrovich's soul the peace and the loftiness 
                by virtue of which he could forget what he did not want to remember.

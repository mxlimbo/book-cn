              <p><br>
                Levin strode along the highroad, absorbed not so much in his thoughts 
                (he could not yet disentangle them), as in his spiritual condition, 
                unlike anything he had experienced before. </p>
              <p>The words uttered by the peasant had acted on his soul like an 
                electric shock, suddenly transforming and combining into a single 
                whole the whole swarm of disjointed, impotent, separate thoughts 
                that incessantly occupied his mind. These thoughts had unconsciously 
                been in his mind even when he was talking about the land. </p>
              <p> He was aware of something new in his soul, and joyfully tested 
                this new thing, not yet knowing what it was. </p>
              <p> `Not living for his own wants, but for God? For what God? And 
                could one say anything more senseless than what he said? He said 
                that one must not live for one's own wants, that is, that one 
                must not live for what we understand, what we are attracted by, 
                what we desire - but must live for something incomprehensible, 
                for God, whom no one can understand nor even define. What of it? 
                Didn't I understand those senseless words of Fiodor's? And understanding 
                them, did I doubt their truth? Did I think them stupid, obscure, 
                inexact? </p>
              <p> `No, I understood him, and exactly as he understands the words. 
                I understood them more fully and clearly than I understand anything 
                in life, and never in my life have I doubted nor can I doubt about 
                them. And not only I, but everyone, the whole world, understands 
                nothing fully but this, and about this only they have no doubt, 
                and are always agreed. </p>
              <p> `Fiodor says that Kirillov, the innkeeper, lives for his belly. 
                That's comprehensible and rational. All of us as rational beings 
                can't do anything else but live for our belly. And all of a sudden 
                the same Fiodor says that one mustn't live for one's belly, but 
                must live for truth, for God, and, at a hint, I understand him! 
                And I and millions of men, men who lived ages ago and men living 
                now - peasants, the poor in spirit and the sages, who have thought 
                and written about it, in their obscure words saying the same thing 
                - we are all agreed about this one thing: what we must live for 
                and what is good. I and all men have only one firm, incontestable, 
                clear knowledge, and that knowledge cannot be explained by reason 
                - it is outside it, and has no causes, and can have no effects. 
              </p>
              <p> `If goodness has causes, it is not goodness; if it has effects 
                - a reward - it is not goodness either. So goodness is outside 
                the chain of cause and effect. </p>
              <p> `And yet I know it, and we all know it. </p>
              <p> `And I sought miracles, complained that I did not see a miracle 
                which would convince me. And here is a miracle, the sole miracle 
                possible, continually existing, surrounding me on all sides, and 
                I never noticed it! </p>
              <p> `What could be a greater miracle than that? </p>
              <p> `Can I have found the solution of it all? Can my sufferings 
                be over?' thought Levin, striding along the dusty road, not noticing 
                the heat nor his weariness, and experiencing a sense of relief 
                from prolonged suffering. This feeling was so delicious that it 
                seemed to him incredible. He was breathless with emotion and incapable 
                of going farther; he turned off the road into the forest and lay 
                down in the shade of an aspen on the uncut grass. He took his 
                hat off his hot head and lay propped on his elbow in the lush, 
                feathery, woodland grass. </p>
              <p> `Yes, I must make it clear to myself and understand,' he thought, 
                looking intently at the untrampled grass before him, and following 
                the movements of a green beetle, advancing along a blade of couch 
                grass and lifting up in its progress a leaf of goatweed. `Everything 
                from beginning?' he asked himself, bending aside the leaf of goatweed 
                out of the beetle's way and twisting another blade of grass above 
                for the beetle to cross over to. `What is it makes me glad? What 
                have I discovered? </p>
              <p> `Of old I used to say that in my body, that in the body of this 
                grass and of this beetle (there, she didn't care for the grass, 
                she's opened her wings and flown away), there was going on a transformation 
                of matter in accordance with physical, chemical, and physiological 
                laws. And in all of us, as well as in the aspens and clouds and 
                nebulae, there was a process of evolution. Evolution from what? 
                Into what? - Eternal evolution and struggle... As though there 
                could be any sort of tendency and struggle in the eternal! And 
                I was astonished that in spite of utmost effort of thought in 
                this direction I could not discover the meaning of life, the meaning 
                of my impulses and yearnings. And the meaning of my impulses is 
                so clear within me, that I was living according to them all the 
                time, and I was astonished and rejoiced, when the peasant expressed 
                it to me: to live for God, for my soul. </p>
              <p> `I have discovered nothing. I have only found out what I knew. 
                I understand the force that in the past gave me life, and now 
                too gives me life. I have been set free from falsity, I have found 
                the Master.' </p>
              <p> And he briefly went through, mentally, the whole course of his 
                ideas during the last two years, the beginning of which was the 
                clear confronting of death at the sight of his dear brother hopelessly 
                ill. </p>
              <p> Then, for the first time, grasping that for every man, and himself 
                too, there was nothing in store but suffering, death and eternal 
                oblivion, he had made up his mind that life was impossible like 
                that, and that he must either interpret life so that it would 
                not present itself to him as the evil jest of some devil, or else 
                shoot himself. </p>
              <p> But he had not done either, but had gone on living, thinking, 
                and feeling, and had even at that very time married, and had had 
                many joys, and had been happy, when he was not thinking of the 
                meaning of his life. </p>
              <p> What did this mean? It meant that he had been living rightly, 
                but thinking wrongly. </p>
              <p> He had lived (without being aware of it) on those spiritual 
                truths that he had sucked in with his mother's milk, but he had 
                thought, not merely without recognition of these truths, but studiously 
                ignoring them. </p>
              <p> Now it was clear to him that he could live only by virtue of 
                the beliefs in which he had been brought up. </p>
              <p> `What should I have been, and how should I have spent my life, 
                if I had not had these beliefs, if I had not known that I must 
                live for God and not for my own wants? I should have robbed and 
                lied and killed. Nothing of what makes the chief happiness of 
                my life would have existed for me.' And with the utmost stretch 
                of imagination he could not conceive the brutal creature he would 
                have been himself, if he had not known what he was living for. 
              </p>
              <p> `I looked for an answer to my question. And thought could not 
                give an answer to my question - it is incommensurable with my 
                question. The answer has been given me by life itself, in my knowledge 
                of what is right and what is wrong. And that knowledge I did not 
                arrive at in any way, it was given to me as to all men, given, 
                because I could not have got it from anywhere. </p>
              <p> `Where could I have got it? Could I have arrived through reason 
                at knowing that I must love my neighbor and not oppress him? I 
                was told that in my childhood, and I believed it gladly, for they 
                told me what was already in my soul. But who discovered it? Not 
                reason. Reason discovered the struggle for existence, and the 
                law that requires us to oppress all who hinder the satisfaction 
                of our desires. That is the deduction of reason. But loving one's 
                neighbor reason could never discover, because that is unreasonable. 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, pride,' he said to himself, turning over on his abdomen 
                and beginning to tie a noose of blades of grass, trying not to 
                break them. </p>
              <p> `And not merely pride of intellect, but dullness of intellect. 
                And most of all, its knavishness; yes, the knavishness of intellect. 
                The cheating knavishness of intellect - that's it,' he repeated.

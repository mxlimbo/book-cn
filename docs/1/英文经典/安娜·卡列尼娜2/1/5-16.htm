              <p><br>
                When Levin went upstairs, his wife was sitting near the new silver 
                samovar and the new tea service, and, having settled old Agathya 
                Mikhailovna at a little table with a full cup of tea, was reading 
                a letter from Dolly, with whom they were in continual and frequent 
                correspondence. </p>
              <p>`You see, your lady's settled me here, told me to sit a bit with 
                her,' said Agathya Mikhailovna, smiling amicably at Kitty. </p>
              <p> In these words of Agathya Mikhailovna Levin read the final act 
                of the drama which had been enacted of late between her and Kitty. 
                He saw that, in spite of Agathya Mikhailovna's feelings being 
                hurt by a new mistress taking the reins of government out of her 
                hands, Kitty had yet conquered her and made her love her. </p>
              <p> `Here, I opened your letter too,' said Kitty, handing him an 
                illiterate letter. `It's from that woman, I think - your brother's...' 
                she said. `I did not read it through. This is from my people and 
                from Dolly. Fancy! Dolly took Tania and Grisha to a children's 
                ball at the Sarmatskys': Tania was a French marquise.' </p>
              <p> But Levin did not hear her. Flushing, he took the letter from 
                Marya Nikolaevna, his brother's former mistress, and began to 
                read it. This was the second letter he had received from Marya 
                Nikolaevna. In the first letter, Marya Nikolaevna wrote that his 
                brother had sent her packing for no fault of hers, and, with touching 
                simplicity, added that though she was in want again, she asked 
                for nothing, and wished for nothing, but was only tormented by 
                the thought that Nikolai Dmitrievich would come to grief without 
                her, owing to the weak state of his health, and begged his brother 
                to look after him. Now she wrote quite differently. She had found 
                Nikolai Dmitrievich, had again made it up with him in Moscow, 
                and had moved with him to a provincial town, where he had received 
                a post in the government service. But, she wrote, he had quarreled 
                with the head official, and was on his way back to Moscow, only 
                he had been taken so ill on the road that it was doubtful if he 
                would ever leave his bed again. `It's always of you he has talked, 
                and, besides he has no more money left.' </p>
              <p> `Read this; Dolly writes about you,' Kitty was beginning, with 
                a smile; but she stopped suddenly, noticing the changed expression 
                on her husband's face. `What is it? What's the matter?' </p>
              <p> `She writes to me that Nikolai, my brother, is at death's door. 
                I shall go to him.' </p>
              <p> Kitty's face changed at once. Thoughts of Tania as a marquise, 
                of Dolly, all had vanished. </p>
              <p> `When are you going?' she said. </p>
              <p> `Tomorrow.' </p>
              <p> `And I will go with you - may I?' she said. </p>
              <p> `Kitty! What are you thinking of?' he said reproachfully. </p>
              <p> `What am I thinking of?' offended that he should seem to take 
                her suggestion unwillingly and with vexation. </p>
              <p> `Why shouldn't I go? I shan't be in your way. I...' </p>
              <p> `I'm going because my brother is dying,' said Levin. `Why should 
                you...' </p>
              <p> `Why? For the same reason as you.' </p>
              <p> `And, at a moment of such gravity for me, she only thinks of 
                her being dull by herself,' thought Levin. And this subterfuge 
                in a matter of such gravity infuriated him. </p>
              <p> `It's out of the question,' he said sternly. </p>
              <p> Agathya Mikhailovna, seeing that it was coming to a quarrel, 
                gently put down her cup and withdrew. Kitty did not even notice 
                her. The tone in which her husband had said the last words offended 
                her, especially because he evidently did not believe what she 
                had said. </p>
              <p> `I tell you, that if you go, I shall come with you; I shall 
                certainly come,' she said hastily and wrathfully. `Why out of 
                the question? Why do you say it's out of the question?' </p>
              <p> `Because it'll be going God knows where, by all sorts of roads 
                and to all sorts of hotels.... You would be a hindrance to me,' 
                said Levin, trying to be cool. </p>
              <p> `Not at all. I don't want anything. Where you can go, I can...' 
              </p>
              <p> `Well, for one thing then, because this woman's there whom you 
                can't meet.' </p>
              <p> `I don't know and don't care to know who's there and what. I 
                know that my husband's brother is dying, and my husband is going 
                to him, and I go with my husband so that...' </p>
              <p> `Kitty! Don't get angry. But just think a little: this is a 
                matter of such importance that I can't bear to think that you 
                should bring in a feeling of weakness, of dislike to being left 
                alone. Come, you'll be dull alone, so go and stay at Moscow a 
                little.' </p>
              <p> `There, you always ascribe base, vile motives to me,' she said 
                with tears of wrath and wounded pride. `I didn't mean anything 
                - it wasn't weakness, it wasn't anything.... I feel that it's 
                my duty to be with my husband when he's in trouble, but you try 
                on purpose to hurt me, you try on purpose not to understand....' 
              </p>
              <p> `No; this is awful! To be such a slave!' cried Levin, getting 
                up, and unable to restrain his vexation any longer. But at the 
                same second he felt that he was beating himself. </p>
              <p> `Then why did you marry? You could have been free. Why did you, 
                if you regret it?' she said, getting up and running away into 
                the drawing room. </p>
              <p> When he went to her, she was sobbing. </p>
              <p> He began to speak, trying to find words not to dissuade but 
                simply to soothe her. But she did not heed him, and would not 
                agree to anything. He bent down to her and took her hand, which 
                resisted him. He kissed her hand, kissed her hair, kissed her 
                hand again - still she was silent. But when he took her face in 
                both his hands, and said `Kitty!' she suddenly collected herself, 
                still shed some tears, and they were reconciled. </p>
              <p> It was decided that they should go together the next day. Levin 
                told his wife that he believed she wanted to go simply in order 
                to be of use, agreed that Marya Nikolaevna's being with his brother 
                did not make her going improper, but he set off dissatisfied, 
                at the bottom of his heart, both with her and with himself. He 
                was dissatisfied with her for being unable to make up her mind 
                to let him go when it was necessary (and how strange it was for 
                him to think that he, so lately hardly daring to believe in such 
                happiness as the possibility of her loving him - now was unhappy 
                because she loved him too much!), and he was dissatisfied with 
                himself for not showing more strength of will. Even greater was 
                the feeling of disagreement at the bottom of his heart as to her 
                not needing to consider the woman who was with his brother, and 
                he thought with horror of all the contingencies they might meet 
                with. The mere idea of his wife, his Kitty, being in the same 
                room with a common wench, set him shuddering with horror and loathing.

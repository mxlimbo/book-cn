              <p><br>
                While the train was stopping at the provincial town, Sergei Ivanovich 
                did not go to the refreshment room, but walked up and down the 
                platform. </p>
              <p>The first time he passed Vronsky's compartment he noticed that 
                the curtain was drawn over the window; but as he passed it the 
                second time he saw the old Countess at the window. She beckoned 
                to Koznishev. </p>
              <p> `I'm going, you see - taking him as far as Kursk,' she said. 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, so I heard,' said Sergei Ivanovich, standing at her window 
                and peeping in. `What a noble act on his part!' he added, noticing 
                that Vronsky was not in the compartment. </p>
              <p> `Yes, after his misfortune, what was there for him to do?' </p>
              <p> `What a terrible thing it was!' said Sergei Ivanovich. </p>
              <p> `Ah, what I have been through! But do get in.... Ah, what I 
                have been through!' she repeated, when Sergei Ivanovich had got 
                in and sat down beside her. `You can't conceive it! For six weeks 
                he did not speak to anyone, and would not touch food except when 
                I implored him. And not for one minute could we leave him alone. 
                We took away everything he could have used against himself. We 
                lived on the ground floor, but there was no reckoning on anything. 
                You know, of course, that he had shot himself once already on 
                her account,' she said, and the old lady's brows contracted at 
                the recollection. `Yes, hers was the fitting end for such a woman. 
                Even the death she chose was low and vulgar.' </p>
              <p> `It's not for us to judge, Countess,' said Sergei Ivanovich 
                sighing; `but I can understand that it has been very hard for 
                you.' </p>
              <p> `Ah, don't speak of it! I was staying on my estate, and he was 
                with me. A note was brought him. He wrote an answer and sent it 
                off. We hadn't an idea that she was close by at the station. In 
                the evening I had only just gone to my room, when my Mary told 
                me a lady had thrown herself under the train. Something seemed 
                to strike me at once. I knew it was she. The first thing I said 
                was that he was not to be told. But they'd told him already. His 
                coachman was there and saw it all. When I ran into his room, he 
                was beside himself - it was frightful to see him. He didn't say 
                a word, but galloped off there. I don't know to this day what 
                happened there, but he was brought back at death's door. I shouldn't 
                have known him. Prostration complète, the doctor said. And that 
                was followed almost by madness. Oh, why talk of it!' said the 
                Countess with a wave of her hand. `It was an awful time! No, say 
                what you will, she was a bad woman. Why, what is the meaning of 
                such desperate passions? It was all to show herself something 
                out of the ordinary. Well, and that she did do. She brought herself 
                to ruin and two good men - her husband, and my unhappy son.' </p>
              <p> `And what did her husband do?' asked Sergei Ivanovich. </p>
              <p> `He has taken her daughter. Aliosha was ready to agree to anything 
                at first. Now it worries him terribly that he should have given 
                his own child away to another man. But he can't take back his 
                word. Karenin came to the funeral. But we tried to prevent his 
                meeting Aliosha. For him, for her husband, it was easier, anyway. 
                She had set him free. But my poor son was utterly given up to 
                her. He had thrown up everything, his career, me, and even then 
                she had no mercy on him, but of set purpose she made his ruin 
                complete. No, say what you will, her very death was the death 
                of a vile woman, of no religious feeling. God forgive me, but 
                I can't help hating the memory of her, when I look at my son's 
                misery!' </p>
              <p> `But how is he now?' </p>
              <p> `It was a blessing from Providence for us - this Servian war. 
                I'm old, and I don't understand the rights and wrongs of it, but 
                it's come as a providential blessing to him. Of course for me, 
                as his mother, it's terrible; and what's worse, they say, ce n'est 
                pas très bien vu a Pétersbourg. But it can't be helped! It was 
                the one thing that could rouse him. Iashvin - a friend of his 
                - he had lost all he had at cards and he was going to Servia. 
                He came to see him and persuaded him to go. Now it's an interest 
                for him. Do please talk to him a little. I want to distract his 
                mind. He's so low-spirited. And, as bad luck would have it, he 
                has toothache too. But he'll be delighted to see you. Please do 
                talk to him; he's walking up and down on that side.' </p>
              <p> Sergei Ivanovich said he would be very glad to, and crossed 
                over to the other side of the station. </p>

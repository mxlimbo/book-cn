              <p><br>
                Anna, in that first period of her emancipation and rapid return 
                to health, felt herself unpardonably happy and full of the joy 
                of life. The thought of her husband's unhappiness did not poison 
                her happiness. On one side that memory was too awful to be thought 
                of. On the other side her husband's unhappiness had given her 
                too much happiness to be regretted. The memory of all that had 
                happened after her illness: her reconciliation with her husband, 
                the rupture, the news of Vronsky's wound, his visit, the preparations 
                for divorce, the departure from her husband's house, the parting 
                from her son - all that seemed to her like a delirious dream, 
                from which she had waked up abroad, alone with Vronsky. The thought 
                of the harm caused to her husband aroused in her a feeling like 
                repulsion, and akin to what a drowning man might feel who has 
                shaken off another man clinging to him. That man did drown. It 
                was an evil action, of course, but it was the sole means of escape, 
                and better not to brood over these fearful facts. </p>
              <p>One consolatory reflection upon her conduct had occurred to her 
                at the first moment of the final rupture, and when now she recalled 
                all the past, she remembered that one reflection. `I have inevitably 
                made that man wretched,' she thought; `but I don't want to profit 
                by his misery. I, too, am suffering, and shall suffer; I am losing 
                what I prized above everything - I am losing my good name and 
                my son. I have done wrong, and so I don't want happiness, I don't 
                want a divorce, and shall suffer from my shame and the separation 
                from my child.' But, however sincerely Anna had meant to suffer, 
                she was not suffering. Shame there was none. With the tact of 
                which both had such a large share, they had succeeded in avoiding 
                Russian ladies abroad, and so had never placed themselves in a 
                false position, and everywhere they had met people who pretended 
                that they perfectly understood their position, far better indeed 
                than they did themselves. Separation from the son she loved - 
                even that did not cause her anguish in these early days. The baby 
                girl - his child - was so sweet, and had so won Anna's heart, 
                since she was all that was left her, that Anna rarely thought 
                of her son. </p>
              <p> The desire for life, waxing stronger with recovered health, 
                was so intense, and the conditions of life were so new and pleasant, 
                that Anna felt unpardonably happy. The more she got to know Vronsky, 
                the more she loved him. She loved him for himself, and for his 
                love for her. Her complete ownership of him was a continual joy 
                to her. His presence was always sweet to her. All the traits of 
                his character, which she learned to know better and better, were 
                unutterably dear to her. His appearance, changed by his civilian 
                dress, was as fascinating to her as though she were some young 
                girl in love. In everything he said, thought, and did, she saw 
                something particularly noble and elevated. Her adoration of him 
                alarmed her indeed; she sought and could not find in him anything 
                not fine. She dared not show him her sense of her own insignificance 
                beside him. It seemed to her that, knowing this, he might sooner 
                cease to love her; and she dreaded nothing now so much as losing 
                his love, though she had no grounds for fearing it. But she could 
                not help being grateful to him for his attitude to her, and showing 
                that she appreciated it. He, who had in her opinion such a marked 
                aptitude for a political career, in which he would have been certain 
                to play a leading part - he had sacrificed his ambition for her 
                sake, and never betrayed the slightest regret. He was more lovingly 
                respectful to her than ever, and the constant care that she should 
                not feel the awkwardness of her position never deserted him for 
                a single instant. He, so manly a man, never opposed her, had indeed, 
                with her, no will of his own, and was anxious, it seemed, for 
                nothing but to anticipate her wishes. And she could not but appreciate 
                this, even though the very intensity of his solicitude for her, 
                the atmosphere of care with which he surrounded her, sometimes 
                weighed upon her. </p>
              <p> Vronsky, meanwhile, in spite of the complete realization of 
                what he had so long desired, was not perfectly happy. He soon 
                felt that the realization of his desires gave him no more than 
                a grain of sand out of the mountain of happiness he had expected. 
                It showed him the mistake men make in picturing to themselves 
                happiness as the realization of their desires. For a time after 
                joining his life to hers, and putting on civilian dress, he had 
                felt all the delight of freedom in general, of which he had known 
                nothing before, and of freedom in his love - and he was content, 
                but not for long. He was soon aware that there was springing up 
                in his heart a desire for desires - longing. Without conscious 
                intention he began to clutch at every passing caprice, taking 
                it for a desire and an object. Sixteen hours of the day must be 
                occupied in some way, since they were living abroad in complete 
                freedom, outside the conditions of social life which filled up 
                time in Peterburg. As for the amusements of bachelor existence, 
                which had provided Vronsky with entertainment on previous tours 
                abroad, they could not be thought of, since the sole attempt of 
                the sort had led to a sudden attack of depression in Anna, quite 
                out of proportion with the cause - a late supper with bachelor 
                friends. Relations with the society of the place - foreign and 
                Russian - were equally out of the question, owing to the irregularity 
                of their position. The inspection of objects of interest, apart 
                from the fact that everything had been seen already, had not for 
                Vronsky, a Russian and a sensible man, the inexplicable significance 
                Englishmen are able to attach to that pursuit. </p>
              <p> And, just as the hungry animal eagerly clutches every object 
                it can get, hoping to find nourishment in it, Vronsky quite unconsciously 
                clutched first at politics, then at new books, and then at pictures. 
              </p>
              <p> As he had, ever since he was a child, a taste for painting, 
                and as, not knowing what to spend his money on, he had begun collecting 
                engravings, he came to a stop at painting, began to take interest 
                in it, and concentrated upon it the unoccupied fund of desires 
                which demanded satisfaction. </p>
              <p> As he had a capacity for understanding art, and for true and 
                tasteful imitation in the art of painting, he supposed himself 
                to have the real thing essential for an artist, and after hesitating 
                for some time which style of painting to select - religious, historical, 
                realistic, or genre painting - he set to work to paint. He appreciated 
                all kinds, and could have felt inspired by any one of them; but 
                he had no conception of the possibility of knowing nothing at 
                all of any school of painting, and of being inspired directly 
                by what is within the soul, without caring whether what is painted 
                will belong to any recognized school. Since he knew nothing of 
                this, and drew his inspiration, not directly from life, but indirectly 
                from life embodied in art, his inspiration came very quickly and 
                easily, and as quickly and easily came his success in painting 
                something very similar to the sort of painting he was trying to 
                imitate. </p>
              <p> More than any other style he liked the French - graceful and 
                effective - and in that style he began to paint Anna's portrait 
                in Italian costume, and the portrait seemed to him, and to everyone 
                who saw it, extremely successful. </p>

                And Levin remembered a scene he had lately witnessed between Dolly 
                and her children. The children, left to themselves, had begun 
                cooking raspberries over the candles and squirting milk into each 
                other's mouths with a syringe. Their mother, catching them at 
                these pranks, began reminding them in Levin's presence of the 
                trouble their mischief gave to the grown-up people, and that this 
                trouble was all for their sake, and that if they smashed the cups 
                they would have nothing to drink their tea out of, and that if 
                they wasted the milk, they would have nothing to eat, and die 
                of hunger. </p>
              <p>And Levin had been struck by the passive, weary incredulity with 
                which the children heard what their mother said to them. They 
                were simply annoyed that their amusing play had been interrupted, 
                and did not believe a word of what their mother was saying. They 
                could not believe it indeed, for they could not take in the immensity 
                of all they habitually enjoyed, and so could not conceive that 
                what they were destroying was the very thing they lived by. </p>
              <p> `That all comes of itself,' they thought, `and there's nothing 
                interesting or important about it, because it has always been 
                so, and always will be so. And it's all always the same. We've 
                no need to think about that, it's all ready; but we want to invent 
                something of our own, and new. So we thought of putting raspberries 
                in a cup, and cooking them over a candle, and squirting milk straight 
                into each other's mouths. That's fun, and something new, and not 
                a bit worse than drinking out of cups.' </p>
              <p> `Isn't it just the same that we do, that I did, searching by 
                the aid of reason for the significance of the forces of nature 
                and the meaning of the life of man?' he thought. </p>
              <p> `And don't all the theories of philosophy do the same, trying 
                by the path of thought, which is strange and not natural to man, 
                to bring him to a knowledge of what he has known long ago, and 
                knows so certainly that he could not live at all without it? Isn't 
                it distinctly to be seen in the development of each philosopher's 
                theory, that he knows what is the chief significance of life beforehand, 
                just as positively as the peasant Fiodor, and not a bit more clearly 
                than he, and is simply trying by a dubious intellectual path to 
                come back to what everyone knows? </p>
              <p> `Now then, leave the children to themselves to get things alone 
                and make their crockery, get the milk from the cows, and so on. 
                Would they be naughty then? Why, they'd die of hunger! Well, then, 
                leave us with our passions and thoughts, without any idea of the 
                one God, of the Creator, or without any idea of what is right, 
                without any idea of moral evil. </p>
              <p> `Just try and build up anything without those ideas! </p>
              <p> `We destroy them only because we're spiritually provided for. 
                Exactly like the children! </p>
              <p> `Whence have I that joyful knowledge, shared with the peasant, 
                that alone gives peace to my soul? Whence did I get it? </p>
              <p> `Brought up with an idea of God, a Christian, my whole life 
                filled with the spiritual blessings Christianity has given me, 
                full of them, and living on these blessings, like the children 
                I did not understand them, and destroy - that is, try to destroy 
                - what I live by. And as soon as an important moment of life comes, 
                like the children when they are cold and hungry, I turn to Him, 
                and even less than the children when their mother's scold them 
                for their childish mischief, do I feel that my childish efforts 
                at wanton madness are reckoned against me. </p>
              <p> `Yes, what I know, I know not by reason - but it has been given 
                to me, revealed to me, and I know it with my heart, by faith in 
                the chief thing taught by the Church. </p>
              <p> `The Church? The Church!' Levin repeated to himself. He turned 
                over on the other side, and, leaning on his elbow, fell to gazing 
                into the distance at a herd of cattle crossing over to the river. 
              </p>
              <p> `But can I believe in all the Church teaches?' he thought, putting 
                himself to the test, and thinking of everything that could destroy 
                his present peace of mind. Intentionally he recalled all those 
                doctrines of the Church which had always seemed most strange and 
                had always been a stumbling block to him. The Creation? But how 
                did I explain existence? By existence? By nothing? The devil and 
                sin. But how do I explain evil?... The Redeemer?... </p>
              <p> `But I know nothing, nothing, and I can know nothing but what 
                has been told to me and all men.' </p>
              <p> And it seemed to him now that there was not a single article 
                of faith of the Church which could destroy the chief thing - faith 
                in God, in goodness, as the one goal of man's destiny. </p>
              <p> Under every article of faith of the Church could be put the 
                faith in the service of truth instead of one's wants. And each 
                doctrine did not simply leave that faith unshaken - each doctrine 
                seemed essential to complete that great miracle, continually manifest 
                upon earth, that made it possible for each man, and millions of 
                different sorts of men - wise men and imbeciles, old men and children 
                - all men, peasants, Lvov, Kitty, beggars and kings, to understand 
                perfectly the same one thing, and to build up thereby that life 
                of the soul which alone is worth living, and which alone is precious 
                to us. </p>
              <p> Lying on his back, he gazed up now into the high, cloudless 
                sky. `Do I not know that that is infinite space, and that it is 
                not a round arch? But, however I screw up my eyes and strain my 
                sight, I cannot see it as not round and not bounded, and, in spite 
                of my knowing about infinite space, I am incontestably right when 
                I see a solid blue dome, and more right than when I strain my 
                eyes to see beyond it.' </p>
              <p> Levin ceased thinking, and only, as it were, listened to mysterious 
                voices that seemed talking joyfully and earnestly with each other. 
              </p>
              <p> `Can this be faith?' he thought, afraid to believe in his happiness. 
                `My God, I thank Thee!' he said, gulping down his sobs, and with 
                both hands brushing away the tears that filled his eyes. </p>

              <p><br>
                Stepan Arkadyevich, as usual, did not waste his time in Peterburg. 
                In Peterburg, besides business, his sister's divorce, and his 
                coveted appointment, he wanted, as he always did, to freshen himself 
                up, as he said, after the mustiness of Moscow. </p>
              <p>In spite of its caf√©s chantants and its omnibuses, Moscow was 
                yet a stagnant bog. Stepan Arkadyevich always felt it. After living 
                for some time in Moscow, especially in close relations with his 
                family, he was conscious of a depression of spirits. After being 
                a long time in Moscow without a change, he reached a point when 
                he positively began to be worrying himself over his wife's ill-humor 
                and reproaches, over his children's health and education, and 
                the petty details of his official work; even the fact of being 
                in debt worried him. But he had only to go and stay a little while 
                in Peterburg, in the circle in which he moved there, where people 
                lived - really lived - instead of vegetating as in Moscow, and 
                all such ideas vanished and melted away at once, like wax before 
                the fire. </p>
              <p> A wife?... Only that day he had been talking to Prince Chechensky. 
                Prince Chechensky had a wife and family, grown-up children in 
                the Corps of Pages.... And he had another illegitimate family 
                of children also. Though the first family was very fine too, Prince 
                Chechensky felt happier in his second family; and he used to take 
                his eldest son with him to his second family, and told Stepan 
                Arkadyevich that he thought it good for his son, enlarging his 
                ideas. What would have been said to that in Moscow? </p>
              <p> Children?... In Peterburg children did not prevent their parents 
                from enjoying life. The children were brought up in schools, and 
                there was no trace of the wild idea that prevailed in Moscow, 
                in Lvov's household, for instance, that all the luxuries of life 
                were for the children, while the parents have nothing but work 
                and anxiety. Here people understood that a man is in duty bound 
                to live for himself, as every man of culture should live. </p>
              <p> Official duties?... Official work here was not the stiff, hopeless 
                drudgery that it was in Moscow. Here there was some interest in 
                official life. A chance meeting, a service rendered, a happy phrase, 
                a knack of facetious mimicry, and a man's career might be made 
                in a trice. So it had been with Briantsev, whom Stepan Arkadyevich 
                had met the previous day, and who was one of the highest functionaries 
                in government now. There was some interest in official work like 
                that. </p>
              <p> The Peterburg attitude on pecuniary matters had an especially 
                soothing effect on Stepan Arkadyevich. Bartniansky, who must spend 
                at least fifty thousand to judge by the style he lived in, had 
                made a remarkable comment the day before on that subject. </p>
              <p> As they were talking before dinner, Stepan Arkadyevich said 
                to Bartniansky: </p>
              <p> `You're friendly, I fancy, with Mordvinsky; you might do me 
                a favor: say a word to him, please, for me. There's an appointment 
                I should like to get - member of the agency...' </p>
              <p> `Oh, I shan't remember all that, if you tell it to me.... But 
                what possesses you to have to do with railways and Yids?... Take 
                it as you will, it's a low business.' </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich did not say to Bartniansky that it was a 
                `growing thing' - Bartniansky would not have understood that. 
              </p>
              <p> `I want the money - I've nothing to live on.' </p>
              <p> `You're living, aren't you?' </p>
              <p> `Yes, but in debt.' </p>
              <p> `Are you, though? Heavily?' said Bartniansky sympathetically. 
              </p>
              <p> `Very heavily: twenty thousand.' </p>
              <p> Bartniansky broke into good-humored laughter. </p>
              <p> `Oh, lucky fellow!' said he. `My debts mount up to a million 
                and a half, and I've nothing, and still I can live, as you see!' 
              </p>
              <p> And Stepan Arkadyevich saw the correctness of this view not 
                in words only but in actual fact. Zhivakhov owed three hundred 
                thousand, and hadn't a copper to bless himself with, and he lived, 
                and in style too! Count Krivtsov was considered a hopeless case 
                by everyone, and yet he kept two mistresses. Petrovsky had run 
                through five millions, and still lived in just the same style, 
                and was even a manager in the financial department with a salary 
                of twenty thousand. But besides this, Peterburg had physically 
                an agreeable effect on Stepan Arkadyevich. It made him younger. 
                In Moscow he sometimes found a gray hair in his head, dropped 
                asleep after dinner, stretched, walked slowly upstairs, breathing 
                heavily, was bored by the society of young women, and did not 
                dance at balls. In Peterburg he always felt ten years younger. 
              </p>
              <p> His experience in Peterburg was exactly what had been described 
                to him on the previous day by Prince Piotr Oblonsky, a man of 
                sixty, who had just come back from abroad: </p>
              <p> `We don't know how to live here,' said Piotr Oblonsky. `I spent 
                the summer in Baden, and you wouldn't believe it, I felt quite 
                a young man. At a glimpse of a pretty woman, my thoughts... One 
                dines and drinks a glass of wine, and feels strong and ready for 
                anything. I came home to Russia - had to see my wife, and, what's 
                more, go to my country place; and there, you'd hardly believe 
                it, in a fortnight I'd got into a dressing gown and given up dressing 
                for dinner. Needn't say I had no thoughts left for pretty women. 
                I became quite an old gentleman. There was nothing left for me 
                but to think of my eternal salvation. I went off to Paris - I 
                was at once as right as could be.' </p>
              <p> Stepan Arkadyevich felt exactly the difference that Piotr Oblonsky 
                described. In Moscow he degenerated so much that if he had had 
                to be there for long together, he might in good earnest have come 
                to considering his salvation; in Peterburg he felt himself a man 
                of the world again. </p>
              <p> Between Princess Betsy Tverskaia and Stepan Arkadyevich there 
                had long existed rather curious relations. Stepan Arkadyevich 
                always flirted with her in jest, and used to say to her, also 
                in jest, the most unseemly things, knowing that nothing delighted 
                her so much. The day after his conversation with Karenin, Stepan 
                Arkadyevich went to see her, and felt so youthful that in this 
                jesting flirtation and nonsense he recklessly went so far that 
                he did not know how to extricate himself, as unluckily he was 
                so far from being attracted by her that he thought her positively 
                disagreeable. What made it hard to change the conversation was 
                the fact that he was very attractive to her. So that he was considerably 
                relieved at the arrival of Princess Miaghkaia, which cut short 
                their t√™te-√†-t√™yte. </p>
              <p> `Ah, so you're here!' said she when she saw him. `Well, and 
                what news of your poor sister? You needn't look at me like that,' 
                she added. `Ever since they've all turned against her, all those 
                who're a thousand times worse than she, I've thought she did a 
                very fine thing. I can't forgive Vronsky for not letting me know 
                when she was in Peterburg. I'd have gone to see her and gone about 
                with her everywhere. Please give her my love. Come, tell me about 
                her.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, her position is very difficult; she...' began Stepan Arkadyevich, 
                in the simplicity of his heart accepting as sterling coin Princess 
                Miaghkaia's words: `Tell me about her.' Princess Miaghkaia interrupted 
                him immediately, as she always did, and began talking herself. 
              </p>
              <p> `She's done what they all do, except me - only the others hide 
                it. But she wouldn't be deceitful, and she did a fine thing. And 
                she did better still in throwing up that crazy brother-in-law 
                of yours. You must excuse me. Everybody used to say he was so 
                clever, so very clever; I was the only one that said he was a 
                fool. Now that he's so thick with Lidia Ivanovna and Landau, they 
                all say he's crazy, and I should prefer not to agree with everybody, 
                but this time I can't help it.' </p>
              <p> `Oh, do please explain,' said Stepan Arkadyevich; `what does 
                it mean? Yesterday I was seeing him on my sister's behalf, and 
                I asked him to give me a final answer. He gave me no answer, and 
                said he would think it over. But this morning, instead of an answer, 
                I received an invitation from Countess Lidia Ivanovna for this 
                evening.' </p>
              <p> `Ah, so that's it, that's it!' said Princess Miaghkaia gleefully, 
                `they're going to ask Landau what he's to say.' </p>
              <p> `Ask Landau? What for? Who or what's Landau?' </p>
              <p> `What! you don't know Jules Landau, le fameux Jules Landau, 
                le clairvoyant? He's crazy too, but on him your sister's fate 
                depends. See what comes of living in the provinces - you know 
                nothing about anything. Landau, do you see, was a commis in a 
                shop in Paris, and he went to a doctor's; and in the doctor's 
                waiting room he fell asleep, and in his sleep he began giving 
                advice to all the patients. And wonderful advice it was! Then 
                the wife of Iury Meledinsky - you know, the invalid? - heard of 
                this Landau, and had him to see her husband. And he cures her 
                husband, though I can't say that I see he did him much good, for 
                he's just as feeble a creature as ever he was, but they believed 
                in him, and took him along with them, and brought him to Russia. 
                Here there's been a general rush to him, and he's begun doctoring 
                everyone. He cured Countess Bezzubova, and she took such a fancy 
                to him that she adopted him.' </p>
              <p> `Adopted him?' </p>
              <p> `Yes, as her son. He's not Landau any more now, but Count Bezzubov. 
                That's neither here nor there, though; but Lidia - I'm very fond 
                of her, but she has a screw loose somewhere - has lost her heart 
                to this Landau now, and nothing is settled now in her house or 
                Alexei Alexandrovich's without him, and so your sister's fate 
                is now in the hands of Landau, alias Count Bezzubov.' </p>

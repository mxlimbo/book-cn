              <p><br>
                When Anna found Dolly at home before her, she looked intently 
                in her eyes, as though questioning her about the talk she had 
                had with Vronsky, but she made no inquiry in words. </p>
              <p>`I believe it's dinnertime,' she said. `We've not seen each other 
                at all yet. I am reckoning on the evening. Now I want to go and 
                dress. I expect you do too; we all got splashed at the buildings.' 
              </p>
              <p> Dolly went to her room and she felt amused. To change her dress 
                was impossible, for she had already put on her best dress. But 
                in order to signify in some way her preparation for dinner, she 
                asked the maid to brush her dress, changed her cuffs and rosette, 
                and put some lace on her head. </p>
              <p> `This is all I can do,' she said with a smile to Anna, who came 
                in to her in a third dress, again of extreme simplicity. </p>
              <p> `Yes, we are too prim here,' she said, as it were apologizing 
                for her finery. `Alexei is delighted at your visit, as he rarely 
                is at anything. He has completely lost his heart to you,' she 
                added. `You're not tired?' </p>
              <p> There was no time for talking about anything before dinner. 
                Going into the drawing room they found Princess Varvara already 
                there, and the gentlemen of the party in black frock coats. The 
                architect wore a swallow-tailed coat. Vronsky presented the doctor 
                and the steward to his guest. The architect he had already introduced 
                to her at the hospital. </p>
              <p> A stout butler, resplendent with a smoothly shaven round chin 
                and a starched white cravat, announced that dinner was ready, 
                and the ladies got up. Vronsky asked Sviiazhsky to take in Anna 
                Arkadyevna, and himself offered his arm to Dolly. Veslovsky was 
                before Tushkevich in offering his arm to Princess Varvara, so 
                that Tushkevich with the steward and the doctor walked in alone. 
              </p>
              <p> The dinner, the dining room, the service, the waiting at table, 
                the wine and the food, were not simply in keeping with the general 
                tone of modern luxury throughout the house, but seemed even more 
                sumptuous and modern. Darya Alexandrovna watched this luxury which 
                was novel to her, and as a good housekeeper used to managing a 
                household - though she never dreamed of adapting anything she 
                saw to her own household, as it was all in a style of luxury far 
                above her own manner of living - she could not help scrutinizing 
                every detail, and wondering how and by whom it was all done. Vassenka 
                Veslovsky, her husband, and even Sviiazhsky, and many other people 
                she knew, would never have considered this question, and would 
                have readily believed what every well-bred host tries to make 
                his guests feel, that is, that all that is well-ordered in his 
                house has cost him, the host, no trouble whatever, but comes of 
                itself. Darya Alexandrovna was well aware that even porridge for 
                the children's breakfast does not come of itself, and that therefore, 
                where so complicated and magnificent a style of luxury was maintained, 
                someone must give earnest attention to its organization. And from 
                the glance with which Alexei Kirillovich scanned the table, from 
                the way he nodded to the butler, and offered Darya Alexandrovna 
                her choice between cold soup and hot soup, she saw that it was 
                all organized and maintained by the care of the master of the 
                house himself. It was evident that it all rested no more upon 
                Anna than upon Veslovsky. She, Sviiazhsky, the Princess, and Veslovsky, 
                were equally guests, with light hearts enjoying what had been 
                arranged for them. </p>
              <p> Anna was the hostess only in conducting the conversation. The 
                conversation was a difficult one for the lady of the house at 
                a small table with persons present, like the steward and the architect, 
                belonging to a completely different world, struggling not to be 
                overawed by an elegance to which they were unaccustomed, and unable 
                to sustain a large share in the general conversation. But this 
                difficult conversation Anna directed with her usual tact and naturalness, 
                and indeed she did so with actual enjoyment, as Darya Alexandrovna 
                observed. </p>
              <p> The conversation began about the row Tushkevich and Veslovsky 
                had taken alone together in the boat, and Tushkevich began describing 
                the last boat races in Peterburg at the Yacht Club. But Anna, 
                seizing the first pause, at once turned to the architect to draw 
                him out of his silence. </p>
              <p> `Nikolai Ivanich was struck,' she said meaning Sviiazhsky, `at 
                the progress the new building had made since he was here last; 
                but I am there every day, and every day I wonder at the rate at 
                which it grows.' </p>
              <p> `It's first-rate working with His Excellency,' said the architect 
                with a smile (he was respectful and composed, though with a sense 
                of his own dignity). `It's a very different matter to have to 
                do with the district authorities. Where one would have to write 
                out sheaves of papers, here I call upon the Count, and in three 
                words we settle the business.' </p>
              <p> `The American way of doing business,' said Sviiazhsky, with 
                a smile. </p>
              <p> `Yes, there they build in a rational fashion....' </p>
              <p> The conversation passed to the misuse of political power in 
                the United States, but Anna quickly brought it round to another 
                topic, so as to draw the steward into talk. </p>
              <p> `Have you ever seen a reaping machine?' she said, addressing 
                Darya Alexandrovna. `We had just ridden over to look at one when 
                we met. It's the first time I ever saw one.' </p>
              <p> `How do they work?' asked Dolly. </p>
              <p> `Exactly like scissors. A plank and a lot of little scissors. 
                Like this.' </p>
              <p> Anna took a knife and fork in her beautiful white hands, covered 
                with rings, and began showing how the machine worked. It was clear 
                that she saw nothing would be understood from her explanation; 
                but aware that her talk was pleasant, and her hands beautiful, 
                she went on explaining. </p>
              <p> `More like little penknives,' Veslovsky said playfully, never 
                taking his eyes off her. </p>
              <p> Anna gave a just perceptible smile, but made no answer. `Isn't 
                it true, Karl Fedorich, that it's just like scissors?' she said 
                to the steward. </p>
              <p> `Oh, ja,' answered the German. `Es ist ein ganz einfaches Ding,' 
                and he began to explain the construction of the machine. </p>
              <p> `It's a pity it doesn't bind too. I saw one at the Vienna exhibition, 
                which binds with a wire,' said Sviiazhsky. `They would be more 
                profitable in use.' </p>
              <p> `Es kommt drauf an... Der Preis vom Draht muss ausgerechnet 
                werden.' And the German, roused from his taciturnity, turned to 
                Vronsky. `Das l?sst sich ausrechnen, Erlaucht.' The German was 
                just feeling in the pocket where were his pencil and the notebook 
                he always wrote in, but recollecting that he was at a dinner, 
                and observing Vronsky's chilly glance, he checked himself. `Zu 
                compliziert, macht zu viel pains,' he concluded. </p>
              <p> `Wünscht man gains, so hat man auch pains,' said Vassenka Veslovsky, 
                bantering the German. `J'adore l'allemand,' he addressed Anna 
                again with the same smile. </p>
              <p> `Cessez,' she said with playful severity. </p>
              <p> `We expected to find you in the fields, Vassilii Semionich,' 
                she said to the doctor, a sickly-looking man; `have you been there?' 
              </p>
              <p> `I went there, but I evaporated,' the doctor answered with gloomy 
                jocoseness. </p>
              <p> `Then you've taken a good constitutional?' </p>
              <p> `Splendid!' </p>
              <p> `Well, and how was the old woman? I hope it's not typhus?' </p>
              <p> `Typhus it isn't, but she's not to be found to the best advantage.' 
              </p>
              <p> `What a pity!' said Anna, and having thus paid the dues of civility 
                to her domestic circle, she turned to her own friends. </p>
              <p> `It would be a hard task, though, to construct a machine from 
                your description, Anna Arkadyevna,' Sviiazhsky said jestingly. 
              </p>
              <p> `Oh, no, why so?' said Anna with a smile that betrayed that 
                she knew there was something charming in her disquisitions upon 
                the machine, that had been noticed by Sviiazhsky too. This new 
                trait of girlish coquettishness made an unpleasant impression 
                on Dolly. </p>
              <p> `But Anna Arkadyevna's knowledge of architecture is marvelous,' 
                said Tushkevich. </p>
              <p> `To be sure, I heard Anna Arkadyevna saying yesterday: ``by 
                cramp' and ``plinths,'' said Veslovsky. `Have I got it right?' 
              </p>
              <p> `There's nothing marvelous about it, when one sees and hears 
                so much of it,' said Anna. `But, I dare say, you don't even know 
                what houses are made of?' </p>
              <p> Darya Alexandrovna saw that Anna disliked the tone of playfulness 
                that existed between her and Veslovsky, but fell in with it against 
                her will. </p>
              <p> Vronsky acted in this matter quite differently from Levin. He 
                obviously attached no significance to Veslovsky's chattering; 
                on the contrary, he encouraged his jests. </p>
              <p> `Come now, tell us, Veslovsky, how are the stones held together?' 
              </p>
              <p> `By cement, of course.' </p>
              <p> `Bravo! And what is cement?' </p>
              <p> `Oh, some sort of paste.... No, putty,' said Veslovsky, raising 
                a general laugh. </p>
              <p> The company at dinner, with the exception of the doctor, the 
                architect, and the steward, who remained plunged in gloomy silence, 
                kept up a conversation that never paused, glancing off one subject, 
                fastening on another, and at times stinging one or the other of 
                the company to the quick. Once Darya Alexandrovna felt wounded 
                to the quick, and got so hot that she positively flushed and wondered 
                afterward whether she had said anything extreme or unpleasant. 
                Sviiazhsky began talking of Levin, describing his strange view 
                that machinery is simply pernicious in its effects on Russian 
                agriculture. </p>
              <p> `I have not the pleasure of knowing this M. Levin,' Vronsky 
                said, smiling, `but most likely he has never seen the machines 
                he condemns; or if he has seen and tried any, it must have been 
                after a queer fashion, some Russian imitation, not a machine from 
                abroad. What sort of views can anyone have on such a subject?' 
              </p>
              <p> `Turkish views, in general,' Veslovsky said, turning to Anna 
                with a smile. </p>
              <p> `I can't defend his opinions,' Darya Alexandrovna said, flaring 
                up; `but I can say that he's a highly cultivated man, and if he 
                were here he would know very well how to answer you, though I 
                am not capable of doing so.' </p>
              <p> `I like him extremely, and we are great friends,' Sviiazhsky 
                said, smiling good-naturedly. `Mais pardon, il est un petit peu 
                toque; he maintains, for instance, that zemstvoes and justices 
                of the peace are all of no use, and he is unwilling to take part 
                in anything.' </p>
              <p> `It's our Russian apathy,' said Vronsky, pouring water from 
                an iced decanter into a delicate glass on a high stem; `we've 
                no sense of the duties our privileges impose upon us, and so we 
                refuse to recognize these duties.' </p>
              <p> `I know no man more strict in the performance of his duties,' 
                said Darya Alexandrovna, irritated by Vronsky's tone of superiority. 
              </p>
              <p> `For my part,' pursued Vronsky, who was evidently for some reason 
                or other keenly affected by this conversation, `such as I am, 
                I am, on the contrary, extremely grateful for the honor they have 
                done me, thanks to Nikolai Ivanich' (he indicated Sviiazhsky), 
                `in electing me an honorary justice of the peace. I consider that 
                for me the duty of being present at the session, of judging some 
                peasants' quarrel about a horse, is as important as anything I 
                can do. And I shall regard it as an honor if they elect me for 
                the district council. It's only in that way I can pay for the 
                advantages I enjoy as a landowner. Unluckily they don't understand 
                the importance that the big landowners ought to have in the state.' 
              </p>
              <p> It was strange to Darya Alexandrovna to hear how serenely confident 
                he was of being right at his own table. She thought how Levin, 
                who believed the opposite, was just as positive in his opinions 
                at his own table. But she loved Levin, and so she was on his side. 
              </p>
              <p> `So we can reckon upon you, Count, for the coming elections?' 
                said Sviiazhsky. `But you must come a little beforehand, so as 
                to be on the spot by the eighth. If you would do me the honor 
                to stop with me!' </p>
              <p> `I rather agree with your beau-frère', said Anna, `though not 
                quite on the same ground as he,' she added with a smile. `I'm 
                afraid that we have too many of these public duties in these latter 
                days. Just as in the old days there were so many government functionaries 
                that one had to call in a functionary for every single thing, 
                so now everyone's doing some sort of public duty. Alexei has been 
                here now six months, and he's a member, I do believe, of five 
                or six different public bodies, a guardian, a justice of the peace, 
                a member of the council, a juryman, an equine something. Du train 
                que cela va, his whole time will be wasted on it. And I'm afraid 
                that with such a multiplicity of these bodies, they'll end in 
                being a mere form. How many are you a member of, Nikolai Ivanich?' 
                she turned to Sviiazhsky. `Over twenty, I fancy.' </p>
              <p> Anna spoke lightly, but irritation could be discerned in her 
                tone. Darya Alexandrovna, watching Anna and Vronsky attentively, 
                detected it instantly. She noticed, too, that as she spoke Vronsky's 
                face had immediately taken a serious and obstinate expression. 
                Noticing this, and that Princess Varvara at once made haste to 
                change the conversation by talking of Peterburg acquaintances, 
                and remembering what Vronsky had without apparent connection said 
                in the garden of his work in the country, Dolly surmised that 
                this question of public activity was connected with some deep 
                private disagreement between Anna and Vronsky. </p>
              <p> The dinner, the wine, the dinner set, were all very good; but 
                it was all like what Darya Alexandrovna had seen at formal dinners 
                and balls which of late years had become quite unfamiliar to her; 
                it all had the same impersonal and constrained character, and 
                so on an ordinary day and in a little circle of friends it made 
                a disagreeable impression on her. </p>
              <p> After dinner they sat on the terrace; then they proceeded to 
                play lawn tennis. The players, divided into two parties, stood 
                on opposite sides of a tightly drawn net with gilt poles, on the 
                carefully leveled and rolled croquet ground. Darya Alexandrovna 
                made an attempt to play, but it was a long time before she could 
                understand the game, and by the time she did understand it she 
                was so tired that she sat down with Princess Varvara and simply 
                looked on at the players. Her partner, Tushkevich, gave up playing 
                too, but the others kept the game up for a long time. Sviiazhsky 
                and Vronsky both played very well and seriously. They kept a sharp 
                lookout on the balls served to them, and without loitering, they 
                ran adroitly up to them, waited for the rebound, and neatly and 
                accurately returned them over the net. Veslovsky played worse 
                than the others. He was too eager, but he kept the players lively 
                with his high spirits. His laughter and outcries never paused. 
                Like the other men of the party, with the ladies' permission, 
                he took off his coat, and his solid, comely figure in his white 
                shirt sleeves, with his red perspiring face and his impulsive 
                movements, made a picture that imprinted itself vividly on the 
                memory. </p>
              <p> When Darya Alexandrovna lay in bed that night, as soon as she 
                closed her eyes, she saw Vassenka Veslovsky flying about the croquet 
                ground. </p>
              <p> During the game Darya Alexandrovna was not enjoying herself. 
                She did not like the light tone of playfulness that was kept up 
                all the time between Vassenka Veslovsky and Anna, and the unnaturalness, 
                altogether, of grown-up people, all alone without children, playing 
                at a child's game. But to avoid breaking up the party and to get 
                through the time somehow, after a rest she joined the game again, 
                and pretended to be enjoying it. All that day it seemed to her 
                as though she were acting in a theater with actors cleverer than 
                she, and that her bad acting was spoiling the whole performance. 
              </p>
              <p> She had come with the intention of staying two days, if all 
                went well. But in the evening, during the game, she made up her 
                mind that she would go home next day. The maternal cares and worries, 
                which she had so hated on the way, now, after a day spent without 
                them struck her in quite another light, and tempted her back to 
                them. </p>
              <p> When, after evening tea and a row by night in the boat, Darya 
                Alexandrovna went alone to her room, took off her dress, and began 
                arranging her thin hair for the night, she had a great sense of 
                relief. </p>
              <p> It was positively disagreeable to her to think that Anna would 
                be coming to see her immediately. She longed to be alone with 
                her own thoughts. </p>

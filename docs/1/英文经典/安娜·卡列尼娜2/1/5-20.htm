                DEATH</p>
              <p> The next day the sick man received the sacrament and Extreme 
                Unction. During the ceremony Nikolai Levin prayed fervently. His 
                great eyes fastened on the holy icon that was set out on a card 
                table covered with a colored napkin, expressed such passionate 
                prayer and hope that it was awful to Levin to see it. Levin knew 
                that this passionate prayer and hope would only make him feel 
                more bitterly the parting from the life he so loved. Levin knew 
                his brother and the workings of his intellect: he knew that his 
                unbelief came not from life being easier for him without faith, 
                but had grown up because, step by step, the contemporary scientific 
                interpretation of natural phenomena crushed out the possibility 
                of faith; and so he knew that his present return was not a legitimate 
                one, brought about by way of the same working of his intellect, 
                but simply a temporary, interested return to faith in a desperate 
                hope of recovery. Levin knew too that Kitty had strengthened his 
                hope by accounts of the marvelous recoveries she had heard of 
                Levin knew all this; and it was agonizingly painful to him to 
                behold the supplicating, hopeful eyes and the emaciated wrist, 
                lifted with difficulty, making the sign of the cross on the tense 
                brow, and the prominent shoulders and hollow, gasping chest, which 
                one could not feel consistent with the life the sick man was praying 
                for. During the sacrament Levin offered prayers, and did what 
                he, an unbeliever, had done a thousand times. He said, addressing 
                God: `If Thou dost exist, make this man recover' (of course this 
                same thing has been repeated many times), `and Thou wilt save 
                him and me.' </p>
              <p>After Extreme Unction the sick man became suddenly much better. 
                He did not cough once in the course of an hour, smiled, kissed 
                Kitty's hand, thanking her with tears, and said he was comfortable, 
                free from pain, and that he felt strong and had an appetite. He 
                even raised himself when his soup was brought, and asked for a 
                cutlet as well. Hopelessly ill as he was, obvious as it was at 
                the first glance that he could not recover, Levin and Kitty were 
                for that hour both in the same state of excitement, happy, though 
                fearful of being mistaken. </p>
              <p> `Is he better?' - `Yes, much.' - `It's wonderful.' - `There's 
                nothing wonderful in it.' - `Anyway, he's better,' - they said 
                in a whisper, smiling to one another. </p>
              <p> This self-deception was not of long duration. The sick man fell 
                into a quiet sleep, but he was waked up half an hour later by 
                his cough. And all at once every hope vanished in those about 
                him and in himself. The reality of his suffering crushed all hopes 
                in Levin and Kitty, and in the sick man himself, leaving no doubt, 
                no memory even of past hopes. </p>
              <p> Without referring to what he had believed in half an hour before, 
                as though ashamed even to recall it, he asked for iodine to inhale 
                in a bottle covered with perforated paper. Levin gave him the 
                bottle, and the same look of passionate hope with which he had 
                taken the sacrament was now fastened on his brother, demanding 
                from him the confirmation of the doctor's words that inhaling 
                iodine worked wonders. </p>
              <p> `Isn't Katia here?' he gasped, looking round while Levin reluctantly 
                assented to the doctor's words. `No - then I can say it.... It 
                was for her sake I went through that farce. She's so sweet; but 
                you and I can't deceive ourselves. This is what I believe in,' 
                he said, and, squeezing the bottle in his bony hand, he began 
                breathing over it. </p>
              <p> At eight o'clock in the evening Levin and his wife were drinking 
                tea in their room, when Marya Nikolaevna ran in to them breathlessly. 
                She was pale, and her lips were quivering. - `He is dying!' she 
                whispered. `I'm afraid he will die right away.' </p>
              <p> Both of them ran to him. He was sitting raised up, with one 
                elbow on the bed, his long back bent, and his head hanging low. 
              </p>
              <p> `How do you feel?' Levin asked in a whisper, after a silence. 
              </p>
              <p> `I feel I'm setting off,' Nikolai said with difficulty, but 
                with extreme distinctness, deliberately squeezing the words out 
                of himself. He did not raise his head, but simply turned his eyes 
                upward, without their reaching his brother's face. `Katia, go 
                away!' he added. </p>
              <p> Levin jumped up, and with a peremptory whisper made her go out. 
              </p>
              <p> `I'm setting off,' he said again. </p>
              <p> `Why do you think so?' said Levin, so as to say something. </p>
              <p> `Because I'm setting off,' he repeated, as though he had a liking 
                for the phrase. `It's the end.' </p>
              <p> Marya Nikolaevna went up to him. </p>
              <p> `You had better lie down; you'd be easier,' she said. </p>
              <p> `I shall lie down soon enough,' he pronounced slowly, `when 
                I'm dead,' he said sarcastically, wrathfully. `Well, you can put 
                me down if you like.' </p>
              <p> Levin laid his brother on his back, sat down beside him, and 
                gazed at his face, holding his breath. The dying man lay with 
                closed eyes, but the muscles twitched from time to time on his 
                forehead, as with one thinking deeply and intensely. Levin involuntarily 
                thought with him of what it was that was happening to him now, 
                but in spite of all his mental efforts to keep him company, he 
                saw by the expression of that calm, stern face, and by the playing 
                muscle above his brow, that for the dying man there was growing 
                clearer and clearer all that was still as dark as ever for Levin. 
              </p>
              <p> `Yes, yes, so,' the dying man articulated slowly at intervals. 
                `Wait a little.' He was silent again. `Right!' he pronounced all 
                at once reassuringly, as though all were solved for him. `O Lord!' 
                he murmured, and sighed deeply. </p>
              <p> Marya Nikolaevna felt his feet. `They're getting cold,' she 
                whispered. </p>
              <p> For a long while, a very long while, it seemed to Levin, the 
                sick man lay motionless. But he was still alive, and from time 
                to time he sighed. Levin by now was exhausted from mental strain. 
                He felt that with no mental effort could he understand what it 
                was that was right. He felt that he could not follow the dying 
                man's thinking. He could not even think of the problem of death 
                itself, but, with no will of his own, thoughts kept coming to 
                him of what he had to do next - closing the dead man's eyes, dressing 
                him, ordering the coffin. And, strange to say, he felt utterly 
                cold, and was not conscious of sorrow nor of loss, less still 
                of pity for his brother. If he had any feeling for his brother 
                at that moment, it was rather envy for the knowledge the dying 
                man had now, which he could not have. </p>
              <p> A long time more he sat over him so, continually expecting the 
                end. But the end did not come. The door opened and Kitty appeared. 
                Levin got up to stop her. But at the moment he was getting up, 
                he caught the sound of the dying man stirring. </p>
              <p> `Don't go away,' said Nikolai and held out his hand. Levin gave 
                him his, and angrily waved to his wife to go away. </p>
              <p> With the dying man's hand in his hand, he sat for half an hour, 
                an hour, another hour. He did not think of death at all now. He 
                wondered what Kitty was doing; who lived in the next room; whether 
                the doctor lived in a house of his own. He longed for food and 
                for sleep. He cautiously drew away his hand and felt the feet. 
                The feet were cold, but the sick man was still breathing. Levin 
                tried once more to move away on tiptoe, but the sick man stirred 
                again and said: `Don't go.' </p>
              <p> The dawn came; the sick man's condition was unchanged. Levin 
                stealthily withdrew his hand, and, without looking at the dying 
                man, went off to his own room and went to sleep. When he woke 
                up, instead of news of his brother's death which he expected, 
                he learned that the sick man had returned to his earlier condition. 
                He had begun sitting up again, coughing, had begun eating again, 
                talking again, and again had ceased to talk of death, again had 
                begun to express hope of his recovery, and had become more irritable 
                and gloomier than ever. No one, neither his brother nor Kitty, 
                could soothe him. He was angry with everyone, and said nasty things 
                to everyone, reproached everyone for his sufferings, and insisted 
                that they should get him a celebrated doctor from Moscow. To all 
                inquiries made of him as to how he felt, he made the same answer 
                with an expression of vindictive reproachfulness: `I'm suffering 
                horribly, intolerably!' The sick man was suffering more and more, 
                especially from bedsores, which it was impossible now to remedy, 
                and grew more and more angry with everyone about him, blaming 
                them for everything, and especially for not having brought him 
                a doctor from Moscow. Kitty tried in every possible way to relieve 
                him, to soothe him; but it was all in vain, and Levin saw that 
                she herself was exhausted both physically and morally, though 
                she would not admit it. The sense of death, which had been evoked 
                in all by his taking leave of life on the night when he had sent 
                for his brother, was broken up. Everyone knew that he must inevitably 
                die soon, that he was half-dead already. Everyone wished for nothing 
                but that he should die as soon as possible, and everyone, concealing 
                this, gave him medicines, tried to find remedies and doctors, 
                and deceived him, and themselves, and one another. All this was 
                falsehood, disgusting, irreverent deceit. And owing to the bent 
                of his character, and because he loved the dying man more than 
                anyone else did, Levin was most painfully conscious of this deceit. 
              </p>
              <p> Levin, who had long been possessed by the idea of reconciling 
                his brothers, at least in face of death, had written to his brother, 
                Sergei Ivanovich, and having received an answer from him, he read 
                this letter to the sick man. Sergei Ivanovich wrote that he could 
                not come himself, and in touching terms he begged his brother's 
                forgiveness. </p>
              <p> The sick man said nothing. </p>
              <p> `What am I to write to him?' said Levin. `I hope you are not 
                angry with him?' </p>
              <p> `No, not in the least!' Nikolai answered, vexed at the question. 
                `Tell him to send me a doctor.' </p>
              <p> Three more days of agony followed; the sick man was still in 
                the same condition. The sense of longing for his death was felt 
                by everyone now who saw him: by the waiters, and the hotelkeeper, 
                and all the people staying in the hotel, and the doctor, and Marya 
                Nikolaevna, and Levin, and Kitty. The sick man alone did not express 
                this feeling, but on the contrary was furious at their not getting 
                him doctors, and went on taking medicine and talking of life. 
                Only at rare moments, when the opium gave him an instant's relief 
                from his never-ceasing pain, he would sometimes, half-asleep, 
                utter what was ever more intense in his heart than in all the 
                others: `Oh, if it were only the end!' or, `When will it be over?' 
              </p>
              <p> His sufferings, steadily growing more intense, did their work 
                and prepared him for death. There was no position in which he 
                was not in pain, there was not a minute in which he was unconscious 
                of it, not a limb, not a part of his body that did not ache and 
                cause him agony. Even the memories, the impressions, the thoughts 
                of this body awakened in him now the same aversion as the body 
                itself. The sight of other people, their remarks, his own reminiscences 
                - everything was for him a source of agony. Those about him felt 
                this, and instinctively did not allow themselves to move freely, 
                to talk, to express their wishes before him. All his life was 
                merged in the one feeling of suffering and desire to be rid of 
                it. </p>
              <p> There was evidently coming over him that revulsion which would 
                make him look upon death as the goal of his desires, as happiness. 
                Hitherto each individual desire, aroused by suffering or privation, 
                such as hunger, fatigue, thirst, had been satisfied by some bodily 
                function giving pleasure. But now no physical craving or suffering 
                received relief, and the effort to relieve them only caused fresh 
                suffering. And so all desires were merged in one - the desire 
                to be rid of all his sufferings and their source, the body. But 
                he had no words to express this desire of deliverance, and so 
                he did not speak of it, and from habit asked for the satisfaction 
                of desires which could not now be satisfied. `Turn me over on 
                the other side,' he would say, and immediately after he would 
                ask to be turned back again as before. `Give me some broth. Take 
                away the broth. Talk of something: why are you silent?' And directly 
                they began to talk he would close his eyes, and would show weariness, 
                indifference, and loathing. </p>
              <p> On the tenth day from their arrival in the town, Kitty was unwell. 
                She suffered from headache and sickness, and she could not get 
                up all the morning. </p>
              <p> The doctor opined that the indisposition arose from fatigue 
                and excitement, and prescribed rest. </p>
              <p> After dinner, however, Kitty got up and went as with her work 
                to the sick man. He looked at her sternly when she came in, and 
                smiled contemptuously when she said she had been unwell. That 
                day he was continually blowing his nose, and groaning piteously. 
              </p>
              <p> `How do you feel?' she asked him. </p>
              <p> `Worse,' he articulated with difficulty. `In pain!' </p>
              <p> `In pain, where?' </p>
              <p> `Everywhere.' </p>
              <p> `It will be over today, you will see,' said Marya Nikolaevna. 
                Though it was said in a whisper, the sick man, whose hearing Levin 
                had noticed was very keen, must have heard. Levin said `Hush!' 
                to her, and looked round at the sick man. Nikolai had heard; but 
                these words produced no effect on him. His eyes had still the 
                same intense, reproachful look. </p>
              <p> `Why do you think so?' Levin asked her, when she had followed 
                him into the corridor. </p>
              <p> `He has begun picking at himself,' said Marya Nikolaevna. </p>
              <p> `How do you mean?' </p>
              <p> `Like this,' she said, tugging at the folds of her woolen skirt. 
                Levin noticed, indeed, that all that day the patient pulled at 
                himself, as it were, trying to snatch something away. </p>
              <p> Marya Nikolaevna's prediction came true. Toward night the sick 
                man was not able to lift his hands, and could only gaze before 
                him with the same intensely concentrated expression in his eyes. 
                Even when his brother or Kitty bent over him, so that he could 
                see them, he looked just the same. Kitty sent for the priest to 
                read the prayer for the dying. </p>
              <p> While the priest was reading it, the dying man did not show 
                any sign of life; his eyes were closed. Levin, Kitty and Marya 
                Nikolaevna stood at the bedside. The priest had not quite finished 
                reading the prayer when the dying man stretched, sighed, and opened 
                his eyes. The priest, on finishing the prayer, put the cross to 
                the cold forehead, then slowly returned it to the stand, and, 
                after standing in silence for two minutes more, he touched the 
                huge, bloodless hand that was turning cold. </p>
              <p> `He is gone,' said the priest, and would have moved away; but 
                suddenly there was a faint stir in the mustaches of the dead man, 
                that seemed glued together, and quite distinctly in the hush they 
                heard from the bottom of the chest the sharply defined sounds: 
              </p>
              <p> `Not quite.... Soon.' </p>
              <p> And a minute later the face brightened, a smile came out under 
                the mustaches, and the women who had gathered round began carefully 
                laying out the corpse. </p>
              <p> The sight of his brother, and the nearness of death, revived 
                in Levin that sense of horror in the face of the insolvable enigma, 
                together with the nearness and inevitability of death, that had 
                come upon him that autumn evening when his brother had come to 
                him. This feeling was now even stronger than before; even less 
                than before did he feel capable of apprehending the meaning of 
                death, and its inevitability rose up before him more terrible 
                than ever. But now, thanks to his wife's presence, that feeling 
                did not reduce him to despair. In spite of death, he felt the 
                need of life and love. He felt that love saved him from despair, 
                and that his love, under the menace of despair, had become still 
                stronger and purer. </p>
              <p> The one mystery of death, still unsolved, had scarcely passed 
                before his eyes, when another mystery had arisen, as insoluble, 
                urging him to love and to life. </p>
              <p> The doctor confirmed his former suppositions in regard to Kitty. 
                Her indisposition consisted of pregnancy. </p>

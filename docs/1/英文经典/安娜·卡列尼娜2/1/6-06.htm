              <p><br>
                During the time of the children's tea the grownups sat on the 
                balcony and talked as though nothing had happened though they 
                all, especially Sergei Ivanovich and Varenka, were very well aware 
                that there had happened an event which, though negative, was of 
                very great importance. They both had the same feeling, rather 
                like that of a schoolboy after an unlucky examination, which has 
                left him in the same class or shut him out of school forever. 
                Everyone present, also feeling that something had happened, talked 
                eagerly about extraneous subjects. Levin and Kitty were particularly 
                happy and conscious of their love that evening. And their happiness 
                in their love seemed to imply a disagreeable reference to those 
                who would have liked to feel the same and could not - and they 
                felt a prick of conscience. </p>
              <p>`Mark my words, Alexandre will not come,' said the old Princess. 
              </p>
              <p> That evening they were expecting Stepan Arkadyevich to come 
                down by train, and the old Prince had written that possibly he 
                might come too. </p>
              <p> `And I know why,' the Princess went on; `he says that newly 
                married couples ought to be left alone for a while at first.' 
              </p>
              <p> `But papa has left us alone. We've never seen him,' said Kitty. 
                `Besides, we're not newly married! - we're old married people 
                by now. </p>
              <p> `Only if he doesn't come, I shall say good-by to you, children,' 
                said the Princess, sighing mournfully. </p>
              <p> `What nonsense, mamma!' both the daughters fell upon her at 
                once. `How do you suppose he is feeling? Why, now...' </p>
              <p> And suddenly there was an unexpected quiver in the Princess's 
                voice. Her daughters were silent, and looked at one another. `Maman 
                always finds something to be miserable about,' they said in that 
                glance. They did not know that happy as the Princess was in her 
                daughter's house, and useful as she felt herself to be there, 
                she had been extremely miserable, both on her own account and 
                her husband's, ever since they had married off their last and 
                favorite daughter, and their family nest had been left empty. 
              </p>
              <p> `What is it, Agathya Mikhailovna?' Kitty asked suddenly of Agathya 
                Mikhailovna, who was standing with a mysterious air, and a face 
                full of meaning. </p>
              <p> `About supper.' </p>
              <p> `Well, that's right,' said Dolly; `you go and arrange about 
                it, and I'll go and hear Grisha repeat his lesson, or else he 
                will have done nothing all day.' </p>
              <p> `That's my duty! No, Dolly, I'm going,' said Levin, jumping 
                up. </p>
              <p> Grisha, who was by now at a high school, had to go over the 
                lessons of the term in the summer holidays. Darya Alexandrovna, 
                who had been studying Latin with her son in Moscow before, had 
                made it a rule on coming to the Levins' to go over with him, at 
                least once a day, the most difficult lessons of Latin and arithmetic. 
                Levin had offered to take her place, but the mother, having once 
                overheard Levin's lesson, and noticing that it was not given exactly 
                as the teacher in Moscow had given it, said resolutely, though 
                with much embarrassment and anxiety not to mortify Levin, that 
                they must keep strictly to the book as the teacher had done, and 
                that she had better undertake it again herself. Levin was amazed 
                both at Stepan Arkadyevich, who, by neglecting his duty, threw 
                upon the mother the supervision of studies of which she had no 
                comprehension, and at the teachers for teaching the children so 
                badly. But he promised his sister-in-law to give the lessons exactly 
                as she wished. And he went on teaching Grisha, not in his own 
                way, but by the book, and so took little interest in it, and often 
                forgot the hour of the lesson. So it had been today. </p>
              <p> `No, I'm going, Dolly, you sit still,' he said. `We'll do it 
                all properly, according to the book. Only when Stiva comes, and 
                we go out shooting, then we shall have to miss it.' </p>
              <p> And Levin went to Grisha. </p>
              <p> Varenka was saying the same thing to Kitty. Even in the happy, 
                well-ordered household of the Levins, Varenka had succeeded in 
                making herself useful. </p>
              <p> `I'll see to the supper, you sit still,' she said, and got up 
                to go to Agathya Mikhailovna. </p>
              <p> `Yes, yes, most likely they've not been able to get chickens. 
                If so, our...' </p>
              <p> `Agathya Mikhailovna and I will see about it,' and Varenka vanished 
                with her. </p>
              <p> `What a fine girl!' said the Princess. </p>
              <p> `Not merely fine, maman; she's an exquisite girl; there's no 
                one else like her.' </p>
              <p> `So you are expecting Stepan Arkadyevich today?' said Sergei 
                Ivanovich, evidently not disposed to pursue the conversation about 
                Varenka. `It would be difficult to find two sons-in-law more unlike 
                than yours,' he said with a subtle smile. `One mobility itself, 
                only living in society, like a fish in water; the other our Kostia, 
                lively, alert, quick in everything, but, as soon as he is in society, 
                he either sinks into apathy, or struggles helplessly like a fish 
                on land.' </p>
              <p> `Yes, he's very heedless,' said the Princess, addressing Sergei 
                Ivanovich. `I've intended, indeed, to ask you to tell him that 
                it's out of the question for her' (she indicated Kitty) `to stay 
                here; that she positively must come to Moscow. He talks of getting 
                a doctor down...' </p>
              <p> `Maman, he'll do everything; he has agreed to everything,' Kitty 
                said, angry with her mother for appealing to Sergei Ivanovich 
                to judge in such a matter. </p>
              <p> In the middle of their conversation they heard the snorting 
                of horses and the sound of wheels on the gravel. </p>
              <p> Dolly had not time to get up to go and meet her husband, when 
                from the window of the room below, where Grisha was having his 
                lesson, Levin leaped out and helped Grisha out after him. </p>
              <p> `It's Stiva!' Levin shouted from under the balcony. `We've finished, 
                Dolly, don't be afraid!' he added, and started running like a 
                boy to meet the carriage. </p>
              <p> `Is, ea, id, ejus, ejus, ejus!' shouted Grisha, skipping along 
                the avenue. </p>
              <p> `And someone else too! Papa, of course!' cried Levin, stopping 
                at the entrance of the avenue. `Kitty, don't come down the steep 
                staircase - go around.' </p>
              <p> But Levin had been mistaken in taking the person sitting in 
                the carriage for the old Prince. As he got nearer to the carriage 
                he saw beside Stepan Arkadyevich not the Prince, but a handsome, 
                stout young man in a Scotch cap, with long ends of ribbon behind. 
                This was Vassenka Veslovsky, a distant cousin of the Shcherbatskys, 
                a brilliant young gentleman in Peterburg and Moscow society - 
                a capital fellow, and a keen sportsman,' as Stepan Arkadyevich 
                said, introducing him. </p>
              <p> Not a whit abashed by the disappointment caused by his having 
                come in place of the old Prince, Veslovsky greeted Levin gaily, 
                claiming acquaintance with him in the past, and snatching up Grisha 
                into the carriage, lifted him over the pointer that Stepan Arkadyevich 
                had brought with him. </p>
              <p> Levin did not get into the carriage, but walked behind. He was 
                rather vexed at the nonarrival of the old Prince, whom he liked 
                more and more the more he saw him, and also the arrival of this 
                Vassenka Veslovsky, a quite alien and superfluous person. He seemed 
                to him still more alien and superfluous when, on approaching the 
                steps where the whole party, children and grownups, were gathered 
                together in much animation, Levin saw Vassenka Veslovsky, with 
                a particularly warm and gallant air, kissing Kitty's hand. </p>
              <p> `Your wife and I are cousins and very old friends,' said Vassenka 
                Veslovsky, once more shaking Levin's hand with great warmth. </p>
              <p> `Well, are there plenty of birds?' Stepan Arkadyevich said to 
                Levin, hardly leaving time for everyone to exchange greetings. 
                `We've come with the most savage intentions. Why, maman, they've 
                not been in Moscow since! Look, Tania, here's something for you! 
                Get it, please, it's in the carriage, behind!' he talked in all 
                directions. `How pretty you've grown, Dollenka,' he said to his 
                wife, once more kissing her hand, holding it in one of his, and 
                patting it with the other. </p>
              <p> Levin, who a minute before had been in the happiest frame of 
                mind, now looked darkly at everyone, and everything displeased 
                him. </p>
              <p> `Who was it he kissed yesterday with these lips?' he thought, 
                looking at Stepan Arkadyevich's tender demonstrations to his wife. 
                He looked at Dolly, and he did not like her either. </p>
              <p> `She doesn't believe in his love. So what is she pleased about? 
                Revolting!' thought Levin. </p>
              <p> He looked at the Princess, who had been so dear to him a minute 
                before, and he did not like the manner in which she welcomed this 
                Vassenka, with his ribbons, just as though she were in her own 
                house. </p>
              <p> Even Sergei Ivanovich, who had come out too on the steps, seemed 
                to him unpleasant with the show of cordiality with which he met 
                Stepan Arkadyevich, though Levin knew that his brother neither 
                liked nor respected Oblonsky. </p>
              <p> And Varenka - even she seemed hateful, with her air sainte nitouche 
                making the acquaintance of this gentleman, while all the while 
                she was thinking of nothing but getting married. </p>
              <p> And more hateful than anyone was Kitty, for falling in with 
                the tone of gaiety with which this gentleman regarded his visit 
                in the country, as though it were a holiday for himself and everyone 
                else. And, more unpleasant than everything else, was that peculiar 
                smile with which she responded to his smile. </p>
              <p> Noisily talking, they all went into the house; but as soon as 
                they were all seated, Levin turned and went out. </p>
              <p> Kitty saw something was wrong with her husband. She tried to 
                seize a moment to speak to him alone, but he made haste to get 
                away from her, saying he was wanted at the countinghouse. It was 
                long since his own work on the estate had seemed to him so important 
                as at that moment. `It's all holiday for them,' he thought; `but 
                these are no holiday matters, they won't wait, and there's no 
                living without them.' </p>

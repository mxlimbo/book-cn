              INT. HARDWARE STORE - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> Peggy and Mrs. Pressman enter, worried.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              You tell Maggie.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              No, you tell her.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              No, no. You're her best friend.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              (holding her <br>
              newspaper)<br>
              You know, it's just possible that she <br>
              hasn't read this yet.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Yeah.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              Maybe she hasn't read the paper...</p>
            <p> On the counter, they see a copy of USA Today opened to the <br>
              article about Maggie.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN (cont'd)<br>
              ... Or not!</p>
            <p> We follow MAGGIE down the back stairs inside The Hale Hardware 
              <br>
              Store, the prettiest, most welcoming shop of its kind anywhere <br>
              in small town USA. Somehow the place ha taken on the spirit of <br>
              the owner's daughter; both stop and shop-girl radiate brightness, 
              <br>
              charm, and possibility. Maggie comes down steps with a faucet <br>
              handle and goes to an elderly customer, MR. PAXTON.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (bright)<br>
              Here we go! One antique hot water <br>
              handle with the &quot;HOT&quot; still on it, <br>
              guaranteed to fit any American Standard <br>
              cast iron tub with a four-inch center <br>
              made between 1924 and 1938. In other <br>
              words, I think you're out of the <br>
              doghouse with Mrs. Paxton.</p>
            <p> MR. PAXTON<br>
              (amazed)<br>
              Hallelujah.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Alright, Mr. Paxton, I'll put it on <br>
              your account.</p>
            <p> Maggie rounds the bend, another customer, EARL, stands by the 
              <br>
              paint machine.</p>
            <p> EARL<br>
              Maggie.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (walking past customer)<br>
              You don't need an air conditioner, Earl, <br>
              you just need an attic fan -- There's <br>
              more in the back.</p>
            <p> Maggie steps behind the front counter of the store and takes the 
              <br>
              account book out. Her voice trails off as she sees the dour <br>
              expression on the faces of her friends.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> Peggy nervously mentions the newspaper.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              (delicate)<br>
              So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (serious)<br>
              Yes, I've seen it. And I have to say <br>
              it's the rudest and most offensive... <br>
              joke anybody's ever played on me!</p>
            <p> To their amazement, Maggie starts smiling.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              You guys! How long did this take you?</p>
            <p> Maggie stays amused.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              Where'd you get this done?<br>
              (laughing)<br>
              You creeps! I should disinvite you! <br>
              And why did you say seven times? This <br>
              is four.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Uh, Maggie, you told us to bachelorette <br>
              jokes, so we didn't...</p>
            <p> Maggie looks at the stricken face of her friends.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              Holy moly.</p>
            <p> Peggy looks like she is going to cry with sympathy for Maggie. 
              <br>
              Maggie is starting to feel uncomfortable. She looks down, <br>
              dubiously, at the paper.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Um, you know, now would be a good <br>
              moment to tell me this is fake.<br>
              (no response)<br>
              It won't be funny if you drag it out. <br>
              Okay?<br>
              (no response)<br>
              Okay, well... I mean, I can find out... <br>
              Real newspapers smear. Phoney papers <br>
              don't.</p>
            <p> She picks up the paper and brushes it against her apron, leaving 
              <br>
              an INK SMEAR!!</p>
            <p> She nearly kneels over.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              (sitting)<br>
              Bag.</p>
            <p> Peggy and Mrs. Pressman immediately spring to her side. They <br>
              give her a bag to breathe in.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              Bag.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> INT. MAGGIE'S WORKOUT ROOM/GYM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> We see Maggie kickboxing in anger. The radio is on. She <br>
              suddenly stops, yanks Ike's article off the wall, leaves her <br>
              workout area and goes to her desk.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON DESK AREA:</p>
            <p> She turns off the radio and begins to type her letter.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (V.O.)<br>
              &quot;Dear Editor...&quot;</p>
            <p> EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY - ESTABLISHING SHOT</p>
            <p> As Maggie's VOICE-OVER continues to read her letter, we take in 
              <br>
              a Manhattan busy day. It is big, loud, and anonymous.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (V.O.; cont'd)<br>
              &quot;Greeting from the sticks! Perhaps you <br>
              believe that a rural education is <br>
              focused mainly on hog calling and <br>
              tractor maintenance rather than reading. <br>
              Why else would you print a piece of <br>
              fiction about me and call it fact?&quot;</p>
            <p> Te CAMERA FINDS Ike, striding across a busy street, dodging <br>
              taxies. A WOMAN smacks him with a newspaper. He passes a WOMAN <br>
              TRAFFIC OFFICER, then a hot dog stand. He greets and passes a <br>
              FALAFEL VENDOR. THE CAMERA PANS to a USA Today Truck.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (V.O.; cont'd)<br>
              &quot;I suppose Mr. Graham was too busy <br>
              thinking us slanderous statements about <br>
              how I dump men for kicks to bother with <br>
              something silly like accuracy in <br>
              reporting. Which is understandable, <br>
              because with a &quot;man-eater&quot; like me on <br>
              the loose, who has time to check facts?&quot;</p>
            <p> EXT. USA TODAY LOADING DOCKS - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> He passes regular GUYS who cheer him.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (V.O.; cont'd)<br>
              &quot;Still, we cannibalistic queens can get <br>
              pretty cranky when we see things in <br>
              print that hurt our feelings, like that <br>
              we deliberately abandon fiances with <br>
              malice aforethought.&quot;</p>
            <p> INT. USA TODAY LOADING DOCKS - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> He enters the newspaper building, going to Ellie's office.</p>
            <p> INT. USA TODAY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> He walks through the crowded city room. His arrival attracts a 
              <br>
              lot of attention from his CO-WORKERS. Ike seems a little <br>
              surprised, but he's pleased.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (V.O.; cont'd)<br>
              &quot;That's why I was surprised to find Mr. <br>
              Graham's editor was a woman. Call me a <br>
              sentimental fool, but I sort of hoped <br>
              we man-eater could stick together.&quot;</p>
            <p> Ike works his way down the hall to the editor's office. CHUFFA 
              <br>
              Ike greets various workers. He steps up to the editor's <br>
              secretary, ELAINE. She doesn't smile.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (to Elaine)<br>
              I'll put in a good word for you.</p>
            <p> ELAINE<br>
              No, no, don't mention my name in there.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Why?</p>
            <p> A buzz.</p>
            <p> ELAINE<br>
              You can go in now.</p>
            <p> Ike goes into Ellie's office. Elaine picks up her phone.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> INT. ELLIE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> ELLIE is that editor. Stylish and successful looking, she's <br>
              about Ike's age. Ellie sits behind a big desk with a scowl on <br>
              her pretty face. Her casual-looking husband, Fisher, sits <br>
              nonchalantly on the arm of the couch. Ike enters as Ellie reads 
              <br>
              Maggie's letter.</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              (reading letter)<br>
              &quot;Anyway, I'm just dropping you big city <br>
              folk this little note to say that I have <br>
              thought of a ritual sacrifice that would <br>
              satisfy my current appetite: Ike <br>
              Graham's column on a platter. Yours <br>
              truly, Maggie Carpenter. P.S. -- I <br>
              have inclosed a list of the gross <br>
              factual misrepresentations in your <br>
              article. There are fifteen.&quot;</p>
            <p> Ike sits as Ellie puts the letter down and takes off her glasses.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (chuckles as he sits)<br>
              Fully. I like her. She has wit.</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              I left four messages. You don't return <br>
              my calls.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              So? I never returned your calls, even <br>
              when we were married. And what's <br>
              Fisher doing here anyway?</p>
            <p> Fisher gets and places a photo of the cat on a bookshelf on his 
              <br>
              way to the other side of the room.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              Ellie asked me to come down to offer <br>
              moral support.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Since when does Ellie need moral supp--</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              -- It's for you, Ike.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              Journalism lesson number one. If you <br>
              fabricate your facts, you get fired.</p>
            <p> Ellie pushes USA Today lawyer's letter across the desk for him 
              <br>
              to read. Ike picks it up and skims the letter. His face is as <br>
              impassive as stone.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Lesson number two. Never work for your <br>
              former spouse.</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              That's not nothing to do with it. You <br>
              cooked this story up and you know it.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I didn't cook up a story. I had a <br>
              source.</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              Someone reliable, I'm sure. A booze-<br>
              hound in a bar?</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              In vino veritas.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Don't knock drunk guys in bars. Drunk <br>
              guys in bars are good. It means <br>
              they're not driving.</p>
            <p> Ike gets up and stands near Ellie, making his point.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              Besides, I'm a columnist. This is what <br>
              columnists are supposed to do. This is <br>
              what you like. We push, we stretch, we <br>
              go out on a limo. That's what makes me <br>
              good!</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              No, that's what makes you unemployed.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I merely write the stuff. You're the <br>
              one that serves it up.</p>
            <p> Ike puts down the letter and puts his glasses back into his <br>
              pocket.</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              Not anymore. I have to draw the line.<br>
              (pushing a piece <br>
              of paper)<br>
              She sent us this list. Our lawyers say <br>
              it's actionable.</p>
            <p> Ellie hands Ike Maggie's list.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (scoffs)<br>
              Lawyers.<br>
              (glances at list)<br>
              I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is <br>
              going to be very tough on you. It's <br>
              going to be hard to get over. There <br>
              will be therapy bills for you.</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              (shrugs)<br>
              I already made an appointment for later <br>
              today.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (putting the list <br>
              down, standing)<br>
              See? You want custody of my job? ... <br>
              Why not just consider my wrist slapped <br>
              and call me when you feel I've served <br>
              my time?</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              I'm sorry, Ike. This is permanent.</p>
            <p> Fisher winces and looks away. Ike and Ellie look at each other 
              <br>
              for a sober moment.</p>
            <p> ELLIE (V.O.; cont'd)<br>
              If you go quietly, I'll get you <br>
              severance pay.</p>
            <p> Ellie fidgets with her toy rake, then Ike heads for the door. 
              <br>
              He laughs a little at the painful truth of her words and walks <br>
              out. Ellie collapses back in her chair. Fisher goes to her and <br>
              rubs her shoulders.</p>

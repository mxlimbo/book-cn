            <p>INT. DINER - DAY</p>
            <p> This is a great place -- a major hub of social life in Hale. The 
              <br>
              food is greasy and good, Mrs. Pressman is the waitress, and the 
              <br>
              CROWD the essence of what is wonderful about a small town. Bob, 
              <br>
              Maggie and Ike sit on the counter. Mrs. Pressman CHUFFS about <br>
              the luau, then moves around the corner.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Mrs. Pressman, I think we're ready to <br>
              order.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              We're out the special because <br>
              somebody...<br>
              (indicates COOK with head)<br>
              ... didn't order enough sausage.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Let me have the garden omelette. Egg <br>
              whites only.</p>
            <p> Ike looks at Maggie. He'd bet a thousand bucks on what she'd say 
              <br>
              next.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I'll have the same.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (clears his throat)<br>
              Of course.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              What was that? I can't order my eggs <br>
              without sarcasm?</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Neutral corners you two. You're on the <br>
              same team now. Any more fighting and <br>
              it's fifteen minutes in the penalty box.<br>
              (gently, to Ike)<br>
              Maggie's the nicest person you'll ever <br>
              meet. But she's always focusing out <br>
              there. She's got to start focusing <br>
              more in here.<br>
              (taps his chest)<br>
              That's why she's had some -- whatever <br>
              you want to call it -- problems in the <br>
              past.<br>
              (to Maggie)<br>
              That's what we're working on -- focus. <br>
              Right, Maggie? Focus on Maggie. Focus <br>
              on Bob.</p>
            <p> As Bob has been talking, Ike has been watching Maggie's face. 
              <br>
              The joy seems to have drained out of her.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (quietly)<br>
              Right.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              (to Ike)<br>
              I lead Maggie through a visualization <br>
              exercise. All the sports shrinks use <br>
              this head stuff. Visualize the end <br>
              zone, if you catch my drift.</p>
            <p> Bob takes out a notepad and hands it to Maggie.</p>
            <p> BOB (cont'd)<br>
              Here's today's mantra: &quot;It's an open <br>
              field to Big Bob.&quot;</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Tell me. When you get to the altar, <br>
              will you spike the bouquet?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You know, there's no...</p>
            <p> Before Maggie can finish, Ike intercepts her.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Well, I'm off. A reporter's work is <br>
              never done.<br>
              (heading to the door)<br>
              Mrs. Pressman, thank you.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              Tootaloo.</p>
            <p> INT. ATLANTIC HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER</p>
            <p> GRANDMA JULIA (V.O.)<br>
              I'd like to explain about the weddings. <br>
              There are reasons why they didn't come <br>
              off. Three weddings, no &quot;I do's&quot;. You <br>
              can't believe how much cake we were <br>
              left with. I should weigh three <br>
              hundred pounds. I don't think her <br>
              father minded spending so much money on <br>
              booze that nobody drank.</p>
            <p> We hear Grandma as through the hotel doors, we see Maggie exit 
              <br>
              the diner. She gets a bag from inside the cab of her truck and <br>
              comes inside the hotel where she finds Ike talking to Grandma, <br>
              who is having tea with her friend, NETTA.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Ike... Hi, Grandma.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Gram here was going to give me the <br>
              skinny on why you run from marital <br>
              bliss.</p>
            <p> GRANDMA JULIA<br>
              Right, cover your ears, Netta. It's <br>
              not that she's afraid of the wedding, <br>
              she's afraid of the wedding night. <br>
              Innocent girls are terrified of &quot;the <br>
              one-eyed snake&quot;.<br>
              (getting into it)<br>
              Why, when I was a virgin bride, I took <br>
              a knitting needle with me into the bed...</p>
            <p> Ike winces.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Actually, Grandma, I charmed the one-<br>
              eyed snake awhile ago.</p>
            <p> GRANDMA JULIA<br>
              Oh, yeah, I forgot. I'll tell you one <br>
              thing, your grandpa didn't forget that <br>
              wedding night.<br>
              (no Netta)<br>
              You can take your hands off your ears, <br>
              Netta. Your tea's getting cold.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Can you excuse us a minute?<br>
              (then to Ike)<br>
              May I have a word with you, please?</p>
            <p> Maggie moves toward door.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Bye, Netta... Bye, Grandam.</p>
            <p> He steps over to Maggie in the doorway.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I found this and didn't know if it was <br>
              something interesting.</p>
            <p> Maggie hands Ike a 30-year-old LP: Miles Davis' &quot;Kind of 
              Blue.&quot;</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (excited)<br>
              Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis. This <br>
              is &quot;King of Blue&quot;! This is the <br>
              original recording. Hard to find in <br>
              good condition. Where did you find <br>
              this?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (casual)<br>
              It was in the attic. It was jus <br>
              sitting there gathering dust.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              It's valuable. Hang onto it.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              No. You take it.</p>
            <p> She steps outside, leaving Ike with the record.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music <br>
              I like and then finding me a rare album. <br>
              You're not trying to soften me up, are <br>
              you?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              No -- I'm cleaning an attic. I <br>
              wouldn't attempt the impossible.</p>
            <p> She turns and walks back to the diner where Mrs. Pressman is <br>
              outside watering plants. Ike looks after Maggie and then back <br>
              down at the record in his hand. Somehow it makes him sad.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> INT. IKE'S CAR - LATER THAT DAY</p>
            <p> Ike drives through Hale gobbling french fries from the fast food 
              <br>
              bag in his lap. Ike passes THE INN HALE BAR, same dump of a <br>
              tavern he talked to bartender at.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: MAGGIE'S CAR parked a few cars down. He pulls over <br>
              and parks. He gets out and speaks into his tape recorder.</p>
            <p> INT./EXT. THE INN HALE BAR -- DAY</p>
            <p> Ike approaches the window of the bar. There's a DRUNK MAN and 
              a <br>
              DOG sitting outside. Inside, we see two figures from the back, <br>
              arms around each other. One is definitely Maggie. The other is <br>
              definitely not Bob.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (coaxing)<br>
              C'mon. Let's go.</p>
            <p> As Maggie helps the man get up, we see that it's Walter, Maggie's 
              <br>
              father -- dead drunk.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              (belligerently)<br>
              I haven't had any fun since you got <br>
              your driver's license...</p>
            <p> They stumble and lurch, exiting the bar toward Maggie's car.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I'm not exactly having fun, either... <br>
              Steady.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              (to Dog)<br>
              Good boy, Port Hole.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              I changed it.<br>
              (then to Drunk)<br>
              See you later, Mr. Travis.<br>
              (then to Maggie)<br>
              That guy has a problem... Maggie, you <br>
              can run everyone's life but your own.</p>
            <p><br>
              Maggie's having trouble keeping him steady as she opens the car 
              <br>
              door. Ike is there in a flash to help her pull Walter into the <br>
              car.</p>
            <p> WALTER (cont'd)<br>
              Good daughters let their fathers pass <br>
              out.</p>
            <p> Walter passes out on the front seat.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (without difficulty)</p>
            <p> Ike... Please don't write anything <br>
              about this --</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No. Forget about it. Don't even think <br>
              about it.</p>
            <p> Maggie looks at him with real gratitude. She swings the car <br>
              door shut.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Watch your leg, Dad.<br>
              (then to Ike)<br>
              I'm so tired of this.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Why don't you let him sleep it off in <br>
              the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. <br>
              Then we'll come back for him.<br>
              (to Drunk on bench)<br>
              Keep an eye on him.</p>
            <p> DRUNK MAN<br>
              I'm too loaded.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I was talking to the dog.<br>
              (turning to Maggie)<br>
              All right?</p>
            <p> Maggie thinks about this for a moment. She takes a deep breath.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Okay... I'll just grab my jacket.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. ROAD - LATE DUSK TO NIGHT</p>
            <p> Establishing of Ike's car driving.</p>
            <p> INT. IKE'S CAR - LATE DUSK TO NIGHT</p>
            <p> Maggie and Ike ride along.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              My dad managed a business and two <br>
              mistresses. He wanted me to be a <br>
              novelist. More?</p>
            <p> Maggie nods,</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              My mother wanted me to become a <br>
              musician. 0 for two. But at least <br>
              I'm a journalist and we all know <br>
              journalism is literature in a hurry</p>

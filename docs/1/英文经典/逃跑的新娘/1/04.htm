              EXT. USA TODAY LOADING DOCK - DAY</p>
            <p> Mrs. Pressman continues her story to Ike.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              I'm not sure. Mr. Schullian runs the <br>
              newsstand, he's our local bookie, you <br>
              know, he's giving eight to one odds she <br>
              won't. He says she's so famous now, <br>
              maybe Vegas will give odds on her. I'm <br>
              going to wait to hear what the pros say.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Good fact. Well, you let me know.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              Oh, I will.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Maggie indicates column to Peggy. She looks over at the part of 
              <br>
              the shop used to wash and dye hair. There's a sink, stool and a 
              <br>
              cabinet affixed to the wall above sink, which holds various <br>
              shampoos and hair dyes. Maggie gets an idea. Maggie and Peggy <br>
              step forward toward Ike.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Well, instead of a haircut, how about <br>
              a wash? You know, get all that city <br>
              grit out of it.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              You'll answer my questions?</p>
            <p> Maggie nods affirmatively.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              (removing his jacket)<br>
              Fine. You wash, I'll ask the <br>
              questions.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Great.</p>
            <p> Ike hands Peggy his jacket. A mystified Peggy leads Ike to the 
              <br>
              sink. While she does this...</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Have a seat. Peggy, why don't you give <br>
              him the special treatment that <br>
              strengthens the follicles.</p>
            <p> Ike sits in the chair near the sink. Maggie shakes out a smock 
              <br>
              and puts it around Ike.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              So, what do you want to know?</p>
            <p> Ike leans and rests his head on the sink. Peggy bends over him 
              <br>
              and wets his hair. She grabs various hair coloring products.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Getting nervous?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Nervous? Not at all! No. I've never <br>
              been more certain in my life. Except <br>
              -- I am having all kinds of weird <br>
              dreams.</p>
            <p> Ike pulls the cloth down from over his face.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Weird dreams? You're going to tell me <br>
              about them?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              (calming)<br>
              Let's just put this back here for the <br>
              aromatherapy.</p>
            <p> Peggy recovers his face, then continues to fuss with the hair 
              <br>
              coloring products. Maggie helps.</p>
            <p> INT. BEAUTY PARLOR - LATER</p>
            <p> Ike sits with a towel over his head as Peggy blow-dries the back 
              <br>
              of his head. His back is to the mirror, his body faces Maggie. <br>
              Cindy does her own nails as Mrs. Pressman scratches off lottery 
              <br>
              tickets. The dog, Sprout, sits in is basket.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              In another one...</p>
            <p> PETE, wearing a hat, comes in the front door of the salon.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Hey, Pete, I'll be right with you.</p>
            <p> Ike peeks out from under his towel as Maggie continues.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I'm inside the church. Everyone I know <br>
              is there, only they're not really them. <br>
              They're like Frankenstein monsters, but <br>
              without the bolts coming out of their <br>
              necks. It's all very &quot;Night of the <br>
              Living Dead&quot;. And here's the creepiest <br>
              part -- I look down at my dress and <br>
              it's red. I mean, I have no idea what <br>
              it means. Red's not my color!</p>
            <p> Ike listens intently and stares steadily into her eyes. Peggy 
              <br>
              removes the towel. His hair is divided into equal parts and <br>
              dyed orange and red.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              So what do you think?</p>
            <p> Ike stares back at her, the tickle of suspicion creeping up his 
              <br>
              spine.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I think you'd look good in red.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              No, she's talking about your hair.</p>
            <p> Maggie swivels his chair so that Ike faces the mirror. Ike <br>
              looks at his brightly colored hair.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You're all ready for football season, <br>
              Mr. Graham.</p>
            <p> Ike stares at his hair in total confusion. With icy calm, Ike 
              <br>
              rises from his chair and primps the end of his hair as if giving 
              <br>
              it the finishing touches. Then he sees his defaced newspaper <br>
              clipping and all becomes clear. He picks up the article and <br>
              shows it to everyone. Ike does a slow burn.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Yes, I think I nailed the personality <br>
              profile of the women of Hale.</p>
            <p> Ike turns and puts the clipping up on the mirror.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              (to Peggy)<br>
              My jacket, please.</p>
            <p> Peggy hands him his jacket.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              (sarcastically)<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p> Ike moves toward the door. He spots Pete.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              (putting on jacket; <br>
              to Pete)<br>
              Excuse me, Pete, do you know a place <br>
              that sells shampoo... Strong shampoo?</p>
            <p> PETE<br>
              Doc's Pharmacy. Third and Elm. Tell <br>
              him Pete sent you. Want my hat?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No thanks.</p>
            <p> Ike smiles at Maggie and exits.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (to Peggy)<br>
              He seems crabby.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY</p>
            <p> In front of beauty salon, Maggie follows Ike out.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              If you're looking for Elm Street, it's <br>
              that way.</p>
            <p> She puts on her sunglasses.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p> He walks the other way.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              If you came down here in the pursuit of <br>
              happiness, you might as well go back. <br>
              Because you can't make me feel bad.</p>
            <p> She stops walking and turns to Ike.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I'm not here to make you feel bad. I'm <br>
              here for vindication. In my heart...</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You have one?</p>
            <p> Ike walks back to Maggie.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I feel I'm right about you. You got me <br>
              fired, lady. You destroyed my <br>
              reputation and you screwed up my hair. <br>
              You chew men up, spit them out and <br>
              loved it. And I'm down here to satisfy <br>
              myself on that point.</p>
            <p> PASSERSBY stare at Ike's hair and giggle.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Did something happen to make you care <br>
              about reality?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Yes. Conviction. Conviction that I'm <br>
              onto the truth. You're going to do the <br>
              same thing to &quot;poor bastard number four&quot; <br>
              that you did to the last three. You're <br>
              going to run again. And I'm not <br>
              leaving until you do.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You're going to be very disappointed.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              We'll see.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got <br>
              to get back to work. I still have my <br>
              job.</p>
            <p> He stares at her for a beat, stung by her words.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I have nothing to hide, Mr. Graham. <br>
              Talk to whoever you want. You might <br>
              actually stumble upon a fact or two.</p>
            <p> Maggie walks away. Ike walks a few steps and stops at a KID on 
              <br>
              a bike.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Hey, kid, I'll give you ten bucks for <br>
              your hat.</p>
            <p> Kid agrees. Ike puts the hat on and starts to cross the street. 
              <br>
              An OLD WOMAN walks by and hits him with a newspaper. Ike is <br>
              stunned.</p>
            <p> EXT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - DUSK</p>
            <p> Maggie pulls into the driveway in her truck. She's in a fine <br>
              mood as she walks right in the house.</p>
            <p> INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - DUSK</p>
            <p> Bob, Walter, and Maggie's GRANDMOTHER JULIA sit in the living 
              <br>
              room. Grandma is sewing one of Maggie's wedding veils. Walter <br>
              drinks wine, Ike wears a hat.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              You know, when I only see one dog, I <br>
              know I've had too much to drink.</p>
            <p> Te family dog, Skipper, sits near a ceramic dog table. Maggie 
              <br>
              smiles as she walks in the front door and puts down her tool box 
              <br>
              and bag.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You'll never guess who came crawling <br>
              into town with his tail between his <br>
              legs.</p>
            <p> IKE (o.s.)<br>
              Who?</p>
            <p> Maggie enters the parlor to see Ike smiling evilly from his seat 
              <br>
              on the couch.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              (innocently)<br>
              Hello, Maggie. I just came by to <br>
              apologize to your family.<br>
              (looks to Walter)<br>
              When I'm wrong, I'm wrong. I pushed a <br>
              story. I made a mistake.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              In other words -- he's only human. An <br>
              he brought us a bottle of wine.</p>
            <p> Raises the bottle to Maggie.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              They made me put my hat back on.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              Oh, yeah. Scared the hell out of <br>
              Skipper.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You've got to be kidding me.</p>
            <p> Maggie stares at them both.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              (enjoying the moment)<br>
              No, no, you should have seen Skipper.<br>
              (then, imitates <br>
              growling)<br>
              It wasn't that funny.</p>
            <p> Maggie gives him a look that says, &quot;You are not absolved.&quot; 
              She <br>
              smiles stiffly, looking back at Ike. She then sits on the arm <br>
              of Bob's chair and puts her arm on his shoulder.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              So, the forces of good and evil have <br>
              already met.</p>
            <p> Maggie takes the wine bottle from the table next to Walter. She 
              <br>
              snaps a look to Bob, who follows her.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              I'll help you take into the kitchen.</p>
            <p> GRANDMA JULIA<br>
              Check on the crabs, Bob.</p>
            <p> We overhear them murmuring in annoyed tones about the wedding 
              <br>
              plans as they exit... Walter puts down his drink.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out <br>
              there. You don't think they'll call it <br>
              off...?</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              Well, wedding cake freezes. This we <br>
              know.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              You know, your daughter seems...</p>
            <p> Ike notices that he's been sewn to the veil.</p>
            <p> GRANDMA JULIA<br>
              Sorry.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              That's okay, Grandma.</p>
            <p> Grandma cuts the thread and separates the veil from Ike's sleeve.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              (continuing his thought)<br>
              ... Like such a lovely girl.</p>
            <p> Walter points to a portrait painting on the wall.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              Like her mother.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (seeing the portrait)<br>
              Ah, beautiful.<br>
              (gets up to admire <br>
              the portrait)<br>
              I just can't see her leaving multiple <br>
              grooms in the dust like that.</p>
            <p> GRANDMA JULIA<br>
              Oh, yes, you can. She's has 'em all on <br>
              tape.</p>

              She has a tape?</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              (good-natured)<br>
              Yeah. Lee at the hotel videos wedding. <br>
              I mean Maggie didn't know she was going <br>
              to make the hundred-yard dash.</p>
            <p> Walter gestures to a pile of video cassettes on the bookcase. 
              <br>
              Ike checks on the tapes.</p>

              Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee <br>
              operation, Grandma's birthday...</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              Gotta tell you this about my daughter. <br>
              My daughter makes real good time, even <br>
              in a long dress and heels. Maggie may <br>
              not be Hale's longest running joke, but <br>
              she certainly is the fastest.</p>
            <p> Walter cracks up.</p>
            <p> GRANDMA JULIA<br>
              (sarcastically)<br>
              Ha ha.</p>
            <p> CLOSE ON: A tape. It reads: &quot;Maggie I, II, III.&quot; Ike's 
              <br>
              interest is more than piqued. Ike picks it up. They get up and <br>
              go to the dining room.</p>

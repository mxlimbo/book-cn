            EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY
            <p> Various High School SPORTS TEAMS practice. Maggie strides across 
              <br>
              the football field, a scowl on her face. A few HIGH SCHOOL <br>
              FOOTBALL PLAYERS job past Maggie, doing laps. A boy, KENDALL, <br>
              calls out to her affectionately as she passes. One of them, <br>
              DENNIS, slows his pace to run alongside Maggie.</p>
            <p> DENNIS<br>
              (playful)<br>
              Maggie, don't marry Coach! Marry me. <br>
              I love you.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You're jail bait, Dennis. Go away. <br>
              Run your laps. Go. Go.</p>
            <p> Dennis runs on as Maggie continues toward her goal: Bob and Ike,<br>
              standing together on the other side of the field.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON BOB AND IKE</p>
            <p> They're both standing on the blocking sled. Wave after wave of 
              <br>
              VARSITY FOOTBALL PLAYERS ram into the sled and drive it across <br>
              the field with both Ike and Bob on top of it. Ike is munching on 
              <br>
              one of the cinnamon rolls as Bob pushes the KIDS.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Drive! Drive! From your hips, get low, <br>
              get low, get low. Next!</p>
            <p> Ike smiles broadly atop of the sled as he sees Maggie <br>
              approaching, looking mighty peeved. He nudges Bob and points to 
              <br>
              Maggie. Bob lights up at the sight of her.</p>
            <p> BOB (cont'd)<br>
              Good job, gentlemen... Special teams.</p>
            <p> The football players move away from the sled. Bob moves to <br>
              Maggie, leaves Ike alone.</p>
            <p> BOB (cont'd)<br>
              (to Maggie)<br>
              Hey, honey!</p>
            <p> Bob kisses and embraces Maggie. She doesn't see Ike immediately, 
              <br>
              then:</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (indicating Ike)<br>
              What is he up to now?</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Ike just came by to check out the team.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              And talk about you.</p>
            <p> Ike grins and shows Maggie the notes in his pocket.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Bob -- are you making friends with this <br>
              man?</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              I'm just bragging about how great you <br>
              are. I'm the luckiest man alive.</p>
            <p> Bob grabs Maggie around the waist and smooches her adoringly. 
              <br>
              Maggie scowls at Ike. He nods, all charm.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Well -- I've got to get moving -- lot <br>
              of work to do today! I'll see you two <br>
              love-birds later.</p>
            <p> Ike leaves. Bob calls after him.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              See you at the wedding.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              You bet ya, Coach.</p>
            <p> Maggie is aghast. She stares at Bob. Ike joins in behind a line 
              <br>
              of peppy cheerleaders.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              At the wedding? You invite him? Bob, <br>
              don't you realize he's writing another <br>
              article about me?</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Sure I do. But the bet defense is a <br>
              good offense, right? You're not going <br>
              to let your opponent throw you off <br>
              your game.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You don't understand this guy.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Let him come to the wedding. You're <br>
              not running, right? Say it. &quot;I'm <br>
              not...&quot;</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (irritably)<br>
              I'm not running.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              So if you're not running and Ike Graham <br>
              is there to see it, then any article he <br>
              writes has got to have a happy ending, <br>
              right? All we're doing is turning <br>
              lemon into lemonade.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I've got news for you. No amount of <br>
              sugar and water is going to turn like <br>
              Graham into something you want to take <br>
              on a picnic.</p>
            <p> Bob gives Maggie a big hug.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              Where's that homemade sunshine?</p>
            <p> Bob blows his whistle, then puts Maggie on the football sled.</p>
            <p> BOB (cont'd)<br>
              I want you boys to take my princess on <br>
              the ride of her life... Honey, tell 'em <br>
              where you parked your car.</p>
            <p> Maggie screams as the boys push her down the football field.</p>
            <p> INT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH/CHURCH - DAY</p>
            <p> Maggie kneels, hands folded reverently. The booth's grate opens 
              <br>
              before her.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. <br>
              My last confession was... ahh...</p>
            <p> She tries to recall.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              ... Anyway, I have sort of a technical <br>
              question here. I've been having -- bad <br>
              thoughts. I mean, really bad thoughts<br>
              ...</p>
            <p> PRIEST<br>
              Of an impure nature?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              No -- like -- I'm having a problem with <br>
              that whole turn-the-other-cheek concept. <br>
              I want revenge. I want to destroy this <br>
              guy's life, career, everything. On the <br>
              sin scale, how big is that? I mean, <br>
              can I &quot;Hail Mary&quot; my way out of it?</p>
            <p> PRIEST<br>
              Child, any sin in one's heart is...</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (impatient)<br>
              The name's Maggie. It wasn't this side <br>
              of ten years ago that you had your <br>
              tongue down my throat. So don't call <br>
              me &quot;child&quot;, Brian. It annoys me.</p>
            <p> PRIEST/ BRIAN<br>
              Now don't get upset.</p>
            <p> Brian closes the confessional window and exits</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (still inside <br>
              the booth)<br>
              Brian, open up. Don't ignore me.</p>
            <p> Brian leans into her confessional. She steps out to join him.</p>
            <p> BRIAN<br>
              You're not even Catholic, Maggie -- you <br>
              really shouldn't come to confession.</p>
            <p> He's a nice looking and gentle man. They regard each other for 
              a <br>
              beat.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I'm sorry. I'm just so stressed out <br>
              about that slime-ball reporter being in <br>
              town. I jus had to come warn you he <br>
              might show up here and start asking you <br>
              all kinds of ridiculous questions.</p>
            <p> Brian moves away. Maggie follows and sits in a nearby pew.</p>
            <p> BRIAN<br>
              Actually, he only asked me one <br>
              ridiculous question. The rest weren't <br>
              so bad.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (sliding along <br>
              the pew)<br>
              What? You talked to him! Did you tell <br>
              him we dated before you were a priest?</p>
            <p> BRIAN<br>
              Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, <br>
              Maggie.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              What did he ask?</p>
            <p> A woman, MRS. MURPHY, rushes in.</p>
            <p> MRS. MURPHY<br>
              Father, am I too late?</p>
            <p> BRIAN<br>
              No, no.</p>
            <p> MRS. MURPHY<br>
              It won't take long. Jus two venials.</p>
            <p> The woman goes into the confessional booth to wait.</p>
            <p> BRIAN<br>
              Only respectful things. What did we <br>
              have in common back then... What kind <br>
              of music did you like... Did you ruin <br>
              my life when you left me standing at <br>
              the altar...</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              And what did you say?</p>
            <p> BRIAN<br>
              How could I be angry at you when <br>
              clearly what has happened to me is as <br>
              God intended?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (relieved)<br>
              Good one! Thanks.</p>
            <p> BRIAN<br>
              It happens to be how I feel.</p>
            <p> Brian sits next to Maggie.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              God... Of course. I'm sorry -- I mean, <br>
              I'm...<br>
              (sighs)<br>
              Brian -- I've got to go. The man's a <br>
              lunatic, but I know exactly where he's <br>
              going next.</p>
            <p> BRIAN<br>
              God bless you, Maggie.</p>
            <p> She turns to rush out, then stops herself.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Oh, wait, my purse.</p>
            <p> She moves to the confessional, knocks, then speaks to Mrs. Murphy.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              Excuse me, sorry, forgot my purse. <br>
              Good luck.</p>
            <p> Maggie closes the booth curtain and turns to Brian.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              Wait -- what was the ridiculous <br>
              question he asked?</p>
            <p> Brian smiles mischievously.</p>
            <p> BRIAN<br>
              He wanted to know how you used to like <br>
              your eggs.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Weird. Like after all those years you <br>
              would remem--</p>
            <p> She starts to go, then stops in her tracks as she hears:</p>
            <p> BRIAN<br>
              (interrupting)<br>
              -- Scrambled, with salt, pepper and <br>
              dill. Same as me.</p>
            <p> Maggie looks at Brian. Suddenly, she remembers too.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (tenderly)<br>
              I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.</p>
            <p> BRIAN<br>
              I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to <br>
              be. But if you ever become a Catholic, <br>
              may I ask you a favor, Maggie?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Of course.</p>
            <p> BRIAN<br>
              Could your confess to Father Patrick <br>
              from now on?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Of course.</p>
            <p> And she scampers out. Brian goes back into the confessional.</p>
            <p> EXT. GILL'S GARAGE - DAY</p>
            <p> Maggie drives up to an old brick firehouse that is now an auto 
              <br>
              garage. The faded sign reads: &quot;Gill's Garage&quot;.</p>
            <p> INT. GILL'S GARAGE - DAY</p>
            <p> Maggie rushes inside and looks around. No one is in sight. <br>
              Several cars, including a yellow jeep-like car up on a hydraulic 
              <br>
              lift, are in the funky garage.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Gill? Lydia? Gill?</p>
            <p> A CRASH, coming from the nearby back room, we hear loud muttering 
              <br>
              in Spanish, then out stumbles GILL CHAVEZ, 34, wearing a grease-<br>
              stained Grateful Dead tie-dyed T-shirt. He grins triumphantly, <br>
              worshipfully cradling a CASSETTE TAPE in his hands.</p>
            <p> GILL<br>
              Hey -- I found it!</p>
            <p> Maggie regards her former fiance with patient warmth.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Found what?</p>
            <p> Gill looks up and gives Maggie a fond, hazy smile.</p>
            <p> GILL<br>
              Mags! Hey, look -- The tape from the <br>
              Radio City Music Hall concert -- <br>
              Remember that night I as trying to get <br>
              Jerry to let me sit in on &quot;Ripple&quot;?</p>
            <p> He pulls out the cassette from its case. It's broken. The tape 
              <br>
              is dangling from the cassette.</p>
            <p> GILL (cont'd)<br>
              (disappointed)<br>
              Oh, I'll play it for you.</p>
            <p> Gill picks up an electric GUITAR and starts to play</p>

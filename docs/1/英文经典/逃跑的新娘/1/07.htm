            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (shouts over the music)<br>
              Listen, Gill -- There's this reporter <br>
              who's ben making my life a living hell<br>
              ... If he comes by here, don't talk to <br>
              him. And whatever yo do....<br>
              (crosses to Gill)<br>
              ... Don't show him that picture of me <br>
              at the concert in San Francisco --</p>
            <p> Suddenly, a loud CHUCKLING emanates from the car overhead.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              What was that?</p>
            <p> Maggie stops Gill from playing. She shoots her ex an angry glare 
              <br>
              and moves a lever on the shop wall. With a HUM, the car descends.</p>
            <p> GILL<br>
              We went to San Francisco twice. <br>
              Remember one time we had a flat tire... <br>
              Which picture?</p>
            <p> As the hydraulic lift slows, the car is lowered, revealing Ike 
              <br>
              sitting in the driver's seat. He has been enjoying the <br>
              photograph he's holding.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (feigning shock)<br>
              Imagine! Maggie Carpenter topless in a <br>
              public arena.<br>
              (checks photo again)<br>
              And I see there was a chill in the air.</p>
            <p> Maggie swipes for the photo, but Ike is faster at pulling it away.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Give me that!</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              But the most interesting thing here is <br>
              that I don't see the rose tattoo that <br>
              I've heard about on your back.</p>
            <p> Gill takes off his guitar and sets it down.</p>
            <p> GILL<br>
              Ike bet me fifty bucks you don't still <br>
              have it, Mags. I said &quot;You're on, man! <br>
              Maggie loved that thing!&quot; And I could <br>
              really use fifty bucks.</p>
            <p> Maggie is conspicuously silent.</p>
            <p> GILL (cont'd)<br>
              (looking worried)<br>
              Mags?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I'm not gonna show you guys anything. <br>
              I am a soon-to-be-married woman. Now <br>
              give me that photograph.</p>
            <p> Maggie seethes.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Sure, I would love to give this to you. <br>
              Just give us one quick gander at that <br>
              rose, and, I'll gladly hand it over.</p>
            <p> She tries to grab the photo again. Ike pulls it away.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Fine. Here.</p>
            <p> Maggie quickly turns around and pulls down the back of her shirt, 
              <br>
              revealing the top of her back and a pristine expanse of skin. No 
              <br>
              tattoo.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              (turning back around)<br>
              Satisfied?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Completely.</p>
            <p> Gill is still trying to grasp the meaning of this.</p>
            <p> GILL<br>
              Maggie? You got it removed?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Gill, I'll go ya double or nothing if <br>
              was a stick-on.</p>
            <p> GILL<br>
              (dismayed)<br>
              Maggie?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (admitting)<br>
              I'm really, really afraid of needles... <br>
              It doesn't make me a bad person.</p>
            <p> Ike laughs. Maggie looks at him with rage. Gill dramatically <br>
              pulls down the front of his t-shirt.</p>
            <p> GILL<br>
              Look.</p>
            <p> There it is on Gill's chest: the rose tattoo. Maggie sighs, <br>
              pained. Gill shows it to Ike. Ike looks at the tattoo. He <br>
              shakes his head at Maggie.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (sincerely)<br>
              Look, look, man. I think the man is <br>
              heartbroken.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              He is not!</p>
            <p> Maggie moves the lever on the wall again, sending Ike back up 
              to <br>
              the ceiling in the car. She grabs the photo from Ike and exits.</p>
            <p> GILL<br>
              I think I am.</p>
            <p> Gill grabs his guitar and sits.</p>
            <p> GILL (cont'd)<br>
              Hey, Ike, what would Jerry do?</p>
            <p> The hydraulic lift stops moving. Ike leans out.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Jerry. He'd play. He'd play... Jerry <br>
              would play his heart out.</p>
            <p> Ike sings and taps along in tempo on the side of the car as Gill 
              <br>
              sings and plays &quot;Ripple&quot;.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. HOTEL PORCH - NEXT DAY, SATURDAY MORNING</p>
            <p> As Maggie drives into town with Peggy, they see Ike on porch with 
              <br>
              SHERIFF, POLICE CHIEF and MAIL MAN, all playing instruments as <br>
              a blues band. Ike is not bad on slide guitar. They all like <br>
              Ike. <br>
              <br>
              Maggie &quot;CHUFFAS&quot; with Peggy and moves on.</p>
            <p> EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - LATER THAT DAY</p>
            <p> CLOSE ON:</p>
            <p> The slow, loopy pitch of a softball. A bat connects.</p>
            <p> NEW ANGLE:</p>
            <p> A big wholesome man, CORY, runs for first base. He just beats 
              <br>
              out the throw. Bob, acting as umpire, yells, &quot;Safe!&quot; Happy, 
              <br>
              Cory turns to the stands and waves.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Maggie and Peggy, cheering loudly. Peggy tries to whoop harder 
              <br>
              than Maggie, but that would be tough. From firs base, Cory waves 
              <br>
              back to them. The two women sit back down and Maggie takes back 
              <br>
              up with their conversation. Maggie is still al steamed up.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Okay, he's on base. Can we talk about <br>
              my life now? -- Ike's going to turn <br>
              that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- <br>
              that I was never serious about Gill, <br>
              blah blah. He's totally out to get me.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              For what reason? Some personal <br>
              satisfaction?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              That's what he says, but if he thinks <br>
              that I don't realize he's writing <br>
              another article, then he's an idiot.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              It's probably because you got him fired.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (sarcastic)<br>
              Ya think?</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Not that he doesn't deserve to get <br>
              fired... Look! Cory's going for <br>
              second!... Sneaky!</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Cory as he runs for second base and with a slide beats the throw 
              <br>
              for the force out. The women jump and cheer -- Maggie, again, <br>
              the most boisterous.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Dennis recognizes Ike as he walks up. Dennis tells Ike that he 
              <br>
              is going to marry Maggie some day and shows Ike where Maggie is 
              <br>
              sitting.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON:</p>
            <p> Maggie spots Ike as they sit back down. She groans.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              There he is. Snoop Doggy-Dogg.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Where?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Over there. Ten o'clock. He's talking <br>
              to our little Dennis. Dennis will turn <br>
              into one of those &quot;sources say&quot; things.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              He looks better with that stuff out of <br>
              his hair. He's an attractive man.</p>
            <p> Ike finds Maggie in the crowd and leaves Dennis.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I'd say you've been in the sun too long. <br>
              You handle him, okay? I could use five <br>
              minutes off from that creep.</p>
            <p> Before Peggy can protest, Maggie climbs down off the bleachers 
              <br>
              and goes and stands near the dugout near the rest of Cory's team.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Okay, that's fine. I can do that.</p>
            <p> Ike comes up to Peggy.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Hello, Peggy Phleming, &quot;not the ice-skater&quot;.</p>
            <p> Ike indicates the seat next to Peggy.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              (protesting weakly)<br>
              That's Maggie's seat...</p>
            <p> Ike sits down comfortably.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              ... And this is Maggie's beer.</p>
            <p> He starts drinking it. ON THE FIELD, Cory is getting ready to 
              <br>
              steal third.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              That your husband out there? Cory <br>
              Phleming, a local radio announcer.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Have you listened to his morning show, <br>
              &quot;Wake up with ballplayer&quot;?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Not yet. I had a phlemless morning. I <br>
              hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              This game is pretty important to him. <br>
              He made all-stars in high school, you <br>
              know.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              That must have made you proud.</p>
            <p> Peggy takes a small sip off her soda.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              He was going with Maggie back then.<br>
              (quickly)<br>
              He was never one of her... I mean, they <br>
              were never going to get... They just <br>
              dated for a while.</p>
            <p> Cory dives in for third and makes it. The crowd goes wild. <br>
              Peggy yells and jumps in.</p>
            <p> PEGGY (cont'd)<br>
              Good job, honey!</p>
            <p> But Maggie's whoop sails out above it all. Cory waves. But not 
              <br>
              at Peggy. He directs his delight at Maggie, who jumps up and <br>
              down by the dugout.</p>
            <p> Ike looks between Cory, Maggie and finally, Peggy. Peggy jerks 
              <br>
              her waving hand back down to her side and sits down. Ike <br>
              pretends not to have noticed. The two watch as Maggie and Cory <br>
              smile at each other.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              It's nice that they're still friends.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              (looking at Maggie <br>
              and Cory)<br>
              Oh, sure. That was a long time ago. <br>
              See, she's not a man-hater at all. <br>
              She's very supportive of men...</p>
            <p> Next BATTER hits one to deep left field and it lands in the grave<br>
              yard. Cory scores, greeted by Maggie. Ike and Peggy watch as <br>
              Cory and Maggie belly-bump and high-five each other in <br>
              celebration of Cory's play. No looks at Peggy. Ike keeps an <br>
              empathetic silence, seeing that Peggy is truly hurt.</p>
            <p> PEGGY (cont'd)<br>
              I'll be back in a second.</p>
            <p> Suddenly, Peggy stands, pushes past him and runs down the steps. 
              <br>
              Maggie looks up just in time to catch Peggy's exit. Ike pulls <br>
              his tape recorder out of his pocket and starts speaking into it.</p>
            <p> Maggie shoots Ike an accusing look, walks up to him in the <br>
              bleachers and sits next to him.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You've been here for three minutes. <br>
              What did you do to her?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              You can turn that finger around.</p>
            <p> Ike does an on-the-button imitation of Maggie jumping excitedly 
              <br>
              at Cory. Now Maggie sees what he's getting at.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (defensive)<br>
              You misinterpret everything. We've all <br>
              been friends our whole lives. But <br>
              that's the types of relationship you <br>
              wouldn't understand.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Obviously, I'm not the only one who <br>
              doesn't understand it. The USS Maggie <br>
              leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.</p>
            <p> Ike walks away. Alone, Maggie tries to seem enthused.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              See, I cheer good. What is he, a cheer <br>
              critic?</p>
            <p> EXT./INT. STREET/BAR - LATER - DUSK</p>
            <p> Sitting in front of Inn Hale Bar, we see the BARTENDER <br>
              pantomiming holding the reins of a wildly galloping horse. We've 
              <br>
              seen something like this before. Maggie's wild ride away from <br>
              her last wedding. Ike laughs with Bartender just as Maggie <br>
              drives by the bar and sees this.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (to herself)<br>
              This guy never stops.</p>
            <p> INT. ATLANTIC HOTEL - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Maggie walks up to the front desk of the hotel, where Lee is <br>
              sleeping with his feet up. She knocks his feet off the counter.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Lee, hey, wake up. Give me the key to <br>
              the reporter's room. I want to snoop <br>
              around.</p>
            <p> LEE<br>

            <p> Ike drives up and parks in front of the hotel as he talks on his 
              <br>
              cell phone.</p>
            <p> INTERCUT WITH:</p>
            <p> INT. FISHER AND ELLIE'S BEDROOM (NYC) - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Ellie's on the phone. Fisher sits nearby.</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              Ike's going to get married.</p>
            <p> Fisher throws himself onto the carpet and rolls himself <br>
              helpless with laughter.</p>
            <p> ELLIE (cont'd)<br>
              (without turning to him)<br>
              Fisher, if you pee on that Persian, <br>
              I'll kill you.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> INT. BEAUTY SALON - NIGHT DAY</p>
            <p> Maggie talks to Peggy, Cindy and Grandma Julia. Grandma Julia 
              <br>
              sits under a hair dryer. Sprout, the dog, sits in his basket.</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              I love his eyes. I just believe <br>
              they're listening to you.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              His hair... any color.</p>
            <p> GRANDMA JULIA<br>
              I like his tight butt.</p>
            <p> Peggy laughs.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Grandma!</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              (to Cindy)<br>
              See, this is a mature relationship. <br>
              She's really found it.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> LOVE MONTAGE SHOTS:</p>
            <p> EXT. OCEAN - DAY</p>
            <p> Ike and Maggie fishing.</p>
            <p> INT. MAGGIE'S WORKSHOP/HOME - DAY</p>
            <p> They play ping-pong. They laugh, enjoying the moment.</p>
            <p> INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - DAY</p>
            <p> Ike and Maggie have fun playing cards. The game is slapjack.</p>
            <p> EXT. FIELD - DAY</p>
            <p> Maggie and Ike horseback riding. They sit on their horses <br>
              amongst trees, &quot;nuzzling&quot;. Ike reads as he pushes Maggie 
              in a <br>
              tire swing.</p>
            <p> INT. MAGGIE'S ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> Ike and Maggie open and close a Hoberman ball by holding its <br>
              opposite ends in their teeth. Grandma looks in.</p>
            <p> INT. MAGGIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> There is a fire in the fireplace. Maggie and Ike sit as Ike <br>
              shows Maggie some passages from his favorite books. He's <br>
              reading something from Yeats at the moment. They seem happy.</p>
            <p> EXT. CHURCH - THE DAY OF THE WEDDING</p>
            <p> It is a media circus including FOUR REPORTERS, Midday with <br>
              Meredith and the T-shirt Vendor. Plus three other people the <br>
              reporters are interviewing, a GERMAN LADY, BUTCH KENAN, a <br>
              farmer and Grandma Julia. Reporter DINA NAPOLI walks down the <br>
              church steps.</p>
            <p> DINA NAPOLI (OF WBAL)<br>
              Wedding bells are ringing for the <br>
              fourth time today in Hale, Maryland. <br>
              Maggie Carpenter, &quot;Always a Bride -- <br>
              Never a Bridesmaid&quot;, will be attempting <br>
              to complete her fourth wedding ceremony. <br>
              We'll come back on the air when the <br>
              results are in. Back to you, Jessica.</p>
            <p> Meredith, the low-end public access TV reporter, films himself 
              <br>
              pointing a cheap video camera himself.</p>
            <p> MEREDITH<br>
              The turnout for this morning's wedding <br>
              is usually reserved for royalty or <br>
              Hollywood stars, but Maggie Carpenter <br>
              is Hale, Maryland's special star and <br>
              the citizens of Hale are out in full <br>
              force today.</p>
            <p> The NY T-shirt Vendor pitches his wares.</p>
            <p> T-SHIRT VENDOR<br>
              I got &quot;Bye-bye Birdie&quot;. &quot;What part of <br>
              'I do' don't you understand?&quot;... Get <br>
              your &quot;Runaway Bride&quot; T-shirts here...</p>
            <p> Reporter JULIE MURPHY stands near Grandma Julia and Mrs. <br>
              Pressman.</p>
            <p> JULIE MURPHY (Channel 6)<br>
              The bride's been here for almost an <br>
              hour, but being around in the beginning <br>
              was never her problem. We'll be here, <br>
              showing you the full wedding ceremony, <br>
              we hope.</p>
            <p> Reporter JACKI and TIFFANY stand at the edge of the CROWD <br>
              reporting.</p>
            <p> JACKI/REPORTER #3 (WBOC TV16)<br>
              Will she or won't she? That is on the <br>
              minds of these several hundreds folks, <br>
              who are standing here this morning. <br>
              Not to mention on the mind of Groom <br>
              Number #4, ex-USA Today columnist, Ike <br>
              Graham, who is missing in action.</p>
            <p> EXT. WINDOW OF CHURCH/INT. SUNDAY SCHOOL ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> INSERT window of church. Peggy peers out the window at the <br>
              carnival scene. Cindy sits with Maggie as she leans forward, <br>
              doubled over on a child's chair. Peggy moves from the window to 
              <br>
              sit with them.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (moves to window)<br>
              He's not coming. Watch. He's not <br>
              coming.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              No, no. I saw eight geese flying in a <br>
              &quot;V&quot;.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You and your lucky geese. You always <br>
              see geese.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Not eight...</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              And in a &quot;V&quot;.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Eight is good... &quot;V&quot; could be Victory.</p>
            <p> They ad lib various words starting with the letter &quot;V&quot;. 
              Maggie <br>
              is nervous.</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              Rub your ears.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. <br>
              Cory does that to me when I <br>
              hyperventilate.</p>
            <p> Maggie rubs her ears.</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              We do it to our dog.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              It's hurting.</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              We'll rub.</p>
            <p> After they rub Maggie's ears a bit:</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              He's here! He's here!</p>
            <p> They all squeeze and peer out window. They scream in excitement. 
              <br>
              Cindy rushes to Maggie's wedding dress.</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              I'll get the dress.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              He's here!... He's here!</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Now's the time for calm... If you don't <br>
              calm down, you won't get your dress on...<br>
              (reassuringly)<br>
              He's the one... He's the one.</p>
            <p> Peggy moves to help Cindy with the dress. Maggie stands alone 
              at <br>
              the window a moment. She picks up a toy horse.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              This is not a good sign.</p>
            <p> Maggie goes over to Peggy and Cindy, and starts to get into her 
              <br>
              bridal gown. They continue to ad lib words standing with the <br>
              letter &quot;V&quot;.</p>
            <p> CINDY<br>
              We have to hurry. The Sunday School <br>
              kids will be here soon.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> INT. IKE'S CAR - DAY</p>
            <p> Ike pulls up slowly. GUESTS peer through the his car window and 
              <br>
              wave. Ike rubs his headache.</p>
            <p> JULIE MURPHY<br>
              Well, the groom just pulled up. There <br>
              was talk of a &quot;now show&quot;, but he is <br>
              here.</p>
            <p> DINA NAPOLI<br>
              Ike Graham is here!</p>
            <p> IKE'SPOV:</p>
            <p> He moves as he takes it all in: a FAMILY eats a fast food picnic 
              <br>
              on a neighbor's lawn, invited GUESTS flock by in their party <br>
              best, and local NEWS TEAMS block the way. The STATE SENATOR is <br>
              making a speech welcoming the press to Maryland. A large GROUP <br>
              of reporters head up the church's stairs, hauling their <br>
              equipment. They enter the flood of PEOPLE streaming inside the <br>
              church. Ike snaps.</p>
            <p> EXT. IKE'S CAR - CONTINUING</p>
            <p> Ike stops the car where it is and jumps out, slamming the door 
              in <br>
              anger. The REPORTERS swarm around him as he gets out of the car. 
              <br>
              They continue to pound him with questions as he walks to church 
              <br>
              steps. An OLDER LADY smacks him on the shoulder with a <br>
              newspaper. He turns in astonishment and continues up the <br>
              steps. He charges up the stairs and grabs Lee.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Shoot ours so she has one with an <br>
              ending.</p>
            <p> Mrs. Pressman stands, shooting Ike with her video camera.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              (pleading)<br>
              Mrs. Pressman, please.</p>
            <p> MRS. PRESSMAN<br>
              It's okay. There's no microphone. <br>
              You're no fun.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No, I'm not.</p>
            <p> Ike retreats into the church. Lee comes up to him again with his 
              <br>
              video camera: CHUFFA about Scorsese.</p>
            <p> INT. CHURCH - CONTINUING</p>
            <p> As Fisher and Ellie sign the guest book, a LOCAL LADY stares at 
              <br>
              Ellie. Ellie stares back at her until she leaves. Ike walks <br>
              away from Lee and turns smack into Ellie and Fisher. Ike puts <br>
              his arms around them and gives them a big hug.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Friends. Thank you. Thank you.</p>
            <p> Over Ellie's shoulder, Ike sees Fisher's grinning face.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              We are friends, aren't we, Fisher?</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              (grinning)<br>
              Of course we are. Of course.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Then you'll be my best man.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm <br>
              best.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell <br>
              you what to do. And someone will tell <br>
              me what to do.</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              You always looked great in that suit... <br>
              And Ike? <br>
              (emotional)<br>
              I'm happy for you, honey.</p>
            <p> Ellie whispers in his ear.</p>
            <p> ELLIE (cont'd)<br>
              I'll have a car around the back to <br>
              whisk you out of here if she runs.</p>
            <p> Ellie kisses him on the cheek and walks away.</p>

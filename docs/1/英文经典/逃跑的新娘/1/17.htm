            <p>IKE<br>
              (after sitting)<br>
              Does it matter?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I think so... When I was walking down <br>
              the aisle? I was walking toward <br>
              somebody who didn't have any idea who I <br>
              really was. And it was only half the <br>
              other person's fault, because I had <br>
              done everything to convince him that I <br>
              was exactly what he wanted. So it was <br>
              good that I didn't go through with it <br>
              because it would have been a lie, but <br>
              you -- you knew the real me.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Yes, I did.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I didn't. And you being the one at the <br>
              end of the aisle didn't just fix that.</p>
            <p> Ike takes this in. She's reaching him -- but then the defenses 
              <br>
              go back up. He turns to her.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No, I couldn't fix anything...<br>
              (as he gets up)<br>
              But I still ended up chasing a truck.</p>
            <p> Ike moves out to the balcony. After a moment, Maggie follows him.</p>
            <p> EXT. BALCONY/IKE'SAPARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The balcony overlooks Central Park. The twinkling lights of the 
              <br>
              city stretch out across the beautiful night. Ike looks out at <br>
              the view with his back to Maggie as she speaks.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I understand why you bring up the truck. <br>
              Let me explain something. The fact is, <br>
              you've seen me at my worst, most <br>
              embarrassing, deviously plotting, <br>
              potentially but not certifiably, <br>
              psychotic state. And if you liked me <br>
              then, I mean, now... I can't imagine...<br>
              (crosses to him)<br>
              Benedict.</p>
            <p> Ike has no response.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              I love eggs Benedict. I hate all the <br>
              other kinds.</p>
            <p> She hesitates.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              ... I hate big weddings with everybody <br>
              staring. I would like to get married <br>
              on a weekday while everybody is at work. <br>
              If I ride off into the sunset, I want <br>
              my own horse.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Should I be writing this down?</p>
            <p> She returns to the balcony and hands him the box.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              What's this?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              These are for you.</p>
            <p> He opens it. It's her running shoes.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Used?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              They're mine. I'm turning in my <br>
              running shoes to you.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              This is getting serious.</p>
            <p> Now she is glowing at him, shining with the full force of her.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              And one more thing. I know it's hard <br>
              to believe there could be more. Um...</p>
            <p> Maggie glances around and spots a DECK CHAIR, which she turns 
              so <br>
              it is facing the city lights. Then she softly says:</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              If you could have a seat, please.</p>
            <p> Ike sits. Maggie takes the box from him and puts it aide. And 
              <br>
              then she gets down on one knee.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (laughing)<br>
              Oh my God. No.</p>
            <p> Maggie smiles up at him. Ike tips his head back and covers his 
              <br>
              eyes with his hand.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              No, no -- don't hide your face, this <br>
              only happens once in a lifetime. It's <br>
              definitely a first to me, and you're <br>
              not going to want to miss it.</p>
            <p> He smiles as he looks at Maggie.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              I love you, Homer Eisenhower Graham. <br>
              Will you marry me?</p>
            <p> Ike swallows, overwhelmed, overjoyed, and scared shitless.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Maggie, I gotta think about this a <br>
              little bit.</p>
            <p> Maggie hops cheerfully back to her feet.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (cheerful)<br>
              Good.</p>
            <p> She gets off her knees and stands.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              I was hoping you'd say that.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (laughing)<br>
              You were not.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I was, because if you said &quot;yes&quot; right <br>
              away, I wouldn't get to say this next <br>
              part. And I've been practicing it.<br>
              (pulling up a chair <br>
              and sitting)<br>
              Ready?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I'm listening.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (tenderly)<br>
              &quot;I guarantee that we'll have tough <br>
              times. I guarantee that at some point <br>
              one or both oof us will want to get out. <br>
              But I also guarantee that if I don't <br>
              ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for <br>
              the rest of my life. Because I know in <br>
              my heart -- you're the only one for me&quot;.</p>
            <p> Ike takes her hands affectionately.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Pretty good speech, Maggie.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I borrowed it from this guy I know. <br>
              So?</p>
            <p> Ike looks into Maggie's shining face and pauses. He gets up and 
              <br>
              motions with his hand for her to stay seated. He goes inside and 
              <br>
              turns on some music. The cat is sitting by the radio. He <br>
              returns to the balcony and takes Maggie's hand.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Dance with me.</p>
            <p> They start to dance a slow dance.</p>
            <p> DISSOLVE TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. LARGE GREEN FIELD - DAY</p>
            <p> We see a hill and on top of it is a Pastor marrying Maggie and 
              <br>
              Ike, in beautiful wedding attire. We see Maggie walk down a <br>
              leaf-lined aisle to a waiting Ike. They kiss as we hear the vows 
              <br>
              and hear them each say &quot;I do&quot;. They kiss a twirling, whirling 
              <br>
              kiss, a circular kiss. We hear the applause of about twenty <br>
              people. Slowly, we see the twenty people come over the crest of 
              <br>
              the hill. They are all Maggie's family and friends, plus the <br>
              old grooms. They are all paired in twos, like a love Noah's ark. 
              <br>
              We see others get the news.</p>
            <p> INT. CHURCH - DAY</p>
            <p> Priest Brian hears about Maggie's wedding.</p>
            <p> INT. BAKERY - DAY</p>
            <p> Mrs. Trout hears about Maggie's wedding.</p>
            <p> INT. NEW YORK BAR - DAY</p>
            <p> George, Groom #3, hears about Maggie's wedding.</p>
            <p> INT. ELLIE'S OFFICE OR APARTMENT - DAY</p>
            <p> Ellie and Fisher hear about Maggie's wedding.</p>
            <p> EXT. FIELD - DAY</p>
            <p> ANOTHER ANGLE:</p>
            <p> Maggie and Ike finally break the kiss. Ike takes her hand and 
              <br>
              walks her to two horses. Ike and Maggie, on the two horses, ride 
              <br>
              off happily in their wedding clothes. As the group cheers, <br>
              Maggie throws bouquet. We see it float in the air.</p>
            <p> FADE TO BLACK.</p>
            <p> THE END</p>

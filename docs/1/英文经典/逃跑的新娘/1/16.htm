            <p>EXT. CHURCH DRIVEWAY - CONTINUING</p>
            <p> Maggie flies toward a FedEx truck at next house just leaving.</p>
            <p> ANOTHER ANGLE:</p>
            <p> She gathers her dress and jumps in as Ike yells from window, <br>
              then, quickly climbs out onto the lawn as the truck starts to <br>
              pull away.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Maggie!</p>
            <p> Maggie looks back once, tearful and regretful, and disappears 
              <br>
              inside the truck. The truck races off.</p>
            <p> The PHOTOGRAPHERS turn their cameras on Ike, en masse. He is <br>
              enveloped by a barrage of bright lights.</p>
            <p> Ellie and Fisher, who have also stepped outside on chapel front 
              <br>
              steps, are looking around as Ike turns around the corner and <br>
              past the church.</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              Look, he's running after her.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              Look, he's in pretty good shape.</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              Poor Ike.</p>
            <p> They look after the FedEx truck and watch Ike chasing the truck 
              <br>
              down the road away from the church.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (running; yells)<br>
              Maggie!</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              Where do you think she's going?</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              Wherever it is, she'll be there by ten-<br>
              thirty tomorrow.</p>
            <p> Cindy, Cory, Peggy and Meredith also rush out of the church and 
              <br>
              comment on Maggie's runaway. Further down the road, Ike still <br>
              chases the truck, yelling:</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Maggie!</p>
            <p> As the truck rounds the bend in the road and disappears, Ike <br>
              stops and stares alone after the disappearing truck. A swarm of 
              <br>
              REPORTERS catch up to him, flashing pictures and asking <br>
              questions. Another camera flashes and we cut to:</p>
            <p> A NEWSPAPER PHOTO</p>
            <p> Of Ike's stunned face on the cover of the USA Today. The caption 
              <br>
              reads: &quot;Hit and Run: Runaway Bride Strikes again&quot;. And 
              we see <br>
              headlines in other papers.</p>

            <p> Various newspaper WORKERS also read Jay's column in the USA <br>

            <p> EXT. MAIN STREET/HALE - NIGHT (1-5 MONTHS LATER)</p>
            <p> It's a night like any other in Hale -- the regular order of <br>
              things has been restored on its quaint streets. Quartet sings <br>
              in front of the hotel. LEE AND CORY CHUFFA: About where Peggy <br>

            <p> INT. HARDWARE STORE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Maggie is sitting, end of a long day. Peggy sticks her head in 
              <br>
              entrance door.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              You okay? I'm closing.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I'm just finishing up, too.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Want to go to Butch's for a drink or <br>
              something?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (interrupting)<br>
              No, I'm just going to head home.</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Okay.</p>
            <p> Peggy starts to go, then moves close to Maggie.</p>
            <p> PEGGY (cont'd)<br>
              (stepping closer <br>
              and making a &quot;V&quot; <br>
              with her fingers)<br>
              You know, I was just thinking about <br>
              that geese thing. I think the &quot;V&quot; was <br>
              half of a &quot;W&quot;. A &quot;W&quot; for...</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              What are you talking about?</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Wedding. Wedding.<br>
              (holding Maggie's face)<br>
              You just have to get the rest of your <br>
              ducks in a row.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Thank you. You still think that he <br>
              was....</p>
            <p> PEGGY<br>
              Quick. Very quick.</p>
            <p> Peggy exits. Maggie stares, losing herself in thought. Then a 
              <br>
              VOICE startles her.</p>
            <p> VOICE<br>
              (whispers)<br>
              Marry me, Maggie.</p>
            <p> Maggie jumps and turns to see: DENNIS -- the kid from the high 
              <br>
              school football team, popping up from a low position near the <br>
              counter.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (softly)<br>
              Hi, Dennis.</p>
            <p> DENNIS<br>
              I am going to propose, you know. I <br>
              mean, the right way. Soon as I turn <br>
              eighteen.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You're sweet, Dennis. But you've got <br>
              to go. I'm closing up. Here's a candy <br>
              bar and one for your brother.</p>
            <p> Dennis takes the candy and starts to go.</p>
            <p> DENNIS<br>
              I'm not giving up. A person shouldn't <br>
              give up.</p>
            <p> Dennis exits. Maggie is alone. She turns out the lamp she <br>
              designed, then on again. She turns off the other lamp on the <br>
              counter and exits. We hold on Maggie's designed lamp.</p>

            <p> INT. IKE'S HALLWAY AND APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Ike walks up to his door, carrying his mail and a bag of <br>
              carryout. He opens the door and walks into his apartment. He <br>
              pets Italics, who sits on his sofa bed. Without taking off his <br>
              coat, he goes to his keyboard and plays music as he CHUFFAS to <br>
              his cat about marriage and divorce.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - DAY</p>
            <p> Dad and Grandma Julia are there. Grandma is making lunch. <br>
              Walter is juggling oranges. There's glass of beer on the <br>
              kitchen counter.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              That's Maggie. Home for lunch.</p>
            <p> GRANDMA JULIA<br>
              She's been doing this since the last <br>
              wedding. I don't think it's good.</p>
            <p> Maggie walks in and kisses Grandma on the cheek.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Hey. Grandma, what's for lunch?</p>
            <p> GRANDMA JULIA<br>
              Turkey and cheese.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              Honey, your grandmother and I were <br>
              thinking about opening a wedding gift <br>
              museum.</p>
            <p> Walter laughs.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              STOP!</p>
            <p> Walter looks at his daughter in surprise. He's never heard a <br>
              tone like this in her voice before.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (quiet fury)<br>
              Just stop it. Don't say another word <br>
              like that.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              (putting down the oranges)<br>
              Maggie, it's just a joke...</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              No. It's my life.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              A harmless joke.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              No, it's humiliating and you've been <br>
              doing it since I was a kid. I don't <br>
              like it. Stop. You may not like <br>
              having a daughter with problems. But <br>
              guess what? I don't like having a <br>
              father who's drunk all the time. I'll <br>
              eat in my room.</p>
            <p> Maggie takes a plate and exits.</p>
            <p> GRANDMA JULIA<br>
              That needed to be said. You know -- <br>
              you're always making jokes about her, <br>
              so they won't make jokes about your <br>
              drinking.</p>
            <p> Walter reacts.</p>

            <p> INT. IKE'S APARTMENT - DAY</p>
            <p> Ike goes out on his terrace. He bounces a basketball. It <br>
              doesn't bounce. He sits on the steps of the patio an stares.</p>

              His cat sits on the windowsill.</p>

              I need a plan... A plan to life... What <br>
              would Bruce Lee do? He'd kick some <br>

            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> INT. MAGGIE'S KITCHEN - DAY</p>
            <p> Maggie in front of plates full of all sorts of types of eggs -- 
              <br>
              scrambled, poached, sunny-side up, Benedict, soft boiled, etc <br>
              -- sits on the kitchen counter. She ties them all.</p>
            <p> EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY</p>
            <p> Establishing shot. Two MEN try to fix the engine of a taxi <br>

            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DUSK</p>
            <p> Eke walks by the T-shirt Vendor, goes into a subway station.</p>
            <p> EXT. ANOTHER STREET - DUSK</p>
            <p> Ike crosses a busy street where a MAN is being arrested. Ike is 
              <br>
              passing the upscale &quot;Millennium Hardware Store&quot;. He glances 
              at <br>
              the window, looks away, stops and looks again. The window <br>
              display is made up of an assortment of Maggie's lamps. Logo <br>
              &quot;MAG&quot; is on them. He smiles and walks on.</p>
            <p> EXT. CENTRAL PARK RESERVOIR - DUSK</p>
            <p> Ike stares out at water as he walks.</p>
            <p> EXT. IKE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Ike walks along sidewalk, crosses street, enters his building.</p>

            <p> Ike opens the door to his apartment and flicks on the lights. 
              He <br>
              crosses to hang his coat in the closet. In the closet mirror, he 
              <br>
              sees and is stunned to find: MAGGIE, sitting on the couch <br>
              holding Italics, the cat.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Hello, Ike.</p>
            <p> He closes the closet and crosses to his desk.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Don't tell me. My doorman is one of <br>
              your many admires... I knew I should <br>
              have given him a better Christmas gift.</p>
            <p> Maggie smiles tenuously. She's more than a little terrified.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I've been making friends with your cat.<br>
              (then)<br>
              Is it okay that I'm here?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I don't have much choice in the matter <br>
              now, do I? But I can't speak for <br>
              Italics.<br>
              (to Cat)<br>
              Traitor!</p>
            <p> He moves to the kitchen.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I don't blame you for being mad...</p>
            <p> Ike looks at her. Apparently the word &quot;mad&quot; is an understatement.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              ... Or... furious.</p>
            <p> Ike looks at her again.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              ... Irate? Livid? How's that?</p>
            <p> He starts putting cat food in a bowl. The cat leaves Maggie's 
              <br>
              side and starts to east.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Livid is good. So what is it, Maggie? <br>
              You here on business? I saw your lamps. <br>
              They're terrific.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              It's something I've always wanted to do.</p>
            <p> Ike leaves the kitchen, turns on the balcony lights and re-enters 
              <br>
              the living room from the balcony.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              You actually could make breaking and <br>
              entering into a new career.<br>
              (after opening <br>
              the glass doors)<br>
              So, what are you doing here?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I wanted to talk to you about why I run <br>
              or ride away from things.</p>
            <p> Ike moves away from her and sits on the steps near the balcony

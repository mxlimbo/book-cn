            <p>PART 9</p>
            <p>EXT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - DAY</p>
            <p> Ike jogs alongside of Maggie on her bike. Maggie parks her bike 
              <br>
              and they go inside her door to the house.</p>
            <p> INT. MAGGIE'S FOYER AND STAIRS - DAY</p>
            <p> Maggie leads Ike upstairs to her workroom.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Pardon the mess. I haven't cleaned <br>
              since the fifth grade.</p>
            <p> INT. MAGGIE'S WORKROOM - LATER</p>
            <p> Insert on a cappuccino machine. We PULL BACK and see Maggie and 
              <br>
              Ike standing at her work table. An automatic cappuccino maker <br>
              stands on the table. Its base is made from a used paint mixing <br>
              machine. It looks very shiny and futuristic. Maggie's logo <br>
              &quot;MAG&quot; is on the side. The machine shakes as it steams 
              the <br>
              cappuccino. Ike notices another homemade machine on the table.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              What's this over here?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              It's a birthday present for my cousin. <br>
              Put your finger in.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Cindy the manicurist.</p>
            <p> He puts his finger in the wrong hole of the machine.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              No, the other one.</p>
            <p> He puts his finger in the correct hole. She turns it on. The <br>
              brushes rotate.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (laughing)<br>
              This is wonderful. You reconfigure all <br>
              these industrial parts and you do <br>
              something amazing with it.</p>
            <p> He looks around and spots some gadgets and lamps on another table. 
              <br>
              He walks to them.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              Amazing. Found industrial stuff. <br>
              Willow lamp... Rasta lamp...</p>
            <p> He picks up one of the many logos on the counter. Each boasts 
              a <br>
              &quot;MAG&quot; logo.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              Is this your preferred logo?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I think so.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I like it. This whole thing is pretty <br>
              incredible.<br>
              (studying a lamp)<br>
              I think you could probably sell this <br>
              lamp idea in New York.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Maybe someday.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              You afraid to try?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (stares at him)<br>
              No, I'm not afraid. Just... Maybe <br>
              someday.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Well, I'm impressed. Absolutely <br>
              incredible.<br>
              (sitting)<br>
              I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this <br>
              isn't exactly a woman's room.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              What an incredible chauvinistic <br>
              observation.</p>
            <p> INT. MAGGIE'S LIVING ROOM - A BIT LATER THAT DAY</p>
            <p> Maggie's showing Ike engagement rings.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              That's Brian's. He took me ut canoeing <br>
              on the lake and gave me the ring in a <br>
              velvet box.</p>
            <p> Ike snores. Maggie hits him.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              (defensive)<br>
              It was classic.</p>
            <p> Maggie hands Ike another ring. This one is in the shape of a <br>
              Grateful Dead rose.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              Gill. Of course. He proposed at the <br>
              tie-dye t-shirt stand at a Dead concert. <br>
              It was very sweet until he hallucinated <br>
              that the drum set was a blood-sucking <br>
              space alien.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Always a mood killer.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Still sweet.</p>
            <p> Maggie hands Ike a third ring. It's in the shape of a butterfly 
              <br>
              and studded with multi-color gems.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              George. He proposed at a butterfly <br>
              farm in St. Thomas. The ring was <br>
              inside a cocoon.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (grimacing)<br>
              It's a little &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; <br>
              for me. I can't believe you waited for <br>
              the wedding to run.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              He's an entomologist! I thought it was <br>
              very unique.</p>
            <p> Now Maggie shows Ike the ring on her hand. It's a gold &quot;#1&quot; 
              with <br>
              a diamond set into the number.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              And here we are at Bob. He proposed <br>
              during the seventh inning stretch...</p>
            <p> Ike touches her hand to examine the ring more closely. Her <br>
              surprise at his touch shows on her face as she finishes her <br>
              sentence.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              ... At an Oriole's game.</p>
            <p> She takes her hand down. Ike steps away.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Wait. Don't tell me. The scoreboard <br>
              lit up with &quot;Mary me, Maggie.&quot;</p>
            <p> Ike picks up his cup of cappuccino and moves behind the couch.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              It was one of the most wonderful <br>
              moments of my life. Cal Ripken even <br>
              applauded.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (stopping)<br>
              Highly suspect.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              What do you mean? It was incredibly <br>
              romantic!</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got <br>
              to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.</p>
            <p> Ike moves back to the couch.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              I think the most anybody can honestly <br>
              say is, &quot;Look...&quot;<br>
              (sits on the arm <br>
              of the couch)<br>
              &quot;I guarantee that we'll have tough <br>
              times. I guarantee that at some point <br>
              one or both of us will want to get out <br>
              of this thing. But I also guarantee <br>
              that if I don't ask you to be mine, <br>
              I'll regret it for the rest of my life. <br>
              Because I know in my heart -- you're <br>
              the only one for me&quot;</p>
            <p> Maggie stares at Ike for a beat. His words have taken a little 
              <br>
              bit of her breath away. She covers.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I like it.</p>
            <p> She moves from the fireplace to a chair and sits.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              I'd like it better on a scoreboard.<br>
              (lightly)<br>
              Is that how you proposed when you asked <br>
              your wife to marry you?</p>
            <p><br>
              Ike is taken aback.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              Don't look so surprised, you've got <br>
              divorce written all over you.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I'm a work in progress.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              So? Is that what you said to her?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No. I think I said something eloquent <br>
              like, &quot;So, uh -- maybe we should, ya <br>
              know. What do you think?&quot;</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Now that's romantic. A proposal like <br>
              that and you didn't find eternal bliss? <br>
              What went wrong?</p>
            <p> Ike takes a swallow of cappuccino.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I don't know.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              You don't know.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Maybe you should ask her some time. <br>
              Ever thought of that?</p>
            <p> Ike is restless. He stands up.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Call me crazy, but I believe that check <br>
              I gave you entitles me to ask the <br>
              questions for a while.</p>
            <p> Ike puts down his cup of coffee, gets his tape recorder and sits 
              <br>
              close to Maggie.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Fair enough.<br>
              (thinks a beat)<br>
              Actually...</p>
            <p> Maggie move to TV. She picks up Ike's stolen post-it notes and 
              <br>
              her wedding video on top of the TV, and goes to the front door.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              I'll just need one more day to make sure <br>
              your check clears.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Ow!</p>
            <p> DISSOLVE TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. HALE STREET - THE NEXT DAY</p>
            <p> Ike and Maggie drive in Maggie's truck. They pull up in front 
              of <br>
              a Bridal Shop.</p>
            <p> A spectacular dress fills the small window. It's beautiful, <br>
              romantic, sexy. Maggie and Ike can be seen in the reflection.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Even with everything that's happened <br>
              I've still never been married and I <br>
              still deserve a beautiful dress.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Agreed.</p>
            <p> Maggie gives Ike a smile that lights up the sky. They go inside.</p>
            <p> INT. BRIDAL SHOP - DAY</p>
            <p> The place is fairly large and prosperous, probably the place to 
              <br>
              go in the Tri-County area. A little FLOWER GIRL, 10, is being <br>
              fitted on the pedestal in the middle of the room. A saleswoman, 
              <br>
              POLLY, has taken the flower girl under her wing. They are both <br>
              under the expert eyes of a stern looking woman, MRS. WHITTENMEYER, 
              <br>
              the shop owner. Also, the girl's MOTHER is there watching.</p>
            <p> POLLY<br>
              (to the mother)<br>
              She'll be the prettiest little flower <br>
              girl in your daughter's wedding.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Mr. Whittenmeyer. Hi, Polly!</p>
            <p> The flower girl sees Maggie and runs and hides behind Polly.</p>
            <p> POLLY<br>
              Hi, Maggie. You'll have to excuse her, <br>
              Maggie. Some of the children are <br>
              afraid of you since you dragged that <br>
              little boy up the aisle.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I didn't drag.<br>
              (then to the girl)<br>
              He tripped on his shoelaces.</p>
            <p> Mrs. Whittenmeyer comes forward to greet Maggie.</p>
            <p> MRS. WHITTENMEYER<br>
              You've come for your dress. Good! <br>
              I'll get it from the back.</p>
            <p> Maggie leads her to the front window.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (happily)<br>
              Actually, I would like to get this dress.</p>
            <p> She points to the dress. She smiles back to Mrs. Whittenmeyer, 
              <br>
              expecting her to share her joy. Mrs. Whittenmeyer darkens.</p>
            <p> MRS. WHITTENMEYER<br>
              (to Polly)<br>
              Polly, take Leslie into change.<br>
              (then, to Maggie)<br>
              But the one you have on hold is lovely.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (pleasantly)<br>
              Yes. But I've changed my mind.</p>
            <p> MRS. WHITTENMEYER<br>
              It's one thousand dollars.</p>
            <p> Maggie is keenly aware of Ike listening in.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I have one thousand dollars.</p>
            <p> MRS. WHITTENMEYER<br>
              (firmly)<br>
              The other one is only three hundred <br>
              dollars.</p>
            <p> Maggie lowers her voice, hoping to lessen the humiliation of the 
              <br>
              moment.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Is this dress for sale?</p>
            <p> MRS. WHITTENMEYER<br>
              It just seems like an awful lot of <br>
              money to spend on one of your dresses, <br>
              Maggie... You only wear them for about <br>
              ten minutes.</p>
            <p> Ike watches with regret as Maggie's child-like enthusiasm <br>
              drains away, her happy mood crushed by the tactless assault of <br>
              the shop owner. He's starting to see that it's no always easy <br>
              being Maggie. There's a tremor in her voice.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Yeah, that's a good point.<br>
              (then, sitting)<br>
              The other dress is nice.</p>
            <p> Ike calls out to Mrs. Whittenmeyer.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Mrs. Whittenmeyer. May I talk to you <br>
              for a second?</p>
            <p> She walks over to him.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              I don't know much about this kind of <br>
              thing. I'm from out of town. You're a <br>
              salesperson, right? You're here to <br>
              sell wedding dresses.</p>
            <p> MRS. WHITTENMEYER<br>
              (huffy)<br>
              Yes. I've been here for thirty years.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Perfect. Because Miss Carpenter is <br>
              here to buy one. But not just any one. <br>
              She wants that one.</p>
            <p> MRS. WHITTENMEYER<br>
              It's a thousand dollars!</p>
            <p> Ike goes over and takes the mannequin out of the window. Mrs. 
              <br>
              Whittenmeyer catches the wig as he puts the mannequin under his 
              <br>
              arm.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              Look, Aunt Bea, we're buying this <br>
              beautiful dress and anything else she <br>
              wants or I'm coming back here with a <br>
              squirt gun filled with India ink.</p>
            <p> Mrs. Whittenmeyer wilts under Ike's fierce gaze. She turns to 
              <br>
              Maggie.</p>
            <p> MRS. WHITTENMEYER<br>
              Will he really do that?</p>
            <p> Maggie gives her a look.</p>
            <p> MR. WHITTENMEYER (cont'd)<br>
              (to Maggie)<br>
              Well, why don't you pick out some <br>
              accessories while I get this ready, <br>
              dear. Polly, will you come help me, <br>
              please?</p>
            <p> Polly comes to help carry the mannequin away.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON POLLY AND MRS. WHITTENMEYER:</p>
            <p> POLLY<br>
              (whispering to Mrs. Whittenmeyer)<br>
              It's a thousand dollars.</p>
            <p> MRS. WHITTENMEYER<br>
              Shhhh! The man has ink!</p>
            <p> Maggie looks gratefully at Ike.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Tough to spend money in this town.</p>
            <p> TIME CUT: A FEW MINUTES LATER:</p>
            <p> Ike sits as he hears Maggie's voice behind him.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (o.s.)<br>
              What do you think?</p>
            <p> Ike turns around. Maggie is standing on the pedestal, wearing 
              <br>
              the dress and looking unbelievably gorgeous. She is overwhelming 
              <br>
              to behold and Ike has to struggle to keep his face under control.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (stammering)<br>
              You look... uh... You look fine.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Fine. The newspaper's upside down. <br>
              That's better than fine.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Bob will be very happy.</p>
            <p> She glows. Then the moment between them is broken as she <br>
              suddenly remembers something and grabs the veil off her head.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Bob! I almost forgot! I have to meet <br>
              Bob!</p>

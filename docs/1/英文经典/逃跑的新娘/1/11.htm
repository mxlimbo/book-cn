            <p>EXT. IKE'S CAR - COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Ike and Maggie stare forward. Both seem in melancholy moods. <br>
              They're beginning to sense they're in trouble here. Suddenly, <br>
              the car falters and jerks. It shows to a stop on the shoulder of 
              <br>
              the road. The car backfires and smokes.</p>
            <p> EXT. IKE'S CAR - COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Ike and Maggie sit in the steaming car for a moment.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Your filter's clogged. This takes <br>
              unleaded.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Can you fix it?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              First I have to find some tools. I <br>
              need a half and a nine-six-tenth.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (removing his glasses)<br>
              Of what?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (in amazement)<br>
              Wrenches. My dad's gonna love that one.</p>
            <p> Maggie slams the food closed.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Kind of isolated.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Yeah. It's kind of nice.</p>
            <p> An uncomfortable silent pause. Ike breaks the moment.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              There's one thing we New Yorkers know <br>
              how to do is hail a cab. If there's no <br>
              cab, we walk.</p>
            <p> Ike stares off down the road. Maggie indicates a building in <br>
              the distance, then turns off the car lights.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              I can get some tools over there.... and <br>
              save the battery... There's one thing <br>
              we country girls know how to do is cut <br>
              across a field. It's quicker.</p>
            <p> Maggie points diagonally across the field to where a gas station 
              <br>
              sign glows and the lights from the outer house twinkle.</p>
            <p> He smiles and follows her into the field.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              Be careful of snakes.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Snakes? Are you serious? I don't like <br>
              snakes. I've never even seen a snake.</p>
            <p> He steps carefully into the field, then hops gingerly toward Maggie.</p>
            <p> MOMENTS LATER</p>
            <p> Maggie leads Ike through a cornfield.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Do you think there's only one right <br>
              person for everybody?</p>
            <p> Ike chooses his words carefully.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No. But I think attraction is too <br>
              often mistaken for rightness. <br>
              Attraction is very misleading. And if <br>
              it's mutual, it's well, terribly <br>
              distracting.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Yes it is. And it doesn't mean <br>
              anything.</p>
            <p> Ike nods as they come to a wooden fence. She puts her hand on 
              <br>
              his shoulder. Ike puts his hands around her waits to give her a 
              <br>
              boost over the top. We see the flicker of misunderstanding cross 
              <br>
              Maggie's face at the initial contact. Neither of them moves -- <br>
              forward or back, but the electricity is obvious.</p>
            <p> ANGLE ON: Ike. His conflicted feelings are apparent. With <br>
              difficulty, Maggie straightens up and they both quickly remove <br>
              their hands.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              (lightly)<br>
              I suddenly forgot how to climb a fence.</p>
            <p> They look at each other for a moment, then:</p>
            <p> MAGGIE AND IKE<br>
              (breaking the <br>
              moment jokingly)<br>
              &quot;Tools&quot;.</p>
            <p> She climbs over the fence on her own and Ike follows. They see 
              <br>
              an old guy, LIONEL, whittling on a porch.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE (cont'd)<br>
              Lionel, can I borrow some tools?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Yeah, we need a half and nine-<br>
              sixteenths.</p>
            <p> LIONEL<br>
              Gonna bust out of another wedding?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              You're sure well known around here.</p>
            <p> EXT. FISHER AND ELLIE'S BUILDING - THE NEXT DAY</p>
            <p> Establishing shot.</p>
            <p> INT. FISHER AND ELLIE'S KITCHEN (NYC) - DAY</p>
            <p> INT. IKE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> INTERCUT BETWEEN TWO LOCATIONS:</p>
            <p> Ike sits on his bed, on the phone, working and eating his <br>
              breakfast. He's watching Maggie's wedding tape again. Fisher <br>
              is cooking an elaborate breakfast. Ellie rushes around getting <br>
              ready for work. He is on the phone to Ike.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              (into phone)<br>
              Yes, well, my theory was that she may <br>
              be running because she gets attention... <br>
              Negative attention is attention. <br>
              Like when women whack you on the street <br>
              because of your column, that's negative <br>
              attention.</p>
            <p> IKE (V.O.)<br>
              This is about her negative attention, <br>
              not mine. Did you get the <br>
              reimbursement for the dress yet?</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              (into phone)<br>
              No, I'm paying for the dress. Do you <br>
              think she's still gonna run?</p>
            <p> IKE (V.O.)<br>
              I don't know.</p>
            <p> Ellie enters the kitchen, hears the question and shakes her head 
              <br>
              to herself. If only these boys would give it up.</p>
            <p> INT. IKE'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> He is finding it very hard to gloat. Fisher is annoying him.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (into phone)<br>
              Look -- I'll be in there later today. <br>
              I'll come by and tell you all about it.</p>
            <p> FISHER (V.O.)<br>
              You're coming here?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (into phone)<br>
              Yeah.</p>
            <p> FISHER (V.O.)<br>
              Then come for dinner.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (into phone)<br>
              Okay, we'll order out.</p>
            <p> FISHER (V.O.)<br>
              Order out like a Philistine, when you <br>
              got the Galloping Gourmet here?...</p>
            <p> Ike hangs up and watches more of the George Swilling wedding <br>
              video.</p>
            <p> INT. NEW YORK BAR - DAY</p>
            <p> The bar from the opening scene. GEORGE SWILLING, the same man 
              <br>
              Ike talked to before, is sitting on a stool, nursing his drink. 
              <br>
              He looks better. Ike enters. George looks up and recognizes <br>
              Ike, who takes the bar stool next to him.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Get this man a Kamikaze.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, <br>
              very professional job.</p>
            <p> Ike sits and leans over to George.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (whispers)<br>
              You could have told me you were fiance <br>
              number three.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              And end up in the papers? I've been <br>
              humiliated enough already to last a <br>
              lifetime, thank you. I'm sorry she got <br>
              you canned.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Thanks.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              She's a cacophony of contradictions.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Well, I'm writing another article on <br>
              the cacophony.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? <br>
              Like a moth to a flame.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Guess you'd know about that. You're an <br>
              entomologist, right? How's business?</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              (taking a sip <br>
              of his drink)<br>
              Not bad. I was traveling around <br>
              studying the reproductive and migratory <br>
              patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (sarcastic)<br>
              Neuter a locust, feed the world.</p>
            <p> GORGE<br>
              Not the world. Just Africa and China.</p>
            <p> Ike wipes the smirk off his face. Like Maggie's other men, this 
              <br>
              guy has a worthy accomplishment under his belt.</p>
            <p> GEORGE (cont'd)<br>
              You know Maggie was the only girl I <br>
              ever met who would hold my tarantula. <br>
              On the first date.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              So, tell me, George, why do you think <br>
              she ran?</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              Same as you said. What did you call <br>
              her? A &quot;man-eater&quot;, &quot;a devouring death <br>
              goddess.&quot;</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I don't think that's why she ran.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              Why do YOU think she ran?</p>
            <p> Ike sips his drink before answering.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              I don't know. I'm working on it. I <br>
              was on the wrong track.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              And you defending her?</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No. I call it like I see it. I'm a <br>
              journalist. I'm a truth teller.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              Unbelievable, she got to you.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Oh, please!</p>
            <p> GORGE<br>
              Join the club.<br>
              (passing him <br>
              his drink)<br>
              Here, you need this more than me.</p>
            <p> George heads out.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (protecting, taking <br>
              his tape recorder <br>
              out of his pocket)<br>
              I'm writing an article, I'm getting <br>
              paid to do this, it's going to be a <br>
              cover story, it's going to be published<br>
              ... The facts will be read someday.</p>
            <p> As George pauses in the doorway, Ike holds up his tape recorder.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              What kind of eggs did she like?</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              Poached, just like me.</p>
            <p> George exits.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. NEW YORK STREET/FISHER AND ELLIE'S BUILDING - DAY</p>
            <p> Ike walks down a street toward Ellie and Fisher.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> INT. FISHER AND ELLIE'S APARTMENT (NYC) - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Ellie is on the phone as Fisher enters with beer. Ike sits at 
              <br>
              the piano.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              (sarcastically)<br>
              Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese <br>
              takeout. That's New York living.</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              (into phone)<br>
              ... Just call me when you have it.<br>
              (hangs up, then to Fisher)<br>
              Ike, how is the story coming? Is she a <br>
              man-eater?</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              Or a vegetarian?</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              Or does she pick &quot;NGB'S&quot; -- &quot;Nice Guys, <br>
              But...&quot; Nice guys, but I'm cheap. <br>
              Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... <br>
              Nice guys, but he just out of prison.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No... They're interesting guys. Each <br>
              one of these guys has something going <br>
              for him. I mean, one's been up Everest. <br>
              Another's become a priest. One's a <br>
              pretty good guitar player. And this <br>
              guy today tried to end world hunger, if <br>
              you can believe that...</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              Whoa, Ike. Getting a complex, buddy?</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              Fisher, let him talk.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (sits)<br>
              But one of those guys -- not one of <br>
              them -- knew her at all. Each one was <br>
              convinced that she was perfect for them, <br>
              but they didn't see her. And she never <br>
              showed up so they couldn't see her. <br>
              It's a very symbolic thing happening. <br>
              She becomes what she thinks they wanted <br>
              to be.</p>
            <p> Fisher doesn't like the sound of this. He glances at Ellie, who 
              <br>
              is looking very interested.</p>
            <p> FISHER<br>
              (in shock)<br>
              Ike is turning sensitive and I can't <br>
              bear to watch. I'm going to make a <br>
              fresh pot of tea.</p>
            <p> The phone rings as Fisher exits. Ike goes to the piano as Ellie 
              <br>
              picks up the phone.</p>
            <p> ELLIE<br>
              (into phone)<br>
              Yeah... Oh, Jay... Okay... Bye.<br>
              (hangs up, then yells to Fisher)<br>
              Fisher, don't forget the fortune <br>

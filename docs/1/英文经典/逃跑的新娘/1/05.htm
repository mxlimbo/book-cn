            <p><br>
              INT. DINNING ROOM/MAGGIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The family dog, Skipper, steals food from the table. Walter <br>
              scolds him. Walter whacks his crab with his hammer and Ike <br>
              copies him.</p>
            <p> WALTER (cont'd)<br>
              Emma and I were only blessed with one <br>
              child, not for lacking of trying.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              This is good, Dad, don't leave anything <br>
              out.</p>
            <p> Ike's hammer flies out of his hand. He goes to pick it up.</p>
            <p> WALTER<br>
              So I've come to see it as a bonus, <br>
              really, that we've been able to plan, <br>
              and pay for, so many weddings.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Not this one. This one's on me.</p>
            <p> Walter reacts.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              That's fair.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Despite what you think, I don't do it <br>
              on purpose. And I have no intention of <br>
              doing it again.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              That's right, Maggie. Just keep your <br>
              eye on the ball.</p>
            <p> Ike raises his eyebrows in question. Bob explains.</p>
            <p> BOB (cont'd)<br>
              Sports psychology. It was my major in<br>
              college.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Ahh.</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              (false modesty)<br>
              I'm the town's unofficial fitness <br>
              trainer. Big advocate of the mind and <br>
              body combining for success. You could <br>
              say or you can quote me, I'm a glass <br>
              half full king of guy.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (boasting)<br>
              Bob's the head of the P.E. department <br>
              at the high school. And he coaches the <br>
              football team. And he's climbed <br>
              Everest.</p>
            <p> To Maggie's satisfaction, Ike shoots Bob a look of begrudging 
              <br>
              respect. Nobody who's been up Everest is a total clown.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (impressed)<br>
              Everest. Is that right?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Twice...</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Really?</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (sticking it to Ike)<br>
              Without oxygen...</p>
            <p> BOB<br>
              My girl likes to brag about me.</p>
            <p> Bob and Maggie kiss Ike two little love-birds.</p>
            <p> BOB (cont'd)<br>
              I'm taking her trekking on Annapurna on <br>
              our honeymoon.</p>
            <p> Ike is highly amused.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              How romantic.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (sharply)<br>
              We think so.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed <br>
              with two Sherpas and a yak.</p>
            <p> Walter cracks up, Maggie shoots Ike a look. He smiles back.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> INT. IKE'S HOTEL ROOM/INT. FISHER AND ELLIE'S BEDROOM (NYC)</p>
            <p> INTERCUT TELEPHONE CONVERSATION</p>
            <p> Fisher and Ellie are exercising. Fisher is on a cycle machine. 
              <br>
              Ellie does yoga stretches. Ike sits back on the couch, puts on <br>
              his glasses and watches a video taped wedding playing on the TV 
              <br>
              screen. Superimposed titles read &quot;Brian Norris wedding.&quot;</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (to Fisher; into phone)<br>
              You won't believe what I'm looking at, <br>
              Fisher. A videotape of all three train <br>
              wrecks.</p>
            <p> THE TV - CLOSE</p>
            <p> Two flower girls and Peggy enter a crowded church where the <br>
              groom, Brian, and his best man wait at the altar.</p>
            <p> Now we see Maggie come down the aisle, then walk past the altar. 
              <br>
              We see Maggie move away another aisle and out of the church. <br>
              SHOCKED WEDDING GUESTS rise in horror, as she runs from this <br>
              first wedding. She drags the train boy up the second aisle as <br>
              she leaves. Ike hangs up. He gets up to pick up the remote and <br>
              then sits back down to watch.</p>
            <p> The tape fast-forwards to the next wedding. Now Ike is looking 
              <br>
              at a much more relaxed, hipper, backyard wedding. It says, <br>
              &quot;Gill Chavez Wedding&quot;. He hits the fast-forward button 
              <br>
              (sometimes slowing down).</p>
            <p> ON TV:</p>
            <p> We see the Carpenter's backyard. It is Gill and Maggie's <br>
              wedding day. The yard is crowded with a MIXTURE of Hells <br>
              Angels-types, Deadheads and townspeople. The &quot;altar&quot; is 
              a band <br>
              platform against the back fence. <br>
              <br>
              Gill is waiting on the platform with a rock combo playing <br>
              Grateful Dead-type music. He makes an introductory speech. <br>
              <br>
              Maggie steps out onto the back porch. She's beautiful in a <br>
              hippie-type wedding ensemble. She walks with her father to a <br>
              trampoline. We can see her tattoo. She jumps on the trampoline, 
              <br>
              then dives into the crowd. They watch her and body surf her <br>
              over their heads to the back fence. <br>
              <br>
              As she hits the stage, she looks at Peggy and Gill, then decides 
              <br>
              to go. She jumps off the stage and runs up to a passing GUY on <br>
              a dirt bike. She jumps on and turns and waves as she rides <br>
              away. During the video, Ike scribbles: &quot;Gill Chavez&quot;. 
              Maggie <br>
              goes off on dirt bike. The tape fast-forwards to the last of <br>
              Maggie's fiascoes.</p>
            <p> ON IKE'STV</p>
            <p> He now sees the third wedding. It's outdoors, in a tree lined 
              <br>
              area, MUSICIANS plays. Ike laughs as he discovers that Maggie <br>
              approaches the altar on horseback, in a simple white dress, <br>
              wearing a crown of flowers. The Maid Marian look. Ike slows the 
              <br>
              tape.</p>
            <p> ON TV: IT SAYS, &quot;GEORGE SWILLING WEDDING&quot;.</p>
            <p> As Maggie rides down the aisle, suddenly the horse whinnies!</p>
            <p> Maggie has kicked it in the shins. It rears and bolts, <br>
              galloping off with the bride. Ike FREEZE FRAMES the tape on an <br>
              image of Maggie, hair blowing. Although she is panic-stricken, <br>
              her soul seems to shine through in tat single frame. As Ike <br>
              stares at her, the smirk fades from his face. He just looks at <br>
              her, allowing himself to see her expression, her eyes. He can't 
              <br>
              help it.</p>
            <p> She gets to him. Ike gets a restless look on his face. He <br>
              stares closely. The groom is George from the bar.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Kamikaze!</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. TE TROUT BAKERY - THE NEXT DAY</p>
            <p> Establishing. High angle wide shot of a bakery in Hale. Ike <br>
              exits a neighboring shop and walks down the block. He pauses in 
              <br>
              front of the bakery to take a look at Maggie's truck. As he <br>
              does, a middle-aged Black WOMAN walks by and whacks him with a <br>
              newspaper. Ike is stunned as she walks off. He turns to a MAN <br>
              sitting on a bench.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Did you see that?</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> INT. THE TROUT BAKERY - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> CLOSE ON a group of plastic grooms and brides on a counter top.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT is behind the counter helping Maggie with a selection 
              <br>
              of grooms for her wedding cake. The groom figures are spread out 
              <br>
              on the counter. All sizes and colors, some attached to brides, <br>
              some solo, some tuxes, some in dinner jackets.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              This one's very popular, but oh, you've <br>
              used this one before... Brian. But I <br>
              like the white dinner jacket.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              No, he's no good. Too blond.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              (picks up another)<br>
              We'll go with total traditional.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              Too dark.</p>
            <p> Then, Ike comes up behind her as she discards another groom.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              But he's got the Bobster's eyes.</p>
            <p> Maggie cringes at the sound of Ike's voice.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              No -- the Bobster's eyes are closer set.</p>
            <p> She ignores him and continues her search.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              (to Mrs. Trout)<br>
              Could I have two coffees, please? And <br>
              what is that wonderful smell?<br>
              (seeing the <br>
              cinnamon rolls)<br>
              I'll have two of those delicious <br>
              looking cinnamon rolls.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              Sure.<br>
              (picking up a <br>
              miniature bride)<br>
              Here, Maggie. I think this makes the <br>
              best you.</p>
            <p> Mrs. Trout steps away to get his order. Ike moves to the other 
              <br>
              side of Maggie and picks up the bride and groom figure.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Let's see... Excuse me, isn't that cute? <br>
              Ahh...</p>
            <p> He makes the bride figure repeatedly knock the groom figure in 
              <br>
              the head and run away screaming.</p>
            <p> IKE (cont'd)<br>
              Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam! Oh, help me! <br>
              Help me! Yup! That's her all right.</p>
            <p> Mrs. Trout just about bursts a gut laughing. Maggie takes the 
              <br>
              bride from Ike coldly.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              You must be that Mr. Graham fellow.</p>
            <p> Ike turns and goes to her.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Yes, I am. And who are you?</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              Betty Trout. Five dollars.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (as he pays)<br>
              Oh, Betty. I take it you're going to <br>
              be making the wedding cake and they say <br>
              you're throwing --</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              (interrupting)<br>
              -- The luau for Maggie.</p>
            <p> She starts picking lint off his sleeve and buttons his cuff.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (all smiles for <br>
              Mrs. Trout)<br>
              Grandma made me the cutest outfit. I <br>
              can't wait to show it to you.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (cynical delight)<br>
              A pre-wedding luau?</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              Yes. My husband and I love luaus. <br>
              It'll be fun.</p>
            <p> Mrs. Trout turns and grabs Ike's bag containing two coffees.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Fun? Fun isn't the word.</p>
            <p> Mrs. Trout beams. Maggie understands his answer a little better. 
              <br>
              Mrs. Trout hands Ike his items and he pays.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              If you're still in town, you should <br>
              stop by.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              No, I'm sure he doesn't.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              (to Mrs. Trout)<br>
              Actually, I would love to come.<br>
              (taps her service bell)<br>
              Thank you. Thank you so much.</p>
            <p> Maggie steps over, carrying her bride and groom figure choices.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              (exasperated)<br>
              Is that what you're going to do now? <br>
              Follow me around everywhere I go?</p>
            <p> Ike smiles at Maggie enigmatically as he picks up his order and 
              <br>
              heads for the door.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> He starts to leave with his bag. Mrs. Trout stops him.</p>
            <p> MRS. TROUT<br>
              (handing him the <br>
              other bag)<br>
              Your two cinnamon rolls.</p>
            <p> IKE<br>
              Bye, Betty. Thanks.</p>
            <p> He leaves.</p>
            <p> MAGGIE<br>
              He's not a nice person.</p>
            <p> Maggie hands Mrs. Trout her bride and broom figures. Maggie <br>
              looks at Mrs. Trout, suddenly nervous. She dashes out. Mrs. <br>
              Trout imitates Ike bamming the bride and groom, laughing.</p>

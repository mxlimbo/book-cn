                INT. HEALY'S CAR - TWILIGHT</p>
              <p>A content Healy is parked out front of Mary's apartment, absently 
                listening to her spill her guts to Magda while he reads the<br>
                newspaper.</p>
              <p> MAGDA (V.O.)<br>
                I'm buying bananas tonight.</p>
              <p> MARY (V.O.)<br>
                Why?</p>
              <p> MAGDA (V.O.)<br>
                Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana 
                split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.</p>
              <p> MARY (V.O.)<br>
                Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I 
                will.</p>
              <p>INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - SAME</p>
              <p>Mary is skipping around the apartment while Magda sits on the<br>
                couch.</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather 
                gloves and an oyster shucker.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean 
                everyone else has to be.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                Oh no? I ain't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety 
                on the Blue Monster.</p>
              <p>BACK ON HEALY - he's reveling in it all.</p>
              <p> MARY (V.O. )<br>
                Well I am pretty psyched. I ran into a guy today I hadn't seen 
                since high school.</p>
              <p>Healy loses the smile and sits up.</p>
              <p> MAGDA (V.O.)<br>
                An old flame?</p>
              <p> MARY (V.O.)<br>
                Kind of. Ted Peloquin--one of the sweetest guys in the world.</p>
              <p>Healy TURNS UP THE VOLUME.</p>
              <p>ON MARY</p>
              <p> MARY (cont'd)<br>
                He was so shy and clumsy...I had a major crush on him.</p>
              <p>BACK ON HEALY as he nearly puts his head through the roof. He 
                grabs hold of the steering wheel and pounds his head on it.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
              <p> MARY (V.O.) (cont'd)<br>
                We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call<br>
                what's-his-face and cancel.</p>
              <p>ON MARY</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                Do I sense a chill in the air?</p>
              <p>Mary sits down.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Oh, Magda, I let my head get in the way of my love life. I always 
                pick guys on what I feel in here.<br>
                (pats heart)<br>
                But with this Pat guy my head kept saying &quot;Grow up, Mary. 
                You have a lot in common with this one, you'll grow to feel something 
                for him.&quot; But it never happened.</p>
              <p>ON HEALY - he couldn't look more crushed. Suddenly his cellular 
                phone RINGS. He stares at it for TWO, THREE, FOUR RINGS. Panic-stricken. 
                Then he answers it.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                (jovial voice)<br>
                Hey, Patty-boy here. Sorry I missed ya, but I'm out rustling up 
                some champagne and roses in preparation for the greatest<br>
                birthday of my life. Hope you and yours are having a good day, 
                too.</p>
              <p>Healy makes a BEEP sound and then holds his breath.</p>
              <p>ON MARY - she stares at the phone, feeling cornered.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Uh, hi Pat, it's me, Mary. Just wanted to say I'm...looking forward 
                to tonight.</p>
              <p>She hangs up.</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                I can't do it--I just found out it's his birthday.<br>
                (sighs)<br>
                I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.</p>
              <p>ON HEALY - he blows imaginary smoke off an imaginary gun. Then 
                he sits back and smugly listens to her DIAL THE PHONE. But then 
                he hears something that concerns him--a KNOCK on the door and 
                the dog YAPPING.</p>
              <p>ON MARY - she puts down the phone and answers the door. It's<br>
                Tucker, the architect.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                (surprised)<br>
                Tucker...come on in.</p>
              <p>BACK ON HEALY pulling his hair out. He's on an emotional roller 
                coaster heading downhill.</p>
              <p> MAGDA (V.O.)<br>
                Well look who's here.</p>
              <p>BACK TO MARY'S APARTMENT - Tucker is carrying an unopened BOTTLE 
                OF SCOTCH and absently flicking the YAPPING pooch off his ankles.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                There she is--I brought you a little thirst-quencher, Mag.</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                Oh, you are sweet.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                No, I'm not. I just want to get you-drunk so you'll pass out and 
                I can have my way with Mary.</p>
              <p>Everyone LAUGHS.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Can I pour you one?</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't 
                a social visit.</p>
              <p>Tucker's tone shifts and Mary grows concerned.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                What's up?</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Well...I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.</p>
              <p>Mary seems relieved.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                I know what you're going to say, but he already told me everything. 
                I know he's not an architect.</p>
              <p>Tucker pulls out a piece of paper.</p>
              <p> TUCKER (cont'd)<br>
                I think you'd better sit down.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped 
                for time here and--</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Mary, the man's a killer.</p>
              <p>ON HEALY - he can't believe his ears.</p>
              <p>BACK ON MARY - as she lowers herself onto the couch.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                (stunned)<br>
                What...?</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                I've got a friend in the Boston police<br>
                department. He faxed me this this morning.<br>
                I'll just give you the highlights.<br>
                (reading from rap sheet)<br>
                After a short stint as a petty thief,<br>
                Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery<br>
                by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he<br>
                committed his first murder--a pretty<br>
                teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He<br>
                was incarcerated until age twenty-two when,<br>
                despite a grim psychological profile, the<br>
                state was forced to release him. In his<br>
                mid-twenties and again in his early<br>
                thirties he was suspected of homicides in<br>
                the states of Utah and Washington.<br>
                Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly<br>
                decomposed that there wasn't enough<br>
                evidence to hold him, and on and on and so<br>
                forth and so on.</p>
              <p>Mary looks like she's going to throw up.</p>
              <p>ON HEALY - he listens intently, his face ashen.</p>
              <p> MARY (V.O.)<br>
                Holy shit...</p>
              <p> MAGDA (V.O.)<br>
                Puffy, get over here.</p>
              <p>We hear the PITTER-PATTER of the dog's nails on the floor, then 
                a LOUD THUMP followed by a YELP.</p>
              <p>ON MARY</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Magda!</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                The little shit lied to me about that guy!</p>
              <p>Mary picks up the startled dog and pets him.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                (growing emotional)<br>
                I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting 
                him in an hour.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.</p>
              <p>Tucker puts his arms around her.</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                Why you two never hooked up is beyond me.</p>
              <p>Mary looks fondly at Tucker.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.<br>
                (smiles)<br>
                The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself 
                as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to do. I'll call him right 
                now.</p>
              <p>BACK ON HEALY - he looks stunned. His cellular PHONE RINGS. He 
                stares at it, then picks it up.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses...and I'm really happy. 
                Leave a message. BEEP.</p>
              <p> MARY (V.O.)<br>
                (nervous)<br>
                Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe 
                this--well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to--but I 
                just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm 
                going to have to bail on you.</p>
              <p>As we hear a CLICK, Healy stares at the cell phone, seething.</p>

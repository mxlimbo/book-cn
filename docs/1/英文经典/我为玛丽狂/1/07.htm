                INT. CHRYSLER LEBARON - DAWN</p>
              <p>Healy is on a stakeout. He's dozing. He's been here for hours,<br>
                food wrappers litter Sully's car. He's wearing Walkman-type<br>
                HEADPHONES which are connected to a RADIO SURVEILLANCE MICROPHONE 
                attached to a pair of BINOCULARS.</p>
              <p>Suddenly MUSIC explodes through his headphones--Healy's jolted 
                awake. Who threw the grenade? Recovering, Healy aims the binoculars 
                toward...</p>
              <p>HEALY'S POV - MARY'S APARTMENT ACROSS THE STREET</p>
              <p>Healy has a clear, unobstructed view into Mary's apartment. The<br>
                music is coming from Mary's clock radio. MARY sits up in bed and 
                shakes herself awake, like someone's just poured cold water over 
                her. She cranks the music even LOUDER. Mary hops out of bed, wearing 
                only her panties, and though she's a little older now, she still 
                looks well cast.</p>
              <p>CLOSE UP - ON HEALY - he's become extremely interested in his 
                work. As much as Healy's enjoying the show, he's got a job to 
                do--he speaks into a MICRO-CASSETTE RECORDER:</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                (into recorder)<br>
                Okay, Ted, I found your Mary. Her current address, two-niner-eight 
                Euclid Avenue, Miami Beach. Husband, negative. Children<br>
                and Labrador, negative. Extremely nice ass,affirmative.</p>
              <p>INT. MARY'S APT. - DAY</p>
              <p>Mary walks into the living room where we see an old woman, MAGDA,sitting 
                on the couch LISTENING to a stack of RADIO SCANNERS.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Have you been up all night again?</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                Bet your ass I have. It's an important job,<br>
                Neighborhood Watch is.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's 
                phone conversations?</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                These ain't strangers, they're neighbors.<br>
                This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Meaning?</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right 
                to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's<br>
                a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                (feigning shock)<br>
                You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.</p>
              <p> MAGDA <br>
                I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because 
                Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know<br>
                Puffy only barks at bad people.</p>
              <p>Magda pats her little dog PUFFY on the head.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy 
                tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing--he was<br>
                a fucking asswipe--but you had to find out for yourself, didn't 
                you?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Okay, you win. Now try to get some sleep,huh.</p>
              <p>Mary gives Magda a kiss and heads to her bedroom.</p>
              <p> CUT TO:</p>
              <p>MUSIC MONTAGE - as Healy follows Mary around town.</p>
              <p>EXT. EUCLID AVENUE - MORNING</p>
              <p>Mary exits her apartment and bounces out into the world. There 
                is a HOMELESS MAN sitting on the sidewalk. Mary flips him an apple,then 
                jumps in her Honda Civic and drives off.</p>
              <p>EXT. DRIVING RANGE - MORNING</p>
              <p>Mary is at the range HITTING a couple buckets of balls.</p>
              <p>ON HEALY - watching from the parking lot.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                (into mic)<br>
                Looks like we got an athlete on our hands.</p>
              <p>EXT. MACDONALD'S DRIVE-THRU WINDOW - MORNING</p>
              <p>Mary waits in the drive-thru lane reading the SPORTS PAGE. Finally 
                the window opens and she is handed a HUGE BAG OF FOOD.</p>
              <p>PAN TO Healy watching from his car.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                (into mic)<br>
                Well, from her figure and her appetite, I'm guessing she's either 
                got a bowel disorder or we've got a hurler on our hands.</p>
              <p>EXT. SPECIAL ED. CENTER - MORNING</p>
              <p>Mary's brother Warren is wearing a walkman as he plays catch 
                out front with a SPECIAL ED TEACHER while several other<br>
                MENTALLY-DISABLED PATIENTS entertain themselves.</p>
              <p>Mary pulls up, gets out, and starts handing out Egg McMuffins.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Get in line. One at a time.</p>
              <p>A fat patient, GARY, approaches.</p>
              <p> GARY<br>
                Can I have two, Mary?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Yeah, you can have two halves, just like everyone else.</p>
              <p> GARY<br>
                Thanks.</p>
              <p>Gary takes his and walks off. A couple more patients and then<br>
                bucktoothed FREDDIE steps up to her.</p>
              <p> FREDDIE<br>
                Will you marry me, Mary?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Oh yeah, pretty boy? And what about Dolores?</p>
              <p>Mary points to another PATIENT staring bashfully at Freddie.</p>
              <p> FREDDIE<br>
                Would you marry us both, Mary?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Yeah, that'd be a good deal for you, wouldn't it?</p>
              <p>Freddie moves off and fat Gary is back, trying to be inconspicuous.</p>
              <p> MARY (cont'd)<br>
                Wow, this is weird. There was somebody wholooked just like you 
                here a minute ago.</p>
              <p>Mary smiles and hands Gary another McMuffin.</p>
              <p>CLOSE ON Healy.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                (into mic)<br>
                Ixnay on the big appetite.<br>
                (beat)<br>
                She's just got a big heart.</p>
              <p>EXT. BEACH BAR - DAY</p>
              <p>Neighborhood restaurant and bar. After-work crowd. Mary and her 
                friends, BRENDA, LISA, and JOANIE are sitting at a table under 
                an umbrella. Lisa reads from the PERSONALS COLUMN in South Beach 
                Magazine.</p>
              <p> LISA<br>
                Listen to this one--'Seeking sensitive Wasp doctor to share candlelit 
                dinners, long walks in Coconut Grove, marriage.'</p>
              <p> BRENDA<br>
                What does this girl want, a corpse? You gotta be more specific: 
                'Seeking deaf mute with three pound cock and trust fund.'</p>
              <p> JOANIE<br>
                No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt 
                and a banana hammock.</p>
              <p>PAN TO the bar where we see Healy eavesdropping on their<br>
                conversation.</p>
              <p> BRENDA (O.S.)<br>
                (to Mary)<br>
                I suppose you wouldn't like someone with a washboard stomach like 
                Brad Pitt?</p>
              <p>BACK ON Mary and friends.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly. 
                It means he's a guy.<br>
                You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring 
                at their reflections.</p>
              <p>ON HEALY</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                (quietly into mic)<br>
                A girl after your own heart, Ted.</p>
              <p>BACK ON Mary and friends.</p>
              <p> JOANIE<br>
                I can live with those reflections.</p>
              <p> MARY <br>
                I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies.<br>
                Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty-six 
                holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to<br>
                a ballgame.</p>
              <p> JOANIE<br>
                (sarcastic)<br>
                Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like 
                that.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self-employed.</p>
              <p> LISA<br>
                You mean, like an architect or something?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Architect, yeah.</p>
              <p>BRENDA You mean creative, but not poor.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                No, it's not the money. Creative, yeah, that's good, but it's 
                the freedom I'm talking about. See, this guy has to have a job 
                he could do anywhere. That way we could just up and leave at the 
                drop of a hat.</p>
              <p> LISA<br>
                And where would you and your beer-bellied architect be leaving 
                to?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                I don't know. The Super Bowl, New Orleans Jazz Festival...maybe 
                a couple months in Nepal.</p>
              <p> JOANIE<br>
                Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                What's that supposed to mean?</p>
              <p> JOANIE<br>
                It means you're too hard on guys.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                No I'm not.</p>
              <p> JOANIE<br>
                Oh come off it, Mare. What about what's-his-name...Steverino? 
                You could've at least passed the baton on that one.</p>
              <p>The girls LAUGH.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.</p>
              <p> JOANIE<br>
                All right for awhile? The guy's good-looking, rich, witty. He 
                was a god.</p>
              <p> LISA<br>
                At one point you were talking about marrying him. Come on, why'd 
                you dump him?</p>
              <p>Mary thinks about this.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                I don't know, it was complicated. He's in San Francisco, I'm in 
                Miami.<br>
                (dodging question)<br>
                Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.</p>
              <p> JOANIE<br>
                Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting 
                her up for a month--it's been a year and a half.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Ah, she's okay.</p>
              <p> LISA<br>
                Mary, cut the crap, what really happened with Steve?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Nothing. I mean, you know my brother.<br>
                (sighs)<br>
                Warren.</p>
              <p> JOANIE<br>
                What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who 
                will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my<br>
                friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier 
                if Warren wasn't in my life.<br>
                (beat)<br>
                Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell 
                with Steve.</p>
              <p>Everyone is touched by this. Then:</p>
              <p> BRENDA<br>
                Well, that's the last time I blow him behind your back.</p>
              <p>As the girls LAUGH, we</p>
              <p> CUT TO:</p>

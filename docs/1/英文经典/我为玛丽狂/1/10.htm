              <p>A profusely sweating Ted has a DRESSER ON HIS BACK and EEKS his 
                way toward the front door as his BOSS'S DISABLED BROTHER catches 
                up to him IN A WHEELCHAIR. (The man is a quadriplegic who needs 
                to use a MOUTHPIECE to operate his chair.)</p>
              <p> BOSS'S DISABLED BROTHER<br>
                Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (straining)<br>
                What?</p>
              <p> BOSS'S DISABLED BROTHER<br>
                You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (biting tongue)<br>
                I'll try to be more careful.</p>
              <p> BOSS'S DISABLED BROTHER<br>
                S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                The thing's kind of heavy.</p>
              <p> BOSS'S DISABLED BROTHER<br>
                Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, 
                you insensitive prick.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                No, I just meant...</p>
              <p> BOSS'S DISABLED BROTHER<br>
                Yeah yeah. I'm going to the corner to get a cup of coffee.</p>
              <p>The Boss's Disabled Brother bites into the mouthpiece and ZIPS<br>
                AWAY up the sidewalk. Ted takes a step. Rests. A step. Rests.</p>
              <p> ASSERTIVE WOMAN'S VOICE<br>
                Hey you!</p>
              <p>Ted glances back toward the street to see a T.V. NEWS REPORTER 
                from the CHANNEL 7 I-TEAM rushing toward him with a NEWS CREW 
                on her heels.</p>
              <p> T.V. NEWS REPORTER (cont'd)<br>

              <p> CUT TO:</p>
              <p>INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY</p>
              <p>Ted is splayed out on a table in obvious pain while DR. LALONDE, 
                an old high school pal, palpates his spine.</p>
              <p> DR. LALONDE<br>
                (smirking)<br>
                So...I see you made the news.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (angry and embarrassed)<br>
                It wasn't my truck--I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.</p>
              <p> DR. LALONDE<br>
                (dubious)<br>
                Uh-huh. Where was he?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Out getting coffee.</p>
              <p> DR. LALONDE<br>
                Yeah, that's more or less what the others said, too. Out getting 
                coffee...supposed to meet him here...picking up my grandma...</p>
              <p>Ted turns and GLARES at him.</p>
              <p> DR. LALONDE (cont'd)<br>
                I'm just saying...They sure made you look dumb.</p>
              <p>Ted SIGHS. A couple big CRACKS of the neck.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Bob, do you remember Mary?</p>
              <p> DR. LALONDE<br>
                Who?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Mary.</p>
              <p> DR. LALONDE<br>
                From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at 
                a convention in Las Vegas.</p>
              <p>Ted sits up.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?</p>
              <p> DR. LALONDE<br>
                I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.</p>
              <p>The Doc SIGHS, still able to recall the feeling.</p>
              <p> DR. LALONDE (cont'd)<br>
                What a babe...</p>
              <p>Ted sits up on his elbows.</p>

                Babe?</p>

              <p>A buckled-over Ted limps into Dom's office with a crazed look 
                on his face.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Mary's a babe!</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                What?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                My Mary--she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. 
                She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the<br>
                football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Huh? But why did Healy?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Well think about it.</p>
              <p>Ted folds his arms.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                No You mean...?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Uh-huh.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look<br>
                her up.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (nodding)<br>
                That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.</p>
              <p>Dom shakes his head. Then:</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Well then you've got to call her, man.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.</p>
              <p>INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
              <p>While Mary gets ready for her date, Magda sits in front of the<br>
                radio scanner in her bathrobe with her little dog Puffy on her<br>
                lap.</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                So who's the lucky guy?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                Good lookin'?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                He's no Steve Young.</p>
              <p>INT. HEALY'S CAR - NIGHT 69</p>
              <p>Healy, listening through his headphones, reacts to this.</p>
              <p> MAGDA (V.O.)<br>
                What's he like?</p>
              <p> MARY (V.O.)<br>
                I don't know. He's kind of a mook.</p>
              <p> MAGDA (V.O.)<br>
                What's a mook?</p>
              <p> MARY (V.O.)<br>
                You know, a mookalone, a schlep.</p>
              <p>INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Come on, Magda<br>
                (SIGHS)<br>
                It's like that movie Harold and Maude.</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                I don't watch the new ones.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and 
                an old lady who fall in love.</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                That's exactly why I don't watch 'em anymore--it's bullshit! Why 
                the hell would an old lady go for a young kid?</p>
              <p>Mary smiles at this.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, 
                it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred 
                spirits.</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy here's gonna tell you all 
                you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat.<br>
                If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if Puffy's relaxed...well, 
                you got yourself akeeper.</p>
              <p>INT. HEALY'S CAR - NIGHT</p>
              <p>As Healy thinks about this, we</p>
              <p> CUT TO:</p>
              <p>EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Healy enters the building.</p>
              <p>INT. MARY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Healy tiptoes up to Mary's apartment door. He peeks through the<br>
                mail slot.</p>
              <p>HEALY'S POV - Puffy is staring at him and GROWLING.</p>
              <p>Healy reaches in his pocket, pulls out a VALIUM and a DOGGY TREAT.<br>
                Healy shoves the pill into the treat's soft center, examines it,<br>
                then thinks what the hell and SHOVES IN ANOTHER ONE.</p>
              <p>Puffy GROWLS LOUDER. Healy pops the treat through the mail slot 
                and listens as the dog DEVOURS IT. Healy looks at his watch, then 
                sneaks back outside to wait a few minutes for the drugs to kick 
                in.</p>
              <p> CUT TO:</p>
              <p>INT. MARY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Healy is sitting on Mary's couch with Puffy spread-eagled<br>
                upside-down on his lap, KNOCKED OUT COLD. Mary and Magda look 
                on in amazement.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                (baby talk)<br>
                Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum-tum rubbed, doesn't he now?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                You mean he doesn't like bad guys.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                'That right?</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. 
                In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan-tee', whichmeans 'man 
                who is loved by many animals...<br>
                (babbling)<br>
                ...who love him a lot, too...and so on.'</p>
              <p>Magda stares dreamily at Healy, smitten.</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                Would you like a glass of tea or something?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                You got a brew?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Sure.<br>
                (noticing Magda's trance)<br>
                Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                Oh, yeah, of course, dear.</p>
              <p>The two women go into the kitchen and Healy is left to pet the<br>
                MOTIONLESS DOG. Suddenly Healy notices that the dog is A LITTLE 
                TOO MOTIONLESS. Healy checks Puffy's pulse. He looks at his watch 
                to time the rate.</p>
              <p> MARY (O.S.)<br>
                (CALLING out)<br>
                Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                (CALLING out)<br>
                Great.</p>
              <p>He starts SHAKING THE DOG, but Puffy doesn't move. Healy goes 
                into action. He starts pressing on his heart, PERFORMING DOGGIE 
                CPR.<br>
                One-and-two-and-three, he continues trying to revive him.</p>

                Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                (CALLING out)<br>
                No, thanks.<br>
                (panicking)<br>
                Love a little bundt cake if you have some!</p>
              <p>INT. MARY'S KITCHEN - SAME</p>
              <p>Magda and Mary are on their way out the door when they stop.</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                Bundt cake?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                (shrugs)<br>
                Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.</p>
              <p>As Magda starts to go through the cupboards...</p>
              <p>INT. MARY'S FAMILY ROOM - SAME</p>
              <p>A panicked Healy is giving the little mutt MOUTH-TO-MOUTH now.<br>
                Then back to the heart, the mouth, the heart, the mouth....</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                (quietly, desperately, to Puffy)<br>
                Come on, man, stay away from the light!</p>
              <p>Healy resumes blowing into the dog's snout, pumping his chest,<br>
                with no results. Desperate, he picks up the cheese knife and<br>
                quickly SLICES THE WIRES ON TWO TABLE LAMPS.</p>
              <p>Healy grabs the two wires and TOUCHES THEM TOGETHER LIKE A DEFIBRILLATOR 
                on the little pooch's chest.</p>
              <p>ZZZZZTTTTTT - the dog BOUNCES a couple feet off the couch as<br>
                SPARKS FLY.</p>
              <p>Healy takes his pulse again. Nothing. He ZAPS him once more with 
                the LIVE WIRES.</p>
              <p>ZZZZZTTTTT - Still nothing. Healy gets to his feet and peeks<br>
                into the kitchen. When he turns his back, we see PUFFY IGNITE 
                IN FLAMES.</p>
              <p>When Healy turns back, he's horrified at what he sees. He grabs 
                a<br>
                vase of flowers and POURS THE WATER ON THE BURNING DOG.</p>
              <p>With this, Puffy flinches and comes to, GASPING FOR AIR!</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                All I had was some Funny Bones--how does<br>
                that sound, honey?</p>
              <p>Healy picks up the stunned pooch and swaddles it in a blanket 
                as<br>
                Magda ENTERS the room followed by Mary.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                (petting dog)<br>
                Fine. Fine.</p>

                EXT. BATHROOM DOOR - NIGHT</p>
              <p>A concerned Mary, her Mom, Dad, and Warren are huddled outside 
                the bathroom.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                (knocking gently)<br>
                Ted, are you okay?</p>
              <p> TED (O.S.)<br>
                (pained)<br>
                Just a minute.</p>
              <p> MARY'S MOM<br>
                He's been in there over half an hour.<br>
                (whispering)<br>
                Charlie, I think he's masturbating.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Mom!</p>
              <p> MARY'S MOM<br>
                Well he was watching you undress with a silly grin on his face.</p>
              <p> TED (O.S.)<br>
                (pained)<br>
                I was watching the birds!</p>
              <p>They all look at one another.</p>
              <p> MARY'S MOM<br>
                Charlie, do something.</p>
              <p> MARY'S DAD<br>
                All right, kid, that's it, I'm coming in.</p>
              <p>INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>A whimpering Ted huddles in the corner as Mary's Dad enters.</p>
              <p> MARY'S DAD (cont'd)<br>
                What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                I wish.</p>
              <p>Ted motions for him to close the door and Mary's Dad obliges.</p>
              <p> TED (cont'd)<br>
                I, uh...I got it stuck.</p>
              <p> MARY'S DAD<br>
                You got what stuck?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                It.</p>
              <p> MARY'S DAD<br>
                It?<br>
                (beat)<br>
                Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's 
                not the end of the world.</p>
              <p>Mary's Dad moves closer and puts his reading glasses on.</p>
              <p>EXT. BATHROOM DOOR - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>As Mary, her Mom, and Warren listen in...</p>
              <p> MARY'S DAD (O.S.)<br>
                OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!</p>
              <p> TED (O.S.)<br>
                Shhhhhh!</p>
              <p>INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p> MARY'S DAD<br>
                (CALLS OUT)<br>
                Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                What?! No please, sir--</p>
              <p> MARY'S DAD<br>
                She's a dental hygienist. She'll know what to do.</p>
              <p>Mary's Mom comes in and closes the door behind her.</p>
              <p> MARY'S MOM<br>
                Teddy, hon, are you okay?<br>
                (moving closer, seeing the situation)<br>
                OH HEAVENS TO PETE!</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.</p>
              <p> MARY'S MOM<br>
                Just relax, dear. Now, um...what exactly are we looking at here?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (dizzy)<br>
                What do you mean?</p>
              <p> MARY'S MOM<br>
                (delicate)<br>
                I mean is it...is it...?</p>
              <p> MARY'S DAD<br>
                (gruff)<br>
                Is it the frank or the beans?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                I think a little of both.</p>
              <p>Suddenly we hear Warren from outside the door:</p>
              <p> WARREN (O.S.)<br>
                Franks and beans!</p>
              <p>Ted hangs his head.</p>
              <p>EXT. BATHROOM DOOR - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>Mary and Warren are huddled outside the door.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                (to Warren)<br>
                Shhhh.</p>
              <p> MARY'S DAD (O.S.)<br>
                What the hell's that bubble?</p>
              <p>Mary REACTS to this.</p>
              <p>INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                One guess.</p>
              <p> MARY'S DAD<br>
                How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                I don't know. It's not like it was a well thought-out plan.</p>
              <p> MARY'S MOM<br>
                Oh my, there sure is a lot of skin coming through there.</p>
              <p> MARY'S DAD<br>
                I'm guessing that's what the soprano shriek was about, pumpkin.</p>
              <p> MARY'S MOM<br>
                I'm going to get some Bactine.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                No, please!</p>
              <p>Suddenly a POLICE OFFICER sticks his head in the bathroom window.</p>
              <p> POLICE OFFICER<br>
                Ho there.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (humiliated)<br>
                Oh God.</p>
              <p> POLICE OFFICER<br>
                Everything okay here? Neighbors said they heard a lady scream.</p>
              <p> MARY'S DAD<br>
                You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                No, that's really unneces--</p>
              <p>But the Officer's already climbing in the window. Once inside, 
                he<br>
                turns his flashlight on Ted and WHISTLES.</p>
              <p> POLICE OFFICER<br>
                Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (frustrated)<br>
                I wasn't trying--</p>
              <p> POLICE OFFICER<br>
                Is that bubble what I think it is? </p>
              <p>Mary's parents nod.</p>
              <p> POLICE OFFICER (cont'd)<br>
                But...how...how'd you get the zipper all the way to the top?</p>
              <p> MARY'S DAD<br>
                Let's just say the kid's limber.</p>
              <p>The Officer makes a face, then rolls up his sleeves.</p>
              <p> POLICE OFFICER<br>
                Well, there's only one thing to do.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and 
                work on it in the morning.</p>
              <p> POLICE OFFICER<br>
                Look, son, this'll only hurt for a second.</p>
              <p>The Officer reaches down and takes hold of the zipper.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                No, no, please!</p>
              <p> MARY'S MOM<br>
                Teddy, be brave.</p>
              <p> WARREN (O.S.)<br>
                Beans and franks!</p>
              <p> MARY (O.S.)<br>
                Warren, shhh.</p>
              <p>Defeated, Ted holds his breath and braces for the worst.</p>
              <p> POLICE OFFICER<br>
                It's just like pulling off a Band-aid.<br>
                A-one and a-two and...</p>

                EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT</p>
              <p>A two-door Toyota Tercel flies by the camera.</p>
              <p>INT. TOYOTA TERCEL</p>
              <p>A determined Ted is cruising along the highway in his rent-a-car.<br>
                He has a cup of coffee in his hand and a HITCHHIKER in the seat 
                beside him. The Hitchhiker sits with a LARGE RED DUFFEL BAG between 
                his legs.</p>
              <p> HITCHHIKER<br>
                Thanks for picking me up. </p>
              <p> TED<br>
                No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going 
                on fifteen hours straight.</p>
              <p> HITCHHIKER<br>
                I know how you feel--I been standing in the same spot for the 
                last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker 
                in this state.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                That must make it tough.</p>
              <p> HITCHHIKER<br>
                Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Nah. I'm...I'm nothing.</p>
              <p> HITCHHIKER<br>
                Oh. Well I am.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Hm?</p>
              <p> HITCHHIKER<br>
                A salesman--that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm 
                starting my own company--video sales--just as soon as I get<br>
                enough seed money.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                'That right? Good for you.</p>
              <p> HITCHHIKER<br>
                Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea--it's a home run. You ever 
                hear of Eight-Minute Abs?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on<br>
                T.V.</p>
              <p> HITCHHIKER<br>
                Two million copies it sold last year. Two million, man. But not 
                next year--my idea's gonna blow them outta the water. Get this:<br>
                (dramatic pause) Seven-Minute Abs.</p>
              <p>BEAT.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                I see where you're going.</p>
              <p> HITCHHIKER<br>
                (big smile)<br>
                Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute 
                Abs and right next to it you see Seven-Minute Abs--which one you 
                gonna spring for?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                I'd go with the seven.</p>
              <p> HITCHHIKER<br>
                Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good 
                a work-out.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                How do you guarantee that?</p>
              <p> HITCHHIKER<br>
                Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you 
                the extra minute.'</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Huh. That sounds great.<br>
                (beat)<br>
                Unless someone else comes out with Six-Minute Abs.</p>
              <p>Ted CHUCKLES, but the Hitchhiker just GLARES at him, unamused.</p>
              <p> TED (cont'd)<br>
                (unaware)<br>
                I'm gonna pull over. I gotta take a leak.</p>
              <p>EXT. REST AREA - NIGHT</p>
              <p>The Toyota Tercel pulls in and parks. Ted gets out and walks 
                into the bushes to whiz.</p>
              <p>ON TED - as he steps into the dark brush UNZIPPING his fly he<br>
                TRIPS over something and FALLS TO THE GROUND.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                What the--?</p>
              <p>Suddenly WHOOSH, WHOOSH, WHOOSH--several huge SPOTLIGHTS illuminate 
                the area revealing</p>
              <p>TWO DOZEN FRIGHTENED MEN scurrying to pull their pants up all 
                around him.</p>
              <p> POLICE OFFICER (O.S.)<br>
                THIS IS A RAID!</p>
              <p>ANGLE ON a startled Ted ON HIS KNEES directly in front of<br>
                ANOTHER MAN, making it appear that he's been BLOWING THE GUY.</p>
              <p>REVERSE ANGLE reveals a DOZEN POLICE OFFICERS holding the spotlights 
                and moving in for the arrests followed by a CAMERA CREW.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (deer caught in headlights)<br>
                Wait a second, it's not what you think.</p>
              <p>A GUY with his pants at his ankles jumps on the bandwagon.</p>
              <p> PANTS AT ANKLES GUY<br>
                That's right! I-I-I was just pissing!</p>
              <p>Ted glares at him.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                No! I was pissing!</p>
              <p> POLICE OFFICER<br>
                Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.</p>
              <p>As they grab Ted and the others and hustle them away, we</p>
              <p>PAN TO the Hitchhiker sitting in the Toyota watching the raid<br>
                unfold.</p>
              <p>The Hitchhiker is clearly PANICKY at the sight of all the cops.</p>
              <p>Quietly he OPENS THE CAR DOOR, ducks down, and then SPRINTS AWAY 
                INTO THE WOODS UNSEEN, LEAVING HIS BIG RED BAG BEHIND.</p>
              <p> CUT TO:</p>
              <p>CLOSE UP OF TELEVISION SCREEN as the bust continues. Each of 
                the men COVER THEIR FACES as they pass by the camera, EXCEPT FOR 
                TED who is extremely visible. </p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (to Cop)<br>
                Okay, take it easy, you don't have to push.</p>
              <p>REVERSE ANGLE REVEALS a shocked Dom and his wife watching this 
                on their television.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Oh my God. Is that...?</p>
              <p> DOM'S WIFE<br>
                (matter-of-fact)<br>
                Told you he was gay.</p>
              <p>BACK ON THE TELEVISION - The COPS struggle to get the feisty 
                Ted into a police van.</p>

                I was taking a leak!</p>

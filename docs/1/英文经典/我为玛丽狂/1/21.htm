                INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY</p>
              <p>CLOSE ON an alarmed Mary.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Woogie? What are what are you doing here?</p>
              <p>REVERSE ANGLE reveals Dom sitting on her bed.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                You sent that?</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Uh-huh. I was worried about you.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Well...thank you. But...you know you're not supposed to be within 
                four hundred yards of me.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                (excited)<br>
                That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of 
                extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right--I needed 
                help.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                (cautious)<br>
                That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better--you seem...good--but...you 
                put me through quite an ordeal, you know.</p>
              <p>Dom nods aggressively.</p>
              <p> MARY (cont'd)<br>
                I had to move, go to court, change my last name--you stole all 
                my shoes!</p>
              <p>Dom stands up.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Look at me.</p>
              <p>Mary turns her head.</p>
              <p> DOM (cont'd)<br>
                Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything 
                that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Woogie, I caught you red-handed.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                All right, I did, but I was in a weird place then.</p>
              <p>He approaches her.</p>
              <p> DOM (cont'd)<br>
                Give me a break, Mare, I was nuts!</p>
              <p>Mary backs into the living room.</p>
              <p> CUT TO:</p>
              <p>INT. HEALY'S CAR - DAY</p>
              <p>Healy and Tucker are parked right out front LISTENING TO THIS 
                CONVERSATION. They seem concerned.</p>
              <p> MARY (V.O.)<br>
                Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Who the hell's Woogie?</p>
              <p>Tucker just shrugs.</p>
              <p>BACK ON Mary and Dom. =~</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                I'm asking you to leave.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                (gentle)<br>
                Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.<br>
                (beat)<br>
                I'm not leaving...</p>
              <p>BACK IN HEALY'S CAR</p>
              <p> DOM (cont'd) (V.O.)<br>
                ...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.</p>
              <p> MARY (V. O . )<br>
                (clearly struggling)<br>
                Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!</p>
              <p>Healy and Tucker jump out of the car and RUN INTO THE BUILDING.</p>
              <p> CUT TO:</p>
              <p>INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY</p>
              <p>Healy and Tucker STORM INTO THE ROOM and freeze at what they 
                see.</p>
              <p>THEIR POV - Dom is cradling SEVERAL PAIRS OF SHOES in his arms 
                and trying to crawl to the door while Mary holds him back.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Stop it!</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch!</p>
              <p>Healy and Tucker grab Dom and throw him down on the couch.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Dom, you're pathetic, fucking over your friend Ted like that.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                What? You fucked him over, too.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                He's no friend of mine.</p>
              <p>Suddenly Magda ENTERS from her bedroom. She's holding a half-eaten 
                BANANA SPLIT. Herb, the Homeless Man, follows after her, sporting 
                a Tom Jones and buttoning up his shirt.</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                What the hell's going on here?</p>
              <p>At first no one knows what to say. Then:</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                We're in love with your roommate.</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and 
                go back to my own place.</p>
              <p>Magda heads back into her bedroom and Herb follows.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Tucker, where are your crutches?</p>
              <p>Tucker is stumped for a second, then:</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                (British accent)<br>
                Interesting query, Mary...</p>
              <p>Healy slaps Tucker in the back of the head.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Shut the fuck up and tell her the truth.</p>
              <p>Before he can respond, Ted ENTERS.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Well isn't this nice--now we've got the whole gang together.</p>
              <p>Ted can hardly believe Dom is there.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Dom? What are you?</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                You stole her from me. Now I want her back.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                (rolling eyes)<br>
                Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (stunned)<br>
                You're Woogie?</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Dom Wooganowski. Duh.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                If I may I have a proposal.</p>
              <p>Everyone turns to Healy.</p>
              <p> HEALY (cont'd)<br>
                I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops 
                jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. 
                Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing 
                them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.</p>
              <p>Healy glares at Tucker.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Uh, well...not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                You mean he's not a criminal?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                God no!<br>
                (pleased)<br>
                I'm just a pathological liar!</p>
              <p>Mary looks at Tucker, confused.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Tucker...not you, too?</p>
              <p>Tucker lowers his head and reluctantly nods.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Oh Jesus...</p>
              <p>Just then the door opens and BRETT FAVRE, the Packers quarterback 
                ENTERS, with Warren (wearing a walkman) beside him. Everyone is 
                stunned.</p>
              <p> MARY (cont'd)<br>
                Brett...?</p>
              <p> BRETT FAVRE<br>
                Hi, Mary.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                What the hell is Brett Favre doing here?</p>
              <p> BRETT FAVRE<br>
                We're in town to play the Dolphins.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                I called him. I told him to pick up Warren and get over here.</p>
              <p>everyone turns their attention to Ted.</p>
              <p> TED (cont'd)<br>
                Mary, I found out that your buddy Tucker there lied to you about 
                Brett.</p>
              <p>Tucker lowers his head.</p>
              <p> TED (cont'd)<br>
                Brett never said anything bad about Warren.<br>
                He loves Warren...and from what he just told me on the phone, 
                he loves you, too.<br>
                (beat)<br>
                He's the guy you should be with.</p>
              <p> BRETT FAVRE<br>
                That's right, Mare. And you know I'll always be true to you.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Aw shit, this isn't fair.</p>
              <p>Mary manages a smile.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (to Mary)<br>
                I realized something tonight. I'm no better than any of these 
                guys. None of them really love you...they just fixated on you 
                because<br>
                of how you made them feel. But that's not real love...Thank you 
                for letting me see that. Now I can get on with the rest of my<br>
                life.</p>
              <p>Tucker, Healy, and Dom scoff.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Oh please...</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Don't listen to him, Mary. It's a ploy.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                You are so full of shit, Strohman. Are you going to stand here 
                and tell us that you aren't in love with this girl?</p>
              <p>Ted looks into Mary's eyes. She looks vulnerable.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Yeah...that's what I'm telling you.<br>
                (winks)<br>
                See you, Mare.</p>
              <p>Ted looks Mary in the eye, then starts for the door.</p>
              <p> TED (cont'd)<br>
                (as he passes Warren)<br>
                See you, Warren.</p>
              <p> WARREN<br>
                Huh...?</p>
              <p>Ted lifts the earphones off Warren's ear.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                See you, Warren.</p>
              <p> WARREN<br>
                Bye, Ted.</p>
              <p>Ted then WALKS OUT OF THE ROOM. They all stand there in silence 
                for a moment, then Dom turns to Brett Favre.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Hey, Brett, any chance I can get you to autograph one of these 
                pumps for me?</p>
              <p> CUT TO:</p>
              <p>EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY</p>
              <p>Ted is walking down the street BLUBBERING LIKE A SCHOOLGIRL.<br>
                Everyone he passes stares at him. Suddenly Mary comes running 
                down the OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Ted!</p>
              <p>Ted stops and looks across the street at her. He wipes his eyes,<br>
                hopeful.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                What what are you doing here?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                You forgot your keys!</p>
              <p>She holds up a RABBIT FOOT KEY-CHAIN.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (deflated)<br>
                Oh. Thanks.</p>
              <p>They remain across the street from one another.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Did you mean what you said back there, Ted?</p>
              <p>Ted starts to well up again.</p>
              <p> MARY (cont'd)<br>
                Ted...?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (looking down)<br>
                I...I just want you to be happy, Mary.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                But I think I'd be happiest...with you.</p>
              <p>Ted just stares at her.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                You're fucking with me, right?</p>
              <p>Mary smiles.</p>
              <p> TED (cont'd)<br>
                (wiping eyes)<br>
                But but what about Steve?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun--the guy doesn't even drink 
                beer or gamble.</p>
              <p>Now Ted smiles.</p>
              <p> MARY (cont'd)<br>
                Get over here.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Really?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Really.</p>
              <p>The BEAMING Ted starts walking across the street. Suddenly a 
                BUS WHIZZES BY AND SMACKS TED BROADSIDE. He bounces around under 
                the bus like a rag doll, then finally squirts out the back end 
                and TUMBLES TO A LIMP STOP.</p>
              <p>Mary SCREAMS and runs toward the body as a CROWD begins to gather.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Ted, no, no....!</p>
              <p>She starts giving him CPR. Somebody covers him with a blanket.</p>
              <p>Just then, another CAR WHIZZES OVER HIS FEET like speedbumps. 
                The crowd winces.</p>
              <p> MARY (cont'd)<br>
                Somebody hold up traffic!<br>
                (beat)<br>
                Come on, Ted. Come on. Tell me you're going to be okay.</p>
              <p>Then Ted takes a deep breath and his eyes flutter open.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Mary....Oh Mary, I love you.</p>
              <p>Mary's smile is as bright as the light from heaven.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                I love you too, Ted.<br>
                (beat)<br>
                I think I always have.</p>
              <p>As the two lovebirds kiss, a LADY CALLS OUT:</p>

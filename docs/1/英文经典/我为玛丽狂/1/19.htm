                EXT. MARY'S ALLEY - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Healy is throwing DOGGIE TREATS through an open THIRD-FLOOR WINDOW.</p>
              <p>INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - SAME</p>
              <p>We hear the TELEVISION and see Magda DOZING on the couch with 
                a watery COCKTAIL IN HER HAND and the dog Puffy at her feet.</p>
              <p>Suddenly a DOGGIE TREAT flies through the window, landing on 
                the rug. Puffy SNAPS TO ATTENTION and approaches the treat. He 
                sniffs it, then GOBBLES IT UP. ANOTHER doggie treat lands beside 
                him and he eats that, too. Then ANOTHER.</p>
              <p>EXT. MARY'S ALLEY - SAME</p>
              <p>Tucker keeps throwing the treats up and Healy looks concerned.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                How many is that?</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Four.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch--you sure it 
                won't kill him?</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                I never said that.</p>
              <p>As Tucker throws another...</p>
              <p>INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - SAME</p>
              <p>The doggie treat LANDS IN MAGDA'S COCKTAIL, waking her up. Magda 
                looks around, gets her bearings, and then DOWNS THE DRINK!</p>
              <p> CUT TO:</p>
              <p>EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME</p>
              <p>Mary and Ted, still sitting on the stoop. Mary seems a little<br>
                reflective.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                ... and then it was all over.<br>
                (SIGHS)<br>
                We haven't spoken since.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (sincere)<br>
                Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Yeah...almost.<br>
                (beat)<br>
                You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.</p>
              <p>Mary looks a little disappointed.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Ted...you're not that far ahead.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Look, Mary, the truth is...I'll be in town for a while now but 
                I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                (alarmed)<br>
                Why not?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Well...to be honest....I'm really crazy about you and it's making 
                me nervous and when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm<br>
                afraid I'm going to doing something really dumb before we get 
                started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure.</p>
              <p>Mary sort of smiles.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your 
                books.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                All right, let's go.</p>
              <p>Ted jumps up and starts up the stairs two at a time.</p>
              <p>INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
              <p>As Ted and Mary ENTER, we see Magda HOLDING UP THE COUCH with 
                one hand and VACUUMING WITH THE OTHER.</p>
              <p>Mary doesn't know what to make of it.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Magda, what are you doing?</p>
              <p>Magda turns off the vacuum and we hear a BANGING SOUND coupled 
                with the O.S. MUFFLED YAPPING of Puffy.</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Where's Puffy?</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                Ah, he was being a pest so I put him in the bathroom.</p>
              <p>As the O.S. YAPPING AND BANGING continues, Magda PICKS UP THE 
                TELEVISION and starts DUSTING the TV stand.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                (to Ted, concerned)<br>
                Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda--would you let the dog out 
                of the bathroom.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Yeah, sure.</p>
              <p>Ted walks down the hall, following the YAPPING AND BANGING SOUND 
                until he comes to the bathroom door. The YAPPING is MUCH LOUDER 
                now and he NOTICES SOMETHING THAT MAKES HIM HESITATE.</p>
              <p>TED'S POV - the bottom part of the door is being DENTED OUTWARD 
                from the force of something BATTERING IT FROM WITHIN.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (CALLING out)<br>
                Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?</p>
              <p> MARY (O.S.)<br>
                (CALLING out)<br>
                Toy poodle!</p>
              <p>Ted thinks about this, shrugs, and opens the door.</p>
              <p>BARING HIS TEETH like a Rottweiler, Puffy SPRINGS at Ted's jugular!</p>
              <p>INT. MARY'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>Ted stumbles back into the living room with the hopped-up dog 
                ON HIS FACE. He KNOCKS OVER A LAMP, tumbles onto the floor, and 
                fights for his life.</p>
              <p>Mary and Magda SCREAM as Ted and Puffy mix it up on the floor. 
                Ted tries to CRAWL TOWARD THE DOOR but Puffy GRABS THE CUFF OF 
                HIS PANTS.</p>
              <p>DOOR POV of Ted's anguished face as he gets pulled back into 
                the room.</p>
              <p>Ted manages to GET THE DOG IN A HEADLOCK.</p>
              <p> MAGDA<br>
                Stop it, you're hurting him!</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (out of breath)<br>
                Tell him...to calm down.</p>
              <p>Puffy gets a piece of Ted's wrist and Ted SCREAMS and drops him.<br>
                Both man and toy poodle SPRING TO THEIR FEET.</p>
              <p>They start CIRCLING ONE ANOTHER. Puffy leaps at Ted and Ted SMACKS<br>
                HIM into a wall. Unfazed, the dog gets a running start and LEAPS 
                AT TED'S NECK.</p>
              <p>Ted manages to duck and PUFFY FLIES OUT THE OPEN WINDOW!</p>
              <p> DISSOLVE TO:</p>
              <p>EXT MIAMI STREET - DAY</p>
              <p>MONTAGE OF TED AND MARY FALLING IN LOVE</p>
              <p>--Ted and Warren are at the top of a giant WATER SLIDE<br>
                Warren motions that he has decided this is not for him.<br>
                Ted shoots him a look that makes Warren feel like a sissy. Convinced 
                it's not too dangerous, Warren decides to go for it and Ted follows.</p>
              <p>--At the bottom of the slide Ted splashes into the huge pool 
                of water, laughing, having a blast. Then he looks</p>
              <p>around...no sign of Warren. Concerned, Ted dives underwater and 
                a moment later Resurfaces clutching a GASPING Warren.</p>
              <p>EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY</p>
              <p>--Mary pumps Warren's stomach as he coughs water out of<br>
                his mouth. Ted looks on sheepishly.</p>
              <p>EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY</p>
              <p>Ted and Warren walk down a city sidewalk. As they pass<br>
                a shop Warren points to the window excitedly.</p>
              <p>THEIR POV</p>
              <p>In the window there is a mannequin dressed in a Super- hero outfit, 
                i.e. a generic superman.</p>
              <p>Warren then pulls Ted into the store.</p>

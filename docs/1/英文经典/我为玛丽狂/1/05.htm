                EXT. MARY'S HOUSE - NIGHT</p>
              <p>TWO PARAMEDICS rush Ted out the front door on a stretcher. Mary 
                runs alongside him holding a towel on his crotch. while a THIRD 
                PARAMEDIC dabs at his crotch with a towel. Mary's Mom and Dad 
                are out front along with two FIRETRUCKS, four POLICE CARS, and 
                a crowdof about thirty NEIGHBORS.</p>
              <p> PARAMEDIC<br>
                (to Mary)<br>
                Keep pressure on it!</p>
              <p>Mary does as she's told.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                (running along)<br>
                Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be<br>
                okay?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (irrational cockiness)<br>
                You betcha!</p>
              <p>He gives her two thumbs up as they slide him into the ambulance.</p>
              <p>INT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>The doors SLAM shut and as the ambulance pulls away Ted starts 
                to WHIMPER and we can see Mary fade into the night, as we</p>
              <p> DISSOLVE TO:</p>
              <p>INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - PRESENT DAY</p>
              <p>Ted, now in his 30's, lays on his therapist's couch.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                ...Anyway, school ended a few days later and that July her father 
                got transferred to Florida.</p>
              <p>The CAMERA PANS up to reveal that the CHAIR BEHIND HIM IS EMPTY.<br>
                Ted has been telling all this to no one.</p>
              <p> TED (cont'd)<br>
                It took me half the summer to pay off all those bets.<br>
                (sighs)<br>
                I never did see Mary again. That was about twelve years ago.</p>
              <p>Just then the door quietly opens and Ted's PSYCHIATRIST tip-toes 
                back into the room and takes his seat. (He has a dab of mustard 
                on his chin and has forgotten about the cloth napkin tucked into 
                his collar.)</p>
              <p> PSYCHIATRIST<br>
                Uh-huh. Interesting.</p>
              <p>The Psychiatrist notices the napkin and quickly wipes his chin,<br>
                then tosses it aside.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Anyway, it's not something you exactly forget about, but I guess 
                I must've blocked it out of my head. Then about a week ago I'm 
                driving on the highway and I got to thinking about Mary and suddenly 
                I couldn't breathe...I couldn't keep up with the flow<br>
                of traffic anymore I felt like I was going to die. I pulled into 
                a rest area, parked the car, and just started shaking.</p>
              <p>The Psychiatrist scratches his chin.</p>
              <p> PSYCHIATRIST<br>
                You know...rest areas are homosexual hang-outs.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Huh?</p>
              <p> PSYCHIATRIST<br>
                Highway rest areas--they're the bathhouses of the nineties for 
                some gay men.</p>
              <p>Ted thinks about this, then glances back at the shrink.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                What are you saying?</p>
              <p> PSYCHIATRIST<br>
                (checking wristwatch)<br>
                Oops, time's up. We'll have to delve into that next week.</p>
              <p>Off Ted's look, we</p>
              <p> CUT TO:</p>
              <p>EXT. DRIVING RANGE - DAY</p>
              <p>Ted and his friend DOM are blasting a couple buckets.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Gay? He said you were gay?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                He implied it.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman 
                Capote.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Yeah, but he was successful.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Let me ask you this: When you smoke a cigar, do you ever pretend 
                it has balls?</p>
              <p>Ted appears to think about this.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                What's he like?</p>
              <p>Dom LAUGHS, then watches as Ted hits a ball.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.<br>
                (beat)<br>
                You're going to like this one--she's half<br>
                Asian, half American.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Good-looking?</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                I just told you, she's half Asian. half American. They're all 
                good looking. You could mate Don Rickles and Yoko Ono and<br>
                they're going to have a gorgeous kid. It's a foolproof combo.</p>
              <p>Ted thinks about it.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump.<br>
                (SIGHS)<br>
                Lately I've been feeling like...well...like a loser.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Loser? You?</p>
              <p>Ted shrugs.</p>
              <p> DOM (cont'd)<br>
                Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? 
                If you were a loser would they have been able to find a<br>
                donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one 
                in a million?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                I never said that. I'm saying your lucky those kids found his 
                kidneys.<br>
                (beat)<br>
                Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a shit about you.</p>
              <p>Ted gives him a look.</p>
              <p> DOM (cont'd)<br>
                You know, you're a real glass-is-half-empty guy. You got a fucking 
                guardian angel, man.</p>
              <p>Ted manages a small smile. Just then, Ted's cell phone RINGS.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                I gotta take this, it might be my boss.<br>
                (flips phone open)<br>
                Ted here.</p>
              <p> GARBLED VOICE<br>
                (on phone)<br>
                You're a cocksucking motherfucking piece of puke!</p>
              <p>Whoever it is HANGS UP. Without reacting, Ted closes the phone 
                and puts it back in his pocket.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Yep.</p>
              <p>EXT. DOM'S HOUSE - DAY</p>
              <p>Dom and Ted are drinking beer while sitting on Dom's front steps.<br>
                We see signs of kids everywhere: a tricycle, six-foot basketball<br>
                hoop, dolls, etc.</p>
              <p>DOM'S WIFE comes out and hands them each a cigar.</p>
              <p> DOM'S WIFE<br>
                I thought you guys might like these with your beers.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Thanks, baby.</p>
              <p>She goes back inside.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                See, that's what I want. I don't need these bimbettes you got 
                me chasing. I want what you have. A family....Someone to...you<br>
                know...love.</p>
              <p>These guys don't usually talk about this crap, and Ted gets a<br>
                little embarrassed.</p>
              <p> TED (cont'd)<br>
                It must be great with a wife like that.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Each day is better than the next.<br>
                (beat)<br>
                Have you ever been, you know...in love with<br>
                someone?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Nah.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Never?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Well once. Mary.</p>
              <p>Dom SIGHS.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Mary again.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes 
                don't last twelve years.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Whatever happened to Mary?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                I told you, her family moved to Miami.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                I mean since then.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                I don't know.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Well why don't you look her up?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (sarcastic)<br>
                Yeah, right.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Why not?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls 
                like Mary don't stay single.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever 
                loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                I did try calling her.<br>
                (sheepish)<br>
                A few years ago. She wasn't listed.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                I also called Unsolved Mysteries.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                You're kidding? What did they say?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                They told me they don't help out stalkers.<br>
                (beat)<br>
                Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                I got it--you hire a private eye, fly him out there, he follows 
                her around a couple days, she'll never know a thing.</p>
              <p>Ted considers this.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                No. No fucking way. That's too creepy.</p>
              <p>Dom thinks a moment, then SNAPS his fingers.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Wait a second. There's a guy named Healy in my office who might 
                be able to help you out. He's a claims investigator and he goes 
                to Miami every couple weeks.</p>

                INT. PROVIDENCE UNION INSURANCE COMPANY - HALLWAY - MORNING</p>
              <p>Ted and Dom are walking down a hallway.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                I don't know about this, Dom.</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in 
                a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his<br>
                resume--like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going 
                to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that<br>
                ended up on my desk.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                His mother?</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady--got 
                diabetes or something--so I went out on a limb and got him transferred 
                down to Providence.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                And you think he could find out her number for me?</p>
              <p> DOM<br>
                He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, 
                you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her 
                down.</p>
              <p>Ted thinks about this.</p>
              <p> DOM (cont'd)<br>
                Just let me warn you--This guy runs a little hot, but he gets 
                the job done.</p>
              <p> CUT TO:</p>
              <p>INT. HEALY'S CUBICLE - MORNING</p>
              <p>Ted is seated inside a small cubicle across the desk from PATRICK 
                HEALY, a shaggy-looking guy in a mis-matched three-piece suit.<br>
                Healy looks more like a used-car salesman than an insurance<br>
                investigator.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew 
                in high school.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Uh-huh.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Any idea where I might start looking?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago.<br>
                I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. 
                She might've moved ten times since then.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                (skeptical)<br>
                All you want is a phone number?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Well, I know you're busy</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Don't play games with me, Ted.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see 
                if she has five kids and a Labrador.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                I don't buy it.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                You don't buy what?</p>
              <p>Suddenly Healy is in his face.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you 
                to level with me:<br>
                Did you knock this skirt up?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (indignant)<br>
                No.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                She's blackmailing you, right?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (more indignant)<br>
                No.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                You want her dead, don't you?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                You can't be serious.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker 
                case?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                I'm not a stalker ! She's a friend of mine.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't 
                heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted.<br>
                You're a real piece of work.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (stands)<br>
                Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                I get one hundred a day plus expenses.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (LAUGHS at Healy's nerve)<br>
                You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay 
                for your expenses.</p>
              <p>Healy thinks about it. </p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Okay, Ted, I'll do it. But if this chick turns up with a toe tag, 
                I'm rolling over on you.</p>
              <p> CUT TO:</p>
              <p>ESTABLISHING SHOT - of Miami Beach</p>
              <p>EXT. COLLINS AVENUE - DAY</p>
              <p>Healy waits alone on a corner carrying one bag and a RACK OF<br>
                BEERS. Suddenly a '89 Chrysler Lebaron convertible with a GREAT 
                DANE in the back SCREECHES to a halt in front of him. The driver, 
                SULLY, is a muscular, well-groomed man in his thirties.</p>
              <p> SULLY<br>
                Healy you dog!</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                (checking out car)<br>
                Fucking Sully! Look at you!</p>
              <p> SULLY<br>
                (Boston accent)<br>
                You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser.</p>
              <p>INT. CHRYSLER LEBARON - DAY</p>
              <p>The dog is catching wind in the backseat and Sully hands Healy 
                a<br>
                packet.</p>
              <p> SULLY<br>
                Here's the info you asked for.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Thanks.</p>
              <p> SULLY<br>
                You should thank me--that girl was not easy to find. What'd she 
                scam you out of-some insurance dough?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school 
                girlfriend.</p>
              <p> SULLY<br>
                Stalker, huh?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Big time.</p>
              <p>INT. SULLY'S APARTMENT - DAY</p>
              <p>This place is modest and clean but it has a direct view of South<br>
                Beach. Healy puts his bags down and looks around.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Very nice.</p>
              <p> SULLY<br>
                I'm doing okay.<br>
                (checks watch)<br>
                I gotta get ready for work.</p>
              <p>Sully ducks into the bedroom and Healy looks around the apartment.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels?<br>
                Looks like you really cleaned up your act.</p>
              <p> SULLY (O.S.)<br>
                What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and 
                it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys<br>
                I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.</p>
              <p> SULLY (O.S.)<br>
                Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?</p>
              <p>Suddenly a huge Boa Constrictor slithers up on Healy's lap.</p>
              <p> HEALY (cont'd)<br>
                What the...?!</p>
              <p>Sully comes back in the room wearing a police uniform.</p>
              <p> SULLY<br>
                Take it easy, that's Bill.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Tell Bill to get the fuck off!</p>
              <p> SULLY<br>
                (smiling)<br>
                Relax, he just ate.</p>
              <p>Healy just stares at his friend.</p>
              <p> SULLY (cont'd)<br>
                (proudly)<br>
                Nineteen months I been sober.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a 
                cokehead.</p>
              <p> SULLY<br>
                Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.</p>
              <p>Healy pops open one of his beers and hands it to Sully.</p>
              <p> HEALY (cont'd)<br>
                Here, just have one of these then.</p>
              <p> SULLY<br>
                Healy, what I just tell you?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?</p>
              <p> SULLY<br>
                No I can't.</p>
              <p>Healy stares at him, baffled.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Sully, it's one fuckin' beer for Christ<br>
                sakes.<br>
                (holds up beer)<br>
                Ooh, the big bad beer's gonna get ya.</p>
              <p>Sully stares at the beer, weakening.</p>
              <p> HEALY (cont'd)<br>
                I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once 
                in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a 
                fanatic and that ain't healthy.</p>
              <p> SULLY<br>
                Am I?</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Bet your ass you are. Now I don't want to hear anymore of your 
                happy horseshit. You gotta learn how to bend a little or believe<br>
                me...you're gonna break.</p>
              <p>Finally, Sully takes the beer. He stares at it a moment and then<br>
                sips.</p>
              <p> SULLY<br>
                Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me 
                anymore.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?</p>
              <p>Healy takes the beer from Sully and as he chugs it, we</p>

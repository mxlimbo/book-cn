              <p> TED<br>
                Thanks, that's great.</p>
              <p>The WAITER turns to Mary.</p>

                with are gone, replaced by a glazed, ACE VENTURA-STYLE WAVE up 
                front.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Thank you.</p>

              <p> MARY<br>
                I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's 
                a freak.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (stunned)<br>
                Jeez, Mary...I'm...</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like 
                Tucker.<br>
                (beat)<br>
                Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.<br>
                (big smile)<br>
                Let's talk about you.</p>
              <p> CUT TO:</p>
              <p>INT. ANOTHER BAR - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Healy and Tucker are bonding over a beer.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                ...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a 
                semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked 
                up with the Pizza Barn.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                And you met Mary how?</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered 
                the door in her nightgown--that was it for me. I went home that 
                night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her 
                office with a broken back.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                How'd you manage that one?</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                (matter-of-factly)<br>
                Friend. Baseball bat.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Nice.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced 
                lies about the competition--that's crossing the line!</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife 
                you started a war!</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Future wife? Get real, man--you're nothing more than a glorified 
                brother in her eyes.</p>
              <p> TUCKER<br>
                Why you son of a--</p>
              <p>Tucker grabs Healy by the jacket.</p>
              <p> HEALY<br>
                Okay, calm down, calm down--the bottom line is neither of us are 
                going to get her if we don't do something about that headcase<br>
                she's with now.</p>
              <p>As Tucker slowly releases him, we</p>

              <p>EXT. DRIVING RANGE - NIGHT</p>
              <p>Ted and Mary are eating CORNDOGS at the snack bar.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (shrugging)<br>
                No short game.</p>
              <p>She smiles.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                We should play some time...I mean, if you can afford to lose some 
                money.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (smiling)<br>
                What are you?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Twenty-two.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron--don't sandbag 
                me, lady.</p>
              <p>Mary smiles coyly.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                That's more like it.<br>
                (to Counter-Man)<br>
                Two more nitrate-sicles please.</p>
              <p> COUNTER-MAN<br>
                You got it.</p>
              <p>Mary is amused by this.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Nitrate-sicles--I like that.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got 
                a lot of sweets on sticks--popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops--but 
                hardly any meat.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                I agree there should be more.</p>
              <p>The Counter-Man hands each of them another corndog.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a cone. You could put corned 
                beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                I like it. And think of the toppings--cheese, mushrooms, mint 
                jelly</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Not to mention ketchup and hot peppers.</p>
              <p>They smile at one another.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                (pleased)<br>
                Yeah?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                We've got a lot in common.</p>
              <p>Ted takes a chance.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Well...why don't you move back?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my practice, the people 
                I work with, Warren's got a nice thing going<br>
                (joking)<br>
                Why don't you just move down here and marry me?</p>
              <p>Mary smiles and Ted LAUGHS...perhaps a little too hard.</p>

                So you're a writer?</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                Trying to be.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a 
                shot.</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.</p>
              <p> TED<br>
                What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?</p>
              <p> MARY<br>
                I don't know...My friends think I'm too picky. I think I'm just 
                a weirdo magnet. I did come close once--just last year, in fact. 
                There was this guy he lived in San Francisco.</p>

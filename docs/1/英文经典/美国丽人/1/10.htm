              <p>INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML3020 - LATER</p>
              <p>Ella Fitzgerald sings &quot;GET HAPPY&quot; on the RADIO. Carolyn 
                drives SINGING along. Her face has dropped the resolute determination 
                we're used to; she's actually enjoying herself spontaneously, 
                and the lack of her usual self-consciousness allows us to see 
                just how beautiful she is. She reaches over suddenly and opens 
                the glove compartment. </p>
              <p>ANGLE ON the open glove compartment: Carolyn's GLOCK 19 rests 
                on top of some CDs.</p>
              <p>Carolyn takes the gun out and holds it at arm's length, admiring 
                it as she continues to SING.</p>
              <p>EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>The MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 turns onto ROBIN Hood Trail.</p>
              <p>INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>Carolyn's POV: We approach the Burnham house and turn into the 
                driveway. A red 1972 PONTIAC GTO with black racing stripes blocks 
                our access to the garage. We come to a stop.</p>
              <p>ANGLE ON Carolyn's face as she stares at the GTO. She doesn't 
                like having things in her way.</p>
              <p>ANGLE ON Carolyn's face as she stares at the GTO. She doesn't 
                like having things in her way.</p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER</p>
              <p>CLOSE on the TV screen: The &quot;FLINTSTONES&quot; THEME SONG 
                plays, and Fred Flintstone bangs on the door of his prehistoric 
                home, yelling, &quot;Wilma!&quot; as the closing credits scroll 
                past.</p>
              <p>LESTER is sprawled on the couch IN his underwear, drinking abeer 
                and watching TV. His working out is beginning to produce results. 
                Carolyn enters through the kitchen. She stands there, staring 
                at Lester. After a moment, he looks up at her.</p>
              <p>LESTERWhat?</p>
              <p>CAROLYNWhose car is that out front?</p>
              <p>LESTERMine. 1972 Pontiac GTO. The car I always wanted and now 
                I have it. I rule!</p>
              <p>CAROLYNWhere's the Camry?</p>
              <p>LESTERI traded it in.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNShouldn't you have consulted me first?</p>
              <p>LESTERHm. Let me think... No.(off her look)You never drove it.</p>
              <p>A beat.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNWhere's Jane?</p>
              <p>LESTER(mimicking her) Where's the Camry? Where's Jane? Where's 
                my butt?(then)I don't know where Jane is. She's probably as far 
                away from you as she could get.</p>
              <p>Carolyn regards him Through narrow eyes, filled with hate.</p>
              <p>CAROLYN(quietly)I'm not as helpless as you think I am.</p>
              <p>He looks UP at her. Carolyn holds his gaze FOR a beat, thenturns 
                and walks out of the room.</p>
              <p>INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>We HEAR Babybird's &quot;ATOMIC SODA.&quot;</p>
              <p>ON VIDEO: We're outside, in a wooded area, looking up at the 
                sun through tree branches, then we PAN down to see a path through 
                the trees in front of us. SOMETHING OUT OF FOCUS crosses by in 
                front us, obscuring our view. We slowly ZOOM back and see that 
                it's Jane, or rather, just a corner of her face, as she looks 
                at us, her eyes shining. Her hand brushes the hair off her face 
                and we stay on her hand. It swings back and forth gracefully she 
                walks ahead in front of us... we JUMP CUT to:</p>
              <p>ON VIDEO: CLOSE on Jane's naked calves, her jeans rolled up, 
                as she dangles her feet in a pond. The water RIPPLES in concentric 
                circles every time she dips her toes in, not unlike the water 
                in the jail cell sink at the beginning... we JUMP CUT to:</p>
              <p>ON VIDEO: We're MOVING in a circle, as Jane runs around us in 
                the opposite direction, so that we see only FLASHES OF HER RUNNING 
                by, LAUGHING... JUMP CUT to:</p>
              <p>On VIDEO: JANE IN profile, looking toward the sky, her yesshut, 
                enjoying the sun on her face.</p>
              <p>RICKY (O.C.)Jesus, you're beautiful.</p>
              <p>She looks at us and smiles, her guard down, her face empty OFits 
                usual vaguely contemptuous expression, and, indeed, she is beautiful: 
                young, happy, hopeful. We linger on her face for a moment. She 
                brings her hand up to caress her cheek, and then, still smiling, 
                she slowly flips us the bird... we JUMP CUT to:</p>
              <p>ON VIDEO: We're looking at Jane's SHADOW, clearly delineated 
                by the bright sun against a textured carpet of fallen leaves on 
                the forest floor. We HEAR her GIGGLE as she makes shadow puppets 
                with her hand, then we MOVE around so that we're looking up at 
                her, silhouetted against the Bun. Even though we can't make out 
                her features, this image seems transcendent, almost religious.</p>
              <p>ON VIDEO: Jane in Ricky's bed, naked. She quickly pulls a sheet 
                up over her breasts.</p>
              <p>JANE(shy)Don' t.</p>
              <p>PULLING BACK, we see we've been watching the WIDE-SCREEN TV in 
                Ricky's room.</p>
              <p>A CORD leads from the TV to Ricky's VIDEO CAMERA. Ricky holds 
                the camera, sitting naked in his desk chair. It's been almost 
                a month since he was beaten up by his father, and there are a 
                couple of slight SCARS on his face. He's focusing his camera on 
                Jane, who's lying in his bed. We see her image on the TV. Babybird's 
                &quot;ATOMIC SODA&quot; plays on the STEREO.</p>
              <p>RICKYWhy?</p>
              <p>JANE(re: image on TV)It's okay when you're just filming me, because 
                that's just you, looking at me. But it's weird, watching myself. 
                I don't like how I look.</p>
              <p>RICKYI can't believe you don't know how beautiful you are. </p>
              <p>JANELook, I'm not going to sit here for that shit.</p>
              <p>She gets out OF bed, takes his camera and focuses it on him.We 
                see his image on the TV as she videotapes.</p>
              <p>JANE (cont'd)Ha. How does it feel now?</p>
              <p>RICKYFine.</p>
              <p>JANEYou don't feel naked?</p>
              <p>RICKYI am naked.</p>
              <p>JANEYou know what I mean.</p>
              <p>Jane ZOOMS in on his face, which remains placid, still, expressionless.</p>
              <p>JANE (cont'd)Tell me about being in the hospital.</p>
              <p>RICKY smiles.</p>
              <p>RICKYWhen I was fourteen, my dad caught me smoking dope. He totally 
                freaked and sent me to military school. I told you his whole thing 
                about structure, and discipline, right?(laughs)Well, of course, 
                I got kicked out. Dad and I had this huge fight, and he hit me... 
                and then the next day, at school, some kid made a crack about 
                my haircut, and I just... snapped. I wanted to kill him. And I 
                would have, if they hadn't pulled me off him.(then)That's when 
                my dad put me in the hospital. They drugged me up and I wasthere 
                for almost two years.</p>
              <p>JANEYou must really hate him.</p>
              <p>RICKYHe's not really a bad man. He's just one of those people 
                who needs everybody to make the same choices he did. So he can 
                feel good about himself.</p>
              <p>JANEYeah, but you lost two whole years of your life.</p>
              <p>RICKYI didn't lose them. It taught me how to step back, and just... 
                watch, and not take everything so personally. And that's something 
                I needed to learn. That's something everybody needs to learn.</p>
              <p>He grabs a half-smoked JOINT from an ashtray and LIGHTS it.</p>
              <p>JANEWell... you better believe I'd hate my father if he did something 
                like thatto me.(laughs)Wait. I do hate my father.</p>
              <p>RICKYWhy?</p>
              <p>He passes her the JOINT, then takes the camera and focuses iton 
                her. We see her image on the TV as he videotapes.</p>
              <p>JANEHe's a total asshole and he's got the hots for my friend 
                Angela and it's disgusting.</p>
              <p>RICKYWhat, you'd rather he had the hots for you?</p>
              <p>JANEGross, no!(then)But it'd be nice if I was anywhere near as 
                important to him as she is.</p>
              <p>She LAUGHS, then leans BACK and takes a drag off the joint.</p>
              <p>JANEI know you think my dad's harmless, but you're wrong. He's 
                doing massive psychological damage to me.</p>
              <p>RICKYHow?</p>
              <p>JANE looks into the camera, a loopy, stoned grin on her face.</p>
              <p>JANEHey. I need structure, okay? I need discipline.</p>
              <p>She LAUGHS. So does Ricky, and Jane's image on the TV SHAKES 
                a little. She takes a deep drag off the joint, and Ricky ZOOMS 
                in on her face as she exhales.</p>
              <p>JANE (cont'd)I'm serious, though. How can he not be damaging 
                me? I need a father who's a role model, not some horny geek-boy 
                who's gonna spray his shorts whenever I bring a girlfriend home 
                from school.(snorts)Like he'd ever have a chance with her. What 
                a lame-o. Somebody really should put him out of his misery.</p>
              <p>A beat. JANE plays with her hair, lost IN thought.</p>
              <p>RICKYWant me to kill him for you?</p>
              <p>JANE stares at him incredulously, then LAUGHS.</p>
              <p>JANEYeah, would you?</p>
              <p>RICKYIt'll cost you.</p>
              <p>JANEI've been baby-sitting since I was ten, I've got almost three 
                thousand dollars. I was saving it for a boob job.</p>
              <p>She stands and shakes her breasts, then falls BACK on to thebed, 
                LAUGHING.</p>
              <p>JANE (cont'd) But my tits can wait.</p>
              <p>RICKYYou know, that's not a very nice thing to do, hiring somebody 
                to kill your dad.</p>
              <p>JANEWell, I guess I'm just not a very nice girl, then, am I?</p>
              <p>She smiles dreamily at him. He turns other camera off andthe 
                TV screen goes BLUE. He lowers the camera and looks at her intently.</p>
              <p>JANE (cont'd)(suddenly nervous)You know I'm not serious, right?</p>
              <p>RICKYOf course.</p>
              <p>He puts the camera down and joins JANE on the bed. a longmoment 
                where neither of them speaks. He caresses her hair, gazing into 
                her eyes. Jane touches one of the scars on his face. He smiles.</p>
              <p>RICKY (cont'd)Do you know how lucky we are to have found each 
                other?</p>
              <p>EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - EARLY MORNING</p>
              <p>We re FLYING high above ROBIN HOOD TRAIL, just as we were atthe 
                beginning, during Lester's dream. We see the BURNHAM1S HOUSE below 
                us as we approach it steadily. The Jims' dog Bitsy looks up at 
                us and BARKS from their yard across the street.</p>
              <p>LESTER (V.O.)Remember those posters that said, Today is the first 
                day of the rest of your life? Well, that's true of every day except 
                one.(a beat)The day that you die.</p>
              <p>We're almost on top of the Burnham house now, as Lester, wearing 
                sweatpants and running shoes, bursts out of the front door and 
                dashes up the driveway.</p>

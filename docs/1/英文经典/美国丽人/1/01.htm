              <p>EXTREME CLOSE-UP on a DROP OF WATER, gathering at the tip OFa 
                faucet, a FLASH OF LIGHT refracting through it just before it 
                FALLS.......</p>
              <p>PULLING BACK slowly, we see ANOTHER DROP OF WATER gather andFALL... 
                and then ANOTHER... into a METAL SINK BASIN filled with water, 
                rippling in concentric circles with each DROP, which we HEAR in 
                a steady rhythm: DRIP... DRIP... DRIP...</p>
              <p>RICKY (O.C.)(singing in time to the water dripping)I'M FIXING 
                A HOLE... WHERE THE RAIN GETS IN....</p>
              <p>REVERSE ANGLE on the face OF a YOUNG MAN with his hair cutshort, 
                military-style, watching the dripping water as if hypnotized. 
                We ZOOM slowly toward him...</p>
              <p>This is RICKY FITTS. He's twenty, but his eyes are much older. 
                Underneath his Zen-like tranquility lurks something wounded... 
                and dangerous. He SINGS softly to himself:</p>

              <p>Through the bars OF his CELL we see RICKY is seated on theedge

              <p>ON TELEVISION: INT. COURTROOM - DAY</p>
              <p>A sullen TEENAGE GIRL sits at a table in a COURTROOM, surrounded 
                by lawyers. SUPERIMPOSED across the bottom of screen: TEENAGE 
                GIRL ACCUSED OF HIRING FATHER'S KILLER. At the lower right corner 
                is the JUSTICE TV logo. In the upper right corner: LIVE.</p>
              <p>This girl is JANE BURNHAM. Seventeen-years-old, with dark, intense 
                eyes. She stares blankly at the table in front of her.</p>
              <p>D.A. (O.C.)Would you please tell the court how long you and the 
                defendant have been friends?</p>
              <p>ANGELA (O.C.)Uh, we've known each other since like, fifth grade? 
                But we didn't really become friends until this past year?</p>
              <p>Jane looks up, her eyes hostile, at:</p>
              <p>Seated on the witness stand is seventeen-year-old ANGELAHAYES. 
                Strikingly beautiful, with perfect, even features, blonde hair, 
                and a nubile young body, she's the archetypal American dream girl. 
                She is being questioned by a DISTRICT ATTORNEY.</p>
              <p>D.A.During that time, did Jane ever say she disliked her father?</p>
              <p>INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>We're now in the courtroom, where the JUSTICE TV CAMERAS focus 
                on Angela as the D.A. questions her.</p>
              <p>ANGELA Yes.</p>
              <p>D.A.Exactly how did she say it?</p>
              <p>ANGELA (cont'd)Uh, she said she hated his guts, and wished he 
                was dead.</p>
              <p>D.A.Did she tell you why?</p>
              <p>Angela hesitates, hot eager to answer this. Finally:</p>
              <p>ANGELA (cont'd)She said he was just too embarrassing to live, 
                okay?</p>
              <p>ANGELA looks at JANE, who stares at her with absolute hatred.</p>
              <p>ANGELA (cont'd)She said both of her parents were totally embarrassing, 
                but her dad was like, way beyond? And somebody had to take him 
                out. But she said her mom was just pathetic and probably didn't 
                deserve to like, die.</p>
              <p>Elsewhere IN the COURTROOM, a very well-put-together WOMAN OFforty 
                stifles a SOB. This is Jane's mother, CAROLYN BURNHAM.</p>
              <p>BACK on the witness stand, ANGELA looks contrite.</p>
              <p>ANGELA (cont'd)I'm sorry, Mrs. Burnham, but she did.</p>
              <p>At her table, JANE buries her face IN her hands.</p>
              <p>ANGELA (cont'd)You did. You said it.</p>
              <p>INT. POLICE STATION - LOBBY - DAY</p>
              <p>A suburban POLICE station. PHONES RINGING, officers withclipboards, 
                lowlifes being booked. The usual.</p>
              <p>The front door opens and COLONEL FRANK FITTS enters, carryinga 
                MANILA ENVELOPE. He's fifty, quite handsome, his graying hair 
                cut short, military-style. He still moves like the athlete he 
                once was, but his eyes tell us he's not happy, and hasn't been 
                for some time. As he approaches the front desk, the uniformed 
                clerk behind it looks up at him impassively.</p>
              <p>COLONELI need to speak to Detective Fleishman.</p>
              <p>INT. POLICE STATION - DETECTIVE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER</p>
              <p>DETECTIVE FLEISHMAN, paunchy and constantly exhausted, opensthe 
                door to his office and motions Colonel Fitts inside.</p>
              <p>FLEISHMANColonel Pitts. How goes it?(off his look)Forgive me. 
                That was a stupid question, after everything you've been through.</p>
              <p>He shows the COLONEL to a chair, then sits behind his desk.</p>
              <p>FLEISHMAN (cont'd)So what can I do for you?</p>
              <p>The COLONEL sighs, looking at the MANILA ENVELOPE He holds.</p>
              <p>COLONELI found something. I think you should take a look at it.</p>
              <p>FLEISHMANOkay.</p>
              <p>But the COLONEL just sits there, holding the envelope.</p>
              <p>COLONELI don't want to do this.(fighting back tears)But I was 
                taught a little thing called duty. Something I wasn't able to 
                teach my own son...</p>
              <p>He breaks down. FLEISHMAN crosses to him and places his handon 
                his shoulder. The Colonel shrugs it off, violently.</p>
              <p>COLONEL (cont'd)No.</p>
              <p>Respectfully, FLEISHMAN steps back. the COLONEL pulls himselftogether 
                and hands over the envelope, without looking up. Fleishman studies 
                the envelope as he walks back to his desk, then opens it and takes 
                out an unmarked HI-8 VIDEOCASSETTE. He looks at the Colonel quizzically.</p>

                in cold blood, allegedly the victim of a teenage psychopath hired 
                by his own daughter, Jane. The case that has outraged America, 
                has now become even more shocking. Tonight on The Real Dirt, we'll 
                show you - for the first time anywhere - an astonishing videotape 
                in which Jane and alleged killer Richard Fitts actually make their

                a lame-o. Somebody really should put him out of his misery.</p>

                as they watch the videotape.</p>

              <p>JANE (O.C.)I've been baby-sitting since I was ten, I've got almost 
                three thousand dollars. </p>
              <p>We see the tape as it plays on the VIDEO MONITOR SET UP INthe 
                front of the courtroom. This time there is no THE REAL DIRT logo 
                nor any digital blurring of Jane's nudity. </p>
              <p>ON THE MONITOR: JANE sits UP IN bed, smiling.</p>
              <p>JANE (cont'd)I was saving it for a boob job. </p>
              <p>ON THE MONITOR: JANE stands and shakes her breasts.</p>
              <p>In the courtroom, Jane's mother Carolyn watches, stunned, gripping 
                the arm of a well-dressed, silver-haired MAN at her side.</p>
              <p>JANE (O.C.) (cont'd)But my tits can wait.</p>
              <p>Jane watches from her seat, her face a mixture of anger, disbelief 
                and helplessness. We ZOOM toward her slowly.</p>
              <p>RICKY (O.C.)You know, that's not a very nice thing to do, hiring 
                somebody to kill your dad.</p>

              <p>FADE to BLACK.</p>
              <p>In darkness, we HEAR Vic Damone singing &quot;I'M NOBODY'S BABY,&quot; 
                as the words &quot;ONE YEAR EARLIER&quot; FADE IN AND OUT.</p>
              <p>FADE IN:</p>
              <p>EXT. SUBURB - EARLY MORNING</p>
              <p>We're FLYING high above an upper middle class SUBURB. The wide 
                streets are lined with stately elms and sycamores; the homes are 
                traditional and well-kept. Coming closer to the ground, we pick 
                out a couple of male JOGGER.</p>
              <p>A DIFFERENT ANGLE on the Joggers. We're at level now, MOVING 
                alongside them. They're both in their thirties, athletic, blandly 
                handsome. They pass a STREET SIGN that reads Robin Hood Trail.</p>
              <p>Suddenly, a MAN comes into view, FLYING Superman-style aboutthree 
                feet above their heads. He's wearing old-fashioned PAJAMAS, and 
                a plaid flannel ROBE. As he passes overhead, the Joggers look 
                up and wave excitedly, like children. He flashes them a grin and 
                waves back, then he speeds up, leaving them behind.</p>
              <p>As the MAN flies down the street, a BARKING DOG runs alongbeneath 
                him, jumping into the air, trying to catch him. The Man swoops 
                and dips effortlessly, teasing the dog, then spots, at the end 
                of the street, a young boy on a bicycle tossing newspapers onto 
                people's porches, or as close as he can get. Seeing the flying 
                Man, the boy tosses a paper high into the air. The dog tears off 
                to catch the paper. The flying Man LAUGHS and shoots upward like 
                he's been blown out of a cannon, grabs the paper, and swoops down, 
                dropping it lightly on the front porch of a well-appointed, two-story 
                HOUSE with distinctive CEDAR SHINGLE SIDING and a RED FRONT DOOR.</p>
              <p>The boy on the bike watches IN admiration. the MAN slowlyfloats 
                by above him and tousles his hair. The dog BARKS. The boy throws 
                another newspaper into the air, this time even higher than before, 
                and the Man grins as he prepares to shoot up after it: this is 
                going to be fun... and we SMASH CUT TO:</p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY</p>
              <p>We HEAR the harsh BUZZ OF an ALARM CLOCK. Vic Damone stillsings 
                &quot;I'M NOBODY'S BABY&quot; elsewhere in the house. Outside, 
                a dog is still BARKING</p>
              <p>The MAN we just saw FLYING Through the streets lies sleepingamidst 
                expensive bed linens, wearing the same PAJAMAS. His hand reaches 
                over and shuts the ALARM CLOCK OFF; his eyes remain clamped shut 
                as he tries to hang onto his dream.... but it's gone. He sighs 
                and opens his eyes. </p>
              <p>This man is LESTER BURNHAM, Carolyn's husband and Jane's father. 
                He's forty-two, with a wide boyish face that's just beginning 
                to droop around the edges. He sits up in bed and rubs his face.</p>
              <p>We're in a large, comfortable bedroom that's tastefully decorated 
                but not overdone - it could be a spread from Metropolitan Home. 
                Lester gets out of the king-sized bed, crosses to a bay window 
                covered with stylish wooden blinds, lifts one of the slats with 
                his finger and peers through it. </p>
              <p>His POV: A DOG - the same dog from Lester's flying dream -BARKS 
                excitedly at us from behind a white picket fence surrounding the 
                front yard of the house across the street.</p>
              <p>EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>The dog's POV: Lester looks down at us through the bay window 
                of the HOUSE from his dream - we recognize the distinctive CEDAR 
                SHINGLE SIDING. The dog continues to BARK.</p>
              <p>LESTER (V.O.)My name is Lester Burnham. I'm forty two-years old. 
                In less than a year, I'll be dead.INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER 
                BATH - MOMENTS LATER</p>
              <p>We're in the shower with Lester. A waterproof RADIO plays COUNTRY 
                MUSIC. He stands with his face directly in the hot spray1 eyes 
                shut.</p>
              <p>LESTER (V.O.)In a way, I'm dead already.</p>
              <p>ANGLE from outside the shower: we see Lester's naked body silhouetted 
                through the steamed-up glass door. It becomes apparent he is masturbating.</p>
              <p>LESTER (V.O.) (cont'd)(amused)Look at me jerking off while I 
                listen to country music. I hated this shit when I was growing 
                up.(then)Funny thing is, this is the high point of my day. It's 
                all downhill from here.</p>

              <p>CLOSE on a single, dewy AMERICAN BEAUTY ROSE, perfect INshape 
                and color. As we PULL BACK, a pair of gloved hands with CLIPPERS 
                appear and SNIP the flower off.</p>
              <p>We continue PULLING BACK to discover Carolyn BURNHAM IN herrose 
                garden in front of the house, cutting flowers and placing them 
                in a basket, a determined, humorless look on her face. Even now, 
                she is perfectly put-together; she wears color-coordinated gardening 
                togs and has lots of useful and expensive tools. </p>
              <p>LESTER (V.O.)That's my wife Carolyn. See the way the handle on 
                those pruning shears matches her gardening clogs? That's not an 
                accident</p>

                dog is still BARKING. A well-groomed, athletic MAN in a conservative 
                suit rolls a blue plastic city GARBAGE CONTAINER up the driveway 
                to the curb.</p>
              <p>JIM #1Bitsy. Hush.</p>
              <p>LESTER (V.O.)That's our next-door neighbor Jim.</p>
              <p>A second well-groomed, athletic MAN IN a conservative suitcomes 
                out the front door.</p>
              <p>JIM #2What in the world is wrong with her? She had a walk this 
                morning.</p>
              <p>JIM #1And a jerky treat.</p>
              <p>JIM #2(frowns)You spoil her.</p>
              <p>LESTER (V.O.)(re: the second man)And that's his lover Jim.</p>
              <p>We recognize the two Jims as the joggers from Lester's dream.</p>
              <p>JIM #2(sternly)Bitsy. No bark. Come inside. Now.</p>
              <p>Bitsy, suddenly subdued, allows Jim #2 to usher her inside.</p>
              <p>LESTER (V.O.)It's weird they have the same name, but that's really 
                no fault of their own. </p>
              <p>As Jim #2 gets into a Ford Taurus, Jim #1 crosses the street 
                to greet Carolyn.</p>
              <p>JIM #1Morning, Carolyn.</p>
              <p>CAROLYN(overly friendly)Good morning, Jim! I just love your tie! 
                That color!</p>
              <p>JIM #1 And I just love your roses. How do you get them to flourish 
                like that?</p>
              <p>CAROLYNWell, I'll tell you. Egg shells and Miracle Grow.</p>
              <p>ANGLE on the second floor bay window of the Burnham's house, 
                where Lester stands in a bathrobe, drying his hair as he looks 
                down at them.</p>
              <p>LESTER (V.O.)Man. I get exhausted just watching her.</p>
              <p>His POV: We can't hear what they're saying, but Carolyn's facial 
                expressions remain overly animated and cheerful, like those of 
                a TV talk show host.</p>
              <p>LESTER (V.O.) (cont'd)She wasn't always like this. She used to 
                be happy. We used to be happy...</p>
              <p>Jim #2 pulls the Ford Taurus into the street; Jim #1 waves to 
                Carolyn, jumps inside and they drive off. Carolyn immediately 
                reverts to her previous resolute expression as she continues cutting 
                flowers.</p>
              <p>LESTER (V.O.) (cont'd)But she doesn't have much use for me anymore. 
                About the only thing that gets her excited now is money.</p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>CLOSE on a young woman's hands counting DOLLAR BILLS. PULLING 
                BACK, we see JANE BURNHAM, seated at a desk in her bedroom, wearing 
                jeans and a tight cotton top with straps. As she counts, she has 
                the same resolute expression as her mother. </p>
              <p>LESTER (V.O.)And this is my daughter Jane. Only child. She takes 
                after her mother in a lot of ways, although she'd never admit 
                it. </p>
              <p>Having finished counting, JANE paper-clips the money togetherthen 
                types something into a computer.</p>
              <p>CLOSE on the COMPUTER MONITOR: Personal banking software.We see 
                the word DEPOSIT and the amount $38.00 as they're entered, then 
                a new total in the balance column: $2,853.06.</p>
              <p>JANE smiles, pleased. she stuffs the money into a KNAPSACKhanging 
                on her closet door, then looks at herself in a full-length MIRROR. 
                A beat, she turns sideways and arches her back so her breasts 
                protrude as much as possible She frowns, then turns so she's facing 
                the mirror, and hugs her herself tightly, to enhance the appearance 
                of cleavage.</p>
              <p>LESTER (V.O.) (cont'd)Janie is a pretty typical teenager. Angry, 
                insecure, confused. I wish I could tell her all that's going to 
                pass.(then)But I don't want to lie to her.</p>
              <p>We HEAR a CAR HORN from outside. JANE grabs her KNAPSACK anda 
                too-large flannel shirt from her closet and starts out.</p>

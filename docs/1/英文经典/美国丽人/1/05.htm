              <p>CLOSE on the front door, as it opens to reveal Carolyn, greeting 
                us with her most winning smile - the smile she thinks could sell 
                ice to an Eskimo.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNWelcome. I'm Carolyn Burnham!</p>
              <p>MUSIC ENDS.</p>
              <p>INT. SALE HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>Smiling, Carolyn leads a MAN and WOMAN into the living room.They're 
                thirtyish, and they've seen a lot of houses today.</p>
              <p>MAN(looking up) How high is that ceiling?</p>
              <p>CAROLYNOver twenty feet.</p>
              <p>WOMANThat color is hideous.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNa simple cream would really lighten things up. You couldeven 
                put in a skylight.</p>
              <p>The WOMAN wrinkles her face, skeptical.</p>
              <p>CAROLYN (cont'd)Wait 'til you see the kitchen.</p>
              <p>INT. SALE HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER</p>
              <p>Carolyn enters, still Smiling, followed By a DIFFERENT COUPLEin 
                their fifties.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNAs you can see, it's been completely remodeled.</p>
              <p>MAN(opening cabinet)These have just been refaced. no new construction.</p>
              <p>WOMAN(re: faucet)What is this, gold?</p>
              <p>CAROLYNNo, it's solid brass.</p>
              <p>WOMANKinda gaudy, isn't it?</p>
              <p>INT. SALE HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER</p>
              <p>Carolyn stands with a different COUPLE: African American, late 
                twenties. The woman is pregnant.</p>
              <p>CAROLYN...and you'll be surprised how much a ceiling fan can 
                cut down on your energy costs.</p>
              <p>MANI got a cousin, he was a ballplayer. Ceiling fan fell on him 
                in a bar and severed a tendon in his shoulder. Never fully regained 
                use of that arm. Ruined his career.</p>
              <p>Carolyn just stares at him, still smiling.</p>
              <p>EXT. SALE HOUSE - BACK YARD - LATER</p>
              <p>Carolyn stands By the pool next to two thirtyish WOMEN withidentical 
                haircuts.</p>
              <p>WOMANThe ad said this pool was &quot;lagoon-like.&quot; But there's 
                nothing &quot;lagoon-like&quot; about it. Except for maybe the 
                bugs.(slaps her arm)There's not even any plants out here.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNI have an excellent landscape architect -</p>
              <p>WOMANI mean, I think &quot;lagoon,&quot; and I think waterfall, 
                I think tropical. This is just a cement hole.</p>
              <p>A beat.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNThere are some tiki torches in the garage.</p>
              <p>The Women stare at her; she just keeps smiling.</p>
              <p>INT. SALE HOUSE - SUN ROOM - MOMENTS LATER</p>
              <p>Carolyn enters, alone. She's furious, much more furious than 
                she should be. She locks the sliding glass door and starts to 
                pull the vertical blinds shut, then stops. Standing very still, 
                with the blinds casting shadows across her face, she starts to 
                cry: brief, staccato SOBS that seemingly escape against her will. 
                Suddenly she SLAPS herself, hard.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNStop it.</p>
              <p>But the Tears continue. she SLAPS herself again.</p>
              <p>CAROLYN (cont'd)Weak. Baby. Shut up. Shut up!</p>
              <p>She SLAPS herself repeatedly until she stops crying. shestands. 
                there, taking deep, even breaths until she has everything under 
                control, then she finishes pulling the blinds shut, once again 
                all business. She walks out calmly, leaving us alone in the dark, 
                empty room.</p>
              <p>INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT</p>
              <p>We HEAR a jazzy rendition of &quot;DESAFINADO&quot; under the 
                cacophonous and oddly comforting DIN of a room full of people 
                all talking at once.</p>

              <p>CAROLYNLester, listen to me. This is an important business function. 
                Now, as you know, my business is selling an image. And part of 
                my job is to live that image - </p>
              <p>LESTER(in unison with her; he's heard this before)is to live 
                that image -(then)Just say whatever you want to say, okay? Spare 
                me the propaganda.</p>
              <p>CAROLYN(sighs)Will you please do me a favor and act happy tonight?</p>
              <p>LESTER(grins stupidly)I am happy, honey.</p>
              <p>Carolyn's jaw tightens, then:</p>
              <p>CAROLYN(spots someone)Leonard!</p>
              <p>She drag. LESTER toward a distinguished silver-haired MAN andhis 
                much younger WIFE. We recognize the Man as LEONARD KANE The Real

              <p>CAROLYN (cont'd)(shakes Leonard's hand)It's good to see you again.</p>
              <p>LEONARD(friendly)It's good to see you too, Catherine.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNCarolyn.</p>

              <p>CHRISTYHello</p>
              <p>CAROLYNThis is my husband, Lester - </p>
              <p>LEONARD(shakes Lester's Hand)It's a pleasure.</p>
              <p>LESTERWe've actually met. At this same thing last year? Wait 
                - maybe it was that Christmas thing at the Sheraton.</p>
              <p>LEONARDOh, yes.</p>
              <p>LESTER(friendly)It's okay. I wouldn't remember me either.</p>
              <p>He LAUGHS. a little too loudly. Carolyn quickly joins in.</p>
              <p>CAROLYN(forced gaiety) Honey. Don't be weird.</p>
              <p>She smiles her winning smile at him. He knows This personawell, 
                only it's never pissed him off as much as it does right now.</p>
              <p>LESTERAll right, honey. I won't be weird.</p>
              <p>He moves IN Suddenly, his face CLOSE to hers.</p>
              <p>LESTER (cont'd)I'll be whatever you want me to be.</p>
              <p>And He kisses her - a soft, warm kiss THAT speaksunmistakably 
                of sex - then turns to the others and grins.</p>
              <p>LESTER (cont'd)We have a very healthy relationship.</p>
              <p>Carolyn's smile is frozen on her face, and we can see just about 
                every vein in her neck.</p>
              <p>LESTER (cont'd)Well. I don't know about you, but I need another 
                drink.</p>
              <p>He crosses off. Carolyn, Leonard and Christy watch him go.</p>
              <p>INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER</p>
              <p>LESTER stands at the bar. the bartender pours him a scotch.</p>
              <p>LESTERWhoa. Put a little more in there, cowboy.</p>
              <p>The bartender complies. LESTER takes his drink and turns toface 
                the center of the room.</p>
              <p>His POV: Carolyn is talking to Leonard and Christy. She's on: 
                smiling, animated, LAUGHING too loud at their jokes.</p>
              <p>Lester smiles and shakes his head. Ricky approaches him, wearing 
                a waiter's uniform, carrying a tray of empty glasses.</p>
              <p>RICKYExcuse me - don't you live on Robin Hood Trail? The house 
                with the red door?</p>
              <p>LESTER(suspicious)Yeah.</p>
              <p>RICKYI'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved into the house next to you.</p>
              <p>LESTEROh. Hi, Ricky Fitts. I'm Lester Burnham.</p>
              <p>RICKYHi, Lester Burnham.</p>
              <p>A beat. LESTER looks away, scans the crowd, then downs therest 
                of his drink in one gulp. Ricky just stands there, watching him. 
                Finally Lester turns back to Ricky: what does this kid want?</p>
              <p>RICKY (cont'd)Hey, do you party?</p>
              <p>LESTERI'm sorry?</p>
              <p>RICKYDo you get high? </p>
              <p>Lester's surprised, but instantly intrigued.</p>
              <p>INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER</p>
              <p>Carolyn and Leonard are deep IN conversation. Christy haswandered 
                off. Carolyn is nervous; Leonard seems amused.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNI probably wouldn't even tell you this if I weren't a 
                little tipsy, but... I am in complete awe of you. Your firm is, 
                hands down, the Rolls Royce of local Real Estate firms, and, well, 
                your personal sales record is, is, is very intimidating. I'd love 
                to sit down with you, just to pick your brain, if you'd ever be 
                willing. I suppose, technically, I'm the competition, but... I 
                mean, I don't flatter myself that I'm even in the same league 
                as you...</p>
              <p>LEONARDI'd love to.</p>
              <p>CAROLYN(shocked)Really?</p>
              <p>LEONARDAbsolutely. Call my secretary and have her schedule a 
                lunch.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNI'll do that. Thank you.</p>
              <p>She smiles at him, and He smiles back. This situation isloaded 
                and they both know it.</p>
              <p>EXT. HOTEL - LATER</p>
              <p>RICKY and LESTER stand next to a dumpster behind the serviceentrance 
                to the hotel, smoking a JOINT.</p>
              <p>LESTERWhat about... did you ever see that one movie, with the 
                body walking around holding its own head? And then the head went 
                down on that babe?</p>
              <p>RICKYRe-Animator. It was okay.</p>
              <p>Suddenly, the service entrance opens, and a serious YOUNG MANin 
                a cheap suit peers out at them. Ricky hides the joint.</p>

              <p>MAN(to Ricky)Look. I'm not paying you to...(eyes Lester, suspiciously)...do 
                whatever it is you're doing out here.</p>
              <p>RICKYFine. Don't pay me.</p>
              <p>MANExcuse me?</p>
              <p>RICKYI quit. So you don't have to pay me. Now, leave me alone.</p>
              <p>A beat.</p>
              <p>MANAsshole.</p>
              <p>He goes BACK inside. LESTER looks at RICKY, who shrugs as Hestubs 
                out the joint.</p>
              <p>LESTERI think you just became my personal hero.(then)Doesn't 
                that make you nervous, just quitting your job like that? Well, 
                I guess when you're all of, what? Sixteen?</p>
              <p>RICKYNineteen.(off Lester's look)I was held back a few years 
                in school. (then)I just do these gigs every now and then as a 
                cover. I have other sources of income. But my dad interferes a 
                lot less in my life when I pretend to be an upstanding young citizen 
                with a respectable job.</p>
              <p>CAROLYN (O.C.)Lester?</p>
              <p>Carolyn is standing IN the open service entrance, staring atLester 
                and Ricky curiously.</p>
              <p>CAROLYN (cont'd)What are you doing?</p>
              <p>LESTERCarolyn, this is Ricky Fitts.</p>
              <p>RICKYHi, I just moved next door to you. I also go to school with 
                your daughter.</p>
              <p>LESTERWith Jane? Really?</p>
              <p>RICKYYeah. Jane.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNHi(then to Lester)I'm ready to leave. I'll meet you out 
                front. </p>
              <p>And she goes BACK inside.</p>
              <p>LESTERUh-oh. I'm in trouble. Well, nice to meet you, Ricky. Thanks 
                for the, uh, thing.</p>
              <p>RICKYAny time.</p>
              <p>LESTER goes inside.</p>
              <p>RICKY (cont'd)(calls after him)If you want any more, you know 
                where I live.</p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT</p>
              <p>JANE and ANGELA are watching TV. we HEAR the BACK door open.</p>
              <p>JANEOh, God. They're home. Quick, let's go Up to my room.</p>
              <p>JANE switches off the TV and starts UP the stairs.</p>
              <p>ANGELAI should say hi to your dad. (off Jane's look)I don't want 
                to be rude.</p>
              <p>She starts toward the kitchen. JANE comes BACK down thestairs. 
                She doesn't like this.</p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>LESTER enters and opens the refrigerator, surveying thechoices 
                inside.</p>
              <p>ANGELA (O.C.)Nice suit.</p>
              <p>He turns, and is instantly transfixed by:</p>
              <p>His POV: ANGELA leans against the counter, twirling her hair.</p>
              <p>ANGELA (cont'd)You're looking good, Mr. Burnham.(off his look)You 
                look all relaxed. </p>
              <p>She starts toward him</p>
              <p>ANGELA (cont'd)Last time I saw you, you looked kind of wound 
                up.(spots something)Oo, is that root beer?</p>
              <p>She reaches inside the refrigerator to grab a bottle. as shedoes, 
                she moves to place her other hand casually on Lester's shoulder. 
                He sees it coming. Everything SLOWS DOWN, and all sound FADES...</p>
              <p>EXTREME CLOSE UP on her hand as it briefly touches hisshoulder 
                in SLOW MOTION. He HEAR only the amplified BRUSH of her fingers 
                against the fabric of his suit, and its unnatural, hollow ECHO...</p>
              <p>BACK IN Real TIME: she grabs the root beer and looks UP athim; 
                smiling.</p>
              <p>CLOSE on LESTER: his eyes narrow slightly, then:</p>
              <p>He takes the root beer from ANGELA and puts it on thecounter. 
                Then he cups her face in his hands and kisses her roughly. She 
                seems shocked, but doesn't resist as he pulls her toward him with 
                surprising strength.</p>
              <p>He breaks the kiss, looking at her IN awe, then He reaches UPand 
                touches his lips. His eyes widen as he pulls a solitary ROSE PETAL 
                from his mouth right before we SMASH CUT TO:</p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>ANGELA is BACK against the counter, drinking the root beer.Lester 
                stands by the refrigerator, gazing at her, still lost in his fantasy.</p>
              <p>ANGELAI love root beer, don't you?</p>
              <p>JANE watches from the doorway to the FAMILY ROOM, staring ather 
                father and feeling incredibly awkward in her own home. Carolyn 
                enter from the dining room. Lester snaps out of it and grabs a 
                root beer from the refrigerator.</p>
              <p>JANEMom, you remember Angela.</p>
              <p>CAROLYN(her sales smile)Yes, of course!</p>
              <p>JANEI forgot to tell you, she's spending the night. It that okay?</p>

                the wrongway and he starts COUGHING violently. </p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT</p>
              <p>ANGELA lays on the bed, IN her bra and panties, flippingthrough 
                a fashion magazine. Jane, in an oversized T shirt, plays a video 
                game on her computer.</p>
              <p>JANEI'm sorry about my dad.</p>
              <p>ANGELADon't be. I think it's funny.</p>
              <p>JANEYeah, to you, he's just another guy who wants to jump your 
                bones. But to me... he's just too embarrassing to live.</p>
              <p>ANGELAYour mom's the one who's embarrassing. What a phony.</p>
              <p>JANE glances at ANGELA, irritated.</p>
              <p>ANGELA (cont'd)But your dad is actually kind of cute.</p>
              <p>JANEShut up.</p>
              <p>Lester, still in his suit, stands outside Jane's room, his ear 
                up against the door. He can't believe what he's hearing.</p>
              <p>ANGELA (O.C.)He is. If he just worked out a little, he'd be hot.</p>
              <p>JANE (O.C.)Shut up.</p>
              <p>ANGELA (O.C.)Oh, come on. Haven't you ever sneaked a peek at 
                him in his underwear?</p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>ANGELAI bet he's got a big dick.</p>
              <p>JANEYou are so grossing me out. </p>
              <p>ANGELA(really enjoying this)If he built up his chest and arms, 
                I'd totally fuck him.</p>
              <p>JANE covers her ears and starts singing to drown her out.</p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>Lester, still listening, looks like he's about to implode.</p>
              <p>ANGELA (O.C.)(laughs)I would! I would suck your dad's big fat 
                dick, and then I would fuck him 'til his eyes rolled back in his 
                head!(then)What was that noise? Jane.</p>
              <p>Jane's SINGING stops.</p>
              <p>ANGELA (O.C.) (cont'd)I swear I heard something.</p>
              <p>Panicked, LESTER scurries down the hall.</p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>JANEYeah, it was the sound of you being a huge disgusting pig.</p>
              <p>ANGELAI'm serious.</p>
              <p>We HEAR the sharp TAP OF a penny being thrown against glass.</p>
              <p>ANGELA (cont'd)See?</p>
              <p>ANGELA crosses to the window and looks out.</p>
              <p>ANGELA (cont'd)(spots something)Oh my God. Jane</p>
              <p>EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>We see Angela standing at the window in her underwear, looking 
                down at us. Jane joins her and is immediately unnerved by what 
                she sees:</p>
              <p>Their POV: In the Burnham's DRIVEWAY, the word &quot;JANE&quot; 
                is spelled out in FIRE.</p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>JANEWhat is it?</p>
              <p>ANGELAIt's that psycho next door. Jane, what if he worships you? 
                What if he's got a shrine with pictures of you surrounded by dead 
                people's heads and stuff?</p>
              <p>JANEShit. I bet he's filming us right now.</p>
              <p>ANGELA(intrigued)Really?</p>

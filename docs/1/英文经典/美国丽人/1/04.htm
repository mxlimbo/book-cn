              <p>CAROLYN(hugs Jane)Honey, I'm proud of you. I watched you very 
                closely, and you didn't screw up once.(then, to Lester) Okay, 
                we have to go.</p>
              <p>She starts toward the parking lot. LESTER stays behind.</p>
              <p>LESTERWhat are you girls doing now?</p>
              <p>JANEDad.</p>
              <p>ANGELAWe're going out for pizza.</p>
              <p>LESTERWell, can we give you a lift?</p>
              <p>ANGELAThank s, but I have a car.</p>
              <p>LESTERThat's great! Uh, Janie's hoping to get a car soon, aren't 
                you honey?</p>
              <p>JANE(you freak)Dad. Mom's waiting for you , and she look like 
                she's about to start chewing her hair.</p>
              <p>LESTERWell, it's great to meet you, Angela. Any, uh, friend of 
                Janie's is a friend of mine.</p>
              <p>ANGELA smiles at him, fully aware OF the powers she has overhim. 
                He is mesmerized; grateful, even.</p>
              <p>LESTER (cont'd)So... I guess I'll be seeing you around.</p>
              <p>I guess.ANGELA</p>
              <p>LESTER waves awkwardly as He crosses off.</p>
              <p>JANECould he be any more pathetic?</p>
              <p>ANGELAI think it's sweet.(then)And I think he and your mother 
                have not had sex for a long time.</p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - a FEW HOURS LATER</p>
              <p>CLOSE on a solitary red ROSE PETAL as it falls slowly andsilently 
                through the air1 like a feather.</p>
              <p>We're in Lester and Carolyn's room, looking down on their bed 
                from OVERHEAD. Even in sleep, Carolyn still looks determined. 
                Lester, however, is wide awake and stares up at us.</p>
              <p>LESTER (V.O.)It's the weirdest thing.</p>
              <p>The ROSE PETAL drifts into view, landing on his pillow.</p>
              <p>LESTER (V.O.) (cont'd)I feel like I've been in a coma for about 
                twenty years, and I'm just now waking up.</p>
              <p>More ROSE PETALS fall onto the bed.</p>
              <p>LESTER (V.O.) (cont'd)I feel younger... lighter...He smiles UP 
                at...his POV: ANGELA, naked, FLOATS directly above us as if INwater, 
                kicking lazily as a deluge of ROSE PETALS falls around her. Her 
                hair fans out around her head and GLOWS with a subtle, burnished 
                light. She looks down at us with a smile that is all things: compassion... 
                invitation... lust...</p>
              <p>LESTER smiles BACK and LAUGHS, as ROSE PETALS cover his face.</p>

              <p>EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>A WHITE BMW 328si CONVERTIBLE winds its way down the street and 
                pulls close to, but not into, the Burnham's driveway.</p>
              <p>INT. ANGELA'S BMW - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>ANGELA is driving, JANE is IN the passenger seat. both girlsare 
                stoned and LAUGH hysterically. Gradually, their LAUGHTER dies 
                down. Iggy Pop sings &quot;CANDY&quot; on the RADIO.</p>
              <p>JANEI'm sorry my dad was so weird tonight.</p>
              <p>ANGELAIt's okay. I'm used to guys drooling over me.(lights a 
                cigarette)It started when I was about twelve. I'd go out to dinner 
                with my parents. Every Thursday night, Red Lobster. And every 
                guy there would stare at me when I walked in. And I knew what 
                they were thinking. Just like I knew guys at school thought about 
                me when they jerked off...</p>
              <p>JANEVomit.</p>
              <p>ANGELANo I liked it. And I still like it. If people I don't even 
                know look at me and want to fuck me, it means I really have a 
                shot at being a model. Which is great, because there's one thing 
                worse in life than being ordinary.</p>
              <p>An awkward beat. JANE stares at the floor.</p>
              <p>JANEI really think it'll happen for you.</p>
              <p>ANGELAOh, I know. Because everything that was meant to happen, 
                does. Eventually.(then)Maybe I should come in a say good night 
                to your dad.</p>
              <p>The two girls break into a fresh round OF stoned LAUGHTER.</p>
              <p>EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>On VIDEO: JANE gets out OF the CAR, still LAUGHING, and wavesas 
                Angela pulls away. We ZOOM in on Jane as she walks toward the 
                house. She turns suddenly, sensing our presence, and looks directly 
                at us.</p>
              <p>Her POV: We're looking at the pale blue COLONIAL HOUSE next door 
                where the moving van was parked earlier. The front porch is shrouded 
                in darkness... then a PORCH LIGHT abruptly reveals Ricky, perched 
                on a white-washed Adirondack chair, having just turned on the 
                overhead light. As usual, he wears very conservative clothes. 
                There is a BEEPER attached to his belt, and his VIDEO CAMERA dangles 
                loosely around his neck.</p>
              <p>Irritated, JANE stares at him, hard.</p>
              <p>JANEAsshole.</p>
              <p>He looks BACK at her curiously, then raises his VIDEO cameraand 
                starts to videotape her.</p>
              <p>His POV, on VIDEO: JANE, angry and self-conscious, turns andwalks 
                quickly toward her house, flipping us off as she goes.</p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>JANE enters, closes and locks the door, quickly turns off theLIGHT 
                that's been left on for her, then peeks through a window..</p>
              <p>Her POV: The Fitts' porch light is still on, but there's no sign 
                of Ricky.</p>
              <p>Jane starts quietly up the stairs. Then, just as she's almost 
                out of sight, she smiles, a schoolgirl thrilled to discover she's 
                the object of a schoolboy's crush.</p>
              <p>FADE to BLACK.</p>
              <p>FADE IN</p>
              <p>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING</p>
              <p>CLOSE on an ADDRESS BOOK. A man's hand flips to the H page and 
                then his finger runs down the names on it, stopping at the name 
                Angela Hayes...</p>
              <p>Lester, already dressed for work, sits at Jane's desk, going 
                through her address book. We HEAR the SHOWER running in the adjacent 
                bathroom, and Jane SINGING &quot;CANDY&quot; at the top of her 
                lungs. Lester grabs her phone and dials.</p>
              <p>JANE (O.C.)I'VE HAD A HOLE... IN MY HEART... FOR SO LONG...CLOSE 
                on LESTER, with the receiver to his ear, nervous.</p>
              <p>ANGELA (O.C.)(over phone line) Hello? Hello?</p>
              <p>LESTER is frozen, unable to speak. Suddenly, the shower isturned 
                off in the next room, and Jane's singing stops. Lester hangs up 
                and exits quickly. A moment, then the PHONE RINGS. Jane emerges 
                from the bathroom, dripping wet, and answers it.</p>
              <p>JANEHello?</p>
              <p>INT. HAYES HOUSE - ANGELA' S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>ANGELA is sprawled across her bed, on the phone. the walls OFher 
                room are covered with pictures of SUPERMODELS.</p>
              <p>ANGELAWhy'd you call me?</p>
              <p>Intercut with Jane in her bedroom:</p>
              <p>JANEI didn't.</p>
              <p>ANGELAWell, my phone just rung and I answered it and somebody 
                hung up and then I star sixty-nined and it called you back.</p>
              <p>JANEI was in the shower.</p>
              <p>Then JANE notices her ADDRESS book open to the H page.</p>
              <p>JANE (cont'd)Oh, gross </p>
              <p>EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>ON VIDEO: We're across from Jane's WINDOW, peering in. Jane picks 
                up the address book, frowning. She speaks into the one, but we 
                can't hear her.</p>
              <p>WOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.)(sing song)Rick-y! Break-fast!</p>
              <p>INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>Ricky, dressed for school, stands at his open window, videotaping. 
                He lowers his CAMERA, but his eyes remain locked on Jane across 
                the way.</p>
              <p>RICKYBe right there.</p>
              <p>INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER</p>
              <p>BARBARA FITTS stands at the stove, frying bacon. She's in her 
                fifties; pretty, in a slightly childish way. She flips the bacon 
                strips mechanically, her eyes focused elsewhere. Her husband, 
                COLONEL FRANK FITTS (whom we recognize from his run-in with Detective 
                Fleishman at the beginning), sits at a dinette reading The Wall 
                Street 'Journal. They're each off in their own little world, which 
                they vastly prefer to this one, then:</p>
              <p>RICKY(entering)Mom.</p>
              <p>Startled, BARBARA turns to him.</p>
              <p>BARBARAHello.</p>
              <p>RICKYI don't eat bacon, remember?</p>
              <p>BARBARA(unnerved)I must have forgotten. I'm sorry.</p>
              <p>RICKY serves himself scrambled eggs from ANOTHER pan, thenjoins 
                his father at the table.</p>
              <p>RICKYWhat's new in the world, Dad?</p>
              <p>COLONELThis country is going straight to hell.</p>
              <p>RICKYSo nothing's changed.</p>
              <p>A DOORBELL rings. the COLONEL and BARBARA look at eachother, 
                alarmed.</p>
              <p>COLONELAre you expecting anyone?</p>
              <p>BARBARANo.(things)No.</p>
              <p>The COLONEL rises and heads toward the living ROOM, a littlepuffed 
                up. Curious, Ricky follows. Barbara just stands there, frightened.</p>
              <p>INT. FITTS HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>The COLONEL opens the front door to reveal the two JIMS.</p>
              <p>JIM #1Hi.</p>
              <p>JIM #2Welcome to the neighborhood.</p>
              <p>Jim #1 holds out a basket filled with flowers, vegetables and 
                a small white cardboard box tied with raffia.</p>
              <p>JIM #1Just a little something from our garden.</p>
              <p>RICKY watches from the BACK OF the foyer.</p>
              <p>JIM #2Except for the pasta, we got that at Dean and Deluca.</p>
              <p>JIM #1It's unbelievably fresh. You just barely drop it in the 
                water and it's done.</p>
              <p>The COLONEL stares at them, suspicious.</p>
              <p>JIM #1 (cont'd)(offers his hand)I'm Jim Olsen. I live across 
                the street. Welcome to the neighborhood.</p>
              <p>COLONEL(shakes)Colonel Frank Fits, U.S. Marine Corps.</p>
              <p>JIM #1Nice to meet you . And this is my partner...</p>
              <p>JIM #2(offers his hand)Jim Boyd, but my friends call me J.B.</p>
              <p>COLONELLet's cut to the chase, okay? What are you guys selling?</p>
              <p>A beat.</p>
              <p>JIM #2Nothing. We just wanted to say hi to our new neighbors 
                - </p>
              <p>COLONELYeah, yeah, yeah. You said you're partners. So what's 
                your business?</p>
              <p>A beat. the Jims look at each other, then BACK at theColonel.</p>
              <p>JIM #1Well, he's an entertainment lawyer.</p>
              <p>JIM #2And he's an anesthesiologist.</p>
              <p>They're trying not to laugh. The Colonel looks at them, confused, 
                then it dawns on him.</p>
              <p>INT. COLONEL' S FORD EXPLORER - LATER</p>
              <p>The COLONEL drives, staring darkly at the road ahead. IN thepassenger 
                seat, Ricky is using a CALCULATOR and jotting numbers down in 
                a NOTEBOOK.</p>
              <p>COLONEL(suddenly)How come these faggots always have to rub it 
                in your face? How can they be so shameless?</p>
              <p>RICKYThat's the whole thing, Dad. They don't feel like it's anything 
                to be ashamed of.</p>
              <p>The COLONEL looks at RICKY sharply.</p>
              <p>COLONELWell, it is.</p>
              <p>A beat, as RICKY continues his calculations, before Herealizes 
                a response is expected from him. Then:</p>
              <p>RICKYYou're right.</p>
              <p>The Colonel's eyes flash angrily.</p>
              <p>COLONELDon't placate me like I'm your mother, boy.</p>
              <p>RICKY sighs, then looks at his father and speaks with sincerehatred.</p>
              <p>RICKYForgive me sir, for speaking so bluntly, but those fags 
                make me want to puke my fucking guts out. </p>
              <p>The COLONEL is taken aback, But quickly covers.</p>
              <p>COLONELMe too, son. Me too.</p>
              <p>Case closed, RICKY goes BACK to his calculations.</p>
              <p>CLOSE on the pencil in his hands... he's totaling two columns 
                of NUMBERS. Under the column &quot;Income&quot; he writes in swift, 
                bold strokes: $24,950.00.</p>
              <p>EXT. high SCHOOL CAMPUS - a FEW MINUTES LATER</p>
              <p>JANE and ANGELA are seated with two other TEENAGE GIRLS.They're 
                all smoking.</p>
              <p>ANGELAI'm serious, he just yanked it out and showed it to me. 
                You know, like the President did to that woman.</p>
              <p>TEENAGE GIRL #1Gross</p>
              <p>ANGELAIt wasn't gross. It was kind of cool.</p>
              <p>TEENAGE GIRL #1So did you do it with him?</p>
              <p>ANGELAOf course I did. He is a really well-known photographer? 
                He shoots for Elle on like, a regular basis? It would have been 
                so majorly stupid of me to turn him down.</p>
              <p>TEENAGE GIRL #2You are a total prostitute.</p>
              <p>ANGELAHey. That's how things really are. You just don't know, 
                because you're this pampered little suburban chick.</p>
              <p>TEENAGE GIRL #2So are you. You've only been in Seventeen once, 
                and you looked fat, so stop acting like you're goddamn Christy 
                Turlington.</p>
              <p>The two TEENAGE girls move away from JANE and Angela.</p>
              <p>ANGELA(calling off)Cunt!(then)I am so sick of people taking their 
                insecurities out on me.</p>
              <p>The Colonel's Ford Explorer pulls up, and Ricky gets out. The 
                creases on his trousers are sharp enough to cut glass.</p>
              <p>JANEOh my God. That's the pervert who filmed me last night.</p>
              <p>ANGELAHim? No way. Jane, he is a total lunatic.</p>
              <p>JANEYou know him?</p>
              <p>ANGELAHe was in my earth science class in eighth grade, and he 
                always said the creepiest things, and then one day, he was just, 
                like, gone. And then Connie Cardullo told me he his parents had 
                to put him in a mental institution.</p>
              <p>JANEWhy? What did he do?</p>
              <p>ANGELAWhat do you mean?</p>
              <p>JANEWell, they can't put you away just for saying creepy things.</p>
              <p>ANGELA stares at JANE, then her mouth widens into a smile.</p>
              <p>ANGELAYou total slut. You've got a crush on him.</p>
              <p>JANEWhat? Please.</p>
              <p>ANGELAYou were defending him! You love him. You want to have, 
                like, ten thousand of his babies.</p>
              <p>JANEShut up.</p>
              <p>JANE Suddenly finds RICKY standing IN front OF her, lookingat 
                her intensely.</p>
              <p>RICKYHi. My name's Ricky. I just moved next door to you.</p>
              <p>JANEUh, yeah. I know. I kinda remember this really creepy incident 
                when you were filming me last night?</p>
              <p>RICKYI didn't mean to scare you. I just think you're interesting.</p>
              <p>ANGELA shoots a wide-eyed look at JANE, who ignores it.</p>
              <p>JANEThanks, but I really don't need to have some psycho obsessing 
                about me right now.</p>
              <p>RICKYI'm not obsessing. I'm just curious.</p>
              <p>He looks at her intently, his eyes searching hers. JANE isunnerved 
                and has to look away. Ricky smiles and walks off.</p>
              <p>ANGELAWhat a freak. And why does he dress like a Bible salesman?</p>
              <p>JANEHe's like, so confident. That can't be real.</p>
              <p>ANGELAI don't believe him. He didn't even like, look at me once.</p>
              <p>EXT. suburban NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY</p>
              <p>CLOSE on a wooden SIGN that reads:</p>
              <p>Open HOUSE TODAYBURNHAM &amp; ASSOCIATES REALTY555-1618</p>
              <p>Carolyn BURNHAM the SIGN is planted IN front OF a RUN-downHOME 
                in a run-down middle-class neighborhood. The Mercedes-Benz ML320 
                is parked in front of the house. Carolyn, wearing a T-shirt and 
                jeans, unloads a box filled with cleaning supplies, a BOOMBOX 
                and a garment bag from the back. Something across the street catches 
                her eye.</p>
              <p>Her POV: IN front OF a DIFFERENT HOUSE with much More curbappeal 
                is another SIGN, with a picture of the same silver-haired MAN 
                we saw on the bus stop bench earlier. It reads:</p>
              <p>FOR SALECall Leonard Kane - the Real Estate King555-1957</p>
              <p>Carolyn frowns and slams the BACK OF the MERCEDES shut, alittle 
                harder than necessary.</p>
              <p>INT. SALE HOUSE - living ROOM - MOMENTS LATER</p>
              <p>Carolyn enters, hangs her garment bag IN the hall closet andinspects 
                the empty living room. The cathedral ceiling is painted an alarming 
                burnt orange, and the native stone fireplace has shed a couple 
                of stones onto the floor, which she quickly picks up and wedges 
                back into the fireplace.</p>
              <p>CAROLYN(quietly)I will sell this house today.</p>
              <p>She plugs IN the BOOMBOX, presses a button and we HEAR TonyBennett 
                singing &quot;WITH PLENTY OF MONEY AND YOU,&quot; which plays 
                throughout the following</p>
              <p>MONTAGEWe see Carolyn, working with fierce concentration as she:</p>
              <p>Doggedly scrubs countertops in the kitchen; Perches on a stepladder 
                to dust a cheap-looking white ceiling fan in the mater bedroom; 
                Cleans glass doors that overlook the patio and pool; Skims leaves 
                off the surface of the pool; Sweeps the patio with a broom; And 
                vacuums a dirty carpet that will never be clean.</p>
              <p>Throughout all this, she keeps repeating to herself:</p>
              <p>CAROLYNI will sell this house today.I will sell this house today.I 
                will sell this house today...</p>
              <p>She says This as if she believes she can actually will Thishouse 
                into being something more than the dump it is.</p>
              <p>INT. SALE HOUSE - BATHROOM - LATER</p>
              <p>Carolyn stands IN front OF the mirror, Now dressed IN astylish 
                but not-too-formal business suit. She finishes applying lipstick, 
                then stares at her reflection, critically.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNI will sell this house today.</p>
              <p>She says This as if it were a threat, then turns to go. onher 
                way out, she notices a smudge on the glass shower door and pulls 
                off a piece of toilet paper to clean it.</p>

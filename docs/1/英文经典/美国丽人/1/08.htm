              <p>INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY</p>
              <p>CLOSE on a COMPUTER MONITOR: We're in some sort of virtual-reality 
                post-apocalyptic environment. Hideous armed MUTANTS approach from 
                all angles, shooting at us. One by one, they're blown away, their 
                heads EXPLODING in geysers of BLOOD.</p>
              <p>LESTER (O.C.)Take that, alien bitches!</p>
              <p>Lester sits in his cubicle at work, glued to his monitor, feverishly 
                handling a JOYSTICK.</p>
              <p>LESTER (cont'd)Woo-hoo!</p>
              <p>From the surrounding cubicles, his co-workers watch blankly.</p>
              <p>INT. BRAD'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER</p>
              <p>BRAD is seated behind his desk, reading a document. LESTERsits 
                across from him, smiling.</p>
              <p>BRAD(reads)...my job consists of basically masking my contempt 
                for the assholes in charge, and, at least once a day, retiring 
                to the men's room so I can jerk off while I fantasize about a 
                life that doesn't so closely resemble hell.(looks up at Lester)Well, 
                you obviously have no interest in saving yourself.</p>
              <p>LESTER(laughs)I've spent fourteen years being a whore for the 
                advertising industry. The only way I could save myself now is 
                to start firebombing.</p>
              <p>BRADWhatever. Management wants you gone by the end of the day.</p>
              <p>LESTERWhoa. What kind of severance package is &quot;management&quot; 
                prepared to give me? Considering the information I have about 
                our editorial director buying pussy with company money.</p>
              <p>A beat.</p>
              <p>LESTER (cont'd)Which I'm sure would interest the I.R.S., since, 
                technically, it does constitute fraud. And some of our advertisers 
                and rival publications might like to know about it as well. Not 
                to mention Craig's wife.</p>
              <p>A beat. BRAD sighs.</p>
              <p>BRADWhat do you want?</p>
              <p>LESTEROne year's salary, with continued benefits.</p>
              <p>BRADThat's not going to happen.</p>
              <p>LESTERWhat if I throw in a little sexual harassment charge?</p>
              <p>BRAD LAUGHS.</p>
              <p>BRADAgainst who? </p>
              <p>LESTERAgainst you.</p>
              <p>BRAD stops LAUGHING.</p>
              <p>LESTER (cont'd)Can you prove you didn't offer to save my job 
                if I'd let you blow me?</p>
              <p>BRAD leans BACK IN his chair, studying Lester.</p>
              <p>BRADMan. You are one twisted fuck.</p>
              <p>LESTER(standing)Nope. Just an ordinary guy with nothing to lose.</p>
              <p>LESTER starts toward the door, then:</p>
              <p>LESTER (cont'd)I hope you and I can still be friends, Brad. And 
                even though you didn't save my job...(smiling)You can still blow 
                me, asshole.</p>
              <p>And He exits.</p>
              <p>INT. RESTAURANT - the same DAY</p>
              <p>Carolyn sits at a table By herself, lost IN thought. thereare 
                two menus on the table. After a moment, Leonard Kane, the Real 
                Estate King, joins her. Upon seeing him, Carolyn immediately becomes 
                warm and gracious.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNLeonard.</p>
              <p>LEONARDCarolyn.</p>
              <p>Carolyn smiles, genuinely touched THAT He remembers her name.</p>
              <p>LEONARD (cont'd)I'm so sorry I kept you waiting. Christy left 
                for New York this morning, and... let's just say things were very 
                hectic around my house.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNWhat's she doing in New York?</p>
              <p>LEONARDShe's moving there.(off Carolyn's look)We're splitting 
                up.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNLeonard. I'm so sorry.</p>
              <p>She places her hand on his, Suddenly deeply concerned.</p>
              <p>LEONARD(bitterly)Yes, according to her1 I'm too focused on my 
                career. As if being driven to succeed is some sort of character 
                flaw. Of course, she certainly took advantage of the lifestyle 
                my success afforded her(then laughing)Believe me, it's for the 
                best.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNBut when I saw you two at the party the other night, you 
                seemed perfectly happy.</p>
              <p>LEONARDWell, call me crazy, but... it's my philosophy that to 
                actually be successful, one must project an image of success, 
                at all times.</p>
              <p>He smiles, then opens his menu. Carolyn picks hers UPmechanically, 
                but continues to stare at him, enraptured, like a fervent Christian 
                who's just come face to face with Jesus.</p>
              <p>EXT. high SCHOOL CAMPUS - LATER THAT DAY</p>
              <p>Students pour out OF the BUILDING at the end OF the day. wefollow 
                Jane and Angela as they head toward the parking lot. A handsome 
                teenage JOCK walks past them.</p>
              <p>JOCK(to Angela, grabbing his crotch)Just say the word, baby, 
                and it's yours.</p>
              <p>ANGELAGreat. Wrap it up and I'll take it home. Oh, and I'd like 
                thin slices, please.</p>
              <p>JOCK(laughs)You know you want it, you stuck-up bitch.</p>
              <p>And he's gone.</p>
              <p>JANEWhat is with you? Everyone I know is dying to do it with 
                him.</p>
              <p>ANGELAOh, please. I would totally fall asleep. Trust me, Jane, 
                once you've fucked that black guy who does the Polo ads, you're 
                a little spoiled.</p>
              <p>She spots something and grabs Jane's arm.</p>
              <p>JANEOw.</p>
              <p>ANGELALook.</p>

              <p>ANGELAWhy?</p>
              <p>RICKY (O.C.)Because it's beautiful.</p>
              <p>On VIDEO: ANGELA looks at JANE, trying not to laugh.</p>
              <p>ANGELAI think maybe you forgot your medication today, mental 
                boy.</p>
              <p>On VIDEO: she falls out OF frame as we ZOOM IN on Jane.</p>
              <p>RICKY (O.C.)Hi, Jane.</p>
              <p>JANE(uncomfortable)Look. I want you to stop filming me.</p>
              <p>RICKY lowers the CAMERA.</p>
              <p>RICKYOkay.</p>
              <p>He looks at her, curious, his eyes searching hers. shefinally 
                has to look away.</p>
              <p>ANGELAHey, I have an idea! Let's all go to the mall together.(off 
                Jane's look)He can film us doing things.</p>

              <p>ANGELAI don't know.(to Ricky, suggestive)What kind of things 
                do you like to film?</p>

              <p>ANGELAOkay. We can take my car.</p>
              <p>ANGELA starts off. JANE looks doubtful, But follows.</p>

              <p>EXT. Top HAT MOTEL - the same DAY</p>
              <p>Carolyn's Mercedes-Benz ML320 is parked next to a forest green 
                JAGUAR CONVERTIBLE with a VANITY LICENSE PLATE that reads &quot;R 
                E KING.&quot;</p>
              <p>INT. Top HAT MOTEL - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>Carolyn and Leonard are in the middle of sex. Dramatic, pyrotechnic, 
                vocal sex.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNYes! Oh, God, yes!</p>
              <p>LEONARDYou like getting nailed by the king?</p>
              <p>CAROLYNYes! I love it! Oh, yes! Fuck me, your majesty!</p>
              <p>INT. TOYOTA CAMRY - the same DAY</p>
              <p>LESTER drives, smoking a joint. He SINGS along to theBeatles' 
                &quot;GOT TO GET YOU INTO MY LIFE&quot; on the STEREO.</p>
              <p>LESTERI WAS ALONE, I TOOK A RIDE, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD 
                FIND THERE... ANOTHER ROAD, WHERE MAYBE I COULD SEE ANOTHER KIND 
                OF MIND THERE...</p>
              <p>He trails off, as something outside catches his attention:</p>
              <p>His POV: A FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT called SMILEY'S. The logo on 
                the sign features a yellow SMILEY-FACE with a red tongue licking 
                its smiling lips. Underneath it, plastic letters spell out: NOW 
                TAKING APPLICATIONS.</p>
              <p>Lester's face suddenly takes on a far-away expression.</p>
              <p>INT. SMILEY'S - MOMENT LATER</p>
              <p>A slightly overweight TEENAGE GIRL mans the counter; behind her, 
                a couple of slow-moving teenagers work... vaguely. They all wear 
                bright yellow uniforms and white BASEBALL CAPS which feature the 
                SMILEY'S logo. Lester enters, straightening his tie, and crosses 
                to the counter.</p>
              <p>COUNTER GIRL (zombie like)Smile, you're at Smiley's Would you 
                like to try our new bacon and egg fajita, just a dollar twenty-nine 
                for a limited time only?</p>
              <p>LESTERActually, I'd like to fill out an application.</p>
              <p>She stares at him, confused By his age and attire.</p>
              <p>COUNTER GIRLThere's not jobs for manager, it's just for counter.</p>
              <p>LESTERGood. I'm looking for the least possible amount of responsibility.</p>
              <p>INT. SMILEY'S - LATER</p>
              <p>LESTER sits at a booth with the MANAGER, a greasy kid wearinga 
                white short sleeve shirt and a tie covered with the Smiley's logo. 
                He looks over Lester's application baffled.</p>
              <p>MANAGERI don't think you'd fit in here.</p>
              <p>LESTERI have fast food experience.</p>
              <p>MANAGERYes, like twenty years ago.</p>
              <p>LESTERWell, I'm sure there have been amazing technological advancements 
                in the industry, but... surely you have some sort of training 
                process. It seems unfair to presume I won't be able to learn.</p>
              <p>The Manger frowns, unconvinced.</p>
              <p>LESTER (cont'd)Should you choose not to hire me, I have to assume 
                it's because of my age, which I can only interpret as discrimination 
                and would have to take up with my attorney.</p>
              <p>The Manager sighs and runs an hand through his greasy hair, wondering 
                what he could possibly have done to deserve this. </p>
              <p>EXT. HIGHWAY - LATER</p>

              <p>ON VIDEO: Angela is driving; Jane is in the passenger seat. We're 
                watching from the back as they pass a JOINT. Angela spots us in 
                the REAR VIEW MIRROR and turns back to us.</p>
              <p>ANGELAHi. I'm Angela, and welcome to my car. My guest today is 
                Jane Burnham. Jane, why don't you tell us about yourself?</p>
              <p>JANENo</p>
              <p>ANGELAOh, come on.(a pointed look to us)I'm sure our audience 
                wants to know all about you.</p>
              <p>JANEAngela, look out!ANGELA turns BACK around to see THAT traffic 
                has Suddenlybacked up in front of her. She slams on the BRAKES.</p>
              <p>EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>Angela's BMW SCREECHES to halt, almost colliding with the car 
                in front of her.</p>
              <p>INT. ANGELA'S BMW - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>ANGELA and JANE sit there, stunned, breathing heavily. RICKYseems 
                completely unaffected.</p>
              <p>RICKYWhat's going on?</p>
              <p>JANEI think there's been a wreck.</p>
              <p>RICKYReally? A big one?</p>
              <p>He rolls down a window, then starts to climb out OF it.</p>
              <p>ANGELAWhat are you doing?</p>
              <p>EXT. ANGELA'S BMW - CONTINUOUS</p>
              <p>RICKY hangs out OF the CAR window, focusing his VIDEO cameraas

              <p>On VIDEO: over the roofs OF the cars IN front OF us, we seethe 
                flashing LIGHTS of police cars and an ambulance, as well as FLARES 
                on the pavement. One car is completely totaled, and PARAMEDICS 
                are utilizing MACHINERY to release the driver.</p>
              <p>BACK on RICKY, hanging out the window.</p>

              <p>ANGELAWhat the fuck is he talking about?</p>
              <p>They're pulling up alongside the accident now. Jane cranes her 
                neck to look.</p>
              <p>Her POV: the paramedics pull the bloody, broken BODY OF ayoung 
                man out of the car.</p>
              <p>JANE(disgusted)Oh God.</p>

              <p>Past the accident Now, They return to normal speed with therest 
                of the traffic. Ricky climbs back into the car.</p>
              <p>RICKYThat was amazing.</p>
              <p>JANE(snort)What was amazing about it?</p>
              <p>A beat.</p>
              <p>RICKYWhen you see something like that, it's like God is looking 
                right at you, just for a second. And if you're careful, you can 
                look right back. </p>
              <p>ANGELA rolls her eyes. But JANE looks at RICKY, intrigued.</p>
              <p>JANEAnd what do you see?</p>
              <p>RICKYBeauty.</p>
              <p>JANE(after a beat)Is it only dead things?</p>
              <p>RICKY seems surprised By This question.</p>
              <p>RICKYNo. Not at all. No, it's everywhere. You just have to be 
                open to it.</p>
              <p>He looks at her, curious, his eyes searching hers. This time, 
                she doesn't look away. He smiles. Jane almost smiles back... then:</p>
              <p>JANE(to Angela)You know what? Let's bag the mall. It's boring.</p>
              <p>She glances BACK over her shoulder at RICKY and smiles.</p>
              <p>ANGELAWhatever.(to Ricky)Hey, turn that camera back on, and do

              <p>Carolyn and Leonard are IN bed, post-sex, eating Clubsandwiches 
                from room service.</p>
              <p>CAROLYNThat was exactly what I needed. The royal treatment, so 
                to speak.</p>
              <p>She HOWLS, as if This were the funniest thing ever said.</p>
              <p>CAROLYN (cont'd)I was soooo stressed out.</p>
              <p>LEONARDKnow what I do when I get that way?</p>
              <p>Carolyn sits UP FOR This, eager to learn from the master.</p>
              <p>LEONARD (cont'd)I fire a gun.</p>
              <p>CAROLYN(intrigued)Really.</p>
              <p>LEONARDYep. I go to this little firing range downtown, pop off 
                a few rounds, and it always makes me feel better.</p>
              <p>CAROLYN(embarrassed)I've never fired a gun before.</p>
              <p>LEONARDOh, you have to try it. Nothing makes you feel more powerful.</p>
              <p>He grins, then reaches FOR her.</p>
              <p>LEONARD(cont'd)Well, almost nothing.</p>
              <p>Carolyn GASPS as his hand reach her neck. She's living some kind 
                of dream here, and she makes her most seductive face as he pulls 
                her to him...</p>
              <p>INT. RECORD STORE - the same DAY</p>

                BASEBALL CAP, approaches the checkout counter with a stack of 
                about twenty CDs. The CLERK, a young, trendy kid wearing a BACKWARD 
                BASEBALL CAP, starts going through the CDs. We see the covers 
                as he scans them: The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, 
                Jimi Hendrix...</p>

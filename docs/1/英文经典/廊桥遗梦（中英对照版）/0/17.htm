            <p> EXT. IOWA LAKEFRONT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Michael and Carolyn have parked in a secluded area near a <br>
              lake. Some place where the moonlight and the scenery create <br>
              a beautiful backdrop. They sit on the ground, leaving the <br>
              headlights and the radio on. They are getting drunk sharing <br>
              a bottle of whiskey.</p>
            <p> MICHAEL<br>
              I used to love this place. I used to <br>
              take Kathy Reynolds down here.</p>
            <p> CAROLYN<br>
              You never dated Kathy Reynolds!</p>
            <p> MICHAEL<br>
              Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall <br>
              were pinned at birth. But I was crazy <br>
              about her. And for about three months, <br>
              I managed to catch her during her <br>
              &quot;exploring&quot; stage.</p>
            <p> CAROLYN<br>
              I never knew that.</p>
            <p> MICHAEL<br>
              (sadly)<br>
              Nobody did.</p>
            <p> CAROLYN<br>
              Was this during Betty?</p>
            <p> MICHAEL<br>
              Everything was during Betty. God we <br>
              were so young. Why did we think we <br>
              had to do it all so fast? I've never <br>
              cheated on Betty. Not once we were <br>
              married, I mean.</p>
            <p> CAROLYN<br>
              Did we want to?</p>
            <p> MICHAEL<br>
              Only about a thousand times. What do <br>
              I do now? &quot;What's good enough for mom <br>
              is good enough for me?&quot;</p>
            <p> CAROLYN<br>
              (pissed off)<br>
              What gets me is I'm 46 years old. <br>
              I've been in this crummy fucking <br>
              marriage -</p>
            <p> MICHAEL<br>
              Carolyn!</p>
            <p> CAROLYN<br>
              (ignores him)<br>
              -- for over twenty years because <br>
              that's what I was taught -- you stick <br>
              with it! Normal people don't get <br>
              divorced. I can't remember the last <br>
              time my husband made love to me so <br>
              intensely that he transported me to <br>
              Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite <br>
              frankly, I don't think he ever did! <br>
              And now I find out in between bake <br>
              sales, my mother was Anais Nin!</p>
            <p> MICHAEL<br>
              What about me! I feel really weird. <br>
              Like she cheated on me, not dad. <br>
              Isn't that sick? I don't mean I <br>
              wanted to sleep with her or anything <br>
              but -- ya know -- being the only son. <br>
              You're sort of made to feel like <br>
              you're the prince of the kingdom, ya <br>
              know? And in the back of your mind, <br>
              you kind of think your mother doesn't <br>
              need sex anymore because she has you.</p>
            <p> CAROLYN<br>
              You're right -- that is sick.</p>
            <p> They drink.</p>
            <p> MICHAEL<br>
              If she was so unhappy, why didn't she <br>
              leave?</p>
            <p> They look to each other without an answer. Then simultaneously 
              <br>
              they reach for the notebooks.</p>
            <p> MICHAEL (cont'd)<br>
              Can I read it now? I think I'm ready.</p>
            <p> Carolyn offers him the book then lays back in a relaxed <br>
              position in order to listen. Michael flips to an ear marked <br>
              page.</p>
            <p> MICHAEL (cont'd)<br>
              What paragraph were you up to?</p>
            <p> CAROLYN<br>
              (casually)<br>
              She just made him perform oral sex on <br>
              the porch.</p>
            <p> Michael freezes. He loses his nerve. Carolyn helps.</p>
            <p> CAROLYN (cont'd)<br>
              Go ahead, Michael. You've got to do <br>
              this. Just think, &quot;Today I am a man.&quot;</p>
            <p> Michael nods and takes another swig. He reads:</p>
            <p> MICHAEL<br>
              &quot;I'd never had a man make love to me <br>
              that way before.&quot;<br>
              (stops)<br>
              Oh Jesus.<br>
              (continues)<br>
              &quot;I couldn't believe the feelings <br>
              bursting inside of me. As if I had <br>
              opened some forbidden Pandora's box.&quot;</p>
            <p> Camera begins to move to wide angle as Francesca takes over.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              &quot;It seems, thinking about it now, <br>
              that in those few days I lived a <br>
              completely different life as a <br>
              completely different woman. What was <br>
              recognizable as me before Robert was <br>
              gone. We decided to spend Wednesday <br>
              away from Winterset. Away from <br>
              Madison County. Away from pastures <br>
              and bridges and people too familiar <br>
              and reminders too painful. We let the <br>
              day take us where it wanted...&quot;</p>
            <p> 1965</p>
            <p> INT. DES MOINES MOVIE THEATER - DAY</p>
            <p> VIVIEN LEIGH is walking down a ships stairs in the 1965 film <br>
              &quot;SHIP OF FOOLS.&quot; She is alone on screen. She walks, slightly 
              <br>
              intoxicated. Suddenly, Charleston music plays out of nowhere <br>
              and she begins to dance, by herself, without any self-<br>
              consciousness.</p>
            <p> In the movie theatre, Robert sits with his arm around <br>
              Francesca like teenage lovers. Her head is nestled in his <br>
              chest as she eats from a bag of popcorn. Robert barely keeps <br>
              his eyes on the screen, staring at Francesca and stroking her <br>
              hair.</p>
            <p> EXT. DOWNTOWN DES MOINES STREET - DAY</p>
            <p> Francesca and Robert walk hand-in-hand, window shopping and <br>
              taking in the sights. For Francesca, it is as if she is <br>
              seeing everything for the first time.</p>
            <p> INT. BOOK STORE - DAY</p>
            <p> Robert introduces Francesca to the photography section, <br>
              showing her a book of one of his favorite photographers, <br>
              Walker Evans. Francesca admires one photograph in particular <br>
              -- a mother and child during the depression.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              On that one is beautiful. Look at <br>
              their expressions. As if the camera <br>
              weren't on them at all. As if they <br>
              had no strength left to hide what <br>
              they were feeling.</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              He's a genius. They're not <br>
              photographs -- they're stories, entire <br>
              histories captured in moments.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              I bet you could do a book.</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              No. I couldn't.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              Why do you say that?</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              Because I already tried once.</p>
            <p> Francesca is surprised. She senses his disappointment.</p>
            <p> ROBERT (cont'd)<br>
              It's no big deal. I know how to work <br>
              a camera, how to make it &quot;make <br>
              pictures&quot; -- but I don't know how to <br>
              make it make art.<br>
              (laughs)<br>
              At least that's what six publishers <br>
              said. To take what we see of this <br>
              world and give it back with a bit of <br>
              ourselves in it. It's a mystery to me.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              (smiles, supportive)<br>
              But you don't mind.</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              (smiles)<br>
              No, I don't mind.</p>
            <p> She brushes his hair away from his face affectionately. As he 
              <br>
              looks at another book, she notices their reflection in a <br>
              mirror. She puts her arm through his. They look like a couple <br>
              to her -- two people who belong together.</p>
            <p> INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - DAY</p>
            <p> Francesca and Robert have an elegant lunch.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              What were you like when you were <br>
              younger?</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              (smiles)<br>
              Trouble. Why?</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              (laughs)<br>
              I just wondered. Why were you trouble?</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              I had a temper.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              What were your parents like?</p>
            <p> Pause. Robert doesn't reply. She looks at him curiously.</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              I can't do this, honey.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              Try and live a lifetime before <br>
              Friday. Cram it all in.<br>
              (shakes his head)</p>
            <p> This is the first time either has mentioned their time clock. 
              <br>
              Francesca nods, understandingly.</p>
            <p> Across the room, Francesca notices A MOTHER having dessert <br>
              with her FIVE-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, a pretty little girl in a <br>
              fancy yellow dress. The mother rises and exits to the ladies <br>
              room while the little girl continues eating a large sundae.</p>
            <p> Francesca smiles. As the girl licks a spoon of fudge, she <br>
              sees Francesca looking at her and smiles back. Robert watches <br>
              the silent exchange as he eats. Francesca makes a funny face <br>
              at her. The little girl giggles as she spoons more ice-cream. <br>
              Unfortunately, she spoons too much and the ice-cream falls on <br>
              her pretty dress. She tries to take it off her, but she slips <br>
              through her fingers and stains her even more. She looks at <br>
              Francesca as if she's about to cry. Francesca smiles.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              Excuse me a minute.</p>
            <p> Robert watches her cross to the little girl and kneel beside <br>
              her. He sees her consoling the little girl while taking a <br>
              napkin and dabbing it in the water glass.</p>
            <p> She helps the girl carefully wipe away the mess, all the <br>
              while calming her. The mother re-enters the scene and shakes <br>
              her head at her daughter. The daughter is afraid of being <br>
              reproached but the mother is smiling. She and Francesca begin <br>
              talking. She thanks Francesca. Robert sees the two mothers <br>
              exchanging a moment of common experience and brief <br>
              friendship. The mother and daughter take their leave as <br>
              Francesca says goodbye and returns to the table. Robert looks <br>
              at her lovingly. Francesca returns to her meal, but suddenly <br>
              she is no longer hungry. Robert senses something is upsetting <br>
              her.</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              You're somewhere else, where?</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              Just that it's been a perfect day and <br>
              that I'd like to skip my fancy <br>
              dessert and go home after this.</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              Uh-huh. And?</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              (beat)<br>
              You're right, you know. We don't have <br>
              much time.</p>
            <p> Uncomfortable silence hangs between them. A waiter passes by.</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              Check, please.</p>
            <p> OS, as the MOTHER YELLS:</p>
            <p> MOTHER<br>
              REBECCA! REBECCA!</p>
            <p> Both Robert and Francesca look to the voice.</p>

            <p><font face="宋体">　　理查德买到了他的零件,和别的男人在咖啡馆喝咖啡,她趁这个时候到副食店采购.他知道她的日程,在她完事时在&quot;精品&quot;店门前等她,见到她就跳了出来,戴着他的阿利斯-查默斯鸭舌帽,帮着她把各种袋子放进福特牌小卡车里,放在座位上.围着的膝盖,而她却想到了三脚架和背包.我还得赶快到工具店去一趟,还有一样零件我忘了买,可能要用的.</font></p>
            <p><font face="宋体">　　他们在第一百六十九号国家公路上往北驶,那是温特塞特的主要道路.在德士古加油站一街之遥的地方她看见哈里正从油泵驶开去,刮水器来回刮着,正驶向他们前头的路上.</font></p>
            <p><font face="宋体">　　他们的车速把他们带到紧跟那辆旧卡车后面.她坐在福特车里高高的座位上可以看见前面车子里一个黑色防雨布包得紧紧,勾画出一只衣箱和一只吉他琴匣的轮廓,紧挨一条备用轮胎,后窗溅满了雨,但是还可以看见他半个脑袋.他弯下身去好像要在杂物箱里取些什么.八天前他也做过同样的动作,他的胳膊擦过她的腿.而就在一星期前,她曾到得梅因去买了一件粉色连衣裙.那辆卡车离家可够远的,对了,我敢肯定那是他们在咖啡馆里谈论的那个摄影师.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="宋体">　　他们跟着罗伯特.金凯向北行,过了好几条街,到一百六十九号公路与东西行的九十二号公路交叉处.那是四向道路的中心点,密集的车辆向着各个方向交叉而行,由于雨和雾更增加了困难.雨更大,雾更浓了.</font></p>
            <p><font face="宋体">　　他们大概停了二十秒钟.他就在前头,离她只有三十英尺.她还可做这件事.跳出车出跑到哈里的右门边,爬进去,抓过那背包,冷藏箱和三脚架.</font></p>
            <p><font face="宋体">　　自从罗伯特.金凯上星期五从她身边离去后,她才意识到,不管她原来自以为对他多么一往情深,她还是大大低估了自己的感情.这看来似乎不可能,但是真的.她开始理解他早已理解的事情.</font></p>
            <p><font face="宋体">　　但是,她还是端坐不动,她的责任把她冻结在那里,眼睛死死地盯着那扇后窗,她一生中从来没有这样死盯着任何东西看过.他的在车灯亮了,再一瞬间他就从此一去不复返了,理查德在摆弄这辆福特车里的收音机.</font></p>
            <p><font face="宋体">　　她开始看到慢镜头,是脑子里一种奇特的作用....慢慢地....慢慢地他把哈里开到道路交叉处-她可以想见他的两条长腿,踩着油门和离合器,想见他胳傅上肌肉在换挡时屈伸的景象-现在向左转弯到九十二号公路向布勒夫斯会议厅开去,向黑山岗开去,向西北...慢慢地....慢慢地....那辆旧卡车转过弯来,它慢慢地穿过交叉路口向西驶去.</font></p>
            <p><font face="宋体">　　他拐弯时为看清楚一点,把车窗放下.他已经完成转弯了,她可以看见他在九十二号公路上开始加速时头发随风飘起.他向西驶去,边开车边摇上窗户哦,基督-哦,耶酥基督,全能的上帝....别!该留下....可是我不能走....让我再告诉你一遍.....为什么我不能走....你再告诉我一遍,为什么我应该走.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="宋体">　　她听见他的声音从大路上传来.&quot;在一个充满混沌不清的宇宙中,这样明确的事只出现一次,不论你活几生几世,以后永不会出现.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="宋体">　　理查德把车开过交叉路口向北驶去.她望着哈里的尾灯在雨和雾中消失,心中搜寻着他的一瞬间的面孔.那辆旧雪佛莱小卡车在一辆巨大的拖车旁边显得很小,那拖车咆哮着向温特塞特,溅起一阵水珠从那最后的牛仔头上洒过.&quot;再见,罗伯特.金凯.&quot;她轻轻说道,然后公然地哭了.</font></p>
            <p><font face="宋体">　　理查德别过头来看她.&quot;怎么啦,弗兰妮?求求你告诉我你到底怎么了,好不好?&quot;理查德,我只需要自己呆一会儿,过几分钟就会好的.</font></p>
            <p><font face="宋体">　　理查德把收音机转到畜情报告节目,转过来看看她,摇摇头.</font></p>

            <p> Beat. Awkward silence. Suddenly there is tension between them.</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              My mistake. I apologize.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              What made you ask such a question?</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              I thought that's what we were <br>
              doing -- asking questions.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              (defensive)<br>
              I thought we were just having a <br>
              conversation. You seem to be reading <br>
              all this meaning into it. Meanings I <br>
              must be too simple to, uh... <br>
              interpret or something.</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              I already apologized.</p>
            <p> Silence. Robert remains seated. Francesca remains at the sink.</p>
            <p> ROBERT (cont'd)<br>
              It's getting late.<br>
              (rises)<br>
              Thank you for dinner.</p>
            <p> Pause. Francesca feels badly.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              Listen, I'm sorry I --</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. <br>
              It was an inappropriate thing to ask.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              (shrugs it off, then:)<br>
              ... I feel like something's been <br>
              spoiled now.</p>
            <p> Robert smiles and crosses to her. He takes her hand into both 
              <br>
              his hands.</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              It's been a perfect evening. Just the <br>
              way it is. Thank you.</p>
            <p> Francesca smiles. The possibility of a kiss hangs in the air <br>
              between them until Robert turns to get his film out of the <br>
              fridge. As he exits through the screen door, he stops.</p>
            <p> ROBERT (cont'd)<br>
              One thing though -- don't kid yourself, <br>
              Francesca. You're anything but a <br>
              simple woman.</p>
            <p> He smiles and exits, catching the screen door before it <br>
              slams.</p>
            <p> Francesca doesn't move for a moment, then crosses to the door 
              <br>
              as if to run after him when she is stopped by the PHONE <br>
              RINGING. She picks up.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              Hello?</p>
            <p> RICHARD (on phone)<br>
              Franny?</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              Richard, hi.</p>
            <p> RICHARD (on phone)<br>
              How are you?</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              Fine. Everyone settled in okay?</p>
            <p> RICHARD (on phone)<br>
              Just fine. We're all in one room. <br>
              Michael's on the couch and <br>
              Carolyn's...<br>
              (continues...)</p>
            <p> She hears Robert's truck door open and close. She hears the <br>
              motor being turned on. She half-listens to Richard.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA<br>
              Uh-uh... good... Hmmm...</p>
            <p> She hears the truck driving away as Richard continues:</p>
            <p> RICHARD (on phone)<br>
              We got our position in the Fair. Not <br>
              bad although I would have liked to be <br>
              third which is not too early and not <br>
              too late. But I told Carolyn not to <br>
              worry...<br>
              (continues, if needed)</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> INT. FRANCESCA BEDROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Francesca exits her bathroom, in her bathrobe, shutting the <br>
              light. She is brushing her hair and thinking of Robert. She <br>
              sits on the edge of the bed. She sees her reflection in a <br>
              mirror on the closet door.</p>
            <p> She stands and takes her robe off. She steps forward to look <br>
              at her body -- running her hands gently around her curves, her <br>
              neck, down the side of her thighs, her face, her breasts.</p>
            <p> She shuts off the lights and gets into bed under the covers. <br>
              She closes her eyes and tentatively begins to explore her <br>
              body. It is awkward for her but we can see her trying to let <br>
              herself go. Until she opens her eyes in frustration. It's no <br>
              good. She can't do it. She feels ashamed. The shame turns <br>
              into anger.</p>
            <p> INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Francesca sits at a writing table with two large books opened 
              <br>
              before her containing literary quotations. She searches for <br>
              the line Robert mentioned in the pasture.</p>
            <p> A note sits before her as well. On it reads: &quot;Robert. Again, 
              <br>
              I'm sorry for last night. Would you like supper again tonight <br>
              after you're finished. I'd like it very much if I were one of <br>
              those good friends you have in the world. Anytime is fine -- <br>
              Francesca... P.S. By the way, &quot;Of what I call God and Fools 
              <br>
              call Nature&quot; was...&quot; She writes the name BROWNING.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> EXT. ROSEMAN BRIDGE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Francesca is tacking a note for Robert to the bridge. She <br>
              considers taking it down a moment later, but decides not to. <br>
              She gets back into her truck and drives away.</p>
            <p> WIDE ANGLE OF BRIDGES - DAWN</p>
            <p> DISSOLVE TO:</p>
            <p> The view of the bridge goes in and out of focus until we <br>
              realize we are seeing it through Robert's camera lens.</p>
            <p> Once the focus it sets, Robert notices something is tacked <br>
              onto the bridge. He crosses to it hurriedly -- time for the <br>
              perfect shot is running out -- pulls it down, thumbtack and <br>
              all, and shoves it into his pocket, unread. He returns to <br>
              his camera to take his shots.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p> INT. JOHNSON BEDROOM - MORNING</p>
            <p> Francesca is making her bed when she hears a truck driving <br>
              down the road. She looks out the window to see:</p>
            <p> Robert's truck. However, it passes right by her house.</p>
            <p> Francesca's spirit sinks. She feels silly, ashamed and <br>
              rejected. She sits on the bed.</p>
            <p> FANTASY:</p>
            <p> Inside the truck, Robert drives by the house and chuckles to <br>
              himself at the foolishness of some boring, frustrated <br>
              housewife. Francesca's note has been crumbled and stuffed <br>
              into a dirty ashtray.</p>
            <p> END OF FANTASY:</p>
            <p> Francesca enters her bathroom, slamming the door behind her.</p>
            <p> INT. KITCHEN - LATER THAT MORNING</p>
            <p> Francesca sits at the kitchen table in her bathrobe with a <br>
              cup of coffee -- a comic portrait of shame and self-pity. Her <br>
              hair is a mess, she hasn't showered or dressed and she stares <br>
              into space while listening to the bluesy Chicago radio <br>
              station.</p>
            <p> The sink is full of dirty dishes she refuses to clean. Beside 
              <br>
              it is an ashtray of butts from the night before. She carries <br>
              it over to the table and begins fingering for a butt to <br>
              smoke in desperation. She lights up and stares into space.</p>
            <p> FANTASY:</p>
            <p> Robert is in Africa talking to TWO ZULU TRIBE MEMBERS. THE <br>
              DIALOGUE IS SUBTITLED IN SWAHILI:</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              (laughs)<br>
              ... and then she tacks this note on <br>
              the bridge asking me to have dinner <br>
              with her again!</p>
            <p> One Zulu turns to the tower and remarks.</p>
            <p> ZULU<br>
              How pathetic.</p>
            <p> END OF FANTASY:</p>
            <p> Francesca put out her cigarette and suddenly gets an idea. <br>
              She goes to the phone, reads a number off of a slip of paper <br>
              and dials.</p>
            <p> FRANCESCA (on phone)<br>
              Hello? Is Richard Johnson staying <br>
              there?... No, I don't want to leave <br>
              a message. Maybe you can help me -- <br>
              I'm his wife and I live in Winterset <br>
              Iowa -- I wanted to surprise them by <br>
              driving up tonight. What would be the <br>
              fastest route, the Interstate?... Huh-<br>
              huh... Hold it, let me get a pen.</p>

            <p><font face="宋体">　　妇女杂志正在谈论这些事,女人们开始不仅对自己生活中卧室里发生的事情有所期待,而且对自己在更大范围的设计图中的地位也有所期待.像理查德这样的男人-她猜想大多数男人-受到这捉期待的威胁.从某种意义上讲,女人正在要求男人们既是诗人同时又是勇猛而热情奔放的情人.</font></p>
            <p><font face="宋体">　　女人看不出二者之间有什么矛盾,男人们却认为是矛盾的.他们生活中的更衣室,男人的晚会,弹子房和男女分开的聚会都定出一套男性的特点,这里面是容不下诗间或者任何含蓄细致的情调的.所以,如果性爱是一种细致的感情,本身是一种艺术-弗朗西丝卡认为是的-那么,在他们的生活结构中是不存在的.于是男女双方在巧妙的互相应付中继续过着同床异梦的生活.与此同时女人们在麦迪逊县的漫漫长夜只有面壁叹息.</font></p>

            <p><font face="宋体">　　她在镜台前转过来又转过去打量自己.她想,我已是尽力而为了,然后又高兴地说出声,&quot;不过还是挺不错的.&quot;</font></p>

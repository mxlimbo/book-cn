              <p>Red finds Andy sitting in the shadow of the high stone wall, 
                poking listlessly through the dust for small pebbles. Red waits 
                for some acknowledgment. Andy doesn't even look up. Red hunkers 
                down and joins him. Nothing is said for the longest time. And 
                then, softly:</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know. Like a closed book.<br>
                Complained about it all the time.<br>
                (pause)<br>
                She was beautiful. I loved her. But I guess I couldn't show it 
                enough.<br>
                (softly)<br>
                I killed her, Red.</p>
              <p>Andy finally glances to Red, seeking a reaction. Silence.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I didn't pull the trigger. But I drove her away. That's why she 
                died. Because of me, the way I am.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                That don't make you a murderer. Bad husband, maybe.</p>
              <p>Andy smiles faintly in spite of himself. Red gives hisshoulder 
                a squeeze.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Feel bad about it if you want. But you didn't pull the trigger.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                No. I didn't. Someone else did, and I wound up here. Bad luck, 
                I guess.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Bad luck? Jesus.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                It floats around. Has to land on somebody. Say a storm comes through. 
                Some folks sit in their living rooms and enjoy the rain. The house 
                next door gets torn out of the ground and smashed flat. It was 
                my turn, that's all. I was in the path of the tornado.<br>
                (softly)<br>
                I just had no idea the storm would go on as long as it has.<br>
                (glances to him)<br>
                Think you'll ever get out of here?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Sure. When I got a long white beard and about three marbles left<br>
                rolling around upstairs.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Tell you where I'd go. Zihuatanejo.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Zihuatanejo?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Mexico. Little place right on the Pacific. You know what the exicans<br>
                say about the Pacific? They say it has no memory. That's where 
                I'd<br>
                like to finish out my life, Red. A warm place with no memory. 
                Open a<br>
                little hotel right on the beach. Buy some worthless old boat and 
                fix it up like new. Take my guests out charter fishing.<br>
                (beat)<br>
                You know, a place like that, I'd need a man who can get things.</p>
              <p>Red stares at Andy, laughs.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Jesus, Andy. I couldn't hack it on the outside. Been in here too 
                long.<br>
                I'm an institutional man now. Like old Brooks Hatlen was.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                You underestimate yourself.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Bullshit. In here I'm the guy who can get it for you. Out there, 
                all you need are Yellow Pages. I wouldn't know where to begin.<br>
                (derisive snort)<br>
                Pacific Ocean? Hell. Like to scare me to death, somethin' that 
                big.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Not me. I didn't shoot my wife and I didn't shoot her lover, and<br>
                whatever mistakes I made I've paid for and then some. That hotel 
                and<br>
                that boat...I don't think it's too much to want. To look at the 
                stars<br>
                just after sunset. Touch the sand. Wade in the water. Feel free.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Goddamn it, Andy, stop! Don't do that to yourself! Talking shitty<br>
                pipedreams! Mexico's down there, and you're in here, and that's 
                the<br>
                way it is!</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                You're right. It's down there, and I'm in here. I guess it comes 
                down<br>
                to a simple choice, really. Get busy living or get busy dying.</p>
              <p>Red snaps a look. What the hell does that mean? Andy rises and 
                walks away. Red lunges to his feet.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Andy?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                (turns back)<br>
                Red, if you ever get out of here, do me a favor. There's this 
                big<br>
                hayfield up near Buxton. You know where Buxton is?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                (nods)<br>
                Lots of hayfields there.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                One in particular. Got a long rock wall with a big oak at the 
                north end. Like something out of a Robert Frost poem. It's where 
                I asked my<br>
                (MORE)</p>
              <p>ANDY (cont.)<br>
                wife to marry me. We'd gone for a picnic. We made love under that<br>
                tree. I asked and she said yes.<br>
                (beat)<br>
                Promise me, Red. If you ever get out, find that spot. In the base 
                of<br>
                that wall you'll find a rock that has no earthly business in a 
                Maine<br>
                hayfield. A piece of black volcanic glass. You'll find something 
                buried under it I want you to have.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                What? What's buried there?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                You'll just have to pry up that rock and see.</p>
              <p>Andy turns and walks away.</p>
              <p>206 INT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1966)</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                I tell you, the man was talkin' crazy. I'm worried, I truly am.</p>
              <p>SKEET<br>
                We ought to keep an eye on him.</p>
              <p>ZIGGER<br>
                That's fine, during the day. But at night he's got that cell all 
                to<br>
                himself.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                Oh Lord. Andy come down to the loading dock today. Asked me for 
                a length of rope. Six foot long.</p>
              <p>SNOOZE<br>
                Shit! You gave it to him?</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                Sure I did. I mean why wouldn't I?</p>
              <p>FLOYD<br>
                Christ! Remember Brooks Hatlen?</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                How the hell was I s'pose to know?</p>
              <p>ZIGGER<br>
                Andy'd never do that. Never.</p>
              <p>They all look to Red.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Every man's got a breaking point.</p>
              <p>207 EXT -- PRISON YARD -- ANGLE ON P.A. -- DUSK (1966) 207</p>
              <p>VOICE (over P.A.)<br>

              <p>FLOYD<br>
                Where the hell is he?</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                Probably still up in the warden's.</p>
              <p>TOWER GUARD<br>
                (via bullhorn)<br>
                YOU MEN! YOU HEAR THAT ANNOUNCEMENT<br>

              <p>SKEET<br>
                Christ. What do we do?</p>
              <p>FLOYD<br>
                Nothing we can do. Not tonight.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                Let's pull him aside tomorrow, all of us. Have a word with him. 
                Ain't<br>
                that right, Red?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                (unconvinced)<br>
                Yeah. Sure. That's right.</p>
              <p>20B INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- NIGHT (1966) 208</p>
              <p>Andy's working away. Norton pokes his head in.</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                Lickety-split. I wanna get home.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Just about done, sir.</p>
              <p>We follow Norton to his wife's sampler. He swings it aside, works 
                the combination dial, opens the wall safe. Andy moves up, shoves 
                in the black ledger and files. Norton shuts the safe.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Three deposits tonight.</p>
              <p>Andy hands him the envelopes. Norton heads for the door.</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                Get my stuff down t'laundry. And shine my shoes. I want 'em lookin'<br>
                like mirrors.<br>
                (pauses at door)<br>
                Nice havin' you back, Andy. Place just wasn't the same without 
                you.</p>
              <p>Norton exits. Andy turns to the laundry. He opens the shoebox. 
                Nice pair of dress shoes inside. He sighs, glances down at the 
                old ragged pair of work shoes on his own feet.</p>
              <p>209 INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- NIGHT (1966) 209</p>
              <p>Andy is diligently shining Norton's shoes.</p>
              <p>210 INT -- PRISON CORRIDOR -- NIGHT (1966) 210</p>
              <p>Andy trudges down the hallway, laundry slung over his shoulder,</p>
              <p>211 INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1966) 211</p>
              <p>Andy nods to the GUARD. The guard BUZZES him through.</p>
              <p>212 INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 212</p>
              <p>Red hears Andy coming, moves to the bars. He watches Andy come<br>
                up to the second tier and pause before his cell.</p>
              <p>GUARD (O.S.)<br>
                Open number twelve!</p>
              <p>Andy gazes directly at Red. A beat of eye contact. Red shakes 
                his head. Don't do it. Andy smiles, eerily calm...and enters his 
                cell. The door closes. KA-THUMP! We hold on Red's face.</p>
              <p>213 INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 213</p>
              <p>Andy is polishing a chess piece.</p>
              <p>VOICE (O.S.)<br>
                Lights out!</p>
              <p>The lights bump off. He finishes polishing, holds up the piece 
                to admire. A pawn. He sets it down with the others -- and we realize 
                it's the final glance for the board. A full set.</p>
              <p>He gazes up at Racquel and smiles. Pulls a six foot length of 
                rope from under his pillow. Lets it uncoil to the floor.</p>
              <p>214 INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 214</p>
              <p>Red sits in the dark, a bundle of nerves, trying to hold himself 
                still. He feels like he might scream or shake to pieces. The seconds 
                tick by, each an eternity.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                I have had some long nights in stir. Alone in the dark with nothing 
                but your thoughts, time can draw out like a blade...</p>
              <p>A FLASH OF LIGHTNING outside his window sends harsh barred<br>
                shadows jittering across the cell. A storm breaking.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                That was the longest night of my life...</p>
              <p>215 INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- MORNING (1966) 215</p>
              <p>KA-THUMP! The master lock is thrown. The cons emerge from<br>
                their cells and the headcount begins. Red looks back to see if 
                Andy's in line. He's not. Suddenly the count stalls:</p>
              <p>GUARD<br>
                Man missing on tier two! Cell 12!</p>
              <p>The head bull, HAIG, checks his list:</p>
              <p>HAIG<br>
                Dufresne? Get your ass out here, boy! You're holding up the show!<br>
                (no answer)<br>
                Don't make me come down there now! I'll thump your skull for you!</p>
              <p>Still no answer. Glaring, Haig stalks down the tier, clipboard 
                in hand. His men fall in behind.</p>
              <p>HAIG<br>
                Dufresne, dammit, you're putting me behind! You better be sick 
                or dead in there, I shit you not!</p>
              <p>They arrive at bars. Their faces go slack. Stunned. Softly:</p>
              <p>HAIG</p>
              <p>Oh my Holy God.</p>

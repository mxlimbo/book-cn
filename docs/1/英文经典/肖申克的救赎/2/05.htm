                43 INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- 2ND TIER -- NIGHT (1947) 43</p>
              <p>Brooks Hatlen pushes a cart of books from cell to cell. The<br>
                rolling library. He finds Red waiting for him. Red slips the<br>
                rock-hammer, wrapped in a towel, through the bars and onto the<br>
                cart. Next comes six cigarettes to pay for postage.</p>
              <p>RED</p>
              <p>Dufresne.</p>
              <p>Brooks nods, never missing a beat. He rolls his cart to Andy's 
                cell, mutters through the bars:</p>
              <p>BROOKS<br>
                Middle shelf, wrapped in a towel.</p>
              <p>Andy's hand snakes through the bars and makes the object disappear. 
                The hand comes back and deposits a small slip of folded paper 
                along with more cigarettes. Brooks turns his cart around and goes 
                back. He pauses, sorting his books long enough for Red to snag 
                the slip of paper. Brooks continues on, scooping the cigarettes 
                off the cart and into his pocket.</p>
              <p>44 INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 44</p>
              <p>Red unfolds the slip of paper. Penciled neatly on it is a single 
                word: &quot;Thanks.&quot;</p>
              <p>45 INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1947) 45</p>
              <p>We are assaulted by the deafening noise of the laundry line</p>
              <p> Andy is doing his job, getting good at it.</p>
              <p>BOB<br>
                DUFRESNE! WE'RE LOW ON HEXLITE!<br>
                HEAD ON BACK AND FETCH US UP SOME!</p>
              <p>Andy nods. He leaves the line, weaving his way through the laundry 
                room and into --</p>
              <p>46 INT -- BACK ROOMS/STOCK AREA -- DAY (1947) 46</p>
              <p>-- a dark, tangled maze of rooms and corridors, boilers and furnaces, 
                sump pumps, old washing machines, pallets of cleaning supplies 
                and detergents, you name it. Andy hefts a cardboard drum of Hexlite 
                off the stack, turns around --</p>
              <p>-- and finds Bogs Diamond in the aisle. blocking his way. Rooster 
                looms from the shadows to his right, Pete Verness on the left. 
                A frozen beat. Andy slams the Hexlite to the floor, rips off the 
                top, and scoops out a double handful.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                You get this in your eyes, it blinds you.</p>
              <p>BOGS<br>
                Honey, hush.</p>
              <p>Andy backs up, holding them at bay, trying to maneuver through 
                the maze. The Sisters keep coming, tense and guarded, eyes riveted 
                and gauging his every move, trying to outflank him. Andy trips 
                on some old gaint sugglies. That's all it takes. They're on him 
                in an instant, kicking and stomping.</p>
              <p>Andy gets yanked to his feet. Bogs applies a chokehold from behind. 
                They propel him across the room and slam him against an old four-pocket 
                machine, bending him over it. Rooster jams a rag into Andy's mouth 
                and secures it with a steel pipe, like a horse bit. Andy kicks 
                and struggles, but Rooster and Pete have his arms firmly pinned. 
                Bogs whispers in Andy's ear:</p>
              <p>BOGS<br>
                That's it, fight. Better that way.</p>
              <p>Andy starts screaming, muffled by the rag. CAMERA PULLS BACK, 
                SLOWLY WIDENING. The big Washex blocks our view. All we see is 
                Andy's screaming face and the men holding him down...</p>
              <p>...and CAMERA DRIFTS FROM THE ROOM, leaving the dark place and 
                the dingy act behind...MOVING up empty corridors, past<br>
                concrete walls and steel pipes...</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                I wish I could tell you that Andy fought the good fight, and the 
                Sisters let him be. I wish I could tell you that, but prison is 
                no fairy-tale world.</p>
              <p>WE EMERGE into the prison laundry past a guard, WIDENING for<br>
                a final view of the line. The giant steel &quot;mangler&quot; 
                is slapping down in brutal rhythm. The sound is deafening.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                He never said who did it...but we all knew.</p>
              <p>PRISON MONTAGE: (1947 through 1949)</p>
              <p>47 Andy plods through his days. Working. Eating. Chipping and 
                47<br>
                shaping his rocks after lights-out...</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Things went on like that for a while. Prison life consists of 
                routine, and then more routine.</p>
              <p>48 Andy walks the yard, face swollen and bruised. 48</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Every so often, Andy would show up with fresh bruises.</p>
              <p>49 Andy eats breakfast. A few tables over, Bogs blows him a kiss. 
                49</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                The Sisters kept at him. Sometimes he was able to fight them off...<br>
                sometimes not.</p>
              <p>50 Andy backs into a corner in some dingy part of the prison, 
                wildly swinging a rake at his tormentors.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                He always fought, that's what I remember. He fought because he 
                knew if he didn't fight, it would make it that much easier not 
                to fight<br>
                the next time.</p>
              <p>The rake connects, snapping off over somebody's skull. They beat 
                the hell out of him.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Half the time it landed him in the infirmary...</p>
              <p>51 INT -- SOLITARY CONFINEMENT (&quot;THE HOLE&quot;) -- NIGHT 
                (1949) 51</p>
              <p>A stone closet. No bed, sink, or lights. Just a toilet with no 
                seat. Andy sits on bare concrete, bruised face lit by a faint 
                ray of light falling through the tiny slit in the steel door.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                ...the other half, it landed him in solitary. Warden Norton's 
                &quot;grain &amp;<br>
                drain&quot; vacation. Bread, water, and all the privacy you could 
                want.</p>
              <p>52 INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1949) 52</p>
              <p>Andy is working the line.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                And that's how it went for Andy. That was his routine. I do believe 
                those first two years were the worst for him. And I also believe 
                if things had gone on that way, this place would have got the 
                best of him. But then, in the spring of 1949, the powers-that-be 
                decided that...</p>
              <p>53 EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1949) 53</p>
              <p>Warden Norton addresses the assembled cons via bullhorn:</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                ...the roof of the license-plate factory needs resurfacing. I 
                need a dozen volunteers for a week's work. We're gonna be taking 
                names in this steel bucket here...</p>
              <p>Red glances around at his friends. Andy also catches his eye.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                It was outdoor detail, and May is one damn fine month to be workin'<br>
                outdoors.</p>
              <p>54 EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1949) 54</p>
              <p>Cons shuffle past, dropping slips of paper into a bucket.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                More than a hundred men volunteered for the job.</p>
              <p>Red saunters to a guard named TIM YOUNGBLOOD, mutters<br>
                discreetly in his ear.</p>
              <p>55 EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1949) 55</p>
              <p>Youngblood is pulling names and reading them off. Red exchanges 
                grins with Andy and the others.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Wouldn't you know it? Me and some fellas I know were among the 
                names called.</p>
              <p>56 INT -- PRISON CORRIDOR -- NIGHT (1949) 56</p>
              <p>Red slips Youngblood six packs of cigarettes.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Only cost us a pack of smokes per man. I made my usual twenty<br>
                percent, of course.</p>
              <p>57 EXT -- LICENSE PLATE FACTORY -- DAY (1949) 57</p>
              <p>A tar-cooker bubbles and smokes. TWO CONS dip up a bucket of<br>
                tar and tie a rope to the handle. The rope goes taught. CAMERA<br>
                FOLLOWS the bucket of tar up the side of the building to --</p>
              <p>58 THE ROOF 58</p>
              <p>-- where it is relayed to the work detail. The men are dipping 
                big Padd brushes and spreading the tar. ANGLZ OVER to Byron Hadley 
                bitching sourly to his fellow guards:</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                ...so this shithead lawyer calls long distance from Texas, and 
                he says, Byron Hadley? I say, yeah. He says, sorry to inform you, 
                but your<br>
                brother just died.</p>
              <p>YOUNGBLOOD<br>
                Damn, Byron. Sorry to hear that.</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                I ain't. He was an asshole. Run off years ago, family ain't heard 
                of him since. Figured him for dead anyway. So this lawyer prick 
                says, your brother died a rich man. Oil wells and shit, close 
                to a million bucks. Jesus, it's frigging incredible how lucky 
                some assholes can get.</p>
              <p>TROUT<br>
                A million bucks? Jeez-Louise! You get any of that?</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                Thirty five thousand. That's what he left me.</p>
              <p>TROUT<br>
                Dollars? Holy shit, that's great! Like winnin' a lottery...<br>
                (off Hadley's shitty look)<br>
                ...ain't it?</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                Dumbshit. What do you figger the government's gonna do to me? 
                Take a big wet bite out of my ass, is what.</p>
              <p>TROUT<br>
                Oh. Hadn't thought of that.</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                Maybe leave me enough to buy a new car with. Then what happens? 
                You pay tax on the car. Repairs and maintenance. Goddamn kids 
                pesterin' you to take 'em for a ride...</p>
              <p>MERT<br>
                And drive it, if they're old enough.</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                That's right, wanting to drive it, wanting to learn on it, f'Chrissake!<br>
                Then at the end of the year, if you figured the tax wrong, they 
                make<br>
                you pay out of your own pocket. Uncle Sam puts his hand in your<br>
                shirt and squeezes your tit till it's purple. Always get the short 
                end. That's a fact.<br>
                (spits over the side)<br>
                Some brother. Shit.</p>
              <p>The prisoners keep spreading tar, eyes on their work.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                Poor Byron. What terrible fuckin' luck. Imagine inheriting thirty 
                five thousand dollars.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Crying shame. Some folks got it awful bad.</p>
              <p>Red glances over -- and is shocked to see Andy standing up, listening 
                to the guards talk.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Hey, you nuts? Keep your eyes on your pail!</p>
              <p>Andy tosses his Padd in the bucket and strolls toward Hadley.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Andy! Come back! Shit!</p>
              <p>SNOOZE<br>
                What's he doing?</p>
              <p>FLOYD<br>
                Gettin' himself killed.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                God damn it...</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                Just keep spreadin' tar...</p>
              <p>The guards stiffen at Andy's approach. Youngblood's hand goes<br>
                to his holster. The tower guards CLICK-CLACK their rifle bolts. 
                Hadley turns, stupefied to find Andy there.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Mr. Hadley. Do you trust your wife?</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                That's funny. You're gonna look funnier suckin' my dick with no<br>
                fuckin' teeth.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                What I mean is, do you think she'd go behind your back? Try to<br>
                hamstring you?</p>
              <p>HADLZY<br>
                That's it! Step aside, Mert. This fucker's havin' hisself an accident.</p>
              <p>Hadley grabs Andy's collar and propels him violently toward the 
                edge of the roof. The cons furiously keep spreading tar.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                Oh God, he's gonna do it, he's gonna throw him off the roof...</p>
              <p>SNOOZE<br>
                Oh shit, oh fuck, oh Jesus...</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Because if you do trust her, there's no reason in the world you 
                can't<br>
                keep every cent of that money.</p>
              <p>Hadley abruptly jerks Andy to a stop right at the edge. In fact, 
                Andy's past the edge, beyond his balance, shoetips scraping the 
                roof. The only thing between him and an ugly drop to the concrete 
                is Hadley's grip on the front of his shirt.</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                You better start making sense.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                If you want to keep that money, all of it, just give it to your 
                wife.<br>
                See, the IRS allows you a one-time- only gift to your spouse. 
                It's good up to sixty thousand dollars.</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                Naw, that ain't right! Tax free?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Tax free. IRS can't touch one cent.</p>
              <p>The cons are pausing work, stunned by this business discussion.</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                You're the smart banker what shot his wife. Why should I believe 
                a<br>
                smart banker like you? So's I can wind up in here with you?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                It's perfectly legal. Go ask the IRS, they'll say the same thing. 
                Actually, I feel silly telling you all this. I'm sure you would 
                have<br>
                investigated the matter yourself.</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                Fuckin'-A. I don't need no smart wife-killin' banker to show me 
                where<br>
                the bear shit in the buckwheat.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Of course not. But you will need somebody to set up the tax-free<br>
                gift, and that'll cost you. A lawyer, for example...</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                Ambulance-chaaing, highway-robbing cocksuckers!</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                ...or come to think of it, I suppose I could set it up for you. 
                That would save you some money. I'll write down the forms you 
                need,<br>
                you can pick them up, and I'll prepare them for your signature...<br>
                nearly free of charge.<br>
                (off Hadley's look) <br>
                I'd only ask three beers apiece for my co-workers, if that seems 
                fair.</p>
              <p>TROUT<br>
                (guffawing)<br>
                Co-workers! Get him! That's rich, ain't it? Co-workers...</p>
              <p>Hadley freezes him with a look. Andy presses on:</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I think a nan working outdoors feels more like a man if he can 
                have a bottle of suds. That's only my opinion.</p>
              <p>The convicts stand gaping, all pretense of work gone. They look 
                like they've been pole-axed. Hadley shoots them a look.</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                What are you jimmies starin' at?<br>
                Back to work, goddamn it!</p>

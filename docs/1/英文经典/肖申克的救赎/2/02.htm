                8 INT -- COURTROOM -- DAY (1946) 8</p>
              <p>Andy stands before the dias. THE JUDGE peers down, framed by 
                a<br>
                carved frieze of blind Lady Justice on the wall.</p>
              <p>JUDGE<br>
                You strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne. 
                It chills my blood just to look at you. By the power vested in 
                me by the State of Maine, I hereby order you to serve two life 
                sentences, back to back, one for each of your victims. So be it.</p>

              <p>9 AN IRON-BARRED DOOR 9</p>
              <p>slides open with an enormous CLANG. A stark room waits beyond.<br>
                CAMERA PUSHES through. SEVEN HUMORLESS MEN sit side by side at 
                a long table. An empty chair faces them. We are now in:</p>
              <p>INT -- SHAWSHANK HEARINGS ROOM -- DAY (1947)</p>
              <p>RED enters, removes his cap and waits by the chair.</p>
              <p>MAN #1<br>
                Sit.</p>
              <p>Red sits, tries not to slouch. The chair is uncomfortable.</p>
              <p>MAN #2<br>
                We see by your file you've served twenty years of a life sentence.</p>
              <p>MAN #3<br>
                You feel you've been rehabilitated?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Yes, sir. Absolutely. I've learned my lesson. I can honestly say 
                I'm a<br>
                changed man. I'm no longer a danger to society. That's the God's 
                honest truth. No doubt about it.</p>
              <p>The men just stare at him. One stifles a yawn.</p>
              <p>CLOSEUP -- PAROLE FORM</p>
              <p>A big rubber stamp slams down: &quot;REJECTED&quot; in red ink.</p>
              <p>10 EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- DUSK (1947) 10</p>
              <p>High stone walls topped with snaky concertina wire, set off at<br>
                intervals by looming guard towers. Over a hundred CONS are in 
                the yard. Playing catch, shooting craps, jawing at each other, 
                making deals. Exercise period.</p>
              <p>RED emerges into fading daylight, slouches low-key through the<br>
                activity, worn cap on his head, exchanging hellos and doing minor 
                business. He's an important man here.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                There's a con like me in every prison in America, I guess. I'm 
                the guy who can get it for you. Cigarettes, a bag of reefer if 
                you're partial, a<br>
                bottle of brandy to celebrate your kid's high school graduation. 
                Damn<br>
                near anything, within reason.</p>
              <p>He slips somebody a pack of smokes, smooth sleight-of-hand.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Yes sir, I'm a regular Sears &amp;<br>
                Roebuck.</p>
              <p>TWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS issue from the main tower, drawing<br>
                everybody's attention to the loading dock. The outer gate swings 
                open...revealing a gray prison bus outside.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                So when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949 and asked me to smuggle 
                Rita Hayworth into the prison for him, I told him no problem. 
                And it wasn't.</p>
              <p>CON<br>
                Fresh fish! Fresh fish today!</p>
              <p>Red is joined by HEYWOOD, SKEET, FLOYD, JIGGER, ERNIE, SNOOZE.<br>
                Most cons crowd to the fence to gawk and jeer, but Red and his<br>
                group mount the bleachers and settle in comfortably.</p>
              <p>11 INT -- PRISON BUS -- DUSK (1947) 11</p>
              <p>Andy sits in back, wearing steel collar and chains.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Andy came to Shawshank Prison in early 1947 for murdering his 
                wife<br>
                and the fella she was bangin'.</p>
              <p>The bus lurches forward, RUMBLES through the gates. Andy gazes<br>
                around, swallowed by prison walls.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                On the outside, he'd been vice- president of a large Portland 
                bank.<br>
                Good work for a man as young as he was, when you consider how<br>
                conservative banks were back then.</p>
              <p>TOWER GUARD<br>
                All clear!</p>
              <p>GUARDS approach the bus with carbines. The door jerks open.<br>
                The new fish disembark, chained together single-file, blinking<br>
                sourly at their surroundings. Andy stumbles against the MAN in<br>
                front of him, almost drags him down.</p>
              <p>BYRON HADLEY, captain of the guard, slams his baton into<br>
                Andy's back. Andy goes to his knees, gasping in pain. JEERS<br>
                and SHOUTS from the spectators.</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                On your feet before I fuck you up so bad you never walk again.</p>
              <p>13 ON THE BLEACHERS 13</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                There they are, boys. The Human Charm Bracelet.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                Never seen such a sorry-lookin' heap of maggot shit in my life.</p>
              <p>JIGGER<br>
                Comin' from you, Heywood, you being so pretty and all...</p>
              <p>FLOYD<br>
                Takin' bets today, Red?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                (pulls notepad and pencil)<br>
                Bear Catholic? Pope shit in the woods?<br>
                Smokes or coin, bettor's choice.</p>
              <p>FLOYD<br>
                Smokes. Put me down for two.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                High roller. Who's your horse?</p>
              <p>FLOYD<br>
                That gangly sack of shit, third from the front. He'll be the first.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                Bullshit. I'll take that action.</p>
              <p>ERNIE<br>
                Me too.</p>
              <p>Other hands go up. Red jots the names.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                You're out some smokes, son. Take my word.</p>
              <p>FLOYD<br>
                You're so smart, you call it.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                I say that chubby fat-ass...let's see...fifth from the front. 
                Put me<br>
                down for a quarter deck.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                That's five cigarettes on Fat-Ass. Any takers?</p>
              <p>More hands go up. Andy and the others are paraded along, forced 
                by their chains to take tiny baby steps, flinching under the barrage 
                of jeers and shouts. The old-timers are shaking the fence, trying 
                to make the newcomers shit their pants. Some of the new fish shout 
                back, but mostly they look terrified. Especially Andy.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                I must admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes 
                on him.<br>
                He might'a been important on the outside, but in here he was just 
                a<br>
                little turd in prison grays. Looked like a stiff breeze could 
                blow him<br>
                over. That was my first impression of the man.</p>
              <p>SKEET<br>
                What say, Red?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Little fella on the end. Definitely. I stake half a pack. Any 
                takers?</p>
              <p>SNOOZE<br>
                Rich bet.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                C'mon, boys, who's gonna prove me wrong?<br>
                (hands go up)<br>
                Floyd, Skeet, Joe, Heywood. Four brave souls, ten smokes apiece. 
                That's it, gentlemen, this window's closed.</p>
              <p>Red pockets his notepad. A VOICE comes over the P.A. speakers:</p>
              <p>VOICE (amplified)<br>
                Return to your cellblocks for evening count.</p>
              <p>14 INT -- ADMITTING AREA -- DUSK (1947) 14</p>
              <p>The new fish are marched in. Guards unlock the shackles. The<br>
                chains drop away, rattling to the stone floor.</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                Eyes front.</p>
              <p>WARDEN SAMUEL NORTON strolls forth, a colorless man in a gray 
                suit and a church pin in his lapel. He looks like he could piss 
                ice water. He appraises the newcomers with flinty eyes.</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                This is Mr. Hadley, captain of the guard. I am Mr. Norton, the 
                warden. You are sinners and scum, that's why they sent you to 
                me. Rule number one: no blaspheming. I'll not have the Lord's 
                name taken in vain in my prison. The other rules you'll figure 
                out as you go along.<br>
                Any questions?</p>
              <p>CON<br>
                When do we eat?</p>
              <p>Cued by Norton's glance, Hadley steps up to the con and screams<br>
                right in his face:</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                YOU EAT WHEN WE SAY YOU EAT! YOU PISS WHEN WE SAY YOU PISS! YOU 
                SHIT WHEN WE SAY YOU SHIT! YOU SLEEP WHEN WE SAY YOU SLEEP! YOU 
                MAGGOT DICK MOTHERFUCKER!</p>
              <p>Hadley rams the tip of his club into the con's belly. The man 
                falls to his knees, gasping and clutching himself. Hadley takes 
                his place at Norton's side again. Softly:</p>
              <p>NORTON<br>
                Any other questions?<br>
                (there are none)<br>
                I believe in two things. Discipline and the Bible. Here, you'll 
                receive<br>
                both.<br>
                (holds up a Bible)<br>
                Put your faith in the Lord. Your ass belongs to me. Welcome to<br>
                Shawshank.</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                Off with them clothes! And I didn't say take all day doing it, 
                did I?</p>
              <p>The men shed their clothes. Within seconds, all stand naked.</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                First man into the shower!</p>
              <p>Hadley shoves the FIRST CON into a steel cage open at the front. 
                TWO GUARDS open up with a fire hose. The con is slammed<br>
                against the back of the cage, sputtering and hollering. Seconds 
                later, the water is cut and the con yanked out.</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                Delouse that piece of shit! Next man in!</p>
              <p>The con gets a huge scoop of white delousing powder thrown all<br>
                over him. Gasping and coughing, blinking powder from his eyes,<br>
                he gets shoved to a trustee's cage. The TRUSTEE slides a short<br>
                stack of items through the slot -- prison clothes and a Bible. 
                All the men are processed quickly -- a blast of water, powder, 
                clothes and a Bible...</p>
              <p>15 INT -- INFIRMARY -- NIGHT (1947) 15</p>
              <p>A naked CON steps before a DOCTOR and gets a cursory exam.<br>
                A penlight is shined in his eyes, ears, nose, and throat.</p>
              <p>DOCTOR<br>
                Bend over.</p>
              <p>The con does. A GUARD with a penlight in his teeth spreads his<br>
                cheeks, peers up his ass, and nods. Andy is next up. He gets the 
                same treatment.</p>
              <p>16 INT -- PRISON CHAPEL -- NIGHT (1947) 16</p>
              <p>CAMERA TRACKS the naked newcomers shivering on hard wooden chairs, 
                clothes on their laps, Bibles open.</p>
              <p>CHAPLAIN (O.S.)<br>
                ...maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside

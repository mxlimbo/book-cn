                105 EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- DAWN (1954) 105</p>
              <p>The sun rises over gray stone.</p>
              <p>106 INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- DAWN (1954) 106</p>
              <p>ANGLE ON RITA POSTER. Sexy as ever. The rising sun sends<br>
                fingers of rosy light creeping across her face.</p>
              <p>107 INT -- LIBRARY -- DAWN (1954) 107</p>
              <p>Brooks stands on a chair, poised at the bars of a window, cradling 
                Jake in his hands.</p>
              <p>BROOKS<br>
                I can't take care of you no more. You go on now. You're free.</p>
              <p>He tosses Jake through the bars. The crow flaps away.</p>
              <p>108 EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- MAIN GATE -- DAY (1954) 108</p>
              <p>TWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS herald the opening of the gate. It<br>
                swings hugely open, revealing Brooks standing in his cheap suit, 
                carrying a cheap bag, wearing a cheap hat.</p>
              <p>Brooks walks out, tears streaming down his face. He looks back. 
                Red, Andy, and others stand at the inner fence, seeing him off. 
                The massive gate closes, wiping them from view.</p>
              <p>109 INT -- BUS -- DAY (1954) 109</p>
              <p>Brooks is riding the bus, clutching the seat before him, gripped 
                by terror of speed and motion.</p>
              <p>BROOKS (V.O.)<br>
                Dear Fellas. I can't believe how fast things move on the outside.</p>
              <p>110 EXT -- STREET -- PORTLAND, MAINE -- DAY (1954) 110</p>
              <p>Brooks looks like a kid trying to cross the street without his 
                parents. People and traffic a blur.</p>
              <p>BROOKS (V.O.)<br>
                I saw an automobile once when I was young. Now they're everywhere.</p>
              <p>111 EXT -- BREWSTER HOTEL -- DAY (1954) 111</p>
              <p>Brooks comes trudging up the sidewalk. He glances up as a prop-driven 
                airliner streaks in low overhead.</p>
              <p>BROOKS (V.O.)<br>
                The world went and got itself in a big damn hurry.</p>
              <p>He arrives at the Brewster. It ain't much to look at.</p>
              <p>112 INT -- BREWSTER HOTEL -- DAY (1954) 112</p>
              <p>A WOMAN leads Brooks up the stairs toward the top floor. He<br>
                has trouble climbing so many stairs.</p>
              <p>WOMAN<br>
                No music in your room after eight p.m. No guests after nine. No 
                cooking except on the hotplate...</p>
              <p>BROOKS (V.O.)<br>
                People even talk faster. And louder.</p>
              <p>113 INT -- BROOKS' ROOM -- DAY (1954) 113</p>
              <p>Brooks enters. The room is small, old, dingy. Heavy wooden beams 
                cross the ceiling. An arched window affords a view of Congress 
                Street. Traffic noise drifts in. Brooks sets his bag down. He 
                doesn't quite know what to do. He just stands there, like a man 
                waiting for a bus.</p>
              <p>BROOKS (V.O.)<br>
                The parole board got me into this halfway house called the Brewster,<br>
                and a job bagging groceries at the Foodway...</p>
              <p>114 INT -- FOODWAY MARKET -- DAY (1954) 114</p>
              <p>Loud. Jangling with PEOPLE and NOISE. Brooks is bagging groceries. 
                Registers are humming, kids are shrieking.</p>
              <p>WOMAN<br>
                Make sure he double-bags. Last time your man didn't double-bag 
                and the bottom near came out.</p>
              <p>MANAGER<br>
                You double-bag like the lady says, understand?</p>
              <p>BROOKS<br>
                Yes sir, double-bag, surely will.</p>
              <p>BROOKS (V.O.)<br>
                It's hard work. I try to keep up, but my hands hurt most of the 
                time.<br>
                I don't think the store manager likes me very much.</p>
              <p>115 EXT -- PARK -- DAY (1954) 115</p>
              <p>Brooks sits alone on a bench, feeding pigeons.</p>
              <p>BROOKS (V.O.)<br>
                Sometimes after work I go to the park and feed the birds. I keep<br>
                thinking Jake might show up and say hello, but he never does. 
                I hope<br>
                wherever he is, he's doing okay and making new friends.</p>
              <p>116 INT -- BROOKS' ROOM -- NIGHT (1954) 116</p>
              <p>Dark. Traffic outside. Brooks wakes up. Disoriented. Afraid.<br>
                Somewhere in the night, a LOUD ARGUMENT is taking place.</p>
              <p>BROOKS (V.O.)<br>
                I have trouble sleeping at night. The bed is too big. I have bad 
                dreams, like I'm falling. I wake up scared. Sometimes it takes 
                me a<br>
                while to remember where I am.</p>
              <p>117 INT -- FOODWAY -- DAY (1954) 117</p>
              <p>BROOKS (V.O.)<br>
                Maybe I should get me a gun and rob the Foodway, so they'd send 
                me home. I could shoot the manager while I was at it, sort of 
                like a bonus.</p>
              <p>118 INT -- BROOKS' ROOM -- DAY (1954) 118</p>
              <p>Brooks is packing his worldly possessions into the carry bag.<br>
                Undershirts, socks, etc.</p>
              <p>BROOKS (V.O.)<br>
                But I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense anymore.</p>
              <p>119 INT -- BROOKS' ROOM -- SHORTLY LATER (1954) 119</p>
              <p>Brooks is dressed in his suit. He finishes knotting his tie, 
                puts his hat on his head. The letter lies on the desk, stamps 
                and ready for mailing. His bag is by the door.</p>
              <p>BROOKS (V.O.)<br>
                I don't like it here. I'm tired of being afraid all the time. 
                I've decided not to stay.</p>
              <p>He takes one last look around. Only one thing left to do. He 
                steps to a wooden chair in the center of the room, pulls out s 
                pocketknife, and glances up at the ceiling beam.</p>
              <p>He steps up onto the chair. It wobbles queasily. Now facing the 
                beam, he carves a message into the wood: &quot;Brooks Hatlen was 
                here.&quot; He smiles with a sort of inner peace.</p>
              <p>BROOKS (V.O.)<br>
                I doubt they'll kick up any fuss. Not for an old crook like me.</p>
              <p>120 TIGHT ON CHAIR 120</p>
              <p>His weight shifts on the wobbly chair -- and it goes out from 
                under him. His feet remain where they are, kicking feebly in mid-air. 
                His hat falls to the floor.</p>
              <p>ANGLE WIDENS. Brooks has hanged himself. He swings gently,<br>
                facing the open window. Traffic noise floats up from below.</p>
              <p>121 EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- SHAWSHANK -- DAY (1954) 121</p>
              <p>Andy reads the letter to Red and the others:</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat. No hard 
                feelings.</p>
              <p>A long silence. Andy folds the letter, puts it away. Softly:</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                He should'a died in here, goddamn it.</p>
              <p>122 INT -- PRISON LIBRARY -- DAY (1954) 122</p>
              <p>Andy is sorting books on the cart. He replaces a stack on the 
                shelf -- and pauses, noticing a line of ants crawling up the wood. 
                He glances up. The ants disappear over the top. He pulls a chair 
                over and stands on it, peers cautiously over.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Red!</p>
              <p>Red steps in with an armload of files. Andy gingerly reaches 
                in, grabs a black feathered wing, and pulls out a dead crow.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                (softly)<br>
                Is that Jake?</p>
              <p>123 INT -- WOOD SHOP -- DAY (1954) 123</p>
              <p>Red is making something at his bench, sanding and planing.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                It never would have occurred to us, if not for Andy. It was his 
                idea.<br>
                We all agreed it was the right thing to do...</p>
              <p>124 EXT -- FIELDS -- DAY (1954) 124</p>
              <p>Low hilly terrain all around. A HUNDRED CONS are at work in the 
                fields. GUARDS patrol with carbines, keeping a sharp eye. We find 
                Andy, Red, and the boys working with picks and shovels. They lance 
                over to the pickup truck. Hadley's chewing the fat with Mert and 
                Youngblood. A WHISTLE BLOWS.</p>
              <p>GUARD<br>
                Water break! Five minutes!</p>
              <p>The work stops. Cons head for the pickup truck, where water is<br>
                dispensed with dipper and pail. Red and the boys look to Andy.<br>
                Andy nods. Now's the time. The group moves off through the<br>
                confusion, using it as cover. They head up the slope of a nearby 
                hill and quickly decide on a suitable spot. The guards haven't 
                noticed.</p>
              <p>Jigger and Floyd start swinging picks into the soft earth, quickly 
                ripping out a hole. Red reaches into his jacket and pulls out 
                a beautiful wooden box, carefully stained and varnished. He shows 
                it around to nods of approval.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                That's real pretty, Red. Nice work.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                Shovel man in. Watch the dirt.</p>
              <p>124 CONTINUED 124<br>
                Heywood jumps in and starts spading out the hole.</p>
              <p>125 BY THE TRUCK 125</p>
              <p>Youngblood glances up and sees the men on the slope.</p>
              <p>YOUNGBLOOD<br>
                What the fuck.</p>
              <p>HADLZY<br>
                (follows his gaze)<br>
                HEY.' YOU MEN UP THERE.' GET YOUR ASSES OFF THAT SLOPE!<br>
                (works his rifle bolt)</p>
              <p>YOU HAPPY ASSHOLES GONE DEAF? YOU GOT FIVE SECONDS 'FORE I SHOOT 
                SOMEBODY!</p>
              <p>Suddenly, other cons start breaking away in groups, dozens of<br>
                them heading toward the slope. The guards look around.</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                What am I, talkin' to myself?</p>
              <p>126 ON THE SLOPE 126</p>
              <p>Andy pulls a towel-wrapped bundle from his jacket and unfolds 
                it. Jake. Andy lays him in the box, followed by Brook's letter. 
                Red places the casket in the hole. A moment of silence. Andy gives 
                Red with an encouraging nod.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Lord. Brooks was a sinner. Jake was just a crow. Neither was much 
                to look at. Both got institutionalized. See what you can do for 
                'em. Amen.</p>
              <p>Muttered &quot;amens&quot; all around. The boys shovel dirt onto 
                the small grave and tamp it down.</p>
              <p>127 INT -- SHAWSHANK CORRIDORS -- DAY (1955) 127</p>
              <p>RAPID DOLLY with Hadley. He's striding, pissed-off, a man on 
                e<br>
                mission. He straight-arms a door and emerges onto --</p>
              <p>128 EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON WALL -- DAY (1955) 128</p>
              <p>-- the wall overlooking the exercise yard. He leans on the railing, 
                scans the yard, sees Andy chatting with Red.</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                Dufresne! What the fuck did you do?<br>
                (Andy looks up)<br>
                Your ass, warden's office, now!</p>
              <p>Andy shoots a worried look at Red, then heads off.</p>
              <p>129 INT -- GUARD DESK/WARDEN'S OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1955) 129</p>
              <p>Dozens of parcel boxes litter the floor. WILEY, the duty guard, 
                picks through them. Hadley enters, trailed by Andy.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                What is all this?</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                You tell me, fuck-stick! They're addressed to you, every damn 
                one!</p>
              <p>Wiley thrusts an envelope at Andy. Andy just stares at it.</p>
              <p>WILEY<br>
                Well, take it.</p>
              <p>Andy takes the envelope, pulls out a letter, reads:</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                &quot;Dear Mr. Dufresne. In response to your repeated inquiries, 
                the State<br>
                Senate has allocated the enclosed funds for your library project...&quot;<br>
                (stunned, examines check)<br>
                This is two hundred dollars.</p>
              <p>Wiley grins. Hadley glares at him. The grin vanishes.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                &quot;In addition, the Library District has generously responded 
                with a<br>
                charitable donation of used books and sundries. We trust this 
                will<br>
                fill your needs. We now consider the matter closed. Please stop<br>
                sending us letters. Yours truly, the State Comptroller's Office.&quot;</p>
              <p>Andy gazes around at the boxes. The riches of the world lay at 
                his feet. His eyes mist with emotion at the sight.</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                I want all this cleared out before the warden gets back, I shit 
                you not.</p>
              <p>Hadley exits. Andy touches the boxes like a love-struck man touching 
                a beautiful woman. Wiley grins.</p>
              <p>WILEY<br>
                Good for you, Andy.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Only took six years.<br>
                (beat)<br>
                From now on, I send two letters a week instead of one.</p>
              <p>WILEY<br>
                (laughs, shakes his head)<br>
                I believe you're crazy enough. You better get this stuff downstairs<br>
                like the Captain said. I'm gonna go pinch a loaf. When I get back, 
                this<br>
                is all gone, right?</p>
              <p>Andy nods. Wiley disappears into the toilet, Jughead Comix in<br>
                hand. Alone now, Andy starts going through the boxes like a<br>
                starving man exploring packages of food. He doesn't know where<br>
                to turn first. He gets giddy, ripping boxes open and pulling<br>
                out books, touching them, smelling them.</p>
              <p>He rips open another box. This one contains an old phonograph<br>
                player, industrial gray and green, the words &quot;Portland Public<br>
                School District&quot; stenciled on the side. The box also contains<br>
                stacks and stacks of used record albums.</p>
              <p>Andy reverently slips a stack from the box and starts flipping<br>
                through them. Used Nat King Coles, Bing Crosbys, etc.<br>
                He comes across a certain album -- Mozart's &quot;Le Nozze de<br>
                Figaro.&quot; He pulls it from the stack, gazing upon it as a 
                man<br>
                transfixed. It is a thing of beauty. It is the Grail.</p>

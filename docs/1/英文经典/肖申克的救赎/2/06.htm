                59 EXT -- LICENSE PLATE FACTORY -- DAY (1949) 59</p>
              <p>As before, an object is hauled up the side of the building by 
                rope -- only this time, it's a cooler of beer and ice.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                And that's how it came to pass, that on the second-to-last day 
                of the job, the convict crew that tarred the plate factory roof 
                in the spring of '49...</p>
              <p>60 EXT -- ROOF -- SHORTLY LATER (1949) 60</p>
              <p>The cons are taking the sun and drinking beer.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                ...wound up sitting in a row at ten o'clock in the morning, drinking 
                icy<br>
                cold Black Label beer courtesy of the hardest screw that ever 
                walked<br>
                a turn at Shawshank State Prison.</p>
              <p>HADLEY<br>
                Drink up, boys. While it's cold.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                The colossal prick even managed to sound magnanimous.</p>
              <p>Red knocks back another sip, enjoying the bitter cold on his 
                tongue and the warm sun on face.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders, and felt like 
                free men. We could'a been tarring theroof of one of our own houses. 
                We<br>
                were the Lords of all Creation.</p>
              <p>He glances over to Andy squatting apart from the others.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                As for Andy, he spent that break hunkered in the shade, a strange<br>
                little smile on his face, watching us drink his beer.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                (approaches with a beer)<br>
                Here's a cold one, Andy.</p>
              <p>ANDY <br>
                No thanks. I gave up drinking.</p>
              <p>Heywood drifts back to others, giving them a look.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                You could argue he'd done it to curry favor with the guards. Or 
                maybe make a few friends among us cons. Me, I think he did it 
                just to<br>
                feel normal again...if only for a short while.</p>
              <p>61 EXT -- PRISON YARD -- THE BLEACHERS -- DAY (1949) 61</p>
              <p>Andy and Red play checkers. Red makes his move.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                King me.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Chess. Now there's a game of kings.<br>
                Civilized...strategic...</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                ...and totally fuckin' inexplicable. Hate that game.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Maybe you'll let me teach you someday. I've been thinking of getting 
                a board together.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                You come to the right place. I'm the man who can get things.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                We might do business on a board. But the pieces, I'd like to carve 
                those myself. One side done in quartz... the opposing side in 
                limestone.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                That'd take you years.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Years I've got. What I don't have are the rocks. Pickings here 
                in the<br>
                exercise yard are pretty slim.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                How's that rock-hammer workin' out anyway? Scratch your name on 
                your wall yet?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                (smiles)<br>
                Not yet. I suppose I should.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Andy? I guess we're gettin' to be friends, ain't we?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I suppose we are.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                I ask a question? Why'd you do it?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I'm innocent, remember? Just like everybody else here.</p>
              <p>Red takes this as a gentle rebuff, keeps playing.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                What are you in for, Red?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Murder. Same as you.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Innocent?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                The only guilty man in Shawshank.</p>
              <p>62 INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 62</p>
              <p>Andy lies in his bunk after lights out, polishing a fragment 
                of quartz by the light of the moon. He pauses, glancing at all 
                the names scratched in the wall. He rises, makes sure the coast 
                is clear, and starts scratching his name into the cement with 
                his rock-hammer, adding to the record.</p>
              <p>63 RAY MILLAND 63</p>
              <p>fills the screen in glorious (and scratchy) black &amp; white, 
                suffering a bad case of DT's...</p>
              <p>64 INT -- PRISON AUDITORIUM -- NIGHT (1949) 64</p>
              <p>...while a CONVICT AUDIENCE hoots and catcalls, talking back<br>
                to the screen. We find Red slouched in a folding chair, watching 
                the movie. Andy enters, backlit by the flickering glare of the 
                projector, and takes a seat next to him.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Here's the good part. Bugs come out of the walls to get his ass.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I know. I've seen it three times this month already.</p>
              <p>Ray Milland starts SCREAMING. The entire audience SCREAMS with 
                him, high-pitched and hysterical. Andy fidgets.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Can we talk business?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Sure. What do you want?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Rita Hayworth. Can you get her?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                No problem. Take a few weeks.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Weeks?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Don't have her stuffed down my pants this very moment, sorry to<br>
                say. Relax. What are you so nervous about? She's just a woman.</p>
              <p>Andy nods, embarrassed. He gets up and hurries out. Red grins, 
                turns back to the movie.</p>
              <p>65 INT -- AUDITORIUM CORRIDOR -- NIGHT (1949) 65</p>
              <p>Andy exits the theater and freezes in his tracks. Two dark figures 
                loom in the corridor, blocking his path. Rooster and Pete. Andy 
                turns back -- and runs right into Bogs. Instant bear hug. The 
                Sisters are on him like a flash. They kick a door open and drag 
                him into --</p>
              <p>66 THE PROJECTION BOOTH 66</p>
              <p>-- where they confront the startled PROJECTIONIST, an old con<br>
                blinking at them through thick bifocals.</p>
              <p>BOGS<br>
                Take a walk.</p>
              <p>PROJECTIONIST<br>
                I have to change reels.</p>
              <p>BOGS<br>
                I said fuck off.</p>
              <p>Terrified, the old man darts past and out the door. Pete slams 
                and locks it. Bogs shoves Andy to the center of the room.</p>

              <p>BOGS<br>
                Ain't you gonna scream?</p>
              <p>Andy sighs, cocks his head at the projector.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                They'd never hear me over that. Let's get this over with.</p>
              <p>Seemingly resigned, Andy turns around, leans on the rewind bench 
                -- and curls his fingers around a full 1.000 foot reel of 35mm 
                film. Rooster licks his lips, pushes past the others.</p>
              <p>ROOSTER<br>
                Me first.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Okay.</p>
              <p>Andy whips the reel of film around in a vicious arc, smashing 
                it into Rooster's face and bouncing him off the wall.</p>
              <p>ROOSTER<br>
                Fuck! Shit! He broke my nose!</p>
              <p>Andy fights like hell, but is soon overpowered and forced to 
                his knees. Bogs steps to Andy, pulls out an awl with a vicious 
                eight-inch spike, gives him a good long look at it.</p>
              <p>BOGS<br>
                Now I'm gonna open my fly, and you're gonna swallow what I give<br>
                you to swallow. And when you d mine, you gonna swallow<br>
                Rooster's. You done broke his nose, so he ought to have somethin' 
                to show for it.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Anything you put in my mouth, you're going to lose.</p>
              <p>BOGS<br>
                You don't understand. You do that, I'll put all eight inches of 
                this steel ii your ear.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Okay. But you should know that sudden serious brain injury causes<br>
                the victim to bite down. Hard. (faint smile) In fact, I understand 
                the bite-reflex is so strong the victim's jaws have to be pried 
                open with a crowbar.</p>
              <p>The Sisters consider this carefully. The film runs out of the 
                projector, flapping on the reel. The screen goes white.</p>
              <p>BOGS<br>
                You little fuck.</p>
              <p>Andy gets a bootheel in the face. The Sisters start kicking and 
                beating the living shit out of him with anything they can get 
                their hands on. In the theater, the convicts are CHANTING AND 
                CLAPPING for the movie to come back on.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth, and neither did his 
                friends. What they did do is beat him within an inch of his life...</p>

                260 INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 260</p>
              <p>Norton is staring out the window as they approach the building. 
                He goes to his desk, opens a drawer. Inside lies a revolver and 
                a box of shells.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Norton had no intention of goin' that quietly.</p>
              <p>261 INT -- PRISON CORRIDORS -- DAY (1966) 261</p>
              <p>The D.A. marches along amidst a phalanx of TROOPERS.</p>
              <p>262 INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 262</p>
              <p>Norton sits blankly at his desk, revolver before him. The doorknob 
                rattles, a VOICE is heard:</p>
              <p>D.A. (O.S.)<br>
                Samuel Norton? We have a warrant for your arrest! Open up!</p>
              <p>The POUNDING starts. Norton dumps the box of bullets out on thr<br>
                desk. He starts sorting them to see which ones he likes.</p>
              <p>263 OUTSIDE HIS OFFICE 263</p>
              <p>Troopers hustle the hapless duty guard to Norton's door as he 
                fumbles nervously with a huge key ring.</p>
              <p>DUTY GUARD<br>
                I'm not sure which one it is...</p>
              <p>He starts trying keys in the lock. And as the keys go sliding 
                in one after another...</p>
              <p>264 INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 264</p>
              <p>...so do the bullets. Norton is riveted to the door. For every 
                key, he loads another bullet. Methodical and grim. He gets the 
                final bullet in just as the right key slams home. The door bursts 
                open. Men muscle in. Somebody SHOUTS. Troopers dive in all directions 
                as Norton raises the gun --</p>
              <p>-- and jams it under his chin. His head snaps back as the wall 
                goes red. His swivel chair does a slow half-turn and creaks to 
                a final stop. Troopers rise slowly, gazing in horror.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                I like to think the last thing that went through his head...other 
                than<br>
                that bullet...was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got 
                the<br>
                best of him.</p>
              <p>PUSH SLOWLY to the wall to reveal Mrs. Norton's framed sampler<br>
                trickling blood and brains...and we get our final Bible lesson 
                for today: &quot;HIS JUDGMENT COMETH AND THAT RIGHT SOON.&quot;</p>
              <p>265 EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1966) 265</p>
              <p>Mail call. Red hears his name. They pass him a postcard.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Not long after the warden deprived us of his company, I got a 
                postcard in the mail. It was blank. But the postmark said, &quot;McNary, 
                Texas.&quot;</p>
              <p>266 INT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1966) 266</p>
              <p>Red sits with an atlas, tracing his finger down the page.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                McNary. Right on the border. That's where Andy crossed.<br>
                (shuts the book)<br>
                When I picture him heading south in his own car with the top down, 
                it<br>
                makes me laugh all over again...</p>
              <p>267 EXT -- MEXICO -- HIGHWAY -- DAY (1966) 267</p>
              <p>A red convertible rips along with Andy at the wheel, cigar jutting 
                from his grin, warm wind fluttering his tie.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Andy Dufresne, who crawled through a river of shit and came out 
                clean on the other side. Andy Dufresne, headed for the Pacific.</p>
              <p>268 INT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1966) 268</p>
              <p>Heywood is regaling the table with some anecdote about Andy.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Those of us who knew him best talk about him often. I swear, the 
                stuff he pulled. It always makes us laugh.</p>
              <p>A wild burst of laughter. PUSH IN on Red. Feeling melancholy.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Sometimes it makes me sad, though, Andy being gone. I have to 
                remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged, that's 
                all. Their feathers are just too bright...</p>
              <p>269 EXT -- FIELDS -- LATE DAY (1966) 269</p>
              <p>Convicts hoe the fields. Guards patrol on horseback.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                ...and when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a 
                sin to<br>
                lock them up does rejoice...but still, the place you live is that 
                much more drab and empty that they're gone.</p>
              <p>A DISTANT RUMBLE OF THUNDER. Red pauses, gazes off. Storm clouds 
                coming in, backlit by the sun. A light drizzle begins.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                I guess I just miss my friend.</p>
              <p>270 INT -- PRISON CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 270</p>
              <p>Red is sleeping. He wakes with a start.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                But there are times I curse him for the dreams he left behind...</p>
              <p>He senses a presence, looks over his shoulder. There's a Rita<br>
                Hayworth poster on his wall. He gets out of bed. Rita just</p>
              <p>keeps smiling, inscrutable. As Red watches, a brilliant round 
                glow builds behind the poster, shining from the tunnel. The poster 
                rips free, charred to ash in the blink of an eye as a shaft of 
                holy white light stabs into the cell. Sunlight. Red staggers back 
                against the glare.</p>
              <p>A whirlwind kicks up, whipping everything into the air. The hole 
                in the wall is like a giant vacuum cleaner -- papers, book, toiletries, 
                bedding -- if it ain't nailed down, it gets sucked down the hole 
                toward the light. Red fights it, but the suction drags him closer 
                and closer...</p>
              <p>271 RED'S POV 271</p>
              <p>...and CAMERA rockets into the hole, getting sucked down an endless 
                tunnel at impossible speed, the ROAR of air mixing with his drawn-out 
                SCREAM, closer and closer to the light...</p>
              <p>...and erupting out the other side into total silence and a beautiful 
                white beach. The Pacific Ocean before us. Enormous. Mind-blowing. 
                Beautiful beyond description. All we hear now are the gentle sound 
                of waves.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                ...dreams where I am lost in a warm place with no memory.</p>
              <p>A lone figure stands at water's edge. CAMERA KEEPS MOVING,<br>
                coming up behind him and TRACKING AROUND to reveal -- Red.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                An ocean so big it strikes me dumb. Waves so quiet they strike 
                me deaf. Sunshine so bright it strikes me blind. It is a place 
                that is blue<br>
                beyond reason. Bluer than can possibly exist. Bluer than my mind<br>
                can possibly grasp.</p>
              <p>272 AERIAL SHOT 272</p>
              <p>Nothing for a million miles but beach, sky, and water. Red is 
                a tiny speck at water's edge. Just another grain of sand.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                I am terrified. There is no way home.</p>
              <p>273 INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 273</p>
              <p>Red wakes from the nightmare. He gets out of bed. Moves to the<br>
                barred window of his cell. Peers up at the stars.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Andy. I know you're in that place. Look at the stars for me just 
                after<br>
                sunset. Touch the sand...wade in the water...and feel free.</p>
              <p>FADE TO BLACK</p>
              <p>274 AN IRON-BARRED DOOR 274</p>
              <p>slides open with an enormous CLANG. A stark room beyond.<br>
                CAMERA PUSHES through. SIX MEN AND ONE WOMAN sit at a long table. 
                An empty chair faces them. We are again in:</p>
              <p>INT -- SHAWSHANK HEARINGS ROOM -- DAY (1967)</p>
              <p>Red enters, sits. 20 years older than when we first saw him.</p>
              <p>MAN #1<br>
                Your file says you've served forty years of a life sentence. You 
                feel<br>
                you've been rehabilitated?</p>
              <p>Red doesn't answer. Just stares off. Seconds tick by. The parole 
                board exchanges glances. Somebody clears his throat.</p>
              <p>MAN #1<br>
                Shall I repeat the question?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                I heard you. Rehabilitated. Let's see now. You know, come to think 
                of it, I have no idea what that means.</p>
              <p>MAN #2<br>
                Well, it means you're ready to rejoin society as a--</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                I know what you think it means. Me, I think it's a made-up word, 
                a politician's word. A word so young fellas like you can wear 
                a suit and tie and have a job. What do you really want to know? 
                Am I sorry for what I did?</p>
              <p>- -----</p>
              <p>MAN g2<br>
                Well...are you?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Not a day goes by I don't feel regret, and not because I'm in 
                here or because you think I should. I look back on myself the 
                way I was...stupid kid who did that terrible crime...wish I could 
                talk sense to him. Tell him how things are. But I can't. That 
                kid's long gone, this old man is all that's left, and I have to 
                live with that.<br>
                (beat)<br>
                &quot;Rehabilitated?&quot; That's a bullshit word, so you just 
                go on ahead and<br>
                stamp that form there, sonny, and stop wasting my damn time. Truth<br>
                is, I don't give a shit.</p>
              <p>The parole board just stares. Red sits drumming his fingers.</p>
              <p>CLOSEUP -- PAROLE FORM</p>
              <p>A big rubber stamp SLAMS down -- and lifts away to reveal the<br>
                word &quot;APPROVED&quot; in red ink.</p>
              <p>275 EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- DAY 275</p>
              <p>TWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS herald the opening of the main gate. It 
                swings hugely open, revealing Red standing in his cheap suit, 
                carrying a cheap bag, wearing a cheap hat. He walks out, still 
                looking stunned.</p>
              <p>276 INT -- BUS -- DAY 276</p>
              <p>Red rides the bus, clutching the seat before him, gripped by 
                terror of speed and motion.</p>
              <p>277 EXT -- BREWSTER HOTEL -- LATE AFTERNOON 277</p>
              <p>Red arrives at the Brewster, three stories high and even less 
                to look at than it used to be.</p>
              <p>27B INT -- BREWSTER -- LATE DAY 278</p>
              <p>A BLACK WOMAN leads Red up the stairs toward the top floor.</p>
              <p>279 INT -- RED'S ROOM -- LATE DAY 279</p>
              <p>Small, old, dingy. An arched window with a view of Congress Street. 
                Traffic noise floats up. Red enters and pauses, staring up at 
                the ceiling beam. Carved into the wood are the words: &quot;Brooks 
                Hatlen was here.&quot;</p>
              <p>280 INT -- FOODWAY MARKET -- DAY 280</p>
              <p>Loud. Jangling with PEOPLE and NOISE. We find Red bagging<br>
                groceries. Registers are humming, kids are shrieking. Red calls 
                to the STORE MANAGER:</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Sir? Restroom break sir?</p>
              <p>MANAGER<br>
                (motions him over)<br>
                You don't need to ask me every time you go take a piss. Just go.<br>
                Understand?</p>

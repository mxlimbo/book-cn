              <p>130 INT -- BATHROOM -- DAY (1955) 130 </p>
              <p>Wiley sits in one of the stalls, Jughead comic on his knees.</p>
              <p>131 INT -- GUARD STATION/OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1955) 131</p>
              <p>Andy wrestles the phonograph player onto the guards' desk,<br>
                sweeping things onto the floor in his haste. He plugs the machine 
                in. A red light warms up. The platter starts spinning.</p>
              <p>He slides the Mozart album from its sleeve, lays it on the platter, 
                and lowers the tone arm to his favorite cut. The needle HISSES 
                in the groove...and the MUSIC begins, lilting and gorgeous. Andy 
                sinks into Wiley's chair, overcome by its beauty. It is &quot;Deutino: 
                Che soave zeffiretto,&quot; a duet sung by</p>
              <p>Susanna and the Contessa.</p>
              <p>132 INT -- BATHROOM -- DAY (1955) 132</p>
              <p>Wiley pauses reading, puzzled. He thinks he hears music.</p>
              <p>WILEY<br>
                Andy? You hear that?</p>
              <p>133 INT -- GUARD STATION/OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1955) 133</p>
              <p>Andy shoots a look at the bathroom...and smiles. Go for broke.<br>
                He lunges to his feet and barricades the front door, then the<br>
                bathroom. He returns to the desk and positions the P.A.<br>
                microphone. He works up his courage, then flicks all the<br>
                toggles to &quot;on.&quot; A SQUEAL OF FEEDBACK echoes briefly...</p>
              <p>134 INT/EXT -- VARIOUS P.A. SPEAKERS -- DAY (1955) 134</p>
              <p>...and the Mozart is suddenly broadcast all over the prison.</p>
              <p>135 INT -- BATHROOM -- DAY (1955) 135</p>
              <p>Wiley lunges to his feet, pants tangling around his ankles.</p>
              <p>136 INT/EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- VARIOUS LOCATIONS -- DAY (1955) 
                136</p>
              <p>Cons all over the prison stop whatever they're doing, freezing 
                in mid-step to listen, gazing up at the speakers.</p>
              <p>137 The stamping machines in the plate shop are shut down... 
                137</p>
              <p>138 The laundry line goes silent, grinding to a halt... 138</p>
              <p>139 The wood shop machines are turned off, buzzing to a stop... 
                139</p>
              <p>140 The motor pool...the kitchen...the loading dock...the exercise 
                140<br>
                thru yard...the numbing routine of prison life itself...all grinds 
                thru<br>
                143 to a stuttering halt. Nobody moves, nobody speaks. Everybody 
                143</p>
              <p>just stands in place, listening to the MUSIC, hypnotized.</p>
              <p>144 INT -- GUARD STATION -- DAY (1955) 144</p>
              <p>Andy is reclined in the chair, transported, arms fluidly conducting 
                the music. Ecstasy and rapture. Shawshank no longer exists. It 
                has been banished from the mind of men.</p>
              <p>145 EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- DAY (1955) 145</p>
              <p>CAMERA TRACKS along groups of men, all riveted.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                I have no idea to this day what them two Italian ladies were singin' 
                about. Truth is, I don't want to know. Some things are best left 
                unsaid. I like to think they were singin' about something so beautiful 
                it can't be expressed in words, and makes your heart ache because 
                of it.</p>
              <p>CAMERA brings us to Red.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                I tell you, those voices soared. Higher and farther than anybody 
                in a gray place dares to dream. It was like some beautiful bird 
                flapped<br>
                into our drab little cage and made these walls dissolve away...and 
                for<br>
                the briefest of moments -- every last man at Shawshank felt free.</p>
              <p>146 INT -- PRISON CORRIDOR -- DAY (1955) 146</p>
              <p>FAST DOLLY with Norton striding up the hallway with Hadley.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                It pissed the warden off something terrible.</p>
              <p>147 INT -- GUARD STATION/OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1955) 147</p>
              <p>Norton and Hadley break the door in. Andy looks up with a<br>
                sublime smile. We hear Wiley POUNDING on the bathroom door:</p>
              <p>WILEY (O.S.)<br>
                LET ME OUUUUT!</p>
              <p>148 INT -- SOLITARY WING -- DAY (1955) 148</p>
              <p>LOW ANGLE SLOW PUSH IN on the massive, rust-streaked steel<br>
                door. God, this is a terrible place to be.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Andy got two weeks in the hole for that little stunt.</p>
              <p>149 INT -- SOLITARY CONFINEMENT -- DAY (1955) 149</p>
              <p>Andy doesn't seem to mind. His arms sweep to the music still<br>
                playing in his head. We hear a FAINT ECHO of the soaring duet.</p>
              <p>150 INT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1955) 1 50</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                Couldn't play somethin' good, huh? Hank Williams?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                They broke the door down before I could take requests.</p>
              <p>FLOYD<br>
                Was it worth two weeks in the hole?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Easiest time I ever did.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                Shit. No such thing as easy time in the hole. A week seems like 
                a year.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company. Hardly felt the time at all.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Oh, they let you tote that record player down there, huh? I could'a<br>
                swore they confiscated that stuff.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                (taps his heart, his head)<br>
                The music was here...and here. That's the one thing they can't<br>
                confiscate, not ever. That's the beauty of it. Haven't you ever 
                felt<br>
                that way about music, Red?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Played a mean harmonica as a younger man. Lost my taste for it. 
                Didn't make much sense on the inside.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Here's where it makes most sense. We need it so we don't forget.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Forget?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                That there are things in this world not carved out of gray stone. 
                That<br>
                there's a small place inside of us they can never lock away, and 
                that<br>
                place is called hope.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Hope is a dangerous thing. Drive a man insane. It's got no place 
                here.<br>
                Better get used to the idea.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                (softly)<br>
                Like Brooks did?</p>
              <p>FADE TO BLACK</p>
              <p>151 AN IRON-BARRED DOOR 151</p>
              <p>slides open with an enormous CLANG. A stark room beyond.<br>
                CAMERA PUSHES through. SEVEN HUMORLESS MEN sit at a long</p>
              <p>table. An empty chair faces them. We are again in:</p>
              <p>INT -- SHAWSHANK HEARINGS ROOM -- DAY (1957)</p>
              <p>Red enters, ten years older than when we first saw him at a parole 
                hearing. He removes his cap and sits.</p>
              <p>MAN #l<br>
                It says here you've served thirty years of a life sentence.</p>
              <p>MAN #2<br>
                You feel you've been rehabilitated?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Yes sir, without a doubt. I can say I'm a changed man. No danger 
                to<br>
                society, that's the God's honest truth. Absolutely rehabilitated.</p>
              <p>CLOSEUP -- PAROLE FORM</p>
              <p>A big rubber stamp slams down: &quot;REJECTED.&quot;</p>
              <p>152 EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DUSK (1957) 152</p>
              <p>Red emerges into fading daylight. Andy's waiting for him.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Same old, same old. Thirty years. Jesus. When you say it like 
                that...</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                You wonder where it went. I wonder where ten years went.</p>
              <p>Red nods, solemn. They settle in on the bleachers. Andy pulls 
                a small box from his sweater, hands it to Red.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Anniversary gift. Open it.</p>
              <p>Red does. Inside the box, on a thin layer of cotton, is a shiny 
                new harmonica, bright aluminum and circus-red.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Had to go through one of your competitors. Hope you don't mind.<br>
                Wanted it to be a surprise.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                It's very pretty, Andy. Thank you.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                You gonna play something?</p>
              <p>--</p>
              <p>Red considers it, shakes his head. Softly:</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Not today.</p>
              <p>153 INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE/ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1957) 153</p>
              <p>Men line the tiers as the evening count is completed. The convicts 
                step into their cells. The master switch is thrown and all the 
                doors slam shut -- KA-THUMP! Andy finds a cardboard tube on his 
                bunk. The note reads: &quot;A new girl for your 10 year anniversary. 
                From your pal. Red.&quot;</p>
              <p>154 INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- LATER (1957) 154</p>
              <p>Marilyn Monroe's face fills the screen. SLOW PULL BACK reveals<br>
                the new poster: the famous shot from &quot;The Seven Year Itch,&quot; 
                on the subway grate with skirt billowing up. Andy sits gazing 
                at her as lights-out commences...</p>
              <p>INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1957) 155</p>
              <p>...and we find Red gazing blankly as darkness takes the cellblock. 
                Adding up the months, weeks, days...</p>
              <p>He regards the harmonica like a man confronted with a Martian 
                artifact. He considers trying it out -- even holds it briefly 
                to his lips, almost embarrassed -- but puts it back in its box 
                untested. And there the harmonica will stay...</p>
              <p>FADE TO BLACK</p>
              <p>156 WE HOLD IN BLACKNESS as THUMPING SOUNDS grow louder... 156</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Andy was as good as his word. He kept writing to the State Senate.<br>
                Two letters a week instead of one.</p>
              <p>...and the BLACKNESS disintegrates as a wall tumbles before our 
                eyes, revealing a WORK CREW with picks and sledgehammers,<br>
                faces obscured outlaw-style with kerchiefs against the dust. Behind 
                them are GUARDS overseeing the work.</p>
              <p>Andy yanks his kerchief down, grinning in exhilaration. Red and 
                the others follow suit. They step through the hole in the wall, 
                exploring what used to be a sealed-off storage room.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                In 1959, the folks up Augusta way finally clued in to the fact 
                they<br>
                couldn't buy him off with just a 200 dollar check. Appropriations<br>
                Committee voted an annual payment of 500 dollars, just to shut 
                him up.</p>
              <p>157 INT -- PRISON LIBRARY -- DAY (1960) 157</p>
              <p>TRACKING the construction. Walls have been knocked down. Men<br>
                are painting, plastering, hammering. Lots of shelves going up.<br>
                Red is head carpenter. We find him discussing plans with Andy.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                Those checks came once a year like clockwork.</p>
              <p>158 INT -- PRISON LIBRARY -- DAY (1960) 158</p>
              <p>Red and the boys are opening boxes, pulling out books.</p>
              <p>RED (V.O.)<br>
                You'd be amazed how far Andy could stretch it. He made deals with 
                book clubs, charity groups...he bought remaindered books by the 
                pound...</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                Treasure Island. Robert Louis...</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                (jotting)<br>
                ...Stevenson. Next?</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                I got here an auto repair manual, and a book on soap carving.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Trade skills and hobbies, those go under educational. Stack right<br>
                behind you.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                The Count of Monte Crisco...</p>
              <p>FLOYD<br>
                Cristo, you dumbshit.</p>
              <p>HEYWOOD<br>
                ...by Alexandree Dumb-ass.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Dumas. You boys'll like that one.<br>
                It's about a prison break.</p>
              <p>Floyd tries to take the book. Heywood yanks it back. I saw it<br>
                first. Red shoots Andy a look.</p>
              <p>RED<br>
                Maybe that should go under educational too.</p>

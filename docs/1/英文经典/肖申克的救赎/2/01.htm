              <p>1 INT -- CABIN -- NIGHT (1946)</p>
              <p>A dark, empty room.</p>
              <p>The door bursts open. A MAN and WOMAN enter, drunk and giggling, 
                horny as hell. No sooner is the door shut than they're all over 
                each other, ripping at clothes, pawing at flesh, mouths locked 
                together.</p>
              <p>He gropes for a lamp, tries to turn it on, knocks it over instead. 
                Hell with it. He's got more urgent things to do, like getting 
                her blouse open and his hands on her breasts. She arches, moaning, 
                fumbling with his fly. He slams her against the wall, ripping 
                her skirt. We hear fabric tear.</p>
              <p>He enters her right then and there, roughly, up against the
                wall. She cries out, hitting her head against the wall but not
                caring, grinding against him, clawing his back, shivering with
                the sensations running through her. He carries her across the
                room with her legs wrapped around him. They fall onto the bed.</p>
              <p>CAMERA PULLS BACK, exiting through the window, traveling
                smoothly outside...</p>
              <p>2 EXT -- CABIN -- NIGHT (1946) 2</p>
              <p>...to reveal the bungalow, remote in a wooded area, the
                lovers' cries spilling into the night...</p>
              <p>...and we drift down a wooded path, the sounds of rutting
                passion growing fainter, mingling now with the night sounds of
                crickets and hoot owls...</p>
              <p>...and we begin to hear FAINT MUSIC in the woods, tinny and
                incongruous, and still we keep PULLING BACK until...</p>
              <p>...a car is revealed. A 1946 Plymouth. Parked in a clearing.</p>
              <p>3 INT -- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT (1946) 3</p>
              <p>ANDY DUFRESNE, mid-20's, wire rim glasses, three-piece suit.
                Under normal circumstances a respectable, solid citizen; hardly
                dangerous, perhaps even meek. But these circumstances are far
                from normal. He is disheveled, unshaven, and very drunk. A
                cigarette smolders in his mouth. His eyes, flinty and hard, are
                riveted to the bungalow up the path.</p>
              <p>He can hear them fucking from here.</p>
              <p>He raises a bottle of bourbon and knocks it back. The radio<br>
                plays softly, painfully romantic, taunting him:</p>
              <p>You stepped out of a dream...
                You are too wonderful...
                To be what you seem...</p>
              <p>He opens the glove compartment, pulls out an object wrapped
                in a rag. He lays it in his lap and unwraps it carefully --</p>
              <p>-- revealing a .38 revolver. Oily, black, evil.</p>
              <p>He grabs a box of bullets. Spills them everywhere, all over
                the seats and floor. Clumsy. He picks bullets off his lap,
                loading them into the gun, one by one, methodical and grim.
                Six in the chamber. His gaze goes back to the bungalow.</p>
              <p>He shuts off the radio. Abrupt silence, except for the distant
                lovers' moans. He takes another shot of bourbon courage, then
                opens the door and steps from the car.</p>
              <p>4 EXT -- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT (1946) 4</p>
              <p>His wingtip shoes crunch on gravel. Loose bullets scatter to
                the ground. The bourbon bottle drops and shatters.</p>
              <p>He starts up the path, unsteady on his feet. The closer he
                gets, the louder the lovemaking becomes. Louder and more
                frenzied. The lovers are reaching a climax, their sounds of
                passion degenerating into rhythmic gasps and grunts.</p>
              <p>WOMAN (O.S.)<br>
                Oh god...oh god...oh god...</p>
              <p>Andy lurches to a stop, listening. The woman cries out in<br>
                orgasm. The sound slams into Andy's brain like an icepick. He<br>
                shuts his eyes tightly, wishing the sound would stop.</p>
              <p>It finally does, dying away like a siren until all that's left<br>
                is the shallow gasping and panting of post-coitus. We hear<br>
                languorous laughter, moans of satisfaction.</p>
              <p>WOMAN (O.S.)<br>
                Oh god...that's sooo good...you're the best...the best I ever had...</p>
              <p>Andy just stands and listens, devastated. He doesn't look like
                much of a killer now; he's just a sad little man on a dirt
                path in the woods, tears streaming down his face, a loaded gun
                held loosely at his side. A pathetic figure, really.</p>
              <p>FADE TO BLACK: 1ST TITLE UP</p>
              <p>5 INT -- COURTROOM -- DAY (1946) 5</p>
              <p>THE JURY listens like a gallery of mannequins on display,
                pale-faced and stupefied.</p>
              <p>D.A. (O.S.)<br>
                Mr. Dufresne, describe the
                confrontation you had with your
                wife the night she was murdered.</p>
              <p>ANDY DUFRESNE</p>
              <p>is on the witness stand, hands folded, suit and tie pressed,
                hair meticulously combed. He speaks in soft, measured tones:</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                It was very bitter. She said she
                was glad I knew, that she hated all the sneaking around. She said she
                wanted a divorce in Reno.</p>
              <p>D.A.<br>
                What was your response?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I told her I would not grant one.</p>
              <p>D.A.<br>
                (refers to his notes)<br>
                &quot;I'll see you in Hell before I see you in Reno.&quot; Those 
                were the words<br>
                you used, Mr. Dufresne, according to the testimony of your neighbors.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                If they say so. I really don't remember. I was upset.</p>
              <p>FADE TO BLACK: 2ND TITLE UP</p>
              <p>D.A.<br>
                What happened after you and your wife argued?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                She packed a bag and went to stay with Mr. Quentin.</p>
              <p>D.A.<br>
                Glenn Quentin. The golf pro at the Falmouth Hills Country Club. 
                The<br>
                man you had recently discovered was her lover.<br>
                (Andy nods)<br>
                Did you follow her?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I went to a few bars first. Later, I decided to drive to Mr. Quentin's<br>
                home and confront them. They weren't there...so I parked my car<br>
                in the turnout...and waited.</p>
              <p>D.A.<br>
                With what intention?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I'm not sure. I was confused. Drunk. I think mostly I wanted to 
                scare them.</p>
              <p>D.A.<br>
                You had a gun with you?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Yes. I did.</p>
              <p>FADE TO BLACK: 3RD TITLE UP</p>
              <p>D.A.<br>
                When they arrived, you went up to the house and murdered them?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                No. I was sobering up. I realized she wasn't worth it. I decided 
                to<br>
                let her have her quickie divorce.</p>
              <p>D.A.<br>
                Quickie divorce indeed. A .38 caliber divorce, wrapped in a<br>
                handtowel to muffle the shots, isn't that what you mean? And then<br>
                you shot her lover!</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                I did not. I got back in the car and drove home to sleep it off.<br>
                Along the way, I stopped and threw my gun into the Royal River. 
                I feel I've been very clear on this point.</p>
              <p>D.A.<br>
                Yes, you have. Where I get hazy, though, is the part where the<br>
                cleaning woman shows up the next morning and finds your wife and 
                her lover in bed, riddled with .38 caliber bullets. Does that 
                strike<br>
                you as a fantastic coincidence, Mr. Dufresne, or is it just me?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                (softly)<br>
                Yes. It does.</p>
              <p>D.A.<br>
                I'm sorry, Mr. Dufresne, I don't think the jury heard that.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Yes. It does.</p>
              <p>D.A.<br>
                Does what?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                Strike me as a fantastic coincidence.</p>
              <p>D.A.<br>
                On that, sir, we are in accord...</p>
              <p>FADE TO BLACK! 4TH TITLE UP</p>
              <p>D.A.<br>
                You claim you threw your gun into the Royal River before the murders 
                took place. That's rather convenient.</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                It's the truth.</p>
              <p>D.A.<br>
                You recall Lt. Mincher's testimony?<br>
                He and his men dragged that river for three days and nary a gun 
                was<br>
                found. So no comparison can be made between your gun and the bullets 
                taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims. That's also 
                rather convenient, isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?</p>
              <p>ANDY<br>
                (faint, bitter smile)<br>
                Since I am innocent of this crime, sir, I find it decidedly inconvenient<br>
                the gun was never found.</p>
              <p>FADE TO BLACK: STH TITLE UP</p>
              <p>6 INT -- COURTROOM -- DAY (1946) 6</p>
              <p>The D.A. holds the jury spellbound with his closing summation:</p>
              <p>D.A.<br>
                Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard all the evidence, you know 
                all the<br>
                facts. We have the accused at the scene of the crime. We have 
                foot<br>
                prints. Tire tracks. Bullets scattered on the ground which bear 
                his fingerprints. A broken bourbon bottle, likewise with fingerprints.<br>
                Most of all, we have a beautiful young woman and her lover lying<br>
                dead in each other's arms. They had sinned. But was their crime 
                so<br>
                great as to merit a death sentence?</p>
              <p>He gestures to Andy sitting quietly with his ATTORNEY.</p>
              <p>D.A.<br>
                I suspect Mr. Dufresne's answer to that would be yes. I further<br>
                suspect he carried out that sentence on the night of September<br>
                21st, this year of our Lord, 1946, by pumping four bullets into 
                his<br>
                wife and another four into Glenn Quentin. And while you think 
                about<br>
                that, think about this...</p>
              <p>He picks up a revolver, spins the cylinder before their eyes 
                like a carnival barker spinning a wheel of fortune.</p>
              <p>D.A.<br>
                A revolver holds six bullets, not eight. I submit to you this 
                was not<br>
                a hot-blooded crime of passion! That could at least be understood,<br>
                if not condoned. No, this was revenge of a much more brutal and<br>
                cold-blooded nature. Consider! Four bullets per victim! Not six 
                shots<br>
                fired, but eight! That means he fired the gun empty...and then<br>
                stopped to reload so he could shoot each of them again! An extra 
                bullet per lover...right in the head.<br>
                (a few JURORS shiver)<br>
                I'm done talking. You people are all decent, God-fearing Christian<br>
                folk. You know what to do.</p>

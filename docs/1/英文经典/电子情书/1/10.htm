            <p> EXT. CAFE LALO - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Joe and Kevin in front.</p>
            <p> Kevin looks in the window.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              See her?</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              There's a beautiful, whoa, a very<br>
              beautiful girl.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              But no book. Let me see, let me see...<br>
              Wait a minute. There's a book with a<br>
              flower, so it must be her.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              What does he look like?</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              There's a waiter blocking, I can't see<br>
              her face. He's serving her a cup of tea<br>
              and she's putting in three spoonfuls of<br>
              sugar --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Well, why shouldn't she?</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              No reason. Unless she has hypoglycemia.<br>
              Oh, he's moving.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Can you see her?</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              And? --</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              (clearly frustrated)<br>
              She's very pretty.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              She is. I knew she would be. She had to be.</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              She looks... I would say she has a little<br>
              of the coloring of that Kathleen Kelly<br>
              person.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Kathleen Kelly of the bookstore.</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              Why not? You said you thought she was<br>
              attractive.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              So what? Who cares about Kathleen Kelly?</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              Well, if you don't like Kathleen Kelly,<br>
              I can tell you right now you ain't gonna<br>
              like this girl.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Why not?</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              Because it is Kathleen Kelly.</p>
            <p> Joe elbows Kevin aside and looks.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Oh, God.</p>
            <p> A long beat.</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              What are you going to do?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Nothing.</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              You're going to let her just wait there?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Yes. Yes I am. That's exactly what I'm<br>
              going to do. Why not?</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              But she wrote the letters.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Good night, Kevin. I'll see you<br>
              tomorrow.</p>
            <p> He walks away, leaving Kevin.</p>
            <p> Kevin stares after him. Then he walks away in the other<br>
              direction.</p>
            <p> INT. CAFE LALO - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> Kathleen, sitting alone, at a table for two, is drinking her<br>
              tea. She's starting to feel a little foolish. She checks<br>
              her watch.</p>
            <p> A loud, boisterous group comes in and sits at the table next<br>
              to hers. They're laughing. A man from the group grabs the<br>
              empty chair at Kathleen's table.</p>
            <p> MAN<br>
              Do you mind?</p>
            <p> Kathleen jumps up.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Oh, yes. I'm expecting someone.<br>
              Please.</p>
            <p> She takes the chair back. Sits down again. She watches the<br>
              group as they playfully fight over the menus.</p>
            <p> She checks her watch again. Then she opens her copy of Pride<br>
              and Prejudice and looks at it. She can't focus.</p>
            <p> A man comes into the restaurant and she looks up hopefully at<br>
              him. But he's going to meet another group of people.</p>
            <p> As he passes her table, he knocks the book and the flower<br>
              onto the floor.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Oh!</p>
            <p> She jumps up and rescues the book and flower as if they were<br>
              precious china.</p>
            <p> In the window, now, behind her, Joe appears. He watches, as<br>
              she rearranges the book and the flower.</p>
            <p> He disappears from sight.</p>
            <p> A beat...</p>
            <p> He walks in the door.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Kathleen Kelly. Hello. What a<br>
              coincidence. Mind if I sit down?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Yes I do. I'm expecting someone.</p>
            <p> Joe picks up her book, looks at it.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Pride and Prejudice.</p>
            <p> Kathleen grabs it back.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Do you mind?</p>
            <p> She places it back on the table, puts the rose into it.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I didn't know you were a Jane Austen<br>
              fan. Not that it's a surprise. I bet<br>
              you read it every year. I bet you just<br>
              love Mr. Darcy, and that your sentimental<br>
              heart beats wildly at the thought that he<br>
              and whatever her name is are really,<br>
              honestly and truly going to end up<br>
              together.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Would you please leave?</p>
            <p> Joe sits down.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Please?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I'll get up as soon as your friend comes.<br>
              Is he late?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              The heroine of Pride and Prejudice is<br>
              Elizabeth Bennet and she's one of the<br>
              greatest, most complex characters ever<br>
              written, not that you would know.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              As a matter of fact I've read it.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Well, good for you.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I think you'd discover a lot of things if<br>
              you really knew me.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              If I really knew you, I know what I would<br>
              find -- instead of a brain, a cash<br>
              register, instead of a heart, a bottom<br>
              line.</p>
            <p> Kathleen is shocked at herself.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              What is it?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I just had a breakthrough, and I have to<br>
              thank you for it. For the first time in<br>
              my life, when confronted with a horrible,<br>
              insensitive person I actually knew what I<br>
              wanted to say and I said it.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I think you have a gift for it. It was a<br>
              splendid mixture of poetry and meanness.</p>
            <p><br>
              KATHLEEN<br>
              Meanness? Let me tell you --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Don't misunderstand me, I'm just paying<br>
              you a compliment.</p>
            <p> He lifts the book off the table. Kathleen grabs for it.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Why are you doing this?</p>
            <p> She manages to get the book, leaving Joe with the rose.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              What have we have? A red, no, crimson<br>
              rose, tucked into the pages. Something<br>
              you read about in a book, no doubt. One<br>
              of those books with a lady in a nightgown<br>
              on the cover about to throw herself off a<br>
              cliff.</p>
            <p> She holds her hand out for it.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (cont'd)<br>
              Give it to me.</p>
            <p> Joe puts it between his mouth and his nose like a mustache.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              It's a joke to you, isn't it?<br>
              Everything's a joke to you.</p>
            <p> She grabs the rose. Puts it back in the book.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (cont'd)<br>
              Please leave. I beg you.</p>
            <p> He stands up, walks from the table, sits down at the very<br>
              next table, with his back to her.</p>
            <p> The door to the restaurant opens. Kathleen looks at it<br>
              hopefully. A pleasant looking man, who's immediately joined<br>
              by a pleasant looking woman.</p>
            <p> For a moment, Kathleen looks just a little droopy, as if the<br>
              wind has just gone out of her sails. She takes out her<br>
              compact, looks into her mirror. She slides it over to look<br>
              behind her, at him, just as he's looking sideways at her. He<br>
              turns away suddenly.</p>
            <p> Then she blots her lipstick with her handkerchief.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              You know what the handkerchief reminds<br>
              me of? The first day I met you --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              The first day you lied to me --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I didn't lie to you --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              You did too --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I did not --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I thought all that Fox stuff was so<br>
              charming. F-O-X.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I never lied about it --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              &quot;Joe. Just call me Joe.&quot; As if you were<br>
              one of those stupid 22-year-old girls<br>
              with no last name. &quot;Hi, I'm Kimberley.&quot;<br>
              &quot;Hi, I'm Janice.&quot; What's wrong with<br>
              them? Don't they know you're supposed to<br>
              have last names? It's like they're a<br>
              whole generation of cocktail waitresses.</p>
            <p> She stops herself -- it's a tangent she never meant to go off<br>
              on. But Joe has stood up and seated himself back at her table.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I am not a stupid 22-year-old girl --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              That's not what I meant --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              And when I said the thing about the Price<br>
              Club and cans of olive oil, that wasn't<br>
              what I meant either --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Oh, you poor sad multimillionaire. I<br>
              feel so sorry for you.</p>
            <p> The door opens and a large and very attractive TRANSVESTITE<br>
              in a boa comes in the door.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I am going to take a wild guess that this<br>
              isn't him, either. Who is he, I wonder.<br>
              Not, I gather, the world's greatest<br>
              living expert on Julius and Ethel<br>
              Rosenberg, but someone else entirely.<br>
              Will you be you be mean to him too? Will<br>
              you start out sweet as sugar candy and<br>
              then suddenly, miraculously, like a bolt<br>
              from the blue, find that sharp little <br>
              tongue of yours?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              No, I won't. Because the man who's<br>
              coming here tonight is completely unlike<br>
              you. The man who is coming here is kind<br>
              and funny -- he has the most wonderful<br>
              sense of humor --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              But he's not here.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              If he's not here, he has a reason,<br>
              because there is not a cruel or careless<br>
              bone in his body. I can't expect you to<br>
              know anything about a person like that.<br>
              You've nothing but a suit.</p>
            <p> A beat. Joe gets up.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              That is my cue. Good night.</p>
            <p> Joe leaves.</p>
            <p> EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING -- LATER THAT NIGHT</p>
            <p> Kathleen comes down the street. She drops the rose in the<br>
              trash can.</p>
            <p> INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - A MINUTE LATER</p>
            <p> Kathleen comes in, drops the book on the table, takes off her<br>
              coat and goes immediately to the computer. She clicks on<br>
              American Online. Waits impatiently to connect. Looks with<br>
              anticipation at the mail box.</p>
            <p> THE COMPUTER SCREEN - NO MAIL</p>
            <p> Hold on Kathleen as a tear starts down her face.</p>
            <p> She takes her handkerchief out of her sleeve and wipes her<br>
              face and blows her nose. Then looks at her handkerchief and<br>
              tosses it over her shoulder.</p>
            <p> She goes over to the bed and turns it down and slips out of<br>
              her shoes.</p>
            <p> Then she lies down on the bed, fully clothed. She reaches<br>
              up to turn out the light.</p>
            <p> INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As Joe turns on his closet light and hangs up his jacket.<br>
              The computer is on the desk, and the light on it illuminates<br>
              the room.</p>
            <p> Patricia is in the next room, eating matzos.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA (O.C.)<br>
              So I said to her, &quot;If you think I will<br>
              even talk to you about paying that kind<br>
              of advance for an author whose last book<br>
              is being used as trivets all over the<br>
              world, you are completely crazy.&quot;</p>
            <p> On Joe's face, barely bearing.</p>

            <p>FADE IN ON:</p>
            <p> CYBERSPACE</p>
            <p> We have a sense of cyberspace-travel as we hurtle through a<br>
              sky that's just beginning to get light. There are a few<br>
              stars but they fade and the sky turns a milky blue and a big<br>
              computer sun starts to rise.</p>
            <p> We continue hurtling through space and see that we're heading<br>
              over a computer version of the New York City skyline. We<br>
              move over Central Park. It's fall and the leaves are<br>
              glorious reds and yellows.</p>
            <p> We reach the West Side of Manhattan and move swiftly down<br>
              Broadway with its stores and gyms and movies theatres and<br>
              turn onto a street in the West 80s.</p>
            <p> Hold in front of a New York brownstone.</p>
            <p> At the bottom of the screen a small rectangle appears and the<br>
              words:</p>
            <p> ADDING ART</p>
            <p> As the rectangle starts to fill with color, we see a percentage<br>
              increase from 0% to 100%. When it hits 100% the image pops and <br>
              we are in real life.</p>
            <p> EXT. NEW YORK BROWNSTONE - DAY</p>
            <p> Early morning in New York. A couple of runners pass on their<br>
              way to Riverside Drive Park.</p>
            <p> We go through the brownstone window into:</p>
            <p> INT. KATHLEEN KELLY'S APARTMENT - DAY</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN KELLY is asleep. Kathleen, 30, is as pretty and<br>
              fresh as a spring day. Her bedroom cozy, has a queen-sized<br>
              bed and a desk with a computer on it. Bookshelves line every<br>
              inch of wall space and overflow with books. Framed on the<br>
              children's classic. Madeleine.</p>
            <p> As Kathleen wakes up, her boyfriend FRANK NAVASKY walks into<br>
              the room. He wears blue jeans and a workshirt. He's carrying<br>
              the New York Times.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Good morning.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              (as he reads)<br>
              Listen to this -- the entire work force<br>
              of the state of Virginia had to have<br>
              solitaire removed from their computers --</p>
            <p> Kathleen gets out of bed and goes to brush her teeth in the<br>
              bathroom, and we stay with Frank.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              (continuing)<br>
              -- because they hadn't done any work in<br>
              six weeks.</p>
            <p> Kathleen comes out of the bathroom in her robe.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Aren't you late?</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              (continuing)<br>
              You know what this is, you know what<br>
              we're seeing here? We're seeing the end<br>
              of Western civilization as we know it.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              This is so sad.</p>
            <p> She tosses him his jacket.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              (points at her computer)<br>
              You think that machine is your friend,<br>
              but it's not.<br>
              (checks his watch)<br>
              I'm late.</p>
            <p> INT. LIVING ROOM - KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> As Frank walks to the apartment door. We see a charming room<br>
              with a couch, fireplace, books, and a dining table with a <br>
              typewriter with a cover on it.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (O.C.)<br>
              I'll see you tonight.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              Sushi.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (O.C.)<br>
              Great. Bye.</p>
            <p> Frank goes out the door. It closes.</p>
            <p> Kathleen tiptoes into the hall and looks through the fish-eye<br>
              peephole watching as he goes down the stairs, disappearing<br>
              from sight. She walks into:</p>
            <p> INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> And looks out the front window as Frank walks out onto the<br>
              street and turns toward Broadway.</p>
            <p> He's gone. Good.</p>
            <p> She sits down at her computer. An expression of anticipation<br>
              and guilty pleasure as she clicks the mouse.</p>
            <p> INT. COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY</p>
            <p> As we see the logo for America On Line come up and Kathleen's<br>
              code name: Shopgirl. She logs on and the computer makes all<br>
              its little modem noises as the computer dials the access<br>
              number and connects and we hear the machine:</p>
            <p> COMPUTER<br>
              Welcome.</p>
            <p> And we see Kathleen, listening for the words she's waiting to<br>
              hear:</p>
            <p> COMPUTER (cont'd)<br>
              You've got mail.</p>
            <p> And Kathleen smiles as her mail page comes up:</p>
            <p> INT. COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY</p>
            <p> We see a list of letters:</p>
            <p> Big Cash Op: You can make $$$ in your spare time. OIL MKT: You<br>
              can turn $20 into $20,000 THIS REALLY WORKS U CAN DO IT: <br>
              Maximize your selling ability nowwwww!!! NY152 Brinkley</p>
            <p> Kathleen hits the &quot;delete&quot; key and the first three letters 
              --<br>
              all of them junk-mail -- are deleted and drop offscreen.</p>
            <p> Then she selects the &quot;Read Mail&quot; key for &quot;NY 152 
              Brinkley&quot;.</p>
            <p> And the letter comes up:<br>
              To: Shopgirl<br>
              From: NY152<br>
              Re: Brinkley</p>
            <p> Kathleen starts to read the letter aloud:</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Brinkley is my dog. He loves the streets<br>
              of New York as much as I do --</p>
            <p> And now we hear Kathleen's voice replaced by the voice of<br>
              NY 152, a man named JOE FOX --</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O.)<br>
              -- although he likes to eat bits of pizza<br>
              and bagel off the sidewalk, and I prefer<br>
              to buy them. Brinkley is a great catcher<br>
              and was offered a tryout on the Mets farm<br>
              team --<br>
              (continued)</p>
            <p> INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - DAY</p>
            <p> A dog is sitting on a large green pillow on the floor. This<br>
              is BRINKLEY. The pillow has &quot;Brinkley&quot; embroidered on 
              it.<br>
              Brinkley's master, JOE FOX, a great-looking guy, full of<br>
              charm and irony, comes into the kitchen and pours himself<br>
              some orange juice. He's half-dressed.</p>
            <p> JOE (cont'd)<br>
              -- but he chose to stay with me so that<br>
              he could spend 18 hours a day sleeping on<br>
              a large green pillow the size of an inner<br>
              tube. Don't you love New York in the<br>
              fall? It makes me want to buy school<br>
              supplies. I would send you a bouquet of<br>
              newly-sharpened pencils if I knew your<br>
              name and address. On the other hand,<br>
              this not knowing has its charms.</p>
            <p> VOICE<br>
              Darling --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Mmmmmhmmm --</p>
            <p> Joe's girlfriend PATRICIA EDEN, in Armani head to toe, comes<br>
              into the kitchen and turns on the $2000 espresso machine,<br>
              which starts grinding beans. She's carrying the morning<br>
              papers.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              I'm late.<br>
              (indicating the newspaper)<br>
              Random House fired Dick Atkins. Good<br>
              riddance. Murray Chilton died. Which<br>
              makes one less person I'm not speaking <br>
              to --<br>
              (she drains a cup of espresso<br>
              as a second starts to come out of the machine)<br>
              Vince got a great review. He'll be<br>
              insufferable. Tonight, PEN dinner --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Am I going?</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              You promised.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Can't I just give them money? That's the<br>
              cause? Free Albanian writers? I'm for<br>
              that.</p>
            <p> Patricia drains another cup of espresso, looks at him.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              All right, I'll go. You're late.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              I know I know I know.</p>
            <p> She tears out of the kitchen and the door slams behind her.</p>
            <p> Hold on Joe, listening as he hears the elevator door open and<br>
              close on the landing outside.</p>
            <p> IT. JOE'S DEN - DAY</p>
            <p> As he comes in and sits down at his laptop computer and logs <br>
              on.</p>
            <p> JOE &amp; THE COMPUTER (TOGETHER)<br>
              Welcome... You've got mail.</p>
            <p> And as he starts to read his letter, we hear:</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>
              I like to start my notes to you as if<br>
              we're already in the middle of a<br>
              conversation. I pretend that we're <br>
              the oldest and dearest friends --<br>
              as opposed to what we actually are,<br>
              people who don't know each other's names<br>
              and met in a Chat Room where we both<br>
              claimed we'd never been before.</p>
            <p> INT. JOE'S ELEVATOR - DAY</p>
            <p> As Joe, dressed for work, takes the elevator down with his<br>
              elevator man CHARLIE. There's a certain amount of Good<br>
              morning, etc., as the elevator goes down and the voice-over<br>
              continues:</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O., CONTINUES)<br>
              What will he say today, I wonder. I turn<br>
              on my computer, I wait impatiently as it<br>
              boots up.</p>
            <p> EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE - DAY</p>
            <p> As Joe comes out of his building.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O., CONTINUES)<br>
              I go on line, and my breath catches in my<br>
              chest until I hear three little words:<br>
              You've got mail.</p>
            <p> And the camera now pans from 152 Riverside uptown to:</p>
            <p> EXT. NEW YORK BROWNSTONE - MORNING</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O., CONTINUES)<br>
              I hear nothing, not even a sound on the<br>
              streets of New York, just the beat of my<br>
              own heart. I have mail. From you.</p>
            <p> EXT. BROADWAY - MORNING</p>
            <p> As Kathleen comes onto Broadway at the corner of 83rd Street<br>
              and starts downtown.</p>
            <p> Through a long lens we can see Joe, walking into blocks behind<br>
              her.</p>
            <p> As Kathleen and Joe make their way down Broadway we see the<br>
              West Side of Manhattan in the morning. Mothers and fathers<br>
              taking their kids to school, people on their way to work,<br>
              dogs being walked. School buses picking up kids, bakery<br>
              trucks dropping off brown bags of bread in the doorframes of<br>
              unopened restaurants.</p>
            <p> Kathleen stops at a newsstand, says good morning to the <br>
              newsstand dealer, and picks up a New York Times.</p>
            <p> Metal grates are pulled up to open flower shops, nail salons,<br>
              the pharmacy, fish store, the Cuban Chinese Restaurant,<br>
              Zabar's.</p>
            <p> Joe stops at the same newsstand. He buys all the papers --<br>
              the Times, Wall Street Journal, Post and Daily News.</p>
            <p> INT. STARBUCKS - DAY</p>
            <p> As Kathleen picks up her coffee, walks out.</p>
            <p> EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY</p>
            <p> As Kathleen walks down Columbus, we see Joe a block behind<br>
              her. She stops to buy flowers and Joe passes her, crosses to<br>
              the Ease side of Columbus Avenue.</p>
            <p> EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY</p>
            <p> A building under construction, with plywood board covering<br>
              the front and wrapping around the corner. Joe goes to a side<br>
              entrance and enters.</p>
            <p> EXT. COLUMBUS &amp; 73RD STREET - DAY - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> As Kathleen comes around the corner onto 73rd and stops in<br>
              front of her store, a children's bookstore called &quot;The Shop<br>
              Around the Corner.&quot; It is an irresistibly inviting store.<br>
              There are twinkle lights in the windows, framing large<br>
              stuffed animals reading children's books: Madeleine, Good<br>
              Night Moon, Where the Wild Things Are. A teddy bear in a <br>
              pinafore is reading The Stupids Step Out. Waiting for<br>
              Kathleen in front is one of her employees, CHRISTINA.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Hello, Christina. It's a beautiful day.<br>
              Isn't it the most beautiful day?</p>
            <p> Christina looks up at the sky as if seeing it for the first<br>
              time.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              I guess. Yeah, sure.</p>
            <p> Kathleen unlocks the shop and cranks the grate, which<br>
              rises, making a horrible noise. Two cabs almost collide in<br>
              front of the store, with a screech, and one cabdriver starts<br>
              yelling obscenities at the other. Kathleen unlocks the door<br>
              to the store.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Don't you love New York in the fall?</p>
            <p> Christina looks at her puzzled.</p>
            <p> INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> Kathleen turns the CLOSED sign on the door over to read<br>
              &quot;OPEN&quot; and she activates the computer system. She looks<br>
              around, and we see a small but charming children's bookstore,<br>
              with wooden shelves, a tiny area where kids can sit and read,<br>
              some charming posters and a glass case full of first editions<br>
              of the Oz books and Alice In Wonderland, etc. There's a <br>
              playful display of witches, lit with twinkle lights covered<br>
              with orange pumpkin globes and a sign reading &quot;The Ten Best<br>
              Witch List&quot; and a collection of witch books -- &quot;The Lion, 
              The <br>
              Witch and the Wardrobe,&quot; &quot;The Witches,&quot; &quot;The 
              Wizard of Oz.&quot;<br>
              On the counter is a glass jar full of sugar-free lollipops.</p>
            <p> Kathleen hangs up her coat in the back of the store and<br>
              suddenly stops to daydream. A smile creeps onto her face.<br>
              Christina looks at her.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              What's going on with you?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Nothing.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              You're in love.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              In love? No. Yes. Of course I am.<br>
              I'm in love with Frank. I'm practically<br>
              living with Frank. Do you think you<br>
              could get our Christmas mailers out this<br>
              week?</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              By Monday I promise. I have a paper due<br>
              Friday. Now what's going on?<br>
              (she looks at Kathleen)<br>
              I'm just going to stand here till you tell<br>
              me.</p>
            <p> A beat.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Is it infidelity if you're involved with<br>
              someone on E-mail?</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Have you had sex?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Of course not. I don't even know him.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              I mean cybersex.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              No!</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Well, don't do it. The minute you do,<br>
              they lose all respect for you.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              It's not like that. We just E-mail.<br>
              It's really nothing, on top of which I'm<br>
              definitely thinking of stopping because<br>
              it's getting --</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Out of hand?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Confusing. But not really. Because it's<br>
              nothing.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Where did you meet him?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I can't even remember.<br>
              (off Christina's look)<br>
              The day I turned thirty I wandered into<br>
              the Over Thirty Room for a joke, sort of<br>
              and he was there, and we started <br>
              chatting.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              About what?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Books. Music. How much we both love New<br>
              York. Harmless. Harmless. Meaningless.<br>
              (starts smiling)<br>
              Bouquets of sharpened pencils.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Excuse me?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Forget it. We don't talk about anything<br>
              personal. We made a rule about that.<br>
              I don't know his name, what he does or<br>
              exactly where he lives, so it will be<br>
              really easy to stop seeing him, because<br>
              I'm not.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              God, he could be the next person to talk<br>
              into the store. He could be...<br>
              (as George walks in)<br>
              George.</p>
            <p> GEORGE PAPPAS, in his twenties, one of Kathleen's <br>
              salespeople, is a cute guy who has no idea that he's supposed<br>
              to look in the mirror when he gets dressed.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              Morning.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Are you On Line?</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              As far as I'm concerned, the Internet is<br>
              just another way to be rejected by a <br>
              woman.</p>
            <p> BIRDIE walks in. She is in her seventies, has white hair,<br>
              and is tiny, like a little sparrow. She is the store's<br>
              oldest employee, having worked there for over forty years,<br>
              and serves as a accountant as well as salesperson.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Good morning, Birdie.</p>
            <p> BIRDIE<br>
              What are you all talking about?</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Cybersex.</p>
            <p> BIRDIE<br>
              I tried to have cybersex once but I kept<br>
              getting a busy signal.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              I know, I know. One Saturday night I was<br>
              really depressed about not having a date,<br>
              so I thought, no problemo, I'll go on<br>
              line and I won't be lonely, but I <br>
              couldn't get on, there were hundreds of<br>
              thousands of people who didn't have dates<br>
              trying to get on.<br>
              (MORE)<br>
              You have to wonder which is harder,<br>
              getting a date or getting On Line when<br>
              you don't have a date.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              Getting a date is harder.</p>
            <p> We hear the bell jingle as TWO WEST SIDE MOTHERS come in with 
              two KIDS IN STROLLERS.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              (to the kids)<br>
              Jessica and Maia, how are you today?</p>
            <p> We hear the sound of the garbage truck. Kathleen goes out<br>
              the front door to:</p>

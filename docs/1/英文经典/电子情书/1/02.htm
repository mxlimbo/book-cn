            <p> As the commercial garbage truck pulls up and TWO GARBAGEMEN start 
              to load her trash.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Hey, you forgot to pick up the garbage<br>
              last week and I got a ticket. And you're<br>
              late today -- I could have gotten<br>
              another.</p>
            <p> GARBAGEMAN #1<br>
              We were here, there was no garbage.</p>
            <p> GARBAGEMAN #2<br>
              Yeah.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Of course there was --</p>
            <p> GARBAGEMAN #1<br>
              What do you think, I don't want to pick<br>
              up garbage? You think I go up and down<br>
              the street picking up garbage, I'm not<br>
              going to pick up yours? What's the<br>
              matter with you?</p>
            <p> GARBAGEMAN #2<br>
              Yeah.</p>
            <p> Kathleen is standing there, tongue-tied.<br>
              <br>
              GARBAGEMAN #1<br>
              You don't even bundle it right, you're<br>
              supposed to bundle it and leave it near<br>
              the curb, you leave it near the store<br>
              and you use cheap garbage bags, they<br>
              smear all over the place, and then I got<br>
              to pick it up with my shovel --</p>
            <p> INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> As Christina, who's helping one of the customers, looks out<br>
              the window as the harangue continues.</p>

            <p> GARBAGEMAN #1<br>
              And now you're busting my chops. You're<br>
              just another garbage pick-up to us, okay?</p>
            <p> GARBAGEMAN #2<br>
              Yeah.</p>
            <p> As Kathleen continues to stand there, speechless.</p>

            <p> As Kathleen comes back into the store. Christina is ringing<br>
              up a sale.</p>

              That guy went ballistic on me.</p>

              I hope you told him off.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Not exactly.</p>
            <p> Another customer enters the store. The bell jingles.</p>
            <p> EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE ON COLUMBUS - DAY</p>
            <p> A little truck carrying a knife sharpener, its bells ringing,<br>
              passes the building under construction.</p>
            <p> INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY</p>
            <p> WORKERS, ELECTRICIANS, MASONS, CARPENTERS, etc. in the process 
              of building what looks like a large store. Wires<br>
              hanging everywhere.</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              The electrical contractor called. His<br>
              truck hit a deer last night, he won't be<br>
              in 'til tomorrow. The shelves are late<br>
              because the shipment of pine had beetles.<br>
              And there's some question about whether<br>
              we're installing the stairs in the right<br>
              spot --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              That sounds great.</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              Testing one two three four.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Is the electrician here?</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              I just told you -- he hit a deer.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I hear nothing. Not a sound on the city<br>
              streets, just the beat of my own heart.<br>
              I think that's the way it goes.<br>
              Something like that.</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              (beginning to glean something)<br>
              Did you and Patricia get engaged?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Engaged? Are you crazy?</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              I thought you liked Patricia --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I love Patricia. Patricia's amazing.<br>
              Patricia makes coffee nervous.<br>
              (suddenly all business)<br>
              Are we still on schedule?</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              We open two weeks before Thanksgiving.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I guess we should announce ourselves<br>
              soon. Tell people we're coming.</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              This is the Upper West Side of Manhattan.<br>

              They hate us in the beginning, but we <br>
              get them in the end. Meanwhile we <br>
              should just put up a sign -- Coming soon, <br>

            <p> Joe is in the office with his father, NELSON FOX, and his<br>
              grandfather, SCHUYLER FOX. The office has been recently<br>
              redecorated; everything is new and a little overdone.</p>
            <p> On the wall we see the Foxbooks logo.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Kevin and I are both a little concerned<br>
              about the neighborhood response --<br>
              (suddenly notices the garish couch)<br>
              What is this fabric? Does it have a<br>
              name?</p>
            <p> NELSON<br>
              Money. Its name is money.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Gillian selected it.</p>
            <p> NELSON<br>
              Of course.</p>
            <p> SCHUYLER<br>
              Your father is getting married again.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Oh, great, congratulations, Dad. Why?</p>
            <p> NELSON<br>
              Who knows? Why does anyone get married?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Love.</p>
            <p> NELSON<br>
              Yes, that is one reason.</p>
            <p> SCHUYLER<br>
              I think you're a damn fool.</p>
            <p> NELSON<br>
              Dad, Matthew is four. It would be nice<br>
              for him if his parents were married.</p>
            <p> SCHUYLER<br>
              Annabel is eight and I'm not married to<br>
              her mother. I can't even remember her<br>
              mother's name.<br>
              (he laughs merrily)</p>
            <p> JOE<br>

              new store.</p>
            <p> NELSON<br>
              How much are your paying?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Whatever it costs, it won't be as much as<br>
              this exquisite mohair episode.<br>
              (indicates the couch)<br>
              We're also going to have a section on<br>

              -- as a sop to the neighborhood.</p>
            <p> NELSON<br>
              Perfect. It'll keep those West Side<br>
              liberal nut pseudo-intellectual bleeding<br>
              hearts --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Readers. They're called readers.</p>
            <p> NELSON<br>
              Don't romanticize them. It'll keep them<br>
              from jumping down your throat --</p>

              One mystery store. Sleuth, on 86th and<br>
              Amsterdam. And a children's bookstore.<br>

              Who's that?</p>
            <p> SCHUYLER<br>
              Cecilia Kelly, lovely woman. I think we<br>
              might have had a date once. Or maybe we<br>
              just exchange letters.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              You wrote her letters?</p>
            <p> SCHUYLER<br>
              Mail. It was called mail.</p>
            <p> NELSON<br>
              (fondly nostalgic and kidding it slightly)<br>
              Stamps. Envelopes.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Wait. I've heard of it. It was a means<br>
              of communication before I was born.</p>
            <p> NELSON<br>
              Exactly.</p>
            <p> SCHUYLER<br>
              Cecilia had beautiful penmanship.<br>
              She was too young for me, but she was...<br>
              enchanting. Her daughter owns it now.</p>

            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>
              Once I read a story about a butterfly in<br>
              the subway, and today I saw one. I<br>
              couldn't believe it. It got on at 42nd<br>
              --<br>
              (continued)</p>
            <p> The train comes to a stop. The butterfly flies out.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>
              -- and got off at 59th, where I assume it<br>
              was going to Bloomindale's to buy a hat<br>
              that will turn out to be a mistake. As<br>
              almost all hats are.</p>
            <p> EXT. H &amp; H BAGELS - NIGHT</p>
            <p> A flour truck is unloading flour into a hole in the ground.</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O.)<br>
              Did you know that every night a truck<br>
              pulls up to H&amp;H Bagels and pumps about a<br>
              ton of flour into the ground? The air is<br>
              absolutely amazing.</p>
            <p> As Joe comes around the corner and sees the dust filling the<br>
              air. It is amazing.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>

              I think about my favorite book I always<br>

            <p> JOE (V.O., cont'd)<br>
              There's a doughnut machine in it that<br>
              won't stop making doughnuts, they just<br>
              keep coming down the chute just as<br>

              regular as a clock can tick.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)<br>
              There's a doughnut machine right in the<br>
              window that makes 110 dozen doughnuts an<br>
              hour.</p>

            <p> We can hear the sounds of Starbucks: &quot;Short decaf cap,&quot; 
              &quot;Tall<br>
              mocha latte.&quot; &quot;Grande lowfat regular.&quot; Etc.</p>
            <p> EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - A HALF HOUR LATER</p>
            <p> The painter is further along on the sign. It now reads:<br>
              COMING SOON, A FOXBOOKS SU --</p>
            <p> Kathleen walks past the construction site. She doesn't<br>
              really pay attention to the sign painter.</p>
            <p> We see two police cars barreling up 75th Street, followed by<br>
              a television news truck.</p>
            <p> EXT. BROADWAY - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> The police cars and TV truck barrel uptown.</p>
            <p> EXT. 101st STREET - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> They turn left onto West 101st and stop in front of an<br>
              apartment building on the block. There are more police cars<br>
              and a horde of television reporters with microphones, etc.</p>
            <p> George emerges from the building as a newscaster broadcasts.</p>
            <p> TV REPORTER<br>
              The body of a woman was found this<br>
              morning on the roof of a New York<br>
              building...</p>
            <p> As George comes out of his building into a horde of REPORTERS<br>
              with microphones, cameras, etc. and listens to the reporter,<br>
              who, seeing George, sticks the microphone into his face.</p>
            <p> TV REPORTER<br>
              Here is a resident of the building. Your name, please?</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              George Pappas.</p>
            <p> REPORTER<br>
              Did you see or hear anything unusual last night?</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              No. I didn't go out.</p>
            <p> At that moment, George sees a young woman. This is MEREDITH<br>
              CARTER. He is struck dumb.</p>
            <p> REPORTER<br>
              The victim was red-haired, about thirty-<br>
              five, wearing a jogging suit. Did you<br>
              encounter anyone by that description<br>
              in the building? Sir?</p>
            <p> George hasn't heard a word.</p>
            <p> REPORTER<br>
              Have there been any wild parties <br>
              lately?</p>
            <p> George doesn't answer.</p>
            <p> REPORTER<br>
              Could it perhaps be one of your<br>
              neighbors?</p>
            <p> George continues to stare at the beautiful woman. As he<br>
              does, she notices him. She stares back. The reporter,<br>
              ignored, finally turns away.</p>
            <p> REPORTER<br>
              (to camera)<br>
              As you can see, no one here knows anything.</p>
            <p> He continues to stand there, dumbstruck for a moment.<br>
              Meredith Carter starts to walk away.</p>

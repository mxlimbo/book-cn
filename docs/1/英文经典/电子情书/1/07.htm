            <p> INT. GEORGE'S APARTMENT - A SHORT WHILE LATER</p>
            <p> They come into the apartment. She throws herself into his<br>
              arms.</p>
            <p> EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE PARK - DAY</p>
            <p> As Christina runs, desperately trying to make eye contact<br>
              with men running in the opposite direction. No one will look<br>
              at her.</p>
            <p> INT. ZABAR'S CHEESE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The place is mobbed -- the usual crush the night before<br>
              Thanksgiving.</p>
            <p> Kathleen, pushing a shopping cart, is trying to wedge her way<br>
              through the crowd in the cheese department. As she reaches<br>
              across three people to grab some Brie, she sees Joe walk into<br>
              the store. Quickly, she turns her back so he can't see her.<br>
              She stands there frozen. A beat...</p>
            <p> Peeks around, doesn't see him anywhere. Cranes her neck this<br>
              way and that. No Joe.</p>
            <p> INT. ZABAR'S CASHIER AREA - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> Kathleen, now wearing dark glasses but looking not at all<br>
              disguised, looks around and spots a short line and makes a<br>
              beeline for it.</p>
            <p> At that moment, Joe comes from the Appetizing Department and<br>
              gets on the line she was heading for.</p>
            <p> Panicked, Kathleen retreats onto another line and stands with<br>
              her back to him.</p>
            <p> INT. SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER</p>
            <p> The CASHIER totals up Kathleen's purchases and Kathleen hands<br>
              over her credit card.</p>
            <p> CASHIER<br>
              This is a Cash Only line.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> CASHIER<br>
              Cash Only.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Omigod, I only have a credit card. Is<br>
              that okay?</p>
            <p> PERSON BEHIND HER IN LINE<br>
              Of course it's not okay, there's a sign.</p>
            <p> CASHIER<br>
              There's a sign.</p>
            <p> PERSON IN LINE<br>
              (to the person behind her)<br>
              She doesn't have cash.</p>
            <p> &quot;She doesn't have cash&quot; is repeated all the way down 
              the line.</p>
            <p> Joe turns to see what's going on.</p>
            <p> ANOTHER PERSON<br>
              Get on another line, lady.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Oh, hello.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Hello.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Do you need some money?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              No, I don't need any money. Thank you<br>
              very much.</p>
            <p> CASHIER<br>
              Get on another line.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Hi.<br>
              (off her nametag, big smile)<br>
              Rose. Great name. Rose, this is<br>
              Kathleen, I'm Joe, and this is a credit<br>
              card machine. Happy Thanksgiving.</p>
            <p> Rose just stares at him.</p>
            <p> JOE (cont'd)<br>
              Now it's your turn to say happy<br>
              Thanksgiving back.</p>
            <p> ROSE<br>
              Happy Thanksgiving back.</p>
            <p> Joe looks at her, winks.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Mississippi is a hard word to spell. How<br>
              do you spell it? I-T.<br>
              (big smile)<br>
              Now take this credit card and put it<br>
              through the machine, zip zip.</p>
            <p> The cashier, completely charmed, takes Kathleen's credit<br>
              card.</p>
            <p> Kathleen is appalled.</p>
            <p> Everyone on the line signs irritably and audibly.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              So you're fine.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Fine.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Happy Thanksgiving.</p>
            <p> As Kathleen signs the charge slip and the cashier exasperatedly<br>
              starts to put her groceries into a bag.</p>
            <p> INT. JOE'S FATHER'S APARTMENT - THANKSGIVING DAY</p>
            <p> An elegant East Side apartment. Schuyler, his youngish<br>
              French wife, YVETTE, Nelson, Gillian and their child Matt,<br>
              and Joe are sitting and listening as Annabel sings Tomorrow.</p>
            <p> ANNABEL<br>
              The sun'll come up tomorrow, bet your<br>
              bottom dollar that tomorrow, there'll be<br>
              sun --</p>
            <p> Joe is on a loveseat with Matt. Gillian lifts Matt up, sits<br>
              down in his place next to Joe and plunks Matt into her lap.<br>
              Nelson is already seated in a chair in front of the loveseat<br>
              and can't see her without turning around.</p>
            <p> As she continues singing, Gillian moves her hand next to<br>
              Joe's leg. Joe edges away. He looks around the room, sees<br>
              Nanny Maureen standing behind the couch. He stands, offers<br>
              her his seat. She sits.</p>
            <p> INT. KATHLEEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> A much more informal Thanksgiving dinner. We see the<br>
              leftovers on a sideboard near a round table in Kathleen's<br>
              living room.</p>
            <p> Kathleen, Frank, Birdie, Christina, George and George's new<br>
              girlfriend, Meredith and TWO OTHER FRIENDS are standing<br>
              around the upright piano. Birdie is playing a Christmas<br>
              song, and everyone is singing.</p>
            <p> As the singing continues, over, we cut to:</p>
            <p> EXT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DECEMBER DAY</p>
            <p> As the Christmas decorations and twinkle lights go into the<br>
              window.</p>
            <p> Birdie walks by the store. She stops to look at the<br>
              customers inside, and then notices a sign in the window:</p>
            <p> &quot;Book Signing January 10 - Best Selling Children's Author<br>
              Laura Margulies.&quot; There's a picture of Laura Margulies.</p>
            <p> EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DECEMBER DUSK</p>
            <p> Kathleen is in the window decorating a little tree with<br>
              lovely decorations from a box. Two people are carrying a<br>
              tree home, there's the sound of church bells.</p>
            <p> Kathleen looks up as a couple of people walk past the store,<br>
              carrying Foxbooks shopping bags.</p>
            <p> Then she unwraps a pair of ruby slipper ornaments, and as she<br>
              starts to hang them on the tree we hear the sound of the<br>
              computer.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>
              This is such an odd Christmas. I find<br>
              myself missing my mother, who's been dead<br>
              for ten years. New York at Christmas is<br>
              so loaded with all the things we used to<br>
              do --</p>
            <p> INT. NEW YORK STATE THEATER - 1972 - DAY</p>
            <p> As Young Kathleen, dressed in a little velvet dress, sits in<br>
              the audience next to her mother watching the ballet.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O. cont'd)<br>

              -- ice skating at Rockefeller Center,<br>
              where I was knocked into a 6-year-old<br>
              maniac --</p>
            <p> A SIX-YEAR-OLD BOY knocks into her.</p>
            <p> YOUNG KATHLEEN<br>
              Hey, watch out --</p>
            <p> SIX-YEAR-OLD BOY<br>
              Me watch out, why don't you watch out?<br>
              I'm not sliding around like a baby. You<br>
              think I come here to skate with babies?</p>
            <p> Young Kathleen's jaw drops and she stands there tongue-tied.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>
              My first experience as a speechless<br>
              person.</p>
            <p> Her mother skates up and takes her hand. The boy skates off.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>
              I always miss my mother at Christmas, but<br>
              somehow it's worse this year since I need<br>
              some advice from her.</p>
            <p> And we hear the sound of another computer.</p>
            <p> INT. JOE'S DEN</p>
            <p> As he replies to Kathleen.</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O.)<br>
              My mother took me ice skating too --</p>
            <p> EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER SKATING RINK - DAY</p>
            <p> We see a little boy, YOUNG JOE, 8, skate past holding someone's<br>
              hand --</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O., cont'd)<br>
              -- although my mother did not skate. The<br>
              nanny skated --</p>
            <p> And we now see JOE'S NANNY, a young Sonja Henie, who suddenly 
              peels off into a series of triple lutzes, as JOE'S MOTHER<br>
              absently reads a copy of Vogue in the spectators' section.</p>
            <p> INT. LINCOLN CENTER THEATER - 1972 - DAY</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O.)<br>
              And I was in the Nutcracker.</p>
            <p> We see the stage now. There's Young Joe, among the children<br>
              at the Christmas party.</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O., cont'd)<br>
              So was my nanny.</p>
            <p> As JOE'S NANNY #2 pirouettes past.</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O., cont'd)<br>
              Different nanny. By the way, I'm<br>
              surprised you aren't a writer. Although<br>
              you probably are a writer and don't<br>
              know it. Are you a writer and I don't <br>
              know it?</p>
            <p> INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - 1972 - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Young Joe, at the dinner table with his father. A wide shot<br>
              of a big room with a huge table and servants. Joe looks very<br>
              small at the table as he eats his soup.</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O., cont'd)<br>
              My mother died when I was ten. I was<br>
              staying with my father, who is not famous<br>
              for intimacy, and whose way of breaking<br>
              the news of her death was to tell me she<br>
              would not be coming to pick me up as<br>
              usual. It was a car accident, and I<br>
              don't know where she was going or who she<br>
              was with, and I assume what I owe her is<br>
              my tendency to cover almost any emotion<br>
              with a joke. A useful gift, unless you<br>
              want to know what you're feeling. She<br>
              was very beautiful. People toss that<br>
              word around a lot, but my mother was.</p>
            <p> The camera moves closer to the dining table. We see that<br>
              tears are rolling down little Joe's cheeks.</p>
            <p> INT. JOE'S DEN - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Joe stops typing. He is surprised to find his eyes watering.<br>
              A moment of confusion as he cannot believe he has moved<br>
              himself to tears. Shakes his head, shakes the emotion off.<br>
              Starts typing again.</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O., cont'd)<br>
              Ancient history. So what kind of advice<br>
              do you need? Can I help?</p>

              now.</p>
            <p> INT. JOE'S BEDROOM - DAY</p>
            <p> Joe is in bed with his laptop. And cut back and forth<br>
              between them and their computer screens as they type Instant<br>

            <p> JOE (V.O., cont'd)<br>
              I can give you advice. I'm great at<br>
              advice.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>

            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>
              My business is in trouble. My mother<br>
              would have something wise to say.</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O.)<br>
              I'm a brilliant businessman. It's what<br>
              I do best. What's your business?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>
              No specifics, remember?</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O.)<br>
              Minus specifics, it's hard to help.<br>
              Except to say, go to the mattresses.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O.)<br>
              It's from The Godfather. It means you<br>

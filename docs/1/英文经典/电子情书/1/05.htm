            <p> EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Frank comes up the stoop.</p>
            <p> INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Kathleen is dressed up for a party.</p>
            <p> Frank walks in, looks meaningfully at her.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              I saw him. I actually saw him.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Who?</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              I can't believe it. I saw William<br>
              Spungeon.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I thought he was in Mexico.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              Maybe he's in Mexico, but today he was in<br>
              New York. The most brilliant and<br>
              reclusive novelist in the history of the<br>
              world is here, in this neighborhood. He<br>
              may be living on this very block.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Where did you see him?</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              I was on the subway --</p>
            <p> INT. SUBWAY - DAY</p>
            <p> FRANK (V.O.)<br>
              -- and this musician got onto the train --</p>
            <p> Frank is sitting on the subway, reading the Village Voice.<br>
              The door between the cars opens and a man playing the <br>
              clarinet enters the car.</p>
            <p> No one looks up except Frank.</p>
            <p> FRANK (V.O.)<br>
              -- and I suddenly saw him, sitting<br>
              directly across from me doing the<br>
              crossword puzzle.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>
              How'd you know it was him?</p>
            <p> FRANK (V.O.)<br>
              He looked exactly the same as his high<br>
              school yearbook picture, which happens to<br>
              be the last photograph ever taken of him.</p>
            <p> Frank takes out his billfold on the subway, pulls out a piece<br>
              of paper.</p>
            <p> CLOSE UP - FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER</p>
            <p> As Frank unfolds a newspaper clipping of a yearbook picture<br>
              of William Spungeon at 17.</p>
            <p> Frank compares the photo of Spungeon with the person sitting<br>
              across the way. They don't look remotely alike except that<br>
              the boy in the picture and the man on the subway are both<br>
              wearing the same style glasses.</p>
            <p> The subway stops at 79th Street, and William Spungeon gets off.<br>
              Frank follows.</p>
            <p> EXT. BROADWAY - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> As Frank comes out of the subway station and looks around.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              So I followed him.</p>
            <p> Frank sees Spungeon cross 79th. He follows.</p>
            <p> EXT. H&amp;H BAGELS - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> Frank follows Spungeon, who hurries into H&amp;H Bagels passing 
              a<br>
              HOMELESS MAN holding a paper cup at the door.</p>
            <p> FRANK (V.O.)<br>
              He went into H&amp;H and bought a bagel<br>
              with everything.</p>
            <p> EXT. H&amp;H BAGELS - A MINUTE LATER</p>
            <p> As Spungeon leaves the store, passing the paper cup, which we<br>
              now realize that Frank, in dark glasses, is holding.</p>
            <p> Spungeon drops his newspaper in a garbage container.</p>
            <p> FRANK (V.O.)<br>
              He dropped his crossword into the <br>
              garbage and I rescued it.</p>
            <p> Frank plucks the puzzle from the trashcan, follows Spungeon.</p>
            <p> INT. SPORTING GOOD STORE - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> Spungeon at the counter in the shoe store.</p>
            <p> FRANK (V.O.)<br>
              Then he went into a sporting good store<br>
              and bought tube socks, 6 pair for $7.99.</p>
            <p> We see Frank, peeking out at him from behind a stack of<br>
              running pants. Suddenly he's distracted by a couple of<br>
              joggers.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>
              William Spungeon and tube socks.</p>
            <p> FRANK (V.O.)<br>
              I know. I don't want to dwell on it.</p>
            <p> Frank looks back at the counter. Spungeon's gone.</p>
            <p> FRANK (V.O.)<br>
              And then I lost him.</p>
            <p> INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - THAT NIGHT</p>
            <p> Frank waves the crossword puzzle in front of Kathleen.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              Do you know what this is worth?</p>
            <p> He takes an empty instant-frame from the closet, puts the<br>
              puzzle into it and sets it next to the typewriters.</p>
            <p> INT. JAPANESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As the two of them eat dinner.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              What I was thinking as I was trailing him<br>
              was that eventually I would have the<br>
              courage to say hello to him, you know,<br>
              not in a horrible, intrusive or slavering<br>
              fan-slash-acolyte kind of way, but more<br>
              like, &quot;Hi.&quot; &quot;How ya doing?&quot; &quot;Have you<br>
              ever thought about trading up in the sock<br>
              area?&quot; &quot;Who knows, maybe he's read my<br>
              work -- and then we'd become friends, and<br>
              eventually I'd introduce him to you --<br>
              you know how much he loves children's<br>
              books, there's a whole long section in<br>
              Relativity's Smile about The Wizard of Oz<br>
              -- and then maybe he'd come out of hiding<br>
              so he could help save the store.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              What are you talking about?</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              From Foxbooks. I mean, if things got<br>
              tough, he could help rally support --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              It's never going to get to that. The<br>
              store is fine.</p>
            <p> EXT. STREET - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As they walk along after dinner.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              I don't even know why you would say that?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Neither do I. It just flew out of my<br>
              mouth.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              There's enough business for us all.</p>
            <p> INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As they go up in an elevator.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I mean, we're fine.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              You're more than fine, you're absolutely<br>
              fine.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              We're fine.</p>
            <p> The elevator opens onto:</p>
            <p> INT. VINCE MANCINI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> A publication party for an author named VINCE MANCINI. A mix<br>
              of book people, journalists and various other media folk.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              Hey, Vince. Congratulations. You know<br>
              Kathleen Kelly.</p>
            <p> VINCE<br>
              How are you?</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              Guess who I saw today on the subway?<br>
              William Spungeon.</p>
            <p> VINCE<br>
              I thought he was in Mexico.</p>
            <p> They start chatting.</p>
            <p> Across the room, Joe is with Patricia, who is telling two<br>
              other people the story of meeting the rabbi in the taxicab.<br>
              Joe looks over and sees Kathleen. He suddenly looks<br>
              stricken.</p>
            <p> Shifts his position so Kathleen can't see his face, but<br>
              sneaks a look.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              Would you get me another drink, sweetie?<br>
              I'm all out.<br>
              (continues chattering)<br>
              So then the rabbi says, &quot;It's a very good<br>
              place to calm down.&quot; Isn't that<br>
              hysterical?</p>
            <p> They all laugh. Joe moves over to the bar.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Absolut on the rocks.</p>
            <p> As he is waiting, Kathleen comes up next to him.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              A white wine, please.<br>
              (very friendly)<br>
              Oh, hello.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Hi.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Remember me, from the bookstore?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Of course I remember you.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              How's your aunt?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Good. She's good.<br>
              (gets his drink)<br>
              I have to deliver this. I have a very<br>
              thirsty date. She's part camel.</p>
            <p> Kathleen laughs.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Joe. It's Joe, isn't it?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              And you're Kathleen.</p>
            <p> Joe vanishes into the party.</p>
            <p> INT. VINCE MANCINI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - A MINUTE LATER</p>
            <p> VINCE<br>
              I can't believe you were talking to Joe<br>
              Fox.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Joe Fox? As in --</p>
            <p> She can't even finish the sentence.</p>
            <p> INT. VINCE MANCINI'S APARTMENT - A COUPLE OF MINUTES LATER</p>
            <p> Joe is standing at a table of food, his back to the room.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Fox? Your last name is Fox?</p>
            <p> Joe spins around, looks at her.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              F-O-X.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              God, I didn't realize. I didn't know who you --<br>
              (she trails off)</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              -- were with.<br>
              (quoting)<br>
              &quot;I didn't know who you were with.&quot;</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Excuse me?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              It's from the Godfather. When the movie<br>
              producer realizes that Tom Hagen is the<br>
              emissary of Vito Corleone --<br>
              (continued)</p>
            <p> Kathleen is staring at him.</p>
            <p> JOE (cont'd)<br>
              -- just before the horse's head ends up<br>
              in his bed never mind --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              You were spying on me, weren't you? You<br>
              probably rented those children.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Why would I spy on you?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I am your competition. Which you know<br>
              perfectly well or you would not have put<br>
              up that sign saying &quot;Just around the<br>
              Corner.&quot;</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              The entrance to our store is around the<br>
              corner. There is no other way to say it.<br>
              It's not the name of our store, it's<br>
              where it is. You don't own &quot;around the<br>
              corner.&quot;</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Next thing you'll be using twinkle<br>
              lights.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Twinkle lights?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Little white Christmas lights that<br>
              twinkle. I use them in my window and on<br>
              all my displays, as if you didn't notice.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Look, the reason I came into your store<br>
              is that I was spending the day with<br>
              Annabel and Matt. I like to buy them a<br>
              present when I see them because I'm one<br>
              of those guys who likes to buy his way<br>
              into the hearts of children who are his<br>
              relatives. There was only one place to<br>
              buy children's books in the neighborhood<br>
              -- although that will not always be the<br>
              case, and it was yours, and it is a<br>
              charming little bookstore. You probably<br>
              sell $250,000 worth of book a year --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              How do you know that?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I'm in the book business.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I'm in the book business --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Oh, I see, and we're the Price Club.<br>
              Only instead of a ten-gallon can of olive<br>
              oil for $3.99 that won't even fit into<br>
              your kitchen cabinet, we're selling cheap<br>
              books. Me a spy.<br>
              (beat)<br>
              Absolutely. And I managed to get my hands<br>
              on a secret printout of the sales figures<br>
              of a bookstore so inconsequential and yet<br>
              full of its own virtue that I was instantly<br>
              compelled to rush over and check it out<br>
              for fear it would drive me out of business <br>
              --</p>
            <p> Kathleen stares at him. She's speechless.</p>
            <p> JOE (cont'd)<br>
              What?<br>
              (off her look)<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> Kathleen shakes her head.</p>
            <p> Frank turns up.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              Hi. I'm Frank Navasky --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              -- Joe Fox.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              Joe Fox? Inventor of the Superstore,<br>
              enemy of the mid-list novel, destroyer of<br>
              City Books -- tell me something:<br>
              How do you sleep at night?</p>
            <p> Patricia joins them.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              I use a wonderful over-the-counter drug,<br>
              Ultrasom. Don't take the whole thing,<br>
              just half, and you will wake up without<br>
              even that tiniest hangover. You're Frank<br>
              Navasky, aren't you?</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              Your last piece in the Independent, the<br>
              one about Anthony Powell, was brilliant.<br>
              I'm Patricia Eden, Eden Books. Joe, this<br>
              man is the greatest living expert on<br>
              Julius and Ethel Rosenberg --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              And this is Kathleen Kelly --</p>
            <p> Kathleen glares at him.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              You liked my piece. God, I'm flattered.<br>
              You know you write these things and you<br>
              think someone's going to mention them and<br>
              then the whole week goes by and the phone<br>
              doesn't ring, and you think Oh, God, I'm<br>
              a fraud, a failure --</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              You know what's always fascinated me<br>
              about Julius and Ethel Rosenberg is how<br>
              old they looked when they were really<br>
              just our age.</p>
            <p> Everyone is stopped dead by this observation and looks at<br>
              Patricia, who smiles at them all.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              (to Frank)<br>
              I'm so happy to have finally met you. We<br>
              will talk. Have you ever thought about<br>
              doing a book?</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              Oh sure, it's passed through my head.<br>
              Something really relevant for today like<br>
              the Luddite movement in 19th century<br>
              England.</p>
            <p> At the same time:</p>

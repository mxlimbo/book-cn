            <p> EXT. FARMER'S MARKET ON BROADWAY - LATER</p>
            <p> As they walk past tables of bread and flowers, etc.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              His combined college board scores.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              His IQ.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              The number of women he's slept with.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              The number of times he's seen The<br>
              Godfather.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              That's the first good thing I've heard<br>
              about him.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              His address. No, no, no. He would never<br>
              do anything that prosaic.</p>
            <p> On Joe, looking a little wounded.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (cont'd)<br>
              The only thing I really care about<br>
              besides the married thing... and the<br>
              jail thing... is the boat thing.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              The boat thing?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I could never be with anyone who has<br>
              a boat.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Oh.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              So that clinches it. We'll never be<br>
              together. I'll take care of these.</p>
            <p> He picks up a mango, squeezes it.</p>
            <p> JOE (cont'd)<br>
              I could never be with anyone who likes<br>
              Joni Mitchell.<br>
              (singing, imitating Joni)<br>
              &quot;It's cloud's illusions I recall, I<br>
              really don't know clouds at all.&quot; <br>
              What does that mean?</p>
            <p> Joe waits for Kathleen to say she likes Joni Mitchell.</p>
            <p> But Kathleen doesn't say anything.</p>
            <p> She starts intently picking over apples, trying to find some<br>
              she wants.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              How's your book coming?</p>
            <p> EXT. BROADWAY - DAY</p>
            <p> As they walk away from the market, going uptown.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              There's a children's book editor I know,<br>
              from the store, and she's excited to <br>
              read it. When I finish it. Who would <br>
              ever have thought I'd write? I mean,<br>
              if I didn't have all this free time, I<br>
              would never have discovered --</p>
            <p> She stops, realizing what she's saying.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (cont'd)<br>
              The truth is, he was the one who made me<br>
              start thinking about writing --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Mister 152 Felony Indictments --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Mister 152... insights into my soul.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Yes. Well. Can't compete with that.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Well. I keep bumping into you. Hope<br>
              your mango's ripe.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I think it is. Want to bump into me<br>
              Saturday? Around lunchtime?</p>
            <p> EXT. COMPUTER SCREEN - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As Joe types.</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O.)<br>
              How about meeting Saturday? The first<br>
              day of spring. 4 P.M. There's a place<br>
              in Riverside Park at 88th Street where<br>
              the path curves and when you come around<br>
              the curve, you'll find me waiting.</p>
            <p> INT./EXT. SATURDAY - GREY'S PAPAYA - THE FIRST DAY OF SPRING</p>
            <p> Kathleen and Joe are putting mustard on their hot dogs.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Today?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Today.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Whoa.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I know. In Riverside Park.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Isn't that amazing? Maybe I've seen him,<br>
              and I don't even know it.</p>
            <p> EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY</p>
            <p> As they walk uptown, eating their hot dogs and drinking<br>
              papaya drinks.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              He could be the Zipper Man.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Who's that?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              This guy on Amsterdam who repairs<br>
              zippers. You'll never have to buy new<br>
              luggage.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Stop teasing.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Timing is everything. He waited until<br>
              you were primed. Until you knew there<br>
              was no other man you could ever love.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              (almost believe it)<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Sometimes I wonder...</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> They stop walking, they look at each other.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              If I hadn't been Foxbooks and you hadn't<br>
              been The Shop Around the Corner and we'd<br>
              just met --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Don't.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I would have asked for your phone number<br>
              and I wouldn't have been able to wait 24<br>
              hours before calling and asking, &quot;How<br>
              about coffee, drinks, dinner, a movie,<br>
              for as long as we both shall live?&quot;</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              (almost a swoon)<br>
              Joe...</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              And then we would never have been at war.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              The only fight we'd ever have is what<br>
              video to rent on Saturday night.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Who fights about that?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Some people. Not us.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              We would never.</p>
            <p> A long beat.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              If only...</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Please. I have to go.</p>
            <p> She doesn't move.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Let me ask you something? How come<br>
              you'll forgive him for standing you<br>
              up and you won't forgive me for a <br>
              little tiny thing like putting you<br>
              out of business?</p>
            <p> Kathleen looks at him. Shakes her head.</p>
            <p> They look at each other.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Oh how I wish you would.</p>
            <p> It's all Kathleen can do not to forgive him.</p>
            <p> It's all Joe can do not to kiss her.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I really do have to go.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              You don't want to be late.</p>
            <p> She's in agony.</p>
            <p> He turns and walks away.</p>
            <p> After a moment, she does too.</p>
            <p> EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - LATER</p>
            <p> As we see Kathleen come down the street and walk into her<br>
              house.</p>
            <p> EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - LATER</p>
            <p> As she comes out of the apartment house, having changed her<br>
              clothes.</p>
            <p> EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE - LATER AFTERNOON</p>
            <p> As she comes toward the entrance to the park.</p>
            <p> EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE PARK - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
            <p> As Kathleen comes down a path in the park, near 88th Street.</p>
            <p> She comes to a stop.</p>
            <p> Looks around.</p>
            <p> A young woman in running clothes passes by.</p>
            <p> A young father pushing a baby in one of those strollers<br>
              runners use to push babies in.</p>
            <p> Kathleen looks at her watch.</p>
            <p> Suddenly she hears a noise. A dog barking.</p>
            <p> And Brinkley comes around the corner.</p>
            <p> VOICE<br>
              Brinkley! Brinkley!</p>
            <p> And hold on Kathleen as she sees.</p>
            <p> JOE</p>
            <p> And she starts to cry.</p>
            <p> And he comes to her. And puts his arms around her.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Don't cry, Shopgirl, don't cry.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I wanted it to be you. I wanted it to<br>
              be you so badly.</p>
            <p> And as they kiss, we hold on them.</p>
            <p> And crane up and away as we see them, a couple kissing in the<br>
              park on a beautiful spring day.</p>
            <p> A dog is leaping around them.</p>
            <p> And as we get further and further away from them, the screen<br>
              turns into</p>
            <p> CYBERSPACE</p>
            <p> And the dog turns cartwheels and flipflops.</p>
            <p> And we tilt up to see the clouds and the sky</p>
            <p> and hear the sound of computer keys, clicking, clicking,<br>
              clicking</p>
            <p> FADE OUT</p>

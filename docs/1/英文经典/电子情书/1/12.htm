            <p> INT. THEATER - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> As they find seats and sit down. A trailer is playing.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Birdie is a very kind person, she's<br>
              practically my surrogate mother.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              Well she's out of her mind.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              She is not.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              I could never ever be with anyone who<br>
              doesn't take politics as seriously as I do.</p>
            <p> The person in front of them turns around.</p>
            <p> PERSON IN FRONT OF THEM<br>
              Do you mind?</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              A hot dog is singing. You need quiet<br>
              while a hot dog is singing?</p>
            <p> The two of them sit there.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I have something to tell you. I didn't<br>
              vote.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              In the last mayoral election, when Rudy<br>
              Giuliani was running against Ruth<br>
              Messinger, I went to get a manicure and<br>
              forgot to vote.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              Since when do you get manicures?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Oh, I suppose you could never be with a<br>
              woman who gets manicures.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              Forget it. It's okay. I forgive you.</p>
            <p> PERSON IN FRONT OF THEM<br>
              Shhhhhh.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              You forgive me.</p>
            <p> Hold on them a beat.</p>
            <p> Kathleen stands and walks out of the theatre.</p>
            <p> INT. SONY LINCOLN SQUARE THEATRE ESCALATOR - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Kathleen on the down escalator. Frank scrambling to catch up<br>
              with her.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              What's going on?</p>
            <p> Kathleen's upset.</p>
            <p> FRANK (cont'd)<br>
              Hey. What is it?</p>
            <p> EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As they walk uptown.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              Look, this has been a big week, you're<br>
              closing the store --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              It's not that, Frank, really it's not.<br>
              It's just... Frank...</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              I know, that was terrible of me.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              What was?</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              To jump all over you when I'm the one<br>
              who's really... Oh, God, I don't know<br>
              how to say this --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              What is it?</p>
            <p> EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As we see Kathleen and Frank being served drinks in a glassed-<br>
              in extension of a restaurant.</p>
            <p> INT. COLUMBUS AVENUE RESTAURANT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As Kathleen looks at Frank, waiting for him to begin.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              You're a wonderful person, Kathleen.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              So are you.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              And I'm honored that you want to be with<br>
              me because you would never be with anyone<br>
              who wasn't truly worthy --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I feel exactly the same way about you.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              Oh, God, don't say that, please, that<br>
              just makes it worse.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              What?<br>
              (he shakes his head)<br>
              You don't love me?</p>
            <p> Frank shakes his head no.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Me either.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              You don't love me?</p>
            <p> Kathleen shakes her head no.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              But we're so right for each other.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I know.</p>
            <p> A long beat.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              That woman on television, right?<br>
              Sidney-Ann.</p>
            <p> Frank nods.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              I mean, nothing's happened or anything.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I think she's a Republican.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              I can't help myself.</p>
            <p> Kathleen pats him.</p>
            <p> FRANK (cont'd)<br>
              What about you? Is there someone else?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Oh, somewhere out there, I'm sure.<br>
              Somewhere --<br>
              (she throws up her hands)<br>
              In cyberspace.</p>
            <p> EXT. KATHLEEN'S BUILDING - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As Frank, carrying a typewriter, walks out off Kathleen's<br>
              building and puts it into the back of a taxicab.</p>
            <p> EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY</p>
            <p> As a sign goes up in the window: &quot;Closing This Week: All<br>
              Stock 40% off.&quot;</p>
            <p> INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - LATE THAT DAY</p>
            <p> The store is crowded. People are buying stacks of books.<br>
              We hear brief snatches of conversation: Birdie telling a<br>
              customer she's planning to travel, Christina saying she's<br>
              finally going to have to finish her dissertation, George<br>
              saying he's been offered a job at Foxbooks but even though<br>
              it's okay with Kathleen, he wouldn't work there if it were<br>
              the last place on the earth.</p>
            <p> There is a frantic, rummage sale atmosphere.</p>
            <p> Kathleen, busy at the cash register, looks up for a minute at<br>
              her beautiful store being ravaged by vultures. We hear the<br>
              sound of the computer and hear her voice-over:</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>
              My store is closing this week.<br>
              I own a store. Did I ever tell you that?<br>
              Probably not. It's a lovely store --</p>
            <p> As a woman dumps a huge stack of books on the checkout table.</p>
            <p> WOMAN SHOPPER<br>
              This is a tragedy.<br>
              (yelling across the shop to her husband)<br>
              Honey, grab a copy of The Trumpet of the<br>
              Swan.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)<br>
              -- and in a week, it will be something<br>
              really depressing, like a Baby Gap. I<br>
              am being amazingly brave --</p>
            <p> WOMAN SHOPPER<br>
              What are you going to do with yourself?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I don't know. I'm going to take some<br>
              time. I have a little money saved. I'm<br>
              almost looking forward to it --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)<br>
              I am so cheerful I would make Pollyanna<br>
              throw up.</p>
            <p> SECOND SHOPPER<br>
              I came here every Saturday when I was a<br>
              little girl. I remember when your mother<br>
              gave me Anne of Green Gables. &quot;Read it<br>
              with a box of Kleenex,&quot; that's what she<br>
              told me.</p>
            <p> THIRD SHOPPER<br>
              She's looking down on you right now.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I'm sure she is.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)<br>
              I have promised myself I'm not going<br>
              to cry.</p>
            <p> A FORTH SHOPPER approaches the counter with a stack of books<br>
              up to his chin, and manages to slide the stack on the <br>
              counter.</p>
            <p> FOURTH SHOPPER<br>
              We should bomb Foxbooks.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              It's not their fault. The truth is, the<br>
              world is just... different.</p>
            <p> She starts ringing up the sale.</p>
            <p> EXT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As Kathleen walks home.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)<br>
              Soon we'll just be a memory. In fact,<br>
              someone, some foolish person will<br>
              probably think it's a tribute to this<br>
              city, the way it keeps changing on you,<br>
              the way you can never count on it, or<br>
              something. I know, because that's the<br>
              sort of thing I'm always saying. But the<br>
              truth is, I'm heartbroken. I feel as if<br>
              part of me has died, and my mother has<br>
              died all over again, and no one can ever<br>
              make it right.</p>
            <p> She stops in front of the window, watching the customers<br>
              lined up to buy books.</p>
            <p> EXT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As Kathleen enters and looks around.</p>
            <p> She goes up the stairs.</p>
            <p> INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENT</p>
            <p> As Kathleen walks into it.</p>
            <p> It's huge, of course. With its reading area, and stage, and<br>
              room for displays, and child-size furniture, and so many<br>
              books and so many customers.</p>
            <p> Kathleen sits down on a little child-size chair, completely<br>
              wilted.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN FROM ANOTHER P.O.V.</p>
            <p> And now we see Joe watching her, from a distance. She doesn't<br>
              see him.</p>
            <p> A woman browsing, stops a sales person.</p>
            <p> WOMAN SHOPPER<br>
              Do you have the &quot;Shoe&quot; books?</p>
            <p> SALESPERSON<br>
              The &quot;Shoe&quot; books? Who's the author?</p>
            <p> WOMAN SHOPPER<br>
              I don't know. My friend told me my<br>
              daughter has to read the &quot;Shoe&quot; books, <br>
              so here I am.</p>

              Noel Streatfeild. Noel Streatfeild wrote<br>
              Ballet Shoes and Skating Shoes and<br>
              Theater Shoes and Movie Shoes...<br>
              (she starts crying as she tells her)<br>
              I'd start with Skating Shoes, it's my<br>
              favorite, although Ballet Shoes is<br>
              completely wonderful.</p>
            <p> SALESPERSON<br>
              Streatfeild. How do you spell that?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              S-T-R-E-A-T-F-E-I-L-D.</p>
            <p> WOMAN SHOPPER<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p> As she walks away.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              (to herself)<br>
              They know nothing, they know absolutely<br>
              nothing.</p>
            <p> ON JOE</p>
            <p> as he watches her. We hear the sound of the computer.</p>
            <p> She starts out of the store. And hold on him.</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O.)<br>
              I'm sorry.</p>
            <p> INT. JOE'S COMPUTER SCREEN</p>
            <p> A screen which says Reply and which now reads &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;</p>
            <p> INT. JOE'S OFFICE - DAY</p>
            <p> On Joe at his computer, staring at the screen.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Asshole.</p>
            <p> He backspaces, deleting. Starts typing again.</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O.)<br>
              I'm sorry. I don't know what to say.<br>
              Truly I don't. And anything I do say<br>
              will sound trite. I hope you feel<br>
              better.</p>
            <p> He sits there, appalled at his own triteness.</p>
            <p> EXT. JOE'S STREET - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As a taxi comes down the street and stops in front of Joe's<br>
              building.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA (V.O.)<br>
              What I was thinking was she'd probably<br>
              make a great children's book either.</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O.)<br>
              Why would you think that?</p>
            <p> They get out of the cab.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              She knows everything. She has flawless<br>
              taste. She's famous for it.<br>
              The salesmen swear by her. If she likes<br>
              it, it sells. Period.</p>
            <p> INT. JOE'S LOBBY - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> As they enter the lobby and walk toward the elevator.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              So you're going to offer her a job?</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              Why not? What else has she got to do?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Now that she's destitute --</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              Thanks to you.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Well, I can't imagine her working for<br>
              you.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              Why not?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              She has a horrible personality, she's...<br>
              nice to everyone all the time. It's<br>
              exhausting. And her staff turnover is<br>
              ... non-existent. They've been there<br>
              forever. Until... recently, when they<br>
              all found out they were going to lose<br>
              their jobs.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              Thanks to you.</p>
            <p> The elevator door is closing.</p>

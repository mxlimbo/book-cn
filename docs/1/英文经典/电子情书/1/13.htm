            <p> INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Hello, Charlie, Veronica.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              Last time, we rode in an elevator, we<br>
              made the deal of the century. What is<br>
              going to happen this time?</p>
            <p> CHARLIE<br>
              Miss Grant's going to get me a part in<br>
              one of her movies, that's what's going<br>
              to happen.</p>
            <p> VERONICA<br>
              In your dream, Charlie.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              (back to the conversation with Joe)<br>
              I love how you've totally forgotten you<br>
              had any role in her current situation.<br>
              It's so obtuse. It reminds me of someone<br>
              ... Who? Who does it remind me of?<br>
              (thinks for a moment)<br>
              Me!</p>
            <p> The elevator suddenly stops.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              Shit.</p>
            <p> VERONICA<br>
              Shit.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              It is stuck?</p>
            <p> CHARLIE<br>
              Could be.</p>
            <p> He pushes the open button. Nothing. Turns the key, hits the<br>
              open button, flicks the emergency switch. The he starts<br>
              hitting the buttons in every possible combination.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Charlie, what are you doing?</p>
            <p> CHARLIE<br>
              Bang the door.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              Really.</p>
            <p> Joe bangs the door. Nothing.</p>
            <p> CHARLIE<br>
              I hope this thing doesn't plummet to the<br>
              basement.</p>
            <p> VERONICA<br>
              Can it do that?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> He picks up the phone.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              This is Joe Fox. Who is this? Hi, Juan.<br>
              We're stuck on the sixth floor. There<br>
              are four of us --</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              (grabs the phone)<br>
              -- and if you don't get your ass up here<br>
              in two shakes and get us out --</p>
            <p> He hangs up.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              (to Veronica)<br>
              Are you all right?</p>
            <p> VERONICA<br>
              It's hot.</p>
            <p> Joe hands her his handkerchief.</p>
            <p> CHARLIE<br>
              Everyone should jump in the air.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> CHARLIE<br>
              We jump. The elevator thinks that no one<br>
              is here and it opens.</p>
            <p> Everyone stares at each other.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              One -- two -- three --</p>
            <p> They all jump into the air.</p>
            <p> They all land.</p>
            <p> Nothing happens.</p>
            <p> INT. ELEVATOR - A LITTLE LATER</p>
            <p> Patricia is sitting on the elevator floor, polishing her<br>
              nails.</p>
            <p> We hear the fire department banging outside...</p>
            <p> VERONICA<br>
              If I ever get out of here, I'm going to<br>
              start speaking to my mother. She slept<br>
              with Oscar, and maybe it was Oscar's<br>
              fault, I don't know, and then she sold<br>
              the story to Inside Edition.<br>
              That could have been Oscar's idea, too.<br>
              Who knows? But I divorced him. I wonder<br>
              what she's doing right this minute. I<br>
              think of her... whenever I hear about a<br>
              new pill. Ecstasy, Zoloft, Fenphen, I<br>
              just think, I hope Mama knows about that.</p>
            <p> She takes out a tissue and dabs at her eyes.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              Maybe you can make up on Rosie. That<br>
              would be so great for the book.</p>
            <p> CHARLIE<br>
              (trying to figure it out)<br>
              If I ever get out of here...</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              If I ever get out of here, I'm having my<br>
              eyes lasered.</p>
            <p> CHARLIE<br>
              I'm marrying Oreet. I love her. I<br>
              should marry her. I don't know what's<br>
              been stopping me.</p>
            <p> He takes out his wallet and looks at a picture of Oreet,<br>
              shows it to Joe.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              If I ever get out of here, I'm going to --</p>
            <p> He stops, he looks at Patricia who is fishing through her<br>
              purse.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              Where is my TicTacs?<br>
              (looks at Joe)<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> The firemen crowbar open the elevator door.</p>
            <p> EXT. 79TH STREET BOAT BASIN - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Joe and Brinkley walk out on the dock toward Joe's boat. Joe<br>
              is carrying Brinkley's pillow, his laptop and a suitcase.</p>
            <p> He boards his boat and goes below. A light goes on. We hear<br>
              the sound of the computer.</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O.)<br>
              I came home tonight and got into the<br>
              elevator to go to my apartment. An hour<br>
              later, I got out of the elevator and<br>
              Brinkley and I moved out. Suddenly<br>
              everything had become clear.<br>
              (continued)</p>
            <p> INT. BOAT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> A small sleeping area with a berth and a little table, where<br>
              Joe's laptop has been hooked up to the phone.</p>
            <p> Joe is on the narrow berth, as is Brinkley.</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O., cont'd)<br>
              It's a long story. Full of the personal<br>
              details we avoid so carefully...</p>
            <p> Joe puts Brinkley on the floor, on his pillow. Brinkley<br>
              jumps back onto the berth with Joe.</p>
            <p> INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - DAY</p>
            <p> Kathleen is making tea. She starts toward the bedroom. We<br>
              see her computer, now hooked up in the living room, where all<br>
              of Frank's typewriters used to be.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>
              I wonder whether change isn't a kind of<br>
              infection. You start with one thing --<br>
              something you never ever thought would<br>
              change and it does --<br>
              (continued)</p>
            <p> INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)<br>
              and the next thing you know even your bed<br>
              is in a different place.<br>
              (continued)</p>
            <p> Kathleen enters the bedroom and we see the entire room has<br>
              been rearranged.</p>
            <p> She gets into bed and turns on the television set.</p>
            <p> EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DUSK</p>
            <p> The bookshelves are empty.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)<br>
              Six months ago, when you and I first met,<br>
              I knew everything about myself -- what I<br>
              would be doing for the rest of my life<br>
              and even the person I would be doing it<br>
              with. Now I know nothing.</p>
            <p> On the door is a small sign. &quot;After 42 years, we are closing<br>
              our doors. We have loved being part of your lives.&quot;</p>
            <p> Kathleen turns out the light in the store and opens the door.</p>
            <p> The little bell over the door jingles.</p>
            <p> Kathleen reaches up on her tiptoes for the bell and detaches<br>
              it.</p>
            <p> Then she comes out of the store, carrying the bell.</p>
            <p> Kathleen locks the door and reaches down to operate the grate<br>
              for the last time.</p>
            <p> The grate starts to lower.</p>
            <p> Kathleen looks at her store, one last time. Then she walks<br>
              off, carrying the bell. We hear it jingle in the night.</p>
            <p> And hold on The Shop Around the Corner, and it slowly turns<br>
              into a computer-enhanced version of itself.</p>
            <p> And then, suddenly, it vanishes with a poof, leaving an empty<br>
              screen.</p>
            <p> EXT. A BLUE SKY WITH A BIG COMPUTER SUN SHINING IN IT, AND PAN 
              <br>
              DOWN TO:</p>
            <p> A COMPUTER VERSION OF COLUMBUS AVENUE</p>
            <p> The trees sprout leaves and birdies start to tweet. And the<br>
              scene turns into a real version of:</p>
            <p> EXT. COLUMBUS AVE. - FOXBOOKS - MORNING</p>
            <p> INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DAY</p>
            <p> George is now the head of the children department at the<br>
              store and he is sitting in the children's section on an itty-<br>
              bitty chair. His staff is sitting on little itty-bitty<br>
              chairs too.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              Then, in the 19th century, Caldecott<br>
              revolutionized the publishing of<br>
              children's books by the introduction of<br>
              color illustrations --</p>
            <p> We see:</p>
            <p> THE STAFF</p>
            <p> Several are dozing.</p>
            <p> EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE &amp; 72ND - DAY</p>
            <p> Joe walks past the Eleanor Roosevelt statue. He's with<br>
              Annabel and Matt:</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              What about going to the Children's Zoo?</p>
            <p> ANNABEL<br>
              I don't want to go to the Children's Zoo.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Okay. The Staten Island Ferry.</p>
            <p> ANNABEL<br>
              I want to go to the Storybook Lady.</p>
            <p> MATT<br>
              I want to go to the Storybook Lady.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Well we can't go to the Storybook Lady.</p>
            <p> INT. JAPANESE NOODLE RESTAURANT - DAY</p>
            <p> Annabel is sitting in her chair, staring glumly at a bowl of<br>
              Japanese soup and noodles.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I'll read you a story.</p>
            <p> ANNABEL<br>
              Where did she go?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              She had to close her store.</p>
            <p> ANNABEL<br>
              Why?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              She didn't have enough business.</p>
            <p> ANNABEL<br>
              Why?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Well. Her store was very close to our<br>
              store, and you know our store sells books<br>
              at a slightly lower cost --</p>
            <p> ANNABEL<br>
              Why?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Why do we sell at a lower cost? So more<br>
              people can buy books.</p>
            <p> ANNABEL<br>
              Why couldn't she sell that way too?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Because she's small and we're big. How<br>
              about we go get some candy?</p>
            <p> ANNABEL<br>
              So now she's gone and it's all your<br>
              fault.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              It's business, Annabel. It's not<br>
              personal. How about we go get so much<br>
              candy you'll be bouncing off the walls<br>
              for days?</p>
            <p> MATT<br>
              What's personal?</p>
            <p> ANNABEL<br>
              Personal means that she's gone forever,<br>
              and now we'll never get another book from<br>
              her as long as we ever live.</p>
            <p> She burst into tears. Matt bursts into tears too.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Remember the man who worked with her?</p>
            <p> ANNABEL<br>
              (a wail)<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Well I hired him.</p>
            <p> ANNABEL<br>
              You killed the Storybook Lady.</p>
            <p> Matt throws himself on the ground, crying.</p>
            <p> Annabel sobs hysterically.</p>

            <p> As she and Frank watch the television show.</p>
            <p> FRANK ON TELEVISION<br>
              Technologically speaking, the world's <br>
              out of hand. Take the VCR. The whole<br>
              idea of a VCR is that it makes it possible<br>
              for you to tape what's on television<br>
              while you're out of the house. But the<br>
              whole point of being out of the house is<br>
              so you can miss what's on television.<br>
              Radio. Now there's a medium I can get<br>
              behind.</p>
            <p> SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION<br>
              Well, we're on television... and you're<br>
              good at it.</p>
            <p> FRANK ON TELEVISION<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p> Another little moment between them.</p>
            <p> SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION<br>
              The bookstore. Tell us about it.</p>
            <p> FRANK ON TELEVISION<br>
              Are you planning to collect radios?</p>
            <p> SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION<br>
              Do you think I should?</p>
            <p> FRANK ON TELEVISION<br>
              The Shop Around the Corner is a true New<br>
              York treasure.</p>
            <p> SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION<br>
              As are you. I'd love to have you back.</p>
            <p> FRANK ON TELEVISION<br>
              Any time. Are we done?</p>
            <p> SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION<br>
              Not at all.</p>
            <p> FRANK ON TELEVISION<br>
              Because I just want to say that the only<br>
              show I do watch is yours.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              (appalled)<br>
              Omigod.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              Hey, I was just being polite. Okay, I<br>
              admit, I slobbered all over her.</p>
            <p> The show continues.</p>
            <p> EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DUSK</p>
            <p> As we see Kathleen flip the open sign to closed.</p>
            <p> INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DUSK</p>
            <p> George is talking to Kathleen and Birdie, who is toting up<br>
              the week's receipts.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              And I can't decide whether to put<br>
              sausages into the meat sauce or just<br>
              chopped meat. Last time I made it,<br>
              Detective Carter and I never even sat<br>
              down to dinner because --<br>
              (he makes some sort of hand<br>
              gesture indicating that sex<br>
              prevented them from dining)<br>
              and last night, I made margaritas in the<br>
              blender, and I took the ice cube and --</p>
            <p> BIRDIE<br>
              Spare us.</p>
            <p> George goes out the door.</p>
            <p> Birdie looks at Kathleen.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Don't tell me. Not the slightest<br>
              difference?</p>
            <p> Birdie can't bring herself to answer.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (cont'd)<br>
              How could that be? All this publicity<br>
              and not one bit of difference?<br>
              Oh Birdie, what am I going to do? What<br>
              would Mom have done?</p>
            <p> BIRDIE<br>
              Let's ask her.</p>
            <p> She opens the locket hanging around her neck. There's a<br>
              picture of Kathleen's mother inside it. Birdie holds the<br>
              locket up to her face.</p>
            <p> BIRDIE<br>
              Cecilia, what should we do?</p>
            <p> Birdie holds the locket to her ear and listens. A pause.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Birdie?</p>
            <p> BIRDIE<br>
              Shhhh.<br>
              (after a beat, shrugs)<br>
              She has no idea, but she thinks the<br>
              window display is lovely. Good night<br>
              dearie.</p>
            <p> Birdie smiles and picks up her shopping bag, goes out the<br>
              door.</p>
            <p> EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - NIGHT</p>
            <p> It's starting to rain. Kathleen lowers the grate over the<br>
              store. As she turns to walk away, William Spungeon steps in<br>
              her path out of the shadows.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Oh my goodness, hello. What are you<br>
              doing here.</p>
            <p> SPUNGEON<br>
              Loitering. Lurking. Skulking.<br>
              Stalking.</p>
            <p> He laughs. So does she. Dramatically, he whips out an<br>
              umbrella and opens it over the two of them.</p>
            <p> SPUNGEON (cont'd)<br>
              You look very beautiful.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Thank you. But I'm a wreck.</p>
            <p> He touches her cheek suddenly. Kathleen starts. Then he<br>
              blows on his hand.</p>
            <p> SPUNGEON<br>
              An eyelash. It's gone.</p>
            <p> Kathleen relaxes. They start walking.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Are you writing another book?</p>
            <p> SPUNGEON<br>
              I'm in the home stretch. I'll be done in<br>
              approximately six more years.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Should I discount?</p>
            <p> SPUNGEON<br>
              It's about a man on a quest for knowledge<br>
              who meets a woman he cannot resist.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              If I discount I have to fire someone<br>
              because I can't discount with this<br>
              overhead but whom could I fire? I<br>
              couldn't fire anyone.</p>
            <p> Spungeon suddenly puts his hand through Kathleen's hair. She<br>
              stops, frozen in place.</p>
            <p> SPUNGEON<br>
              You have your mother's hair. Thick,<br>
              wild, the color of Nebraska wheat.</p>
            <p> He grabs her and tries to kiss her.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              What are you doing? Let me go.</p>
            <p> He backs her into a wall.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Stop it. Are you crazy?</p>
            <p> She kicks him in the shins, wiggles free and runs away.</p>
            <p> SPUNGEON<br>
              (calling after her)<br>
              If you change your mind, you can E-mail<br>
              me. Hermit@AOL.com.</p>
            <p> INT. COMPUTER SCREEN - NIGHT</p>
            <p> The mail form says &quot;To:&quot; and Kathleen types in &quot;NY 
              152&quot;.</p>
            <p> The form says &quot;Re:&quot; and Kathleen types in: &quot;Advice&quot;</p>
            <p> EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Rain is falling.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>
              I need help. Do you still want to meet me?</p>
            <p> EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Rain is falling.</p>
            <p> We hear the sound of the computer.</p>
            <p> JOE (V.O.)<br>
              &quot;Where? When?&quot;</p>
            <p> INT. NUT SHOP OF BROADWAY - DAY</p>
            <p> George, Kathleen and Christina in the shop. Kathleen is<br>
              buying more lollipops.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              We're meeting in a public place.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Well don't go anywhere with him. Don't<br>
              even go out to the street with him<br>
              afterwards. Get a dial cab to just sit<br>
              there and wait for you.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              Did you tell Frank?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              There's nothing to tell.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              But did you tell him?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              He's away. At the 32nd anniversary of<br>
              the Chicago Seven trial.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              And he's gone to a place where there are<br>
              no phones. Do you even know this guy's<br>
              name?</p>
            <p> Kathleen shakes her head no.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              And you're going to meet him in a bar?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Not a bar. That place on 83rd with the<br>
              cheesecake.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              And he will wear a flower in his lapel,<br>
              and you will be carrying a copy of Anna<br>
              Karenina with a rose in it.</p>
            <p> No answer.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Oh God, no.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Not Anna Karenina. Pride and Prejudice.</p>
            <p> EXT. FOXBOOKS - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As Joe and Kevin walk out of the store and start downtown.</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              I suppose she's carrying a copy of a book<br>
              with a flower in it.</p>
            <p> Joe doesn't say anything.</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              Not really.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Really.</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              Which Jane Austen is it?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Pride and Prejudice.</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              She could be a real dog.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I know. Look, I'll just stay ten<br>
              minutes. I'll say hello. Drink a cup of<br>
              coffee and split. I'm outta here.</p>
            <p> He looks at Kevin.</p>
            <p> JOE (cont'd)<br>
              Walk me there, okay?</p>
            <p> EXT. 83RD STREET - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As the two men walk toward Cafe Lalo, the European cafe on<br>
              West 83rd Street.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              What if she has a really high, squeaky<br>
              voice? I hate that. It reminds me of<br>
              those mice in Cinderella.</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              What mice in Cinderella?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Gus-gus and oh shit, I can't remember the<br>
              other one. Why am I compelled to meet<br>
              her? I'm just ruining a good thing.</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              You're taking it to the next level. I<br>
              always do that. I always take a<br>
              relationship to the next level, and if it<br>
              works okay I take it to the next level<br>
              after that, until I can finally get to<br>
              the level where it becomes absolutely<br>
              necessary for me to leave.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I'm not going to stay long anyway. I<br>
              already said that, didn't I. Christ.<br>
              I'm a total wreck.</p>
            <p> As they reach:</p>
            <p> EXT. CAFE LALO - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> Joe stops and looks at Kevin.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Kevin, this woman is the most adorable<br>
              creature I have ever come in contact<br>
              with. If she turns out to be even as<br>
              good-looking as a mailbox, I will be<br>
              crazy not to turn my life upside down<br>
              and marry her.</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              She could be a real dog.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              (a total panic)<br>
              You go look.</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              Me?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Just go to the window and check her out.</p>
            <p> KEVIN<br>
              You're pathetic.</p>
            <p> Kevin goes to the window and looks inside.</p>

            <p> EXT. KATHLEEN'S STORE - DAY</p>
            <p> As Joe, Annabel and Matt walk past. There's some sort of toy<br>
              miniature princess in a pointed hat sitting outside the store<br>
              and a sign lit with twinkle lights: Storybook Lady today 3:30.</p>
            <p> INT. KATHLEEN'S STORE - DAY</p>
            <p> Kathleen is sitting on a stool reading to a group of CHILDREN,<br>
              including Annabel and Matt, who are crammed into her store.<br>
              Joe is watching, along with some PARENTS as Kathleen reads <br>
              from a Roald Dahl book.</p>
            <p> INT. KATHLEEN'S STORE - LATER</p>
            <p> Matt is sitting on the floor reading a book. Kathleen is <br>
              showing Annabel a copy of a book called Betsy-Tacy.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              This is her best friend Tacy, whose real<br>
              name is Anastasia, and then in the next<br>
              book Betsy and Tacy become friends with<br>
              Tib, whose real name, I am sorry to tell<br>
              you, is Thelma.</p>
            <p> In another section of the store:</p>
            <p> George is showing Joe a first edition of Swiss Family<br>
              Robinson from the glass case.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              The illustrations are hand-tipped,<br>
              which is why --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              It costs so much.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              It's why it's worth so much.</p>
            <p> Joe smiles and turns to see Kathleen and Annabel at a whole<br>
              shelf of Betsy-Tacy books.</p>
            <p> ANNABEL<br>
              I want all of them.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              That might be an awful lot for your dad<br>
              to buy at one time.</p>
            <p> ANNABEL<br>
              My dad gets me all the books I want.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              (looking over at Joe)<br>
              Well, that's very nice of him.</p>
            <p> ANNABEL<br>
              That's not my dad. That's my nephew --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Oh, I don't really think that's your nephew --</p>
            <p> As Joe approaches.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              It's true. Annabel is my aunt. Aren't<br>
              you, Aunt Annabel?</p>
            <p> Annabel nods solemnly.</p>
            <p> ANNABEL<br>
              And Matt is --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Let me guess.<br>
              (to Matt)<br>
              Are you his uncle?</p>
            <p> MATT<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              His grandfather?</p>
            <p> Annabel and Matt start giggling.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (cont'd)<br>
              His great-grandfather?</p>
            <p> MATT<br>
              (shouting with glee)<br>
              I'm his brother.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Annabel is my grandfather's daughter.<br>
              And Matt is my father's son. We are an<br>
              American family.</p>
            <p> He smiles at Kathleen, who finds herself smiling back.</p>
            <p> Annabel suddenly sneezes.</p>
            <p> Kathleen takes a handkerchief from her sleeve. It's an old<br>
              fashioned hankie that's embroidered. She offers it to<br>
              Annabel, who instead wipes her nose with her hand and then<br>
              looks at the handkerchief, a little puzzled.</p>
            <p> ANNABEL<br>
              What is that?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              A handkerchief. Oh my, do children not<br>
              even know what handkerchiefs are? A<br>
              handkerchief is a Kleenex you don't throw<br>
              away. My mother embroidered it for me --<br>
              you see? My initials and a daisy, <br>
              because daisies are my favorite flower.</p>
            <p> ANNABEL<br>
              Orchids are my favorite flower.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              (to Joe)<br>
              You know what else children don't know?<br>
              They don't know what a telephone booth is?</p>
            <p> Joe is looking at Kathleen.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Who are you?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Kathleen Kelly. I own this store.<br>
              Are you are?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Joe. Just call me Joe.<br>
              (quickly)<br>
              We'll take these books.</p>
            <p> He gets the one Matt is reading. And the two other Kathleen<br>
              has gotten for Annabel.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              These are wonderful books. As Annabel<br>
              gets older the characters in the books do,<br>
              too.<br>
              (to Annabel)<br>
              You can grow up with Betsy.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              You're going to come back again, aren't<br>
              you?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Of course.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              This is why we're never going to go<br>
              under. Our customers are loyal.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              (by way of explanation)<br>
              They're opening a Foxbooks around the<br>
              corner.</p>
            <p> ANNABEL<br>
              Foxbooks! My Daddy --</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              (gently putting his hand over her mouth)<br>
              -- likes to buy at discount. Don't tell<br>
              anyone that, Annabel, it's nothing to be<br>
              proud of --</p>
            <p> MATT<br>
              (spelling)<br>
              F-O-X.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              That's amazing. You can spell fox. Can<br>
              you spell dog?</p>
            <p> MATT<br>
              F-O-X.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Matt, look at this dinosaur book.<br>
              Wouldn't you like a dinosaur book?<br>
              Annabel, maybe you could read this to<br>
              Matt while I wrap things up here.<br>
              (moves them to a corner, to them quickly)<br>
              Sit down, read, and don't listen to<br>
              anything I say.</p>
            <p> Returns to counter and gives Kathleen some cash.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              And the dinosaur book too.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              The world is not driven by discounts,<br>
              believe me. I've been in business<br>
              forever. I started helping my mother<br>
              here after school when I was six years<br>
              old. I used to watch her, and it wasn't<br>
              that she was selling books, it was that<br>
              she was helping people become whoever<br>
              they were going to turn out to be. When<br>
              you read a book as a child it becomes<br>
              part of your identity in a way that no<br>
              other reading in your life does.<br>
              (stops herself)<br>
              I guess I've gotten carried away.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              You have, and you've made me feel...</p>
            <p> He can't finish the sentence. He looks at her and sees,<br>
              behind her on the shelf, a picture of a woman who is<br>
              unmistakably Kathleen's mother, with a young Kathleen.</p>
            <p> JOE (cont'd)<br>
              Enchanting, your mother was enchanting.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              She was. How did you know that?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Lucky guess.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Anyway. She left the store to me, and<br>
              I'm going to leave it to my daughter.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              How old is your daughter now?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Oh, I'm not married. But eventually.</p>
            <p> She smiles at Joe...</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              So Foxbooks can...</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN AND GEORGE TOGETHER<br>
              Go to hell.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              (handing him his books)<br>
              Here you go.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              We ready?</p>
            <p> Annabel and Matt join him at the counter. Kathleen gives them<br>
              each a lollipop.</p>
            <p> ANNABEL<br>
              Bye, Kathleen.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Goodbye, Annabel. Bye, Matt. What<br>
              about cat? Can you spell cat?</p>
            <p> MATT<br>
              F-O-X.</p>
            <p> INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY</p>
            <p> Someplace like the auditorium at the Museum of Broadcasting.<br>
              PATRICIA EDEN, Joe's girlfriend, who is the editor-in-chief<br>
              of a New York publishing house called Eden Books, is standing<br>
              at a podium at a sales conference. In the audience are sales<br>
              reps, wholesalers, etc. There's a screen behind her with<br>
              pictures of the authors being flashed on it as she speaks.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA (cont'd)<br>
              And now, the book you've all been waiting<br>
              for, the book it's been my dreams to<br>
              publish. The legendary Veronica Grant<br>
              has written her memoirs --</p>
            <p> There's a burst of applause as a photograph of Veronica Grant<br>
              flashes on screen.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA (cont'd)<br>
              -- and I'm happy to report it is just<br>
              crammed with tragedy.<br>
              (she laughs gaily)<br>
              Just kidding, but seriously, it's all<br>
              here: poverty, addiction, divorce,<br>
              tracheotomies --</p>
            <p> We see pictures of Veronica at eight with her sharecropper<br>
              family, Veronica at 14 with her first child, Veronica with a<br>
              series of husbands, Veronica in a wheelchair, etc.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA (cont'd)<br>
              -- her third husband beat her up, hip<br>
              replacement, and an amazing face lift<br>
              where all the injected fat fell to her<br>
              chin.</p>
            <p> Now we see a blow-up of the book's jacket, with a picture of<br>
              Veronica on it and the title: &quot;Am I Rising from Ashes, or Did<br>
              I Just Forget to Dust?&quot;</p>
            <p> PATRICIA (cont'd)<br>
              This book is fabulous. And even if it<br>
              weren't, it would sell like crazy,<br>
              because Veronica is going to plug it to<br>
              death on every talk show in America.<br>
              This book...</p>
            <p> Patricia bursts into tears.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA (cont'd)<br>
              I'm sorry. I can't talk about it without<br>
              crying. Veronica and I have so much in<br>
              common -- well, not all the sad parts --<br>
              but we were both famous by the time we<br>
              were 29 and, believe me, that's rough.<br>
              (wipes her nose with a Kleenex, pulling herself together)<br>
              Anyway, I just want to say that I'm<br>
              especially thrilled to be publishing it.<br>
              Veronica lives in my building and we met<br>
              in the elevator. By the time we had<br>
              traveled from the eighth floor to the<br>
              first, we had a deal. First printing:<br>
              one million copies.</p>
            <p> Everyone applauds enthusiastically.</p>
            <p> INT. AUDITORIUM LOBBY - A SHORT WHILE LATER</p>
            <p> Patricia is leaving, still surrounded by colleagues and sales<br>
              reps congratulating her. She is the soul of graciousness.<br>
              Her assistant, Sarah, comes up.</p>
            <p> SARAH<br>
              (quickly)<br>
              You have a dentist appointment in twenty <br>
              minutes. So you should leave soon...</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              What's my car number?</p>
            <p> SARAH<br>
              Car? You didn't say anything about a car<br>
              --</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              Are you an idiot? Of course I need a car.<br>
              God!</p>
            <p> She walks toward the exit.</p>
            <p> EXT. 57TH STREET - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p> Patricia in the pouring rain, trying to hail a cab. She<br>
              spots one across the street.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!</p>
            <p> She whistles -- a longshoreman's whistle.</p>
            <p> The cab makes a U-turn, but instead of stopping for Patricia<br>
              it stops about twenty feet ahead for a MAN in an overcoat who<br>
              gets into it.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              Excuse me -- what are you doing? This is<br>
              my taxicab.<br>
              (to the driver)<br>
              Don't take him. I am telling you right<br>
              now, and I am memorizing your number,<br>
              don't take him.<br>
              (to the man)<br>
              Who the fuck do you think you are?</p>
            <p> MAN IN OVERCOAT<br>
              Are you going uptown?</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> MAN IN OVERCOAT<br>
              Get in. I'll drop you.</p>
            <p> INT. TAXI - A MINUTE LATER</p>
            <p> As the cab turns onto Eighth Avenue, starts uptown.</p>
            <p> Patricia is dialing her cell phone. She's elaborately<br>
              ignoring the man who stole her cab.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              Veronica, it's Patricia, you should have<br>
              been there, it was unbelievable, we're<br>
              going to sell truckloads of your book.<br>
              Call me.</p>
            <p> She hangs up, folds up the phone, puts it back in her purse<br>
              as the cab moves on.</p>
            <p> MAN IN OVERCOAT<br>
              Are you an editor?</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> MAN IN OVERCOAT<br>
              I am a rabbi.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              Oh, my God, I said fuck to a rabbi. I'm<br>
              sorry.</p>
            <p> MAN IN OVERCOAT<br>
              I hope you don't mind my asking, but are<br>
              you Jewish?</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> MAN IN OVERCOAT<br>
              You should come to our temple.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              I'm not really religious.</p>
            <p> MAN IN OVERCOAT<br>
              Oh, I am surprised, you seem like a very<br>
              religious person.</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              You're kidding, right?</p>
            <p> MAN IN OVERCOAT<br>
              We are at West End Avenue and 83rd<br>
              Street. Every Friday night, we have a<br>
              joyous time, everyone dancing, everyone<br>
              singing. Also some wisdom. Perhaps you<br>
              have heard of us, we are known as The<br>
              Singles Temple.</p>
            <p> He smiles at her.</p>
            <p> MAN IN OVERCOAT<br>
              It's a very good place to calm down.</p>
            <p> The cab stops.</p>
            <p> MAN IN OVERCOAT<br>
              Oh, look, I am already here. Very nice<br>
              to meet you.<br>
              (gives the cabbie money)<br>
              Take this woman to her destination.</p>
            <p> He gets out. Closes the door. A beat too late:</p>
            <p> PATRICIA<br>
              Goodbye.</p>

            <p> EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY</p>
            <p> As George walks along Broadway, past the sign, which now<br>
              says: &quot;COMING SOON: A FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE&quot;. He sees it.</p>
            <p> INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER</p>
            <p> Kathleen and several CUSTOMERS in the store.</p>
            <p> George walks in and goes to the back to hang up his coat.<br>
              Christina is unpacking boxes. Birdie is at the desk. George<br>
              looks at Christina meaningfully.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              (totally mystified)<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              The coup de foudre. I had one. I<br>
              never believed in them, but I just had<br>
              one.</p>
            <p> BIRDIE<br>
              Is that the thing where you get cold<br>
              suddenly, bang?</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              No, that's the coup de vieux.</p>
            <p> BIRDIE<br>
              I had that.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              The coup de foudre is where you get<br>
              love suddenly, bang. A thunderbolt.</p>
            <p> BIRDIE<br>
              I had that too. Only I had it in<br>
              Seville, where it was called ,el<br>
              estruendo de amor.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              I don't know her name, or anything about<br>
              her. I may never see her again.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              And if you ever do meet her, you'll find<br>
              out all the horrible details, and that<br>
              will be that. She'll turn out to have<br>
              pictures of the Virgin Mary all over the<br>
              walls.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              I won't care.</p>
            <p> Kathleen sticks her head into the back.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Can someone help me out here?</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              George had a coup de foudre.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              And Christina's making fun of me.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Don't let her. I believe in this, I<br>
              completely believe in this. It happened<br>
              to Madame Bovary, at least six times.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              And she was wrong every time.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Yes!<br>
              (beat)<br>
              Who was she?</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              I don't know. She was standing outside<br>
              my building with the police and the<br>
              reporters.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              What police and reporters?</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              Someone died.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Who?</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              I have no idea about that either.<br>
              They found her on the roof.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              A dead body. That's so sad. But<br>
              you fell in love. That's so great.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              Oh. One other thing.</p>
            <p> EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY</p>
            <p> The sign is now complete and it says: &quot;Coming soon, just<br>
              around the corner. A Foxbooks Superstore.&quot;</p>
            <p> Kathleen and George and Christina stand there looking at it.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Quel nightmare.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              It has nothing to do with us. It's<br>
              big, impersonal, overstocked and <br>
              full of ignorant salespeople.</p>
            <p> GEORGE<br>
              But they discount.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              But they don't provide any service. We do.</p>
            <p> George and Christina nod.</p>
            <p> INT. BARNEY GREENGRASS - LUNCHTIME</p>
            <p> Kathleen is having lunch with Birdie.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              So really it's a good development. You<br>
              know how in the flower district, there<br>
              are all these flower shops in a row so<br>
              you can find whatever you want. Well,<br>
              this is going to be the book district.<br>
              If you don't have it, we do.</p>
            <p> BIRDIE<br>
              And vice versa.</p>
            <p> INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - DUSK</p>
            <p> Kathleen in the kitchen, unloading groceries. Frank is<br>
              standing there, plugging in an Olympia Report deluxe Electric<br>
              typewriter.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              When you are finished with Foxbooks, the<br>
              Shop Around the Corner is going to be<br>
              responsible for reversing the entire<br>
              course of the Industrial Revolution.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              That is so sweet, Frank. Thank you.<br>
              That is so sweet.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              Hey --</p>
            <p> He holds his arms out. They hug.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Although...</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              (over his shoulder, she notices the typewriter, breaks from the 
              hug)<br>
              What is that doing there?</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              Listen to it. Just listen--</p>
            <p> He strikes a key. Practically swoons.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              The Olympia Report deluxe Electric<br>
              Report. As in gunshot.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              That sound is familiar.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              Now listen to this.</p>
            <p> He puts his ear to the typewriter.</p>
            <p> Kathleen listens too.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              That whirring?</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              The gentle and soothing lullaby of a<br>
              piece of machinery so perfect --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I know where I've heard it before. I<br>
              know.</p>
            <p> She whips a cover off the other typewriter on the table.<br>
              It's the same machine exactly.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              I needed a backup.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Don't you have another one at your<br>
              apartment?</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              I might, I might. So what?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              You're turning my apartment into a<br>
              typewriter museum.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              I'll stop. I'll try. I probably can't.<br>
              I see one and my knees go weak. Anyway,<br>
              what were you starting to say?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              When?</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              Before.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Nothing.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              Come on.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I don't know. I was just wondering about<br>
              my work and all. I mean, what is it I do<br>
              exactly? All I really do is run a <br>
              bookstore --</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              All you really do is this incredibly<br>
              noble thing --</p>
            <p> Kathleen nods.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              But I don't know if I --</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              (stopping her)<br>
              Kathleen --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              But I just --</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              You are a lone reed.</p>
            <p> Kathleen looks puzzled.</p>
            <p> He sticks a piece of paper in the typewriter, starts typing.</p>
            <p> FRANK<br>
              You are a lone reed waving in the <br>
              breeze standing strong and tall in <br>
              the corrupt sands of commerce.</p>
            <p> He whips the piece of paper out of the typewriter and hands<br>
              it to her.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              (reading from it)<br>
              I am a lone reed.<br>
              (tries it on again)<br>
              I am a lone reed.</p>
            <p> Clutching her piece of paper, she wanders into the bathroom.</p>
            <p> INT. BEDROOM - DUSK</p>
            <p> We hear the sound of a typewriter begin to clack away in the<br>
              next room.</p>
            <p> Kathleen walks past her computer, looks at it. Then she goes<br>
              over to the window, looks out at her street at dusk.</p>
            <p> EXT. KATHLEEN'S STREET - DUSK</p>
            <p> A group of schoolgirls in uniform, in two straight lines,<br>
              walk past with a tall woman.</p>
            <p> INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DUSK</p>
            <p> She goes over to the bookshelf and pulls out a copy of<br>
              Madeleine by Ludwig Bemelmans and opens it to the<br>
              illustration of the twelve little girls in two straight lines<br>
              marching through the streets of Paris. She looks at it, then<br>
              looks up, lost in thought. We hear the sound of the computer<br>
              keys.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O.)<br>
              Sometimes I wonder about my life. I lead<br>
              a small life. Well, not small, but<br>
              circumscribed. And sometimes I wonder,<br>
              do I do it because I like it, or because<br>
              I haven't been brave? So much of what I<br>
              see reminds me of something I read in a<br>
              book, when shouldn't it be the other way<br>
              around?<br>
              (continued)</p>
            <p> And hold on her as she thinks about this.</p>
            <p> In the other room, we hear Frank typing.</p>
            <p> Kathleen goes to the computer, turns it on.</p>
            <p> EXT. KATHLEEN'S BUILDING - NIGHT</p>
            <p> As we see Kathleen, through her curtains, a small figure<br>
              barely lit by her computer.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)<br>
              I don't really want an answer. I just<br>
              want to send this cosmic question out<br>
              into the void. So goodnight, dear void.</p>
            <p> INT. DRIP - DAY</p>
            <p> Drip is a cafe on Amsterdam Avenue with Fifties-style couches<br>
              and chairs in cozy seating arrangements. Kathleen is<br>
              standing at the front counter with Christina, getting drinks.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              I went to the Foxbooks Website and you<br>
              can buy anything. They ship it to you<br>
              in a day. Maybe we should get a website.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              My mother would never have wanted us to<br>
              have a website. &quot;Every book you sell is<br>
              a gift from your heart.&quot; She always said<br>
              that.</p>
            <p> As they walk toward the back of the cafe, Kathleen notices a <br>
              stack of loose-leaf binders on the table.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              What if they put us out of business?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              It's out of the question. We're a<br>
              fixture in the neighborhood. We're<br>
              practically a landmark.<br>
              (indicating the binders)<br>
              Men For Women, Women for Men, Women for<br>
              Women -- what is this?</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              You fill out one of these forms and they<br>
              file it in the book and if someone wants<br>
              to meet you, they arrange it.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              What a stupid way to meet someone.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Compared to the Internet?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              My little thing on the Internet is just<br>
              a lark.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              So it's still going on?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              And I do not plan to meet him.<br>
              (indicating the book)<br>
              Why do I get the feeling that you are in<br>
              here somewhere?</p>
            <p> Christina flips the book open to her application.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              I came in here one night and drank too<br>
              much coffee and filled one out.<br>
              (off Kathleen's look)<br>
              Well how am I supposed to meet someone?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              You are a runner. Some day you will make<br>
              eye contact with another runner and --</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              No one ever even looks at me. They<br>
              don't. On top of which, who are they?<br>
              They could like the symphony. I could<br>
              never fall in love with someone who <br>
              likes to go to the symphony --</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I know. What are you supposed to do<br>
              there?</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              I don't know.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              Sit. You're supposed to sit.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              I could never fall in love with anyone<br>
              who smokes cigars either.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I'll tell you what I hate. Big fat legs<br>
              like stumps.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Yeah. I hate that too.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              The worst, the worst -- I could never,<br>
              under any circumstances, love anybody<br>
              who had a sailboat.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Neither could I.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              If I had to get up on Saturday morning<br>
              knowing that I was about to go down to<br>
              the pier and unravel all those ropes and<br>
              put on all that sunblock --</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              All that talk about the wind.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              And then you have to go out on the boat,<br>
              and you sail and sail and sail until you<br>
              are bored witless, and then, only then,<br>
              do they say, let's turn around and you<br>
              realize the trip is only half over, only<br>
              it's not, because the wind has changed --</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              It hasn't changed. It's died.</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              So then there's more talk about the wind.<br>
              While you just float up and down trying<br>
              not to get nauseous. And when you<br>
              finally get back, you have to clean up<br>
              the boat.</p>
            <p> CHRISTINA<br>
              Why don't people have boat maids?</p>
            <p> KATHLEEN<br>
              I know. There're all these people who<br>
              wouldn't be caught dead polishing a<br>
              doorknob in their house but put them on <br>
              a boat and they want to rub down <br>
              everything in sight.<br>
              <br>
              EXT. 19TH STREET BOAT BASIN - ANOTHER DAY</p>
            <p> Joe is on his sailboat. He is polishing his brass and whistling.</p>
            <p> ANNABEL<br>
              Joe --</p>
            <p> Joe jumps off the boat onto the dock to greet his<br>
              grandfather's daughter ANNABEL, 8, who is coming toward the<br>
              dock with GILLIAN, his father's overdecorated 32-year-old<br>
              fiance, her son, MATTHEW, 4, and the Nanny, MAUREEN.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Hello.<br>
              (picks up Annabel)<br>
              Annabel, how are you today?</p>
            <p> ANNABEL<br>
              Great.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              (picks up Matt)<br>
              Hey, big guy --</p>
            <p> GILLIAN<br>
              Don't I get a hello?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Hello, Gillian.</p>
            <p> GILLIAN<br>
              Kiss me. I'm going to be your wicked stepmother.</p>
            <p> Joe gives her a peck on the cheek.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Who is this?</p>
            <p> GILLIAN<br>
              Nanny Maureen. I brought her in case<br>
              you couldn't handle the kids.</p>
            <p> ANNABEL<br>
              Maureen's getting a divorce.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I'm sorry to hear that.</p>
            <p> MAUREEN<br>
              It's my own fault. Never marry a man who lies.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              That is so wise. Remember that, Annabel.</p>
            <p> ANNABEL<br>
              She taught Matt to spell his name.</p>
            <p> MATT<br>
              Fox. F-O-X.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Excellent, Matt.<br>
              (to Maureen)<br>
              Good work. You can have the day off.<br>
              I'll take over from here.<br>
              (to Gillian)<br>
              You must be late for something.<br>
              Volunteer work at the Henry Street<br>
              Settlement. Packing bandages for<br>
              Bosnian refugees. A course in <br>
              Chinese literature at Columbia.</p>
            <p> GILLIAN<br>
              I am. I'm having my eggs harvested.</p>
            <p> EXT. STREET FAIR - DAY</p>
            <p> There's a block street fair with little booths, sausage<br>
              sandwich concessions, etc. Annabel and Matt have been to the<br>
              makeup booth. Annabel is a cat and Matt is a pirate.<br>
              Annabel is carrying a goldfish in a baggie as they walk toward<br>
              Broadway.</p>

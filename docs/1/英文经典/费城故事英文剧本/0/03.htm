            TIGHT SHOT ON ANDREW, FACE TWISTED IN PAIN (INT./DAY) ...
            <p>Andrew rests his head against the wall, sweat covering his face. 
              A storm of fire has passed through him, and he's hoping it's over 
              for now.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I think I need to go to the hospital.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>MIGUEL ALVAREZ RUNS URGENTLY DOWN SPRUCE STREET, DODGING traffic 
              as he crosses Eleventh Street, toward Jefferson Hospital (EXT./DAY). 
              He hustles up the ramp toward the Emergency Entrance...</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>MIGUEL SHOVES THROUGH GLASS DOORS, INTO THE BUSTLING<br>
              Emergency Room (INT./DAY), FINDING </p>
            <p>ANDREW sitting on a gurney, holding a cotton ball against his arm, 
              where blood has been drawn, wearing a blanket over his shoulders, 
              fighting chills.</p>
            <p>Chandra and Bruno are waiting with Andrew. They exchange quick 
              hugs with Miguel and Andrew, ad libbing greetings and goodbyes.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Thanks, you guys.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              Yeah. Thanks, guys.</p>
            <p>Miguel puts his arms around Andrew.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Gillman's out of her office today. I told her to take a day off, 
              and she did, can you believe it? Did<br>
              you get someone to cover your class?</p>
            <p>Miguel touches Andrew's face, checking for fever.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              Don't worry about it. They took blood? A specimen?</p>
            <p>Andrew holds an empty specimen cup.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Aren't you giving an exam?</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              I said, don't worry about it.</p>
            <p>Miguel places a gentle kiss on Andrew's sweaty forehead.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL (CONT.)<br>
              You got a fever, baby.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, the facade cracks and TEARS STING Andrew's eyes.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I almost didn't make it to the bathroom, Miguel. I almost lost control 
              right in front of everybody.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              (holding him)<br>
              So what? It's nothing to be ashamed of. You have nothing to be ashamed 
              of, okay?</p>
            <p>Andrew pulls himself together, brushing aside tears, in control 
              of his emotions once more.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Wait, here's my guy... Hey!</p>
            <p>Andrew catches the attention of a harried INTERN, whose surgeon's 
              greens are covered with blood.</p>
            <p> INTERN<br>
              Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              About my blood work?</p>
            <p> INTERN<br>
              We're waiting...</p>
            <p>Miguel opens a small notebook, making notes.</p>
            <p> INTERN<br>
              ... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we 
              can take a look inside.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Sounds delightful.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              Why do you need to do this?</p>
            <p> INTERN<br>
              Who are you?</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              Who are you? Doctor... ?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              This is my partner. We keep<br>
              records of hospital visits.<br>
              Nothing personal.</p>
            <p> INTERN<br>
              Dr. Klenstein.<br>
              (to Andrew)<br>
              It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, 
              we ought to know right away.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              It could be parasites, an infection...</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              A reaction to AZT...</p>
            <p> KLENSTEIN<br>
              That's possible, but.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              He's not going through some painful procedure until we've cancelled 
              out everything else.</p>
            <p> INTERN<br>
              I'm trying to help your &quot;partner.&quot; You're not a member 
              of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              (to the Intern)<br>
              He's upset, he's sorry.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              Don't apologize for me.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              He's not sorry, okay, fine.<br>
              (the diplomat)<br>
              Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work 
              on getting a specimen, I'm<br>
              sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, 
              we'll hear from my doctor, and<br>
              we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?</p>
            <p> INTERN<br>
              Allright. I'll get on the lab about the blood work.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              (to the Intern)<br>
              I'm sorry.</p>
            <p>The INTERN walks away. Andrew's BEEPER BEEPS.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              That's the third time. I better call the office.<br>
              (smiling at Niguel)<br>
              Would you relax, please?</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              I am relaxed.</p>
            <p>Andrew HOBBLES toward a pay phone, outside a VISITOR LOUNGE, where 
              weary relatives are watching TV.</p>
            <p>Andrew drops a quarter into the phone.</p>
            <p> JOE MILLER'S VOICE<br>
              &quot;If you or someone you know...&quot;</p>
            <p>ANDREW'S POV ON TELEVISION: Joe Miller on the screen, with the 
              words &quot;Negligence... Malpractice... Auto accidents&quot;... 
              and in the background, PHOTOS of MAIMED, BURNED, INJURED CLIENTS.</p>
            <p> JOE (CONT.)<br>
              &quot;... has been injured through the fault of others, you may 
              be entitled to legal remedy...</p>
            <p>Andrew LAUGHS. Then, his call is answered:</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Shelby? It's me. Jamey's been beeping me, I... Okay, okay, calm 
              down. Put Jamey on.</p>
            <p> INTERCUT WITH:</p>
            <p>FIRST YEAR ASSOCIATE JAMEY COLLINS, SITTING AT ANDREW'S DESK (INT/DAY), 
              GRABS THE PHONE when Andrew's intercom BUZZES...</p>
            <p> JAMEY<br>
              (frantic)<br>
              Andy?! This is a disaster! We can't find your revisions on the Kronos 
              complaint!</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Slow down, Jamey, for Christ's sake!</p>
            <p> JAMEY<br>
              I went down to Word Processing to pick up the corrected copy, but 
              they said you haven't<br>
              delivered the corrections. I told them you've been working on it 
              at home, and...</p>
            <p>Andrew forgets his physical pain, this is more important.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I brought it in last night, around midnight. It's in my computer.</p>
            <p> JAMEY<br>
              What did you file it under?</p>
            <p>Jamey puts his hands on Andrew's computer keyboard.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              K-R-O-one.</p>
            <p>Jamey types the file name.</p>
            <p> ANDREW (CONT.)<br>
              Jamey, I don't have to mention, do I, that we're up against a statute 
              of limitations on this<br>
              complaint which runs out in...<br>
              (checks his watch)<br>
              Seventy-five minutes.</p>
            <p>Jamey stares dumbfounded at the computer monitor.</p>
            <p> JAMEY<br>
              It's not here, Andy.</p>
            <p>Andrew closes his eyes. He can't believe this.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              You go down to Word Processing and tell those motherfuckers they 
              better come up with that<br>
              complaint, now! Or they are fucking dead! You tell them that comes 
              from me!</p>
            <p>Andrew SLAMS the phone into its cradle.</p>
            <p>He pauses, takes a deep breath, and says to himself:</p>
            <p> ANDREW (CONT.)<br>
              Every problem has a solution. Every problem... has... a... solution.</p>
            <p>Calmer, Andrew returns to the gurney, putting on his shirt.</p>
            <p> ANDREW (CONT.)<br>
              Every problem has a solution...</p>
            <p>Miguel approaches with tea purchased at the canteen.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              Why are you getting dressed?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...</p>
            <p>Andrew puts his arms around Miguel.</p>
            <p> ANDREW (CONT.)<br>
              Thanks for leaving school, and coming here, and...<br>
              (pulling back, putting on his jacket)<br>
              I will be back. An hour, tops.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              You're going to the office?!</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              You're not smiling.</p>
            <p>Andrew rushes toward the exit doors.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking 
              like that? Are you insane?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              One hour!</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              Drew!</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I promise!</p>
            <p> CONTINUOUS CUT TO:</p>
            <p>ANDREW RUSHES TO THE STREET, HAILING A CAB (EXT./DAY) ...</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>ANDREW STEPS OUT OF THE TAXI IN FRONT OF THE WHEELER<br>
              Building, heading for the entrance (EXT./DAY) ...</p>
            <p>But he changes his mind, darting to the corner of the block.</p>
            <p>Andrew stops to buy a baseball cap from a VENDOR.</p>
            <p>He trots down an alley, past bags of garbage, entering the building 
              through a garage door.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>FROM A HIGH FLOOR, ANDREW CAN BE SEEN CLIMBING THE STEPS OF<br>
              an emergency stairwell (INT./DAY) ...</p>
            <p>Andrew passes CAMERA, out of breath. He's wearing the ball cap 
              PULLED TO HIS EYEBROWS to hide blotches on his forehead.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>ANDREW OPENS THE FIRE DOOR ON HIS FLOOR AT WYANT WHEELER, removing 
              the ball cap, baring the purple blotches. (INT./DAY)</p>
            <p>He walks quickly down the hall. Passing a COLLEAGUE, Andrew pretends 
              to scratch his face, attempting to hide the blotches as nonchalantly 
              as possible.</p>
            <p>He dashes past an office, ignoring Anthea.</p>
            <p> ANTHEA<br>
              Didn't expect to see you... ?</p>
            <p>He ducks into his office.</p>
            <p> CONTINUOUS CUT TO:</p>
            <p>SECRETARY SHELBY AT ANDREW'S DESK, FRANTICALLY SEARCHING through 
              papers (INT./DAY) ...</p>
            <p>Startled when he sees Shelby, Andrew spins toward the wall.</p>
            <p> SHELBY<br>
              I'm looking through the files but...</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Call the messenger service, have someone standing by...<br>
              (she reaches for the phone)<br>
              Your phone.</p>
            <p> SHELBY<br>
              Sure.</p>
            <p>Andrew keeps his face averted, until she's out of the room. He 
              goes to his computer, the monitor already glowing.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Think. You brought the discs in, you transferred...</p>
            <p>Rachel comes into his office.</p>
            <p> RACHEL<br>
              I thought I was supposed to be covering for you.<br>
              (blurts out)<br>
              God, Andy, you look awful.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be 
              filed by fucking five o'clock!<br>
              If it's late, there's no case...<br>
              (the mantra)<br>
              Every problem has a solution.</p>
            <p> RACHEL<br>
              What can I do?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look.</p>
            <p>She rushes out.</p>
            <p>Andrew begins shoving floppy discs into the slots on his computer, 
              bringing up each disc's directory.</p>
            <p> ANDREW (CONT.)<br>
              No.</p>
            <p>He throws the disc to the floor. Shoves in another.</p>
            <p>Shoves in another, bending it in half.</p>
            <p> ANDREW (CONT.)<br>
              No, goddammit!</p>
            <p>He pulls open a file drawer, dumping legal briefs onto the floor, 
              frantically spreading them around with his foot.</p>
            <p>Andrew THROWS a document across the room, takes a breath.</p>
            <p>He picks up the telephone.</p>
            <p> ANDREW (CONT.)<br>
              Bob? Something's come up. With Kronos. I don't want to upset Charles, 
              but...<br>
              (letting down his guard)<br>
              Oh, shit, Bob, the complaint's due in forty minutes and I can't 
              find it.<br>
              (suddenly)<br>
              No, you don't have to come...<br>
              (hanging up the phone)<br>
              Great. Fucking great.</p>
            <p>Andrew rubs his eyes, this is a nightmare.</p>
            <p>He switches off the overhead light. He slants the window blinds, 
              filling the room with shadow</p>
            <p>Bob Seidman comes into the office, typically cheerful.</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              C'mon, Andy, you didn't lose anything...</p>
            <p>Seidman is struck by the mess in the office, and Andrew's disheveled 
              appearance.</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN (CONT.)<br>
              Jesus.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I don't know what to do, Bob.</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              You'll never find it in the dark.</p>
            <p>Seidman FLIPS ON the overhead light. Andrew flinches.</p>
            <p>Seidman approaches. Andrew gives up trying to hide the purple blotches, 
              facing his mentor straight on.</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN (CONT.)<br>
              What in God's name... ?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Bob...</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              What's wrong with your face?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my 
              face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? 
              Fine. Now<br>
              can you help me find the complaint?</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              Allright. Calm down.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Sorry...</p>
            <p>Seidman sits in front of Andy's computer.</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              What was the file name?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              K-R-O-one.</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              Maybe you mistyped the name when you were saving it. We'll try combinations 
              of those letters...</p>
            <p>Seidman goes to work. Andrew leans over his shoulder.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              You're right, I probably just misfiled...</p>
            <p> KENTON (O.S.)<br>
              Andy?</p>
            <p>Walter Kenton is standing at Andrew's door. His demeanor is casual. 
              So casual it seems a little forced.</p>
            <p> KENTON (CONT.)<br>
              Some sort of problem?</p>
            <p>Andrew has kept his face averted. But now he TURNS DIRECTLY TOWARD 
              CAMERA, showing his face to Kenton.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Yeah, Walter. Yeah. Some sort of major problem.</p>
            <p>HOLD ON THIS CLOSE UP OF ANDREW...</p>

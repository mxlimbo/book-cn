            <p>Charles Wheeler, Walter Kenton, Kenneth Killcoyne, Bob Seidman 
              and SEVERAL LAWYERS and SPOUSES watch the game from a plush, private 
              box, complete with TV, bar, snack table. The lawyers wear Ralph 
              Lauren polos, chinos and ball caps. The place reeks of<br>
              cigar smoke. Walter Kenton has a twentyfive year old WIFE.</p>
            <p>Charles Wheeler's nine year old GRANDSON sits nearby. Wheeler turns 
              the GRANDSON'S ballcap around, smiling lovingly at the boy.</p>
            <p>JUST BEYOND WHEELER: The door to the box is opened by a SECURITY

            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>THE BRIGHTLY LIT, RESTRICTED, INNER CORRIDOR OF SPECTRUM Stadium 
              (INT./NIGHT) where Wheeler walks beside Bob Seidman, with Walter 
              Kenton and Kenneth Killcoyne just behind. SOUNDS OF THE GAME STILL 
              IN PROGRESS can be heard, but FAR AWAY.<br>
              Occasionally the lawyers are passed by FOOD SERVICE or LAUNDRY SERVICE 
              EMPLOYEES...</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              ... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. 
              Did any of them know Andy was sick? How did they know? Did he tell 
              them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None 
              of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. 
              Make sure everyone else does too... And<br>
              Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did 
              he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street?</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              Jesus.</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              (ignoring Seidman)<br>
              What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              Charles...</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly<br>
              belong to?<br>
              (with irritation)<br>
              What is it, Bob?!</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.</p>
            <p>They arrive at a quiet, semi-private cul de sac.</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought 
              AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic.</p>
            <p> KENTON<br>
              We ought to be suing him.</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              For Christ's sake, where's your compassion?</p>
            <p> KENTON<br>
              Compassion? Andy sucks cocks, Bob. He takes it up the ass. He's 
              a pervert.</p>
            <p>Only Seidman shows any kind of REACTION.</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of 
              our business.</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private 
              life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, &quot;I'm sick. 
              I might not be able<br>
              to see this through?&quot;</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              He was doing a great job.</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say 
              &quot;I might not be able to serve our<br>
              clients to the best of my ability?&quot; He said nothing. And now, 
              Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a<br>
              court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, 
              Philadelphia, judicial<br>
              establishment. My God.</p>
            <p> KILLCOYNE<br>
              Beckett doesn't want to go to court, he's hoping for a quick tasty 
              settlement.</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              A jury might decide that Andy has a case.</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he 
              has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob?</p>
            <p> KENTON<br>
              Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              (after a moment)<br>
              No. Not really.</p>
            <p>Wheeler walks away, followed by Kenton and Killcoyne.</p>
            <p>Bob Seidman stands alone in this dark place.</p>
            <p> CITY SOUNDS ON A WORK DAY AS WE CUT TO:</p>
            <p>EXTERIOR, JOE'S OFFICE BUILDING, ON A THURSDAY MORNING.</p>
            <p> CONTINUOUS CUT TO:</p>
            <p>JOB'S COLLEAGUE, FILKO, LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA (in Joe's 
              offices, INT./DAY):</p>
            <p> FILKO<br>
              Charles Fucking Wyant Wheeler?!</p>
            <p>Joe sweeps by, just arriving for work.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Morning, Filko.</p>
            <p>Filko keeps pace with Joe down the corridor. ANOTHER<br>
              COLLEAGUE calls out from an office as Joe passes:</p>
            <p> COLLEAGUE<br>
              Hey, it's the local chapter of the ACLU!</p>
            <p> FILKO<br>
              You're a Republican, Joe! You belong to the NRA!</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              How many toilet stalls are there in the women's restroom on this 
              floor, Filko?</p>
            <p> FILKO<br>
              How many... what?!</p>
            <p>Filko follows Joe into Joe's office.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Two. How many toilet stalls are there in the men's room? Two, plus 
              four urinals. How many wheelchair accessible toilets in either of 
              those restrooms?<br>
              Zero. In this entire building? Zero. Get the picture, Filko? Discrimination! 
              You find<br>
              yourself a female, paraplegic, legal assistant who is qualified 
              to work here, except she can't<br>
              take a leak... and you've got yourself a sex discrimination suit 
              and a handicapped<br>
              discrimination suit. Not handicapped. What do you call someone who 
              can't use a normal restroom? &quot;Gastro-intestinally challenged!&quot;</p>
            <p>Behind Joe, out a large window: PAINTERS on a scaffold.</p>
            <p>Iris comes into the office and says:</p>
            <p> IRIS<br>
              Wyant Wheeler's asking for a postponement on the prelim, Joe.Joe 
              is dialing the phone.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Low-life, sleazy scumbags. Of course they want a postponement, I've 
              got a client with a terminal<br>
              disease. They're going to drag their heels every step of the way, 
              the rotten bastards.<br>
              (tapping on the window, to the PAINTERS)<br>
              Is that spelled right?</p>
            <p> CONTINUOUS CUT TO:</p>
            <p>EXTERIOR, JOE'S OFFICE BUILDING, WHERE PAINTERS ARE ADDING A new

            <p> JOE (VO)<br>
              Hey, Beckett. This is Miller.</p>
            <p> CONTINUOUS CUT TO:</p>
            <p>JOE'S VOICE COMES THROUGH, ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE IN Andrew and 
              Miguel's loft (INT./DAY) </p>
            <p> JOE (VO) (CONT.)<br>
              I just wanted to tell you...</p>
            <p>CAMERA DRIFTS THROUGH the loft, finding Andrew in the rooftop solarium, 
              sitting crosslegged in front of a candle.</p>
            <p> JOE (VO) (CONT.)<br>
              ... we're trying to set a date for the prelim. Hang in there.</p>
            <p>Andrew's eyes are closed. Next to him rests a tape player. A WOMAN'S 
              VOICE IS HEARD, accompanied by NEW AGE MUSIC:</p>
            <p> WOMAN'S VOICE<br>
              I can heal myself.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I can heal myself.</p>
            <p> WOMAN'S VOICE<br>
              I can heal myself.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I can heal myself.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>ANDREW AND MIGUEL IN THEIR BEDROOM AT NIGHT, LYING CLOSE TO each 
              other in bed (INT./NIGHT) ...</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              I was coming out of the gym today, and I ran into Jimmy. Do you 
              know what he asked me? &quot;What's it like knowing your boyfriend's 
              going to die?&quot;</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Jerk... What did you say?</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              I said, &quot;Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going 
              to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to 
              be around to take advantage of it.&quot;</p>
            <p>Miguel strokes Andrew's hair.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              You got that right, Mikey...<br>
              (beat)<br>
              You still believe that, don't you?</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, 
              inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll<br>
              revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy 
              again.</p>
            <p>HOLD ON MIGUEL AND ANDREW, ON THIS QUIET MOMENT.</p>
            <p>FADE OUT.</p>
            <p>FADE IN: ESTABLISHING, EXT. PHILADELPHIA COURT HOUSE<br>

            <p>The figures APPROACHING CAMERA are Andrew and Joe, stepping into

            <p>REVERSE ANGLE -- DOWN AN OPPOSITE CORRIDOR:</p>

            <p>ON ANDREW AND JOE:</p>
            <p>Andrew's hair is short, but growing back, the blotches have receded,his 
              weight is up. He's in a stage of recovery.</p>
            <p>ON THE OTHER LAWYERS:</p>
            <p>Charles Wheeler (seeming ironic) and Walter Kenton (he's pissed) 
              lead the battalion.</p>
            <p>Behind them, walk young lawyers BELINDA CONINE and JEROME GREEN.

          <td> JOE AND LISA STAND OUTSIDE ANDREW'S APARTMENT -- IN COSTUME. DANCE 
            MUSIC is playing inside (INT./NIGHT) ... 
            <p>Lisa is dressed as a giant sandwich. Joe's costume looks quickly 
              thrown together: he's wearing a suit, but has pages from a legal 
              document stapled all over the suit.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?</p>
            <p> LISA<br>
              My lettuce is wilting.</p>
            <p>The DOOR IS OPENED -- by the LEAD SINGER OF WHITE SNAKE: big hair, 
              leather, guitar.</p>
            <p> ANDREW (AS ROCKER)<br>
              PARRTYY!</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              We're friends of Beckett's.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              It's me, you dork.</p>
            <p> LISA<br>
              I'm Lisa Miller.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Glad to finally meet you. Come on in.</p>
            <p> CONTINUOUS CUT TO:</p>
            <p>JOE AND LISA FOLLOW ANDREW INTO THE APARTMENT (HE LIMPS, relying 
              on his cane, but he's got A LOT OF ENERGY). The room is filled with 
              two Madonnas, an M.C. Hammer, three nuns, a can of soup<br>
              (INT./NIGHT) ...</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              (to Lisa)<br>
              I have to introduce you to the can of soup. You can enter the costume 
              contest together as a lunch special.</p>
            <p>Miguel approaches, dressed as a MEMBER OF MEGA-DEATH or ANTHRAX. 
              He strikes a pose, contorts his face and hits an air guitar riff. 
              Andrew crosses guitars with Miguel. Then:</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              This is Lisa Miller. Miguel Alvarez.</p>
            <p>Miguel's sister MARIA is passing by with a GROUP OF FRIENDS. Everyone 
              ad libs greetings.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              My sister, Maria.<br>
              (to Lisa)<br>
              Pastrami on rye?</p>
            <p> LISA<br>
              Corned beef.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              Want to dance?</p>
            <p> LISA<br>
              Sure!</p>
            <p>Miguel leads Lisa away. Joe is reluctant to give her up.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.</p>
            <p>Andrew studies Joe, trying to figure out the costume.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I'm a law suit.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Not bad.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Get it?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Let's find you a drink.</p>
            <p>Andrew leads Joe through the crowd, greeting Rachel, skin painted 
              blue (SMURFETTE) her daughter AMY (BART SIMPSON), Anthea, TYRONE 
              from Dr. Gillman's office (A COWBOY), and TYRONE'S LOVER (A HORSE) 
              ... Some of Dr. Gillman's PATIENTS are here too, including the YOUNG 
              ASIAN MAN who is now in a wheelchair. And, one or two of ANDREW'S 
              SIBLINGS may be present as well. And Alan, Bruno and Chandra, and 
              some arty friends and neighbors.</p>
            <p> ANDREW (CONT.)<br>
              What do you want?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Beer.<br>
              (patting his briefcase)<br>
              We need to go over your Q and A.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Sure. It's fine.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              No, we have to do it. But later, allright?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p>A MAN dressed as LA TOYA JACKSON (with fake snake) squeezes past 
              Joe, reaching for a beer.</p>
            <p> LA TOYA<br>
              'Scuse me, darling.</p>
            <p>Andrew is SMILING at Joe.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              You think I'm uncomfortable...</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Correct.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              You're right.</p>
            <p>Joe spills beer down his shirt.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p> CUT TO A SERIES OF PARTY MOMENTS OVER LOUD MUSIC:</p>
            <p>--Andrew and Miguel ROCKING to HEAVY METAL MUSIC, playing a battle 
              of the guitars. At one point, Andrew has to sit down, but he doesn't 
              stop &quot;playing,&quot; while Miguel jumps all around him.</p>
            <p>--Joe talking to a MAN DRESSED AS MARIE ANTOINETTE:</p>
            <p> MARIE ANTOINETTE<br>
              I'm an accountant. What do you do?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I'm a lawyer.<br>
              (points to Lisa)<br>
              That's my wife!</p>
            <p>--Andrew's mother Sarah, as Marge Simpson, delivers a tray of hors 
              d'oeuvres to Joe (standing next to a POLICEMAN):</p>
            <p> SARAH<br>
              Have a cocktail wienie.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Thanks, Sarah.<br>
              (to the POLICEMAN)<br>
              Nice costume.</p>
            <p> POLICEMAN<br>
              It's not a costume, I just got off work. You're cute.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              (pointing to Lisa)<br>
              That's my wife. Want to see a picture of my baby?</p>
            <p> POLICEMAN<br>
              (reaching for his wallet)<br>
              Absolutely. Want to see a picture of my baby?</p>
            <p>--Everyone SLOW DANCES to the Talking Heads tune &quot;Heaven&quot;<br>
              (Simply Red cover version): Joe and Lisa, Andrew and<br>
              Miguel, Rachel with a sleepy Amy in her arms, the POLICEMAN and 
              TYRONE, Sarah Beckett and MARIE ANTOINETTE, LA TOYA and her snake.</p>
            <p> &quot;HEAVEN&quot; CONTINUES OVER:</p>
            <p>A CAB IDLING IN THE STREET, LISA KISSING JOE (NIGHT).</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I'll see you in an hour, max.</p>
            <p> LISA<br>
              Night, honey.</p>
            <p>Lisa climbs into the cab which she is sharing with the NUN and 
              MARIE ANTOINETTE and LA TOYA.</p>
            <p> NUN/MARIE ANTOINETTE/LA TOYA<br>
              Night, Joe!</p>
            <p> &quot;HEAVEN&quot; CONTINUES OVER:</p>
            <p>QUIET IN ANDREW'S CONDO, THE PARTY LONG OVER (INT/NIGHT).</p>
            <p>Joe opens his briefcase, removing a legal pad with notes.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Congratulations, Miller.</p>
            <p>Andrew clears away party debris from the table, making space for 
              his legal work. He is attached to an IV line, which is connected 
              to a drip bag on a rolling stand, that can move with him. He is 
              no longer in costume.</p>
            <p> ANDREW (CONT.)<br>
              You survived your first gay party intact.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the 
              rest of us, in a place like where<br>
              I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... 
              homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are 
              weird, queers are<br>
              funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they 
              all want to cop your joint. And<br>
              that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you 
              want to know the truth.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Let's review these notes for your testimony. We have a big day on 
              Monday.</p>
            <p>Joe begins ticking off a list of courtroom reminders:</p>
            <p> JOE (CONT.)<br>
              When you refer to Wheeler, call him Charles, to show how you'd been 
              admitted to the inner circle, you<br>
              were considered one of them.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              (distracted)<br>
              Uh huh...</p>
            <p> JOE (CONT.)<br>
              Beckett?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Charles. Okay. Miller?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Do you... pray?</p>
            <p>Joe hesitates. They're having a personal conversation?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Yeah. Sure.</p>
            <p>Joe goes back to the notes:</p>
            <p> JOE (CONT.)<br>
              Then we establish how Wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              What have you prayed for?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For 
              the Phillies to get into the playoffs.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              (no self-pity)<br>
              There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I've considered that.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              What happens?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              We proceed, representing your estate.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will 
              need a lawyer. I know it's not<br>
              your area...</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I know a good probate lawyer.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Thanks.<br>
              (a beat)<br>
              Do you like opera?</p>
            <p>Andrew moves to the stereo, pulling the IV line with him.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Opera?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Want to hear my favorite aria?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Opera?</p>
            <p>SUDDENLY, AN ARIA BY MARIA CALLAS FILLS THE ROOM --<br>
              startling Joe with its VOLUME.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              (over the MUSIC)<br>
              Andrea Chenier, by Giordano. This is Madeleine. She's telling how, 
              during the French revolution, a mob set fire to her house. Her mother 
              died, saving her.</p>
            <p> &quot;I look...<br>
              The place that cradled me was burning!&quot;</p>
            <p> Do you hear the heartache in her voice? Then, here come the strings. 
              Everything changes. The music fills with hope. Madeleine says...</p>
            <p>Andrew sways through the room to the music, pulling the IV at his 
              side. He seems truly free and relaxed.</p>
            <p> ANDREW (CONT.)<br>
              &quot;It was during that sorrow that love came to me!</p>
            <p> A voice filled with harmony That said... Live still, I am Life!&quot;</p>
            <p> &quot;I am the god that descends From the heavens to the earth 
              To make of the earth A heaven!&quot;</p>
            <p>ANGLE ON JOE: Shifting, uncomfortable.</p>
            <p> ANDREW (CONT.)<br>
              &quot;I am Oblivion!<br>
              I am Glory!<br>
              I am Love, Love, Love!&quot;</p>
            <p>The MUSIC ENDS.</p>
            <p>Joe sits there, fidgeting. He reaches for his briefcase organizing 
              his notes.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I think I'll... I told Lisa.</p>
            <p>Andrew collects himself, as Joe rises from his chair.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Right.</p>
            <p>Andrew follows Joe to the door.</p>
            <p> ANDREW (CONT.)<br>
              (businesslike)<br>
              I'll look over the Q and A.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              You're ready, don't worry.</p>
            <p>An awkward moment, both men standing with their hands at their 
              sides -- will one of them initiate a handshake?</p>
            <p>Joe gives a little &quot;salute,&quot; then leaves.</p>

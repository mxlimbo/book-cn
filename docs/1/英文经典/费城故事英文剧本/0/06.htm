            A DOCTOR UNRAVELLING A BLOOD PRESSURE GAUGE (INT./DAY)
            <p> JOE<br>
              I'm not worried. What are you doing?</p>
            <p>Joe sits in his shirtsleeves on the examining table.</p>
            <p> DR. ARMBRUSTER<br>
              Checking your blood pressure, relax.</p>
            <p>The DOCTOR wraps the blood pressure unit around Joe's arm.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I didn't have contact. What do you consider &quot;contact?&quot; 
              We were sitting in the same room, three, four feet... What if you 
              shake hands? Wait. I know the answer. Only sex, or sharing needles. 
              I know that. We didn't shake hands, anyway.</p>
            <p>Dr. Armbruster squeezes the blood pressure pump,</p>
            <p> DR. ARMBRUSTER<br>
              The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily 
              fluids, namely blood and semen.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Right.</p>
            <p>Joe begins rolling down his sleeve.</p>
            <p> DR. ARMBRUSTER<br>
              Leave that.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about 
              this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go 
              home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the 
              news: &quot;whoops! We were wrong.' You can carry it on<br>
              your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. 
              What are you doing?</p>
            <p>Dr. Armbruster has been preparing a syringe.</p>
            <p> DR. ARMBRUSTER<br>
              We're going to draw blood.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Why are we going to do that?</p>
            <p> DR. ARMBRUSTER<br>
              Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              You want to give me an AIDS test?!</p>
            <p>Joe HOPS off the table.</p>
            <p> JOE (CONT.)<br>
              The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?</p>
            <p> DR. ARMBRUSTER<br>
              Right.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?</p>
            <p> DR. ARMBRUSTER<br>
              Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... 
              Even kissing someone with AIDS is<br>
              safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Thanks, Doc, but I don't need an AIDS test. Are you crazy? But thanks 
              for the information. Really.</p>
            <p>Joe throws on his jacket, opens the door... then TURNS BACK:</p>
            <p> JOE (CONT.)<br>
              In my past?</p>
            <p> ARMBRUSTER<br>
              IV drug use.</p>
            <p>Joe shakes his head.</p>
            <p> DR. ARMBRUSTER (CONT.)<br>
              A homosexual encounter.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Get real.</p>
            <p> DR. ARMBRUSTER<br>
              Unprotected sex with a prostitute.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              (thinking it over)<br>
              Uh.... No. Not really.</p>
            <p> DR. ARMBRUSTER<br>
              Or unprotected sex with someone you didn't know very well, any time 
              during the last twelve years.</p>
            <p>A MOMENT.</p>
            <p>Joe returns to the examining table, and rolls up his sleeve.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>ESTABLISHING: JOE'S HOUSE IN THE SUBURBS (EXT./NIGHT) ...</p>
            <p> LISA (VOICE OVER)<br>

            <p> JOE<br>
              Not especially.</p>
            <p>Lisa eats standing up, at the stove, while Joe walks the BABY in 
              their modern kitchen.</p>
            <p> LISA<br>
              How many gays do you know?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              How many do you know?</p>
            <p> LISA<br>
              Lots.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Who?</p>
            <p> LISA<br>
              Karen Berman. Aunt Teresa. My cousin Tommy who lives in Rochester. 
              Eddie Meyers from the office. Joe Cantwell, he's one of the partners. 
              His lover, Greg.<br>
              Stanley, the guy who's putting in our kitchen cabinets.</p>
            <p>For a moment, Joe is struck dumb. Then he says:</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... 
              lesbian?</p>
            <p> LISA<br>
              Duh...</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Since when?</p>
            <p> LISA<br>
              Probably since she was born.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with 
              a homosexual. You got me.</p>
            <p> LISA<br>
              Okay, Joe...</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't 
              they get confused?<br>
              &quot;Is that mine? I thought it was yours.&quot; Hey, call me old 
              fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe<br>
              you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic 
              idea really is.</p>
            <p> LISA<br>
              Fine, Joe.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and 
              faggot at the same time... I can't stand that shit. Now I'm being 
              totally honest with you.</p>
            <p> LISA<br>
              That's perfectly clear.</p>
            <p>CLOSE ON JOE, LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA:</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Would you take a client if you were constantly thinking: &quot;I 
              hope this guy doesn't touch me.<br>
              I don't even want him to breathe on me?&quot;</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>THE STREETS OF PHILLY ARE DUSTED WITH SNOW, STORE WINDOWS decorated 
              for Christmas. Joe steps out of the Famous 4th St. Deli, with a 
              package (EXT./DAY) ...</p>
            <p>TITLE: &quot;Two weeks later.&quot;</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>JOE SITS AT A TABLE IN THE PUBLIC LAW LIBRARY, SURROUNDED BY books 
              and legal pads, hard at work. He's eating a pastrami sandwich which 
              he hides behind a reference book when a LIBRARIAN saunters by (INT./DAY) 
              ...</p>
            <p>A CHAIR SQUEAKS and Joe LOOKS UP TO SEE:</p>
            <p>Andrew taking a seat across the room (the blotches have been reduced 
              by chemo, but he's struggling with a cold). Andrew removes notepads 
              and pens from his briefcase. He takes out a package of tissues, 
              blowing his nose.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              (under his breath)<br>
              Shit...</p>
            <p>Joe slides to the far end of his table, stacking seven or eight 
              HUGE REFERENCE BOOKS in front of him.</p>
            <p>JOE'S POV, PEERING THROUGH THE REFERENCE BOOKS:</p>
            <p>Andrew opens a book, taking notes. Rubs his eyes. Writes something. 
              Sneezes.</p>
            <p>A LIBRARIAN delivers a book to Andrew.</p>
            <p> LIBRARIAN<br>
              This is the supplement. You're right, there is a section on... (lowers 
              her voice)<br>
              ... HIV related discrimination.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p>Andrew takes the book from her -- but she remains.</p>
            <p> LIBRARIAN<br>
              We have a private research room available.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I'm fine, thanks.</p>
            <p>Andrew BLOWS HIS NOSE. Now other PATRONS are watching.</p>
            <p> LIBRARIAN<br>
              Wouldn't you be more comfortable in a research room?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              (pleasantly)<br>
              No. But would it make you more comfortable?</p>
            <p> LIBRARIAN<br>
              Whatever, sir.</p>
            <p>The LIBRARIAN turns away, shrugging to a PATRON, indicating she's 
              done all she can do.</p>
            <p>As Joe continues to watch: one of Andrew's NEIGHBORS picks up his 
              books and moves away.</p>
            <p>Joe rises, gliding down an aisle of books, keeping one eye on Andrew, 
              who concentrates on his work.</p>
            <p>Joe approaches, nonchalantly, as if he just happens to be sauntering 
              by. Suddenly he &quot;notices&quot; Andrew.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Fine.</p>
            <p>Andrew goes back to his work.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Who'd you get?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Find a lawyer?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              What's her name?</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Rayisha.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Rayisha. Very nice.</p>
            <p>Andrew focuses on his work. Joe steps away.</p>
            <p>Joe comes back.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              How did they find out?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              (a second, then:)<br>
              One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.</p>
            <p>Nearby, a CHINESE PROFESSOR looks up, startled, when she hears 
              the word &quot;lesion.&quot;</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Uh huh...</p>
            <p>Andrew concentrates on his work once more.</p>
            <p> JOE (CONT.)<br>
              How do you get from one lawyer spotting a lesion, which could have 
              been a bruise, to the partners deducing you had AIDS and basing 
              a decision to<br>
              terminate you on that conclusion?</p>
            <p>The CHINESE PROFESSOR moves away.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Good point.</p>
            <p>Andrew removes a legal pad with &quot;KENTON&quot; written in big 
              letters across the top, and lots of notes underneath.</p>
            <p> ANDREW (CONT.)<br>
              The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work 
              for Benton, Myers, in D.C.<br>
              There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and 
              off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the 
              office that her<br>
              lesions were caused by AIDS.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              They didn't fire her?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              No. They didn't fire her.</p>
            <p>Andrew goes back to his work. Joe stands there.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              So Kenton connected the... lesion, and whatever suspicions he had 
              about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the 
              whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to<br>
              let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, 
              their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p>Andrew goes back to work.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              There is no relevant precedent.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              (not looking up)<br>
              Arline decision. Supreme Court.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Arline?</p>
            <p>Andrew SHOVES the legal book toward Joe.</p>
            <p>CLOSE ON ANDREW'S HANDS (with one blotch) on the book's white pages.</p>
            <p>The book is still facing Andrew. If Joe wants to read it, he'll 
              have to turn it around.</p>
            <p>Joe looks at Andrew's hands. A MOMENT.</p>
            <p>Joe turns the book around, begins to read:</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              &quot;The Federal Vocational<br>
              Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits<br>

            <p>CAMERA CRANES UP, TOWARD THE CEILING... JOE CONTINUES<br>
              READING IN VOICE-OVER:</p>

              able to perform the duties required by<br>
              their employment...&quot;</p>
            <p>CAMERA GOES HIGHER, LOOKING DOWN ON THE ROWS OF BOOKS AND THE LONG 
              TABLES DOTTED WITH PEOPLE...</p>
            <p> JOE (VO) (CONT.)<br>
              &quot;Although the ruling did not address the specific issue of 
              HIV and AIDS discrimination...&quot;</p>
            <p>DISSOLVE TO SAME ANGLE AN HOUR LATER: Andrew and Joe face each 
              other at their table, but NO ONE ELSE remains at that table, or 
              at the table next to it...</p>
            <p> ANDREW (VO)<br>
              &quot;Subsequent decisions have held that AIDS is protected as a 
              handicap under law, not only<br>
              because of the physical limitations it imposes...&quot;</p>
            <p>DISSOLVE TO A SAME ANGLE AN HOUR LATER (DAY IS TURNING INTO NIGHT): 
              Joe pacing, Andrew reading. Their section of the library is COMPLETELY 
              EMPTY but for Andrew and Joe.</p>
            <p> ANDREW (VO) (CONT.)<br>
              &quot;But because the prejudice surrounding AIDS exacts a social 
              death which precedes the actual,<br>
              physical one...&quot;</p>
            <p>DISSOLVE TO SAME ANGLE, LATER: Andrew and Joe sit on the same side 
              of the table, reading the same book.</p>
            <p> JOE (VO)<br>
              &quot;This is the essence of discrimination: formulating<br>
              opinions about others not based on their individual merits but, 
              rather, on their membership in a<br>
              group with assumed characteristics...</p>
            <p>The library is QUIET. Andrew SNEEZES.</p>
            <p>Joe scoots his chair away from Andrew by eight inches.</p>

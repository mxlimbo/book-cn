            <p>Andrew steps into the booth.</p>
            <p> ANDREW (CONT.)<br>
              Now what do we do?</p>
            <p>Robert laughs, closing the door of the booth.</p>
            <p> ROBERT<br>
              I think we'll figure it out.</p>
            <p>BACK TO THE COURTROOM (INT./DAY):</p>
            <p>Joe sits with a stone-sober expression: this isn't easy.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              When? Approximately what year did<br>
              this event take place?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I guess it was 1984, 85.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out 
              there, called AIDS, and that<br>
              you could contract it through sexual activity?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with 
              HIV.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              But you were having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 
              1985?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the 
              way we are now. Or safe sex.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              You'd heard of AIDS in 1984, 85?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I'd heard of something. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't 
              know how you could get it,<br>
              or that it could kill you.</p>
            <p>CLOSE SHOT ON ANDREW -- losing strength.</p>
            <p> BELINDA (OS)<br>
              (sounds far away)<br>
              Do you need a break?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you 
              could to make sure no one knew<br>
              you were an active homosexual, correct?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              That is not correct. I never lied about it.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances 
              on their desks?</p>
            <p>IMAGE: ANDREW IN BOB SEIDMAN'S OFFICE, WORKING, SPOTTING A PHOTO 
              ON THE WALL OF BOB'S WIFE AND CHILDREN (INT./DAY).</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Some do. I didn't.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, 
              is that right?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              In some situations.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something 
              you're not, so much so that the<br>
              art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Objection!</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez 
              in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in 
              the porn theater?</p>
            <p>ANGLE ON MIGUEL, sitting next to Sarah.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              You could have infected him, isn't that right?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, 
              then, or how it is spread.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              Really?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p>Andrew wipes sweat from his forehead.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people 
              you worked with, correct?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              That's right.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware 
              of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired 
              you.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Absolutely.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              One. Here, in front of my ear.</p>
            <p>An ASSISTANT hands Conine a shaving mirror. She holds it before 
              Andrew.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              Remembering you are under oath, answering truthfully, can you see 
              the lesion on your face, in<br>
              this mirror, three feet away? Answering truthfully.</p>
            <p>Andrew looks in the mirror: the lesion is NOT very visible.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much 
              bigger...</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              Answer the question, please.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              No. I can't really see it.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p>Andrew rubs his eyes.</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT (OS)<br>
              (far away)<br>
              This would be a good time to break for the day...</p>
            <p> JOE (OS)<br>
              (far away)<br>
              Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT (OS)<br>
              (far away)<br>
              Beckett?</p>
            <p>Andrew finds the Judge looking at him.</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT (CONT.)<br>
              Can you go on for ten minutes?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Yes sir.</p>
            <p>Joe JUMPS UP from the plaintiff's table.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I only need five!<br>
              (to Belinda, reaching for the mirror)<br>
              May I?</p>
            <p>Joe approaches Andrew, with the mirror.</p>
            <p> JOE (CONT.)<br>
              Do you have any lesions on any part of your body, at this time, 
              that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you 
              were fired?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Yes. On my torso.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              If it please the court, I'd like to ask Mr. Beckett to remove his 
              shirt, so that the jury can have an accurate idea of what we're 
              talking about.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, 
              would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about 
              AIDS, we're<br>
              talking about lesions. Let's see what we're talking about.</p>
            <p>ANGLE ON MEMBERS OF THE JURY -- LOOKING APPREHENSIVE.</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT<br>
              (a moment, then)<br>
              I'll allow it. Would you mind removing your shirt, Mr. Beckett?</p>
            <p>ANGLE ON MIGUEL -- TENSE.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Allright.</p>
            <p>The COURTROOM TURNS SILENT.</p>
            <p>Andrew removes his suit jacket. He's weak, so the smallest gesture 
              requires effort.</p>
            <p>ANGLE ON BOB SEIDMAN -- WATCHING.</p>
            <p>Andrew undoes his tie.</p>
            <p>ANGLE ON THE MARINE JUROR -- WATCHING.</p>
            <p>Andrew unbuttons his collar buttons, working his way down.</p>
            <p>ANGLE ON SARAH BECKETT -- WATCHING.</p>
            <p>Andrew stands, pulling his shirttails out of his trousers.</p>
            <p>ANGLE ON CHARLES WHEELER -- WATCHING.</p>
            <p>Andrew removes his shirt -- THERE ARE PURPLE BLOTCHES SPLAYED ACROSS 
              HIS CHEST AND ABDOMEN AND ARMS.</p>
            <p>The SCHOOLTEACHER JUROR GASPS.</p>
            <p>Sarah Beckett is silently crying.</p>
            <p>The LESBIAN JUROR closes her eyes.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p>CAMERA MOVES IN ON CHARLES WHEELER...</p>
            <p> CUT TO:<br>
              COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR, ACTIVITY (INT./DAY) ...</p>
            <p>Charles Wheeler strides down the corridor, flanked by Kenton, Killcoyne 
              and Belinda, discussing strategy.</p>
            <p>Bob Seidman steps to Wheeler's side, keeping pace.</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              I've discovered something interesting, Charles.</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              (to Belinda)<br>
              ... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.<br>
              (to Seidman)<br>
              What, Bob?</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              No matter how hard I try, I can't lose a file in my<br>
              computer.</p>
            <p>NOW he's got EVERYONE'S attention.</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN (CONT.)<br>
              The system automatically makes a backup.</p>
            <p>Belinda holds up both hands, interrupting with:</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              I don't think I should hear this.</p>
            <p>She walks away, giving a glance over her shoulder as:</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              You can erase the backup...<br>
              (a challenge to Wheeler)<br>
              But why would you?</p>
            <p> KENTON<br>
              (venomous)<br>
              What's the point, Bob?</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              (calm)<br>
              Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a note of that. Andy didn't lose 
              the complaint in his computer. He<br>
              never put it in. He lied about that, too.</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              (weary)<br>
              Charles...</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              If you feel differently, Bob, you should say so, when you're called 
              to the stand. After all, this<br>
              isn't a conspiracy.</p>
            <p>Wheeler and the gang moves on, leaving Seidman alone in the high-ceilinged 
              corridor.</p>
            <p>Belinda hesitates, before re-grouping with Wheeler and the rest, 
              casting a curious glance toward Bob Seidman.</p>

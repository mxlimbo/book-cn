            <p> JAMEY<br>
              Yes. We found a copy. It been incorrectly filed...</p>
            <p>TITLE: &quot;Plaintiff's case, day ten.&quot;</p>
            <p> JAMEY (CONT.)<br>
              We got it to court on time.</p>
            <p>ANGLE ON THE JURY: Several JURORS write in notebooks like the Marine's; 
              he's been handing them out...</p>
            <p>Joe seems ill at ease today, a little off his game. When he glances 
              at Andrew, it's with irritation.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Has a file ever disappeared like that before? Vanished into thin 
              air, all of a sudden, only to<br>
              reappear in the nick of time?</p>
            <p>Jamey answers nervously:</p>
            <p> JAMEY<br>
              I've never known that to happen before. No.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              (fires this question)<br>
              Did you have something to do with this file being lost accidentally-on-purpose?</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              Objection!</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I'll rephrase.<br>
              (to Jamey)<br>
              Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?</p>
            <p> JAMEY<br>
              Absolutely not.</p>
            <p>Joe stands, staring at Jamey. Too long. Jamey squirms.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Are you a homosexual?</p>
            <p> JAMEY<br>
              What?!</p>
            <p>Joe pressing forward, toward Jamey.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              C'mon, Mr. Collins. Are you homosexual? You know, gay?</p>
            <p>The COURTROOM ERUPTS: ACTIVISTS booing Joe, Wheeler's crowd expressing 
              OUTRAGE, JURORS looking confused.</p>
            <p>Andrew takes in the commotion, as the JUDGE BANGS HIS GAVEL.</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT<br>
              Hold it, hold it!</p>
            <p>Andrew trains his attention on Joe.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              Objection! Where has this come from?! Suddenly Counsel is attacking 
              his own witness. Mr. Collins' sexual orientation has absolutely 
              no relevance to this case.</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT<br>
              I said, HOLD IT!<br>
              (the courtroom QUIETS)<br>
              Mr. Miller. Could you kindly share with me exactly what's going 
              on in your brain, because I don't<br>
              have a clue at the moment.</p>
            <p>Joe faces Andrew, also curious to know what Joe's up to.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Your Honor, everyone in this courtroom is thinking about sexual 
              preference, sexual orientation,<br>
              whatever you want to call it. They're looking at me, and wondering 
              about it...<br>
              (looking at Andrew)<br>
              They're looking at Mr. Beckett, and wondering about it. They're 
              looking at Mr. Wheeler and wondering about it. They might even be 
              looking at you and wondering about it. So, let's get it out in the 
              open. Let's talk about what this case is really<br>
              about: the general public's hatred... our loathing, our fear of 
              homosexuals.</p>
            <p>DEAD SILENCE while the Judge thinks it over.</p>
            <p>CLOSE ON ANDREW.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              (to himself)<br>
              Very good.</p>

            <p>CLOSE ON JAMEY COLLINS, sweating bullets on the stand.</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT<br>
              In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, 
              creed, color, religion.<br>
              And sexual orientation.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, 
              do we?</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT<br>
              No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain 
              the defense's objection.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>COURTHOUSE MEN'S ROOM, FIVE URINALS, THREE SINKS (INT./DAY).</p>
            <p>The MARINE JUROR, the RETIRED POSTAL WORKER JUROR, and AN UPTIGHT 
              BUSINESSMAN JUROR stand at the urinals, with an empty urinal between 
              each of them. The MARINE JUROR whistles while he pees (a classic 
              rock tune, like &quot;Radar Love.&quot;) The BUSINESSMAN sighs, 
              &quot;Ahhhhhh.&quot;</p>
            <p>The RETIRED POSTAL WORKER JUROR jingles change.</p>
            <p>The ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR enters, stepping up to the urinal between 
              the BUSINESSMAN and the MARINE. He unzips, and it seems to take 
              him an incredibly long time to extricate his urinary organ. This 
              does not escape the MARINE'S notice.</p>
            <p> ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR<br>
              (innocently, to Marine)<br>
              I have some gay friends. What's the biggie?</p>
            <p>The MARINE says nothing.</p>
            <p> ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR (CONT.)<br>
              Everybody has a couple of gay friends. Don't you?</p>
            <p> MARINE<br>
              No, sir. I do not.</p>
            <p>The MARINE moves closer to the urinal, so that no one can see his 
              private parts.</p>
            <p> ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR<br>
              You might have them, and just not know they're gay.</p>
            <p>The MARINE shakes, zips, flushes, turns away. He pauses to look 
              directly at the ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR.</p>
            <p> MARINE<br>
              I know.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>WALTER KENTON ON THE WITNESS STAND (INT./DAY) ...</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              And how many weeks at a time would you be out to sea, without stopping 
              at port?</p>
            <p> KENTON<br>
              Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Any women on board?</p>
            <p>Kenton glances at the MARINE JUROR.</p>
            <p> KENTON<br>
              Not when I was in the Navy.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women 
              in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime 
              of their life, at<br>
              the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, 
              hormonal instincts... Anything going on?</p>
            <p> KENTON<br>
              Going on... like...? </p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.</p>
            <p>Andrew covers his face with his hands.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              Objection!</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT<br>
              Mr. Miller!</p>
            <p> KENTON<br>
              (can't resist)<br>
              We had one guy like that.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              You haven't ruled on my objection, Your Honor.</p>
            <p>Kenton seems eager to tell his story. Joe stands with crossed arms, 
              waiting.</p>
            <p> JUDGE GARNETT<br>
              Let's continue.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              (to Kenton)<br>
              You had one guy &quot;like that?&quot;</p>
            <p> KENTON<br>
              Yeah. But we took care of him.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              How did you do that?</p>
            <p> KENTON<br>
              We stuck his head in the latrine, after ten of us had used it.</p>
            <p>LAUGHTER and SOME APPLAUSE from some SPECTATORS, and some JURORS. 
              ACTIVISTS BOO and HISS.</p>
            <p>The JUDGE POUNDS HIS GAVEL.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              You taught him a lesson.</p>
            <p> KENTON<br>
              Yes, we did.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Like firing Andrew Beckett taught him a lesson?</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              Objection!</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I'll withdraw.<br>
              (moving on quickly)<br>
              You were aware, when you worked with Maria Torres, that she had 
              AIDS, correct?</p>
            <p> KENTON<br>
              She didn't try to conceal it.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, 
              is that correct?</p>
            <p> KENTON<br>
              I know the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize 
              the difference.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out 
              she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided 
              her, is that correct?</p>
            <p> KENTON<br>
              I felt, and still feel, nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion 
              for people like Maria, who have contracted this terrible disease 
              through no<br>
              fault of their own.</p>
            <p> CUT TO LOUD CLASSICAL MUSIC:</p>
            <p>IN THE KITCHEN OF THEIR APARTMENT, MIGUEL POURS MEDICINE into an 
              IV drip unit (INT./NIGHT) ...</p>
            <p>LOUD CLASSICAL MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND.</p>
            <p>Miguel glances at a chart on the wall, in which a day is broken 
              into hours, with medical instructions for each hour</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              (shouting over MUSIC)<br>
              Drew! Are you ready? If we start at eight, we'll be done by twelve.</p>
            <p>Miguel taps the IV bag, getting the drip started.</p>
            <p>A cat jumps onto the counter. Miguel holds it.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>ANDREW SITS AT THE DININGROOM TABLE, MAKING NOTES ON A LEGAL pad, 
              holding out his left arm (INT./NIGHT). A catheter is imbedded into 
              Andrew's arm, and Miguel is trying to get the IV drip started through 
              the catheter. The MUSIC is lower...</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              It's not going through.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              (focused on his work)<br>
              We'll have to flush it again.</p>
            <p>Andrew reaches for a law book.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              Hold still. Shit.<br>
              (trying again)<br>
              The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, 
              so they can change the goddamn<br>
              catheter.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              We're not skipping this treatment.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              Fuck you.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              That shit's saving your life, you asshole!</p>
            <p>Miguel shoves away from the table.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              What's wrong with you?</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              Close the law book.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I'm not going to close the--</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!</p>
            <p>Andrew slams it SHUT.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!<br>
              (beat)<br>
              Jesus!</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit 
              into your arm. Forget the<br>
              fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              (very quiet)<br>
              You don't think there's much time left, do you?</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              That's not what I said.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              You're scared. You think we're near the end.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start 
              planning my memorial service?<br>
              &quot;Begin to prepare for the inevitable.&quot;</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              (low)<br>
              Maybe you should think about it.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              What's that mean?!</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              (very difficult)<br>
              Maybe you should think about it.</p>
            <p>A MOMENT.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I'm not going to die.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You<br>
              don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into victims?</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              Then, what are we, Drew?! The winners? &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, 
              the first prize of AIDS goes to<br>
              Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel...&quot; Excuse me, I'm not 
              your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK!</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I'm not ready to die.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL<br>
              Do you think I'm ready for it?! I hate this shit. I'm not a fucking 
              martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it!</p>
            <p>Miguel slides down the wall, sitting in a heap.</p>
            <p>Andrew goes to him. They hug. Miguel holds him tight.</p>
            <p> MIGUEL (CONT.)<br>
              Please don't leave me. I love you so much. Don't die, don't leave 
              me, please...</p>
            <p>Miguel rocks in Andrew's arms. Andrew kisses the top of his head, 
              holding tight.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I am so scared. I am so fucking,<br>

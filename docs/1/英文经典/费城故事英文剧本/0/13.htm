            <p> DIALOGUE OVERLAP AND DISSOLVE TO:</p>
            <p>ANDREW ANSWERING A QUESTION AN HOUR OR SO LATER (INT./DAY).</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Wyant Wheeler had aggressively recruited me. They were the most 
              prestigious firm in Philadelphia, full of opportunity. And I was 
              impressed by the partners.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Including Charles Wheeler?</p>
            <p>(Andrew frequently wipes sweat from his forehead with a handkerchief. 
              His voice is hoarse, raspy.)</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Particularly, Charles.</p>
            <p>ANGLE ON WHEELER.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              What impressed you about him?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              What kind of person is that?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. A razor sharp 
              litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best 
              in others. An awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of 
              legal<br>
              concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street.<br>
              (a smile)<br>
              The kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn't sweat. 
              But underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous spirit.</p>
            <p>Belinda Conine MAKES A NOTE ABOUT THAT.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but 
              I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              You didn't look then, the way you look now?</p>
            <p>REVERSE -- ON ANDREW IN THE WITNESS STAND, BUT NOW HE LOOKS COMPLETELY 
              DIFFERENT (The healthy. pre-AIDS Andrew.)</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              No. I was thirty pounds heavier. I was athletic.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              A regular all-American guy?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I suppose you could say that.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Except... you were gay?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I still am.</p>
            <p>SPECTATORS CHUCKLE.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles 
              Wheeler you were gay?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              No. I didn't.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Can you explain why you didn't?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed 
              to have a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, 
              eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club...</p>
            <p>IMAGE: WHEELER. ANDREW. SEIDMAN. OTHERS IN A LOCKER ROOM OF A TENNIS 
              CLUB, WEARING TOWELS, ENTERING A SAUNA (INT./DAY).</p>

              Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I'm seeing him this afternoon.</p>
            <p>INSIDE THE SAUNA: CAMERA PANS SEVERAL MEN.</p>
            <p> ANDREW (VOICE OVER)<br>
              &quot;Somebody started telling jokes.&quot;</p>
            <p> FIRST MAN<br>
              What do you call a woman who has PMS and ESP at the same time?.</p>
            <p> SECOND MAN<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> FIRST MAN<br>
              A bitch who knows everything.</p>
            <p>LAUGHTER. Andrew keeps his eyes closed, leaning against the wall 
              of the sauna, next to Wheeler, relaxing.</p>
            <p> CHARLES WHEELER<br>
              How does a faggot fake an orgasm?</p>
            <p>Andrew opens one eye.</p>
            <p> CHARLES WHEELER (CONT.)<br>
              He spits on your back.</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              Charles, that's revolting!</p>
            <p>All the men LAUGH, and Wheeler LAUGHS THE HARDEST.</p>
            <p> JOE (VOICE OVER)<br>
              How did that make you feel?</p>
            <p>IMAGE: BACK TO THE COURTROOM. ANDREW IN THE WITNESS STAND (And 
              it's the sick, thin Andrew with AIDS).</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Relieved. That I'd never told him I was gay. Very relieved.</p>
            <p>ANGLE ON CHARLES WHEELER: shakes his head, a denial.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Are you a good lawyer?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I'm an excellent lawyer.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              What makes you an excellent<br>
              lawyer?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the 
              only thing I've ever wanted to do.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              What do you love about it?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that 
              every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get 
              to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when<br>
              that happens.</p>

            <p> BELINDA<br>
              You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had &quot;an 
              adventurous spirit.&quot; Is<br>
              that correct?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Something like that.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              Do you take risks?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>
              In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Not unnecessary ones.</p>
            <p> BELINDA<br>

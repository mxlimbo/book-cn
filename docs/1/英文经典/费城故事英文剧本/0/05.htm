            as he enters the room where Wheeler, Kenton, Killcoyne, Bob Seidman 
            are waiting (INT./DAY) ... 
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              Sit down, Andy.</p>
            <p>Wheeler's secretary, LYDIA, takes notes.</p>
            <p> WHEELER (CONT.)<br>
              Thanks for coming in.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Of course.</p>
            <p>Bob Seidman CANNOT look directly at Andrew.</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              Andy. Before we begin, I'd just like to say: everyone in this room 
              is your friend.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              You're in trouble.</p>
            <p>(NOTE: Joe IS SEEN IN HIS OFFICE, or LEANING AGAINST A WINDOW IN 
              THE CONFERENCE ROOM whenever he speaks.)</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I know that, Charles.</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              More than your friend. Family.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Big trouble.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Charles, I must apologize again, for the Kronos mishap.<br>
              (smiling)<br>
              It was a scary few minutes around here. Wow. But thank God, the 
              complaint was found. And no damage was done.</p>
            <p> KENTON<br>
              This time. What about next time?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind 
              of... stupor, a fogginess,<br>
              a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?</p>
            <p> KENTON<br>
              Helloooo...</p>
            <p> KILLCOYNE<br>
              That's right, Andy. The last four, five months you've seemed really 
              out of it...</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              At least... different, somehow.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              (keeping it positive)<br>
              Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos 
              complaint, a preliminary<br>
              injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same 
              time...</p>
            <p> KENTON<br>
              Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Really? Who thinks that, sir?</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              I do.</p>
            <p>Wheeler seems very grave.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              I had no idea there was a concern in that area. Hey:<br>
              (a smile)<br>
              I'll get to work on it right away.</p>
            <p>NO ONE else smiles.</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel 
              that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with 
              you.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Honesty is always best.</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              Do you really think so, Andy?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Yes, Bob, I do.<br>
              (to the group)<br>
              Excuse me? Am I being fired?</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm 
              is no longer secure.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              In a word, yes.</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              We don't think it's fair to keep you here, where your future is 
              limited. But we wish you luck,<br>
              Andy, all the luck in the world.</p>
            <p>Wheeler rises, wearing a friendly smile.</p>
            <p> WHEELER (CONT.)<br>
              And I hate to rush you out of here, but...</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              ... we've got a committee meeting.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Excuse me, Charles. With all due respect... this is... preposterous! 
              It doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone 
              else.<br>
              Pardon the lack of humility, but I've had the distinct impression 
              I was kind of... one of the<br>
              rising stars around here. And I feel that wasn't just my imagination. 
              And I also think I deserve to know what's really going on here, 
              Charles.</p>
            <p> KENTON<br>
              Oh, you're right, Beckett, you don't have an attitude problem.</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              Take it easy, Walter.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could 
              say it was a carrot.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              A carrot?!</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I buy that.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              As in, the vegetable?</p>
            <p> SEIDMAN<br>
              (suddenly emotional)<br>
              Andy, you nearly blew the case, for God's sake! That alone is inexcusable. 
              It would have been<br>
              catastrophic for us. Put yourself in our shoes, Andy. There's no 
              coming back from an error like that, regardless of who you are!<br>
              (softer)<br>
              I'm sorry, Andy.</p>
            <p>Andrew FREEZES -- the full nature of this situation hitting home. 
              He looks each of the PARTNERS in the eye...</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Uh huh... Okay... I see...</p>
            <p>... at last LOOKING DIRECTLY AT Wheeler's secretary Lydia, whose 
              pen is poised above her notebook, waiting for someone to say something.</p>
            <p>Wheeler breaks the silence.</p>
            <p> WHEELER<br>
              Good luck, Andy.</p>
            <p>Wheeler, Kenton, Killcoyne, Seidman and Lydia file out.</p>
            <p>Andrew doesn't move.</p>
            <p>A SECURITY GUARD enters the room.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Who are you?</p>
            <p> SECURITY GUARD<br>
              I'm here to escort you to your office so you can organize your belongings.</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p>CAMERA PULLS BACK FROM ANDREW, WE'RE IN JOE'S OFFICE (DAY) ...</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Okay. Explain to me like I'm a two year old, because there's an 
              element to this I can't get through my thick head: Didn't you have 
              an obligation to inform your employer you had this dreaded, deadly, 
              infectious disease?</p>
            <p>Andrew removes his ballcap -- his hair is cut short, to disguise 
              the effects of chemo.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              The law says people with disabilities cannot be<br>
              terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their 
              position...</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, 
              terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid 
              reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families...<br>
              Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with 
              someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case 
              of acne. And how<br>
              do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Joe, from the day I arrived to the day they fired me, I performed 
              consistently, thoroughly and with absolute excellence. And if they 
              hadn't fired me, that's what I'd be doing today.</p>
            <p><br>
              JOE<br>
              Okay... They want you out. It's against the law to fire you for 
              having AIDS, so they make you<br>
              look like a fuck up. Which leads us to the mysterious, lost file.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              They sabotaged me.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see 
              a case.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal 
              reasons...</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Correct. I don't.</p>
            <p>Andrew rises, thoroughly business-like.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              Thanks for your time.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking 
              kick in the head.</p>
            <p> ANDREW<br>
              (a smile)<br>
              Don't send flowers, Joe. I'm not dead yet.</p>
            <p>Andrew exits.</p>
            <p> CONTINUOUS CUT TO:</p>
            <p>ANDREW LEAVES JOE'S OFFICE, MOVING DOWN THE CORRIDOR<br>
              (DAY) ...</p>
            <p> IRIS<br>
              (still uncomfortable, as Andrew's leaving)<br>
              Have a nice day.</p>
            <p>Andrew nods, passing one of Joe's colleagues, a hustler named FILKO, 
              who STARES SHAMELESSLY.</p>
            <p>Joe approaches Iris's desk.</p>
            <p> JOE<br>
              Find out if Armbruster can see me this afternoon.</p>
            <p> FILKO<br>
              (still staring)<br>
              What the hell's wrong with him?</p>

              excuse me,where do I sign in? Hah, I see you have a sword. I have 
              one too. They'revery manly and tough [Mulan bites her lip as she 
              mishandles pulling the swordout of the scabbard and it falls to 
              the ground. Khan rolls on his back inlaughter. Mulan throws her 
              shoe and hits Khan in the head with it quietingKhan]. I'm working 
              on it. Who am I fooling? It's going to take a miracle toget me into

                on eitherside. Mushu's real appearance remains out of sight]</p>
              <p>Mushu [in a Southern Baptist Preacher's voice]: Did I hear someone 
                ask for amiracle!? Let me hear you say aye!</p>

                a hand shadow of adragon on the rock and stamps him down with 
                his foot] to guide you throughyour masquerade. [bending down to 
                Cri-Kee] C'mon, you're gonna stay you'regonna work. [returning 
                to Mulan] Heed my word, 'cause if the army finds outthat you are 
                a girl, the penalty is death. [big flames shoot up from therocks]</p>
              <p>Mulan: Who are you?</p>

              <p>Mushu: Intimidating? Awe inspiring?</p>
              <p>Mulan [making a hand gesture to denote his smallness of size]: 
                Tiny.</p>
              <p>Mushu [with a look of disappointment]: Of course. I'm travel 
                size for yourconvenience. If I was my real size, your cow here 
                [patting Khan on the nose]would die of fright. [Khan tries to 
                bite Mushu] [pointing to the groundspeaking to Khan] Down Bessy. 
                My powers are beyond your mortal imagination. For instance, [leaning 
                in and looking at Mulan's chest] my eyes can seestraight through 
                your armor. [Mulan cover her bust with her left arm andslaps Mushu 
                with the right] Ow. [angrily] All right, that's it! Dishonor! 
                Dishonor on your whole family. [aside to Cri-Kee] Make a note 
                of this[Cri-Kee grabs a leaf and a pen and starts writing]. [Loudly 
                with gusto]Dishonor on you. Dishonor on your cow. Dis-</p>
              <p>Mulan [pleadingly while covering Mushu's mouth]: Stop! I'm sorry, 
                I'm sorry[kneeling down in front of Mushu]. I'm just nervous. 
                I've never done thisbefore.</p>
              <p>Mushu: Then you're gonna have to trust me. And don't you slap 
                me no more, weclear on that? [Mulan nods emphatically]. All right. 
                Okey dokey, let's getthis show on the road. Cri-Kee, get the bags 
                [Mushu starts walking to thecamp]. [to Khan] Let's move it heifer.</p>

              <p>Mushu [hiding in Mulan's armor poking his head out from her back]: 
                Okay thisis it, time to show 'em your man walk. Shoulders back, 
                chest high, feetapart, head up [Mushu pulls Mulan's head back] 
                ...and strut 2, 3, break itdown, 2, 3 and work it, [Mulan walks 
                into the camp drawing the attention themen who see her. Mulan 
                walks into a tent and sees a man picking his nose andanother man 
                picking out dirt from between his toes with chopsticks] Beautifulisn't 
                it?</p>
              <p>Mulan [making a face of disgust and continuing to walk]: They're 
                disgusting.</p>
              <p>Mushu: No, they're men. And you're going to have to act just 
                like them, sopay attention.</p>
              <p>[Mulan stops and watches Yao, Ling, Chien-Po and Tattoo Soldier]</p>
              <p>Tattoo Soldier [showing the dragon tattoo on his chest and belly]: 
                Look, thistattoo will protect me from harm.</p>
              <p>[Yao thinks for a moment, then punches Tattoo Soldier in the 
                stomach causingLing to laugh. Mulan watches in utter amazement. 
                Yao kisses his hand]</p>
              <p>Ling [laughing]: I hope you can get your money back.</p>
              <p>Mulan: I don't think I can do this.</p>
              <p>Mushu: It's all attitude. Be tough like this guy here [looking 
                at Yao].</p>
              <p>[Mulan looks at Yao as he hocks up a loogie and spits]</p>
              <p>Yao [noticing Mulan watching him]: What are you looking at?</p>
              <p>Mushu: Punch him, it's how men say 'hello.'</p>
              <p>[Mulan looks at her fist, then punches Yao from behind on the 
                shoulder. Theforce causes Yao to run into Chien-Po]</p>
              <p>Chien-Po: Oh Yao, you made a friend.</p>
              <p>Mushu: Good, Now slap him on the behind, they like that.</p>
              <p>[Mulan slaps Yao on the behind]</p>
              <p>Yao: Wu hoo hooooo. [grabbing Mulan buy the collar] I'm going 
                to hit you sohard it'll make your ancestors dizzy.</p>
              <p>Chien-Po [Holding and picking up Yao]: Yao, relax and chant with 
                me. Yaaaaaaa Moouuuu Ahhhhhh Doooou Fuuuu Daaaaa. Yao: Ya Mi Ah 
                To Fu Da.</p>
              <p>Chien-Po: Feel better? </p>
              <p>Yao [relaxed]: Yeah. [Chien-Po places Yao back on the ground] 
                [to Mulanwhile walking away] Aaaaa, you ain't worth my time chicken 
                boy.</p>
              <p>Mushu [loudly]: Chicken boy!? Say that to my face ya limp noodle!</p>
              <p>[Yao grabs Mulan by the collar cocking back his arm to punch. 
                Mulan ducks asYao hits Ling standing behind her]</p>
              <p>Yao: Oh, sorry Ling. Hey!</p>
              <p>[Yao grabs Mulan's foot as she starts to crawl away. Ling kicks 
                Yao on the butt causing him to land on Chien-Po's stomach. Ling 
                Jumpattacks Mulan, but she ducks and he lands on Yao on top of 
                Chien-Po]</p>
              <p>Ling: You're dead. [They fight on top of Chien-Po. Mulan runs 
                away. Ling notices Mulan and then points toward her] Oh, there 
                he goes.</p>
              <p>[Mulan runs into a tent and stops. Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po (in 
                that order) run through the tent. Yao stops short as he is about 
                to run into asoldier in a line for food. He looks behind him with 
                concerned eyes as Ling stops in time. Chien-Po bumps into Ling 
                causing the entire lineof soldiers to fall forward and knock over 
                the pot of congee and the cook behind it. The men look to the 
                back of the line and spy Mulan whohas emerged from the tent. They 
                angrily start walking towards her. Mulan has a look of horror 
                on her face as if trouble is about to brew]</p>
              <p>Mulan: Hey guys. </p>
              <p>[Chi Fu watches and then walks into the tent. General Li and 
                Li Shang are in the tent.]</p>
              <p>General Li [motioning with his pointer to a map of the region]: 
                The Huns have struck here, here and here. I will take the main 
                troops up tothe Tung Shao Pass and stop Shan-Yu before he destroys 
                this village.</p>
              <p>Chi Fu: Excellent strategy, Sir. I do love surprises, Ha ha, 
                ha, ha.</p>
              <p>General Li: You will stay here and train the new recruits. When 
                Chi Fu believes you're ready, you will join us...Captain. [General 
                Li handsa sword to Shang]</p>
              <p>Shang: Captain?</p>
              <p>Chi Fu: Oh, this is an enormous responsibility, General. Uh, 
                perhaps a soldier with more experience--</p>
              <p>General Li: Number one in his class, extensive knowledge of training 
                techniques, [leaning back smugly stroking his chin] an impressivemilitary 
                lineage. I believe Li Shang will do an excellent job.</p>
              <p>Shang [excitedly]: Oh, I will. I wont let you down. This is, 
                I mean, I...[somberly] yes sir.</p>
              <p>General Li [gets up and starts walking out of the tent]: Very 
                good then. We'll toast China's victory at the Imperial City. [to 
                Chi Fu] I'llexpect a full report in three weeks.</p>
              <p>Chi Fu [to Shang]: And I wont leave anything out. [exits through 
                the tent]</p>
              <p>Shang [while tying his sword to his uniform]: Captain Li Shang, 
                Hmmm, leader of China's finest troops. No, the greatest troops 
                of all time. Heh, heh, heh, heh. [Shang walks out of the tent 
                to see the recruits fighting. He stands stage left of Chi Fu and 
                General Li. Injured Recruitsees the General and salutes him as 
                he falls to the ground. General Li steps over Injured Recruit 
                and mounts his horse]</p>
              <p>Chi Fu: Most impressive.</p>
              <p>General Li: Good luck Captain. [The general and his mounted troops 
                leave the camp]</p>
              <p>Shang [quietly, to himself]: Good luck, Father. [Shang looks 
                at his troops and sighs]</p>
              <p>Chi Fu [smirking, with board and brush in hand]: Day one.</p>
              <p>Shang [shouting]: Soldiers!</p>
              <p>All Recruits [backing away revealing Mulan and pointing at her. 
                Mulan is crouching in the fetal position on the ground]: He started 
                it!</p>
              <p>[Shang approaches Mulan and looks down over her. Mulan looks 
                up, sees Shang over top of her and gets up quickly dusting herself 
                off]</p>
              <p>Shang [to Mulan]: I don't need anyone causing trouble in my camp!</p>
              <p>Mulan: Sorry, [in her man voice] Uhh, I mean, sorry you had to 
                see that. [with her fist she taps Shang on the shoulder] You know 
                how it iswhen you get those, uh [pounding her chest] manly urges 
                and you just have to kill something [slapping her hand], fix things, 
                uh, cookoutdoors.</p>
              <p>Shang: What's your name?</p>
              <p>Mulan [stumbling]: Ahh, I, uhhh, I, uh--</p>
              <p>Chi Fu [stepping into Mulan's face]: Your commanding officer 
                just asked you a question.</p>
              <p>Mulan: Uhh, I've got a name. Huh. And it's a boys name too.</p>
              <p>Mushu [from the back of Mulan]: Ling, How 'bout Ling?</p>
              <p>Mulan [to Mushu motioning with her head to Ling]: His name's 
                Ling.</p>
              <p>Shang: I didn't ask for his name. I asked for yours.</p>
              <p>Mushu: Try, uh, ahh, Chu!</p>
              <p>Mulan: Ah Chu.</p>
              <p>Shang: Ah Chu?</p>
              <p>Mushu: Gesundheit. He He, I kill myself.</p>
              <p>Mulan [whispering over her shoulder]: Mushu.</p>
              <p>Shang: Mushu?</p>
              <p>Mulan: No.</p>
              <p>Shang: Then what is it!</p>
              <p>Mushu: Ping! Ping was my best friend growing up!</p>
              <p>Mulan: It's Ping.</p>
              <p>Shang: Ping.</p>
              <p>Mushu: Of course Ping DID steal my gir-[Mulan reaches back and 
                grabs holds Mushu's mouth together]</p>
              <p>Mulan: Yes, my name is Ping.</p>
              <p>Shang: Let me see your conscription notice. [Takes the notice 
                from Mulan] Fa Zhou, *the* Fa Zhou?</p>
              <p>Chi Fu: I didn't know Fa Zhou had a son.</p>
              <p>Mulan: Um, he...doesn't talk about me much. [Mulan tries to hawk 
                up a loogie and spit but the saliva just runs from her mouth. 
                Therecruits laugh]</p>
              <p>Chi Fu: I can see why, the boy's an absolute lunatic.</p>
              <p>Shang [to the recruits]: Okay gentlemen, thanks to your new friend 
                Ping, you'll spend tonight picking up every single grain of rice. 
                Andtomorrow, the real work begins.</p>
              <p>[All recruits growl at Mulan]</p>
              <p>Mushu [Popping out the front of Mulan's armor]: You know, we 
                have to work on your people skills.</p>
              <p>[Cut to Mulan sleeping in her tent. Mushu winds up Cri-Kee's

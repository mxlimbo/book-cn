              <p>[Cut to Mulan walking around the burned-out village. She finds 
                a the doll that Shan-Yu was holding and looks up sorrowfully. 
                Shangcomes to her side]</p>
              <p>Shang: I don't understand. My father should have been here.</p>
              <p>[Zoom in on the fireworks tower. Mushu lands near Barry Cook 
                and Tony Bancroft (the fireworklighters) on the edge of the tower] 
              </p>
              <p>Mushu: Citizens, I need firepower.</p>
              <p>Barry Cook: Who are you?</p>
              <p>Mushu [Mushu (using the wings from the kite) and Cri-Kee with 
                wings spread like batman]: You'reworst nightmare.</p>
              <p>[Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft jump off the tower and plunge toward 
                the ground]</p>
              <p>[Cut to Mulan. She pulls herself onto the roof and climbs up 
                to the crest]</p>
              <p>Man in Crowd #1: On the roof.</p>
              <p>Man in Crowd #2: Look!</p>
              <p>[Mulan lines up where she is standing with the fireworks tower 
                across the way. Shan-Yu breaksthrough the roof behind Mulan surprising 
                her. Mulan backs away and searches for something on herperson 
                to help her against Shan-Yu. She finds a her fan, takes it out, 
                and opens it]</p>
              <p>Shan-Yu: It looks like you're out of ideas.</p>
              <p>[Shan-Yu lunges with his sword. Mulan dodges to her right and 
                lets the sword go right throughthe fan. She closes the fan back 
                up on the sword and twists the fan with both hands so thatShan-Yu 
                loses his grip. The sword flies toward Mulan and she catches it 
                by the handle slippingoff the fan with her sword movement]</p>
              <p>Mulan: Not quite. [calling out] Ready, Mushu?</p>
              <p>Mushu [behind Shan-Yu tied to a large rocket firework]: I am 
                ready, baby. [He blows fire onto astick and hands the stick to 
                Cri-Kee who's standing on the firework] Light me! [Cri-Kee lightsthe 
                fuse]</p>
              <p>[Shan-Yu approaches Mulan. Using the sword as a lever, Mulan 
                lunges at Shan-Yu kicking him inthe face then sweep kicks him 
                and he falls to the ground. Mulan picks the sword back up andstabs 
                it into Shan-Yu's cape. The rocket on Mushu ignites and hurls 
                him toward Shan-Yu. Mulanlies flat down on the left side of the 
                roof. Shan-Yu sees the approaching rocket and tries torun, but 
                the sword has him pinned to the spot. The rocket hits Shan-Yu 
                square in the bellypropelling him toward the firework tower. Mushu 
                grabbed onto the sword as he went by letting therocket do the 
                work. Cri-Kee hangs on to Mushu's tail. Mulan jumps back up to 
                the crest of theroof and runs away from the fireworks tower grabbing 
                Mushu and Cri-Kee off the sword]</p>
              <p>Mulan [while running]: Get off the roof, get off the roof, get 
                off the roof.</p>
              <p>[The rocket rides Shan-Yu into the fireworks tower causing masses 
                of explosions and fireworks tofly everywhere. Mulan jumps near 
                the edge of the roof. Propelled by the explosion, she grabsonto 
                a lantern that is hanging on a taught rope and starts to slide 
                down. She looks down andreleases her grip so that she lands on 
                the back of Shang causing the two of them to fall to theground. 
                Shan-Yu's sword follows and lands on the ground near by]</p>
              <p>Mushu [landing and flying backwards on his butt a couple of times 
                pointing at the fireworks]: Ahha ha ha ha. [Mushu's catches Cri-Kee 
                with antenna on fire as Cri-Kee falls toward him] [toCri-Kee] 
                You are a lucky bug. [Mushu pinches out the fire on Cri-Kee's 
                antenna]</p>
              <p>Chi Fu [walking down the stairs in a tattered outfit and slightly 
                burned]: That was a deliberateattempt on my life. Where is she? 
                Now she's done it. What a mess. [Shang and troops pushMulan behind 
                them to protect her] [to Shang] Stand aside, that creature's not 
                worth protecting.</p>
              <p>Shang [in Chi Fu's face]: She's a hero.</p>
              <p>Chi Fu: 'Tis a woman. She will never be worth anything.</p>
              <p>Shang [grabbing Chi Fu by the shirt collar]: Listen, you pompous--</p>
              <p>Emperor [walking down the steps]: That is enough!</p>
              <p>Shang: Your Majesty, I can explain.</p>
              <p>[The Emperor motions for Shang to stand aside. Shang and his 
                men part giving the Emperor a clearpath to Mulan. Mulan steps 
                forward and bows before the Emperor. Chi Fu with a sinister lookwaits 
                to write down the words of the Emperor]</p>
              <p>Emperor: I've heard a great deal about you, Fa Mulan. You stole 
                your father's armor, ran awayfrom home, impersonated a soldier, 
                deceived your commanding officer, dishonored the Chinese army,destroyed 
                my palace, AND...you have saved us all. [the Emperor bows to Mulan]</p>
              <p>[Chi Fu looks at the Emperor actions astonishingly then immediately 
                falls prostrate before Mulan. Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po follow 
                suit. Mulan looks up then turns around hardly believingwhat she 
                sees as the entire Chinese population within the palace grounds 
                fall prostrate on theground in a wave like pattern, bowing to 
                her. Khan bows with Mushu and Cri-Kee on his back]</p>
              <p>Mushu: My little baby's all grown up and savin' China. [to Cri-Kee] 
                You have a tissue?</p>
              <p>Emperor: Chi Fu,</p>
              <p>Chi Fu: Your Excellency?</p>
              <p>Emperor: See to it that this woman is made a member of my council.</p>
              <p>Chi Fu [muttering to himself]: A member of your coun...[realizing 
                what the Emperor has said]what? [stutters] But there are no council 
                positions open, your Majesty.</p>
              <p>Emperor [to Mulan]: Very well then, you can have his job [pointing 
                out Chi Fu].</p>
              <p>Chi Fu [wobbling to and fro]: What?...My...[faints]</p>
              <p>Mulan [smiles big then turns to the Emperor and bows]: With all 
                due respect, your Excellency. Ihave been away from home long enough.</p>
              <p>Emperor [taking off his pendant]: Then take this, so your family 
                will know what you have donefor me. And this [handing her the 
                sword of Shan-Yu] so the world will know what you have donefor 
                China.</p>
              <p>[Mulan takes the gifts and hugs the Emperor]</p>
              <p>Yao: Is she allowed to do that? [Shang, Ling, and Chien-Po shrug]</p>
              <p>[Mulan walks away from the Emperor and is embraced by Yao and 
                Ling. Chien-Po comes up and liftsall three of them off the ground 
                in a big bear hug. Chien-Po lets them all back to the groundagain. 
                Mulan walks toward Shang and stops in front of him. As Shang begins 
                to speak Mulanstarts to smile anticipating something good]</p>
              <p>Shang: Um...[Mulan grins] You... [Mulan smiles] You fight good.</p>
              <p>Mulan [smile turning into disappointment]: Oh, thank you. [Mulan 
                walks toward Khan]</p>
              <p>Shang: [turning toward Mulan and grunts with disappointment in 
                himself]: Hmm.</p>
              <p>[Mulan mounts Khan]</p>
              <p>Mulan: Khan, let's go home.</p>
              <p>[Khan jumps down the steps and gallops on the flat parts of the 
                stair case back down to groundlevel. The crowd cheers al the while. 
                The Emperor approaches Shang and clears his throat]</p>
              <p>Emperor [to Shang]: The flower that blooms in adversity is the 
                most rare and beautiful of all.</p>
              <p>Shang [dumbfounded]: Sir?</p>
              <p>Emperor: You don't meet a girl like that ev'ry dynasty. [The 
                emperor puts on his hat and walksback up the steps to his palace]</p>
              <p>[Cut to Mulan's home, her father is sitting beneath the blossom 
                tree. A blossom falls and landson his leg. Mulan appears at the 
                threshold and moves toward her father. Fa Zhou sees herapproaching 
                and starts to stand]</p>
              <p>Fa Zhou: Mulan. </p>
              <p>[Mulan quickly moves in front of her father and kneels causing 
                him to sit back down]</p>
              <p>Mulan: Father, I brought you the sword of Shan-Yu [hands the 
                sword to Fa Zhou] and the crest ofthe Emperor [hands the crest 
                to Fa Zhou]. [with head bowed] They're gifts to honor the FaFamily.</p>
              <p>[Fa Zhou takes the gifts and throws them down to the ground beside 
                him to the surprise of Mulan. He bends down and holds her arms 
                outstretched]</p>
              <p>Fa Zhou: The greatest gift and honor, is having you for a daughter. 
                [Fa Zhou wipes away Mulan'stear then hugs Mulan] I've missed you 
                so.</p>
              <p>Mulan: I've missed you too Baba.</p>
              <p>[Fa li and Grandma Fa watch from the doorway]</p>
              <p>Fa Li [sighing]: Ahhhhh</p>
              <p>Grandma Fa: Great, she brings home a sword. If you ask me she 
                should have brought home ama--[leaving her mouth open when she 
                sees Shang]</p>
              <p>Shang [just arriving]: Excuse me, does Fa Mulan live here?</p>
              <p>[Grandma Fa's mouth stays open as she and Fa Li point toward 
                Mulan's position. Shang walkstoward Mulan and Fa Zhou]</p>
              <p>Grandma Fa: Woo, sign me up for the next war.</p>
              <p>[Shang approaches seeing Fa Zhou]</p>
              <p>Shang [bows before Fa Zhou and speaks confidently]: Honorable 
                Fa Zhou I--Mulan [Mulan steps up. Shang sees her and speaks insecurely] 
                Uh...Uh...You forgot your helmet. Ah but well, actuallyit's your 
                helmet, isn't it?...[handing the helmet toward Fa Zhou] I mean...</p>
              <p>[Fa Zhou motions with his head for Mulan to take over. Mulan 
                holds the helmet Shang offers]</p>
              <p>Mulan: Would you like to stay for dinner?</p>
              <p>Grandma Fa [speaking from stage right]: Would you like to stay 
                forever? [Mulan shakes her head with asmile at Grandma Fa's statement]</p>
              <p>Shang [reassuredly to Mulan]: Dinner would be great.</p>
              <p>[Cut to First Ancestor grinning happily looking at the scene 
                through the temple window. He watches Mulan hand the helmet back 
                to FaZhou. Mushu climbs up to the window sill by First Ancestor's 
                his head]</p>
              <p>Mushu [tugging on First Ancestor's ear]: C'mon, who did a good 
                job? C'mon, tell me who did agood job.</p>
              <p>First Ancestor [hesitantly]: Oh, all right. You can be a guardian 
                again.</p>
              <p>Mushu: Yeeeeeahhhhhhh. [Mushu runs to his post and Cri-Kee bangs 
                the gong awakening all theancestors]</p>
              <p>Mushu: Take it Cri-Kee.</p>

                of the family.</p>
              <p>Mushu [spoken while swinging on a chain]: Call out for egg rolls!</p>
              <p>First Ancestor [disgusted]: Guardians.</p>
              <p>[Mushu lands on the steps outside the temple. Mulan walks up 
                to him and rests besides him on thesteps]</p>
              <p>Mulan: Thanks, Mushu [kisses Mushu on the forehead].</p>

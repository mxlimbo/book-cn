            <p>No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball. The day approached, 
              the day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching, Frank 
              Churchill, in all the certainty of his own self, reached Randalls 
              before dinner, and every thing was safe. <br>
            </p>
            <p>No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma. The 
              room at the Crown was to witness it;--but it would be better than 
              a common meeting in a crowd. Mr. Weston had been so very earnest 
              in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after 
              themselves, for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety 
              and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came, that she 
              could not refuse him, and must therefore spend some quiet interval 
              in the young man's company. She was to convey Harriet, and they 
              drove to the Crown in good time, the Randalls party just sufficiently 
              before them. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he 
              did not say much, his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful 
              evening. They all walked about together, to see that every thing 
              was as it should be; and within a few minutes were joined by the 
              contents of another carriage, which Emma could not hear the sound 
              of at first, without great surprize. &quot;So unreasonably early!&quot; 
              she was going to exclaim; but she presently found that it was a 
              family of old friends, who were coming, like herself, by particular 
              desire, to help Mr. Weston's judgment; and they were so very closely 
              followed by another carriage of cousins, who had been entreated 
              to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness, on the same 
              errand, that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected 
              together for the purpose of preparatory inspection. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr. 
              Weston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate 
              of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the 
              very first distinction in the scale of vanity. She liked his open 
              manners, but a little less of open-heartedness would have made him 
              a higher character.--General benevolence, but not general friendship, 
              made a man what he ought to be.-- She could fancy such a man. The 
              whole party walked about, and looked, and praised again; and then, 
              having nothing else to do, formed a sort of half-circle round the 
              fire, to observe in their various modes, till other subjects were 
              started, that, though May, a fire in the evening was still very 
              pleasant. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston's fault that the number of 
              privy councillors was not yet larger. They had stopped at Mrs. Bates's 
              door to offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece 
              were to be brought by the Eltons. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Frank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness, 
              which shewed a mind not at ease. He was looking about, he was going 
              to the door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,-- 
              impatient to begin, or afraid of being always near her. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Elton was spoken of. &quot;I think she must be here soon,&quot; 
              said he. &quot;I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have 
              heard so much of her. It cannot be long, I think, before she comes.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>A carriage was heard. He was on the move immediately; but coming 
              back, said, </p>
            <p>&quot;I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her. I have 
              never seen either Mr. or Mrs. Elton. I have no business to put myself 
              forward.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties 
              passed. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!&quot; said Mr. Weston, looking 
              about. &quot;We thought you were to bring them.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              The mistake had been slight. The carriage was sent for them now. 
              Emma longed to know what Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton might 
              be; how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress, and 
              her smiles of graciousness. He was immediately qualifying himself 
              to form an opinion, by giving her very proper attention, after the 
              introduction had passed. <br>
            </p>
            <p>In a few minutes the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.-- 
              &quot;I will see that there are umbrellas, sir,&quot; said Frank 
              to his father: &quot;Miss Bates must not be forgotten:&quot; and 
              away he went. Mr. Weston was following; but Mrs. Elton detained 
              him, to gratify him by her opinion of his son; and so briskly did 
              she begin, that the young man himself, though by no means moving 
              slowly, could hardly be out of hearing. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston. You know I candidly 
              told you I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that 
              I am extremely pleased with him.--You may believe me. I never compliment. 
              I think him a very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely 
              what I like and approve--so truly the gentleman, without the least 
              conceit or puppyism. You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies-- 
              quite a horror of them. They were never tolerated at Maple Grove. 
              Neither Mr. Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them; and 
              we used sometimes to say very cutting things! Selina, who is mild 
              almost to a fault, bore with them much better.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston's attention was chained; 
              but when she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were 
              ladies just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must 
              hurry away. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston. &quot;I have no doubt of its 
              being our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our coachman and horses 
              are so extremely expeditious!--I believe we drive faster than any 
              body.-- What a pleasure it is to send one's carriage for a friend!-- 
              I understand you were so kind as to offer, but another time it will 
              be quite unnecessary. You may be very sure I shall always take care 
              of them.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walked 
              into the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty 
              as Mrs. Weston's to receive them. Her gestures and movements might 
              be understood by any one who looked on like Emma; but her words, 
              every body's words, were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss 
              Bates, who came in talking, and had not finished her speech under 
              many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire. 
              As the door opened she was heard, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;So very obliging of you!--No rain at all. Nothing to signify. 
              I do not care for myself. Quite thick shoes. And Jane declares-- 
              Well!--(as soon as she was within the door) Well! This is brilliant 
              indeed!--This is admirable!--Excellently contrived, upon my word. 
              Nothing wanting. Could not have imagined it.--So well lighted up!-- 
              Jane, Jane, look!--did you ever see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you 
              must really have had Aladdin's lamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not 
              know her own room again. I saw her as I came in; she was standing 
              in the entrance. `Oh! Mrs. Stokes,' said I-- but I had not time 
              for more.&quot; She was now met by Mrs. Weston.-- &quot;Very well, 
              I thank you, ma'am. I hope you are quite well.Very happy to hear 
              it. So afraid you might have a headach!-- seeing you pass by so 
              often, and knowing how much trouble you must have. Delighted to 
              hear it indeed. Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you for the carriage!--excellent 
              time. Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep the horses a moment. 
              Most comfortable carriage.-- Oh! and I am sure our thanks are due 
              to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score. Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent 
              Jane a note, or we should have been.-- But two such offers in one 
              day!--Never were such neighbours. I said to my mother, `Upon my 
              word, ma'am--.' Thank you, my mother is remarkably well. Gone to 
              Mr. Woodhouse's. I made her take her shawl--for the evenings are 
              not warm--her large new shawl-- Mrs. Dixon's wedding-present.--So 
              kind of her to think of my mother! Bought at Weymouth, you know--Mr. 
              Dixon's choice. There were three others, Jane says, which they hesitated 
              about some time. Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive. My 
              dear Jane, are you sure you did not wet your feet?--It was but a 
              drop or two, but I am so afraid:--but Mr. Frank Churchill was so 
              extremely-- and there was a mat to step upon--I shall never forget 
              his extreme politeness.--Oh! Mr. Frank Churchill, I must tell you 
              my mother's spectacles have never been in fault since; the rivet 
              never came out again. My mother often talks of your good-nature. 
              Does not she, Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?-- 
              Ah! here's Miss Woodhouse.--Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do you do?-- 
              Very well I thank you, quite well. This is meeting quite in fairy-land!-- 
              Such a transformation!--Must not compliment, I know (eyeing Emma 
              most complacently)--that would be rude--but upon my word, Miss Woodhouse, 
              you do look--how do you like Jane's hair?--You are a judge.-- She 
              did it all herself. Quite wonderful how she does her hair!-- No 
              hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah! Dr. Hughes I declare-- 
              and Mrs. Hughes. Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a 
              moment.--How do you do? How do you do?--Very well, I thank you. 
              This is delightful, is not it?--Where's dear Mr. Richard?-Oh! there 
              he is. Don't disturb him. Much better employed talking to the young 
              ladies. How do you do, Mr. Richard?--I saw you the other day as 
              you rode through the town--Mrs. Otway, I protest!-- and good Mr. 
              Otway, and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.--Such a host of friends!--and 
              Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!--How do you do? How do you all do?--Quite 
              well, I am much obliged to you. Never better.-- Don't I hear another 
              carriage?--Who can this be?--very likely the worthy Coles.--Upon 
              my word, this is charming to be standing about among such friends! 
              And such a noble fire!--I am quite roasted. No coffee, I thank you, 
              for me--never take coffee.--A little tea if you please, sir, by 
              and bye,--no hurry--Oh! here it comes. Every thing so good!&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as 
              Miss Bates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing 
              the discourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing 
              a little way behind her.--He was thoughtful. Whether he were overhearing 
              too, she could not determine. After a good many compliments to Jane 
              on her dress and look, compliments very quietly and properly taken, 
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself-- and 
              it was, &quot;How do you like my gown?--How do you like my trimming?-- 
              How has Wright done my hair?&quot;--with many other relative questions, 
              all answered with patient politeness. Mrs. Elton then said, </p>
            <p>&quot;Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do--but 
              upon such an occasion as this, when every body's eyes are so much 
              upon me, and in compliment to the Westons--who I have no doubt are 
              giving this ball chiefly to do me honour--I would not wish to be 
              inferior to others. And I see very few pearls in the room except 
              mine.--So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.--We 
              shall see if our styles suit.--A fine young man certainly is Frank 
              Churchill. I like him very well.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could 
              not but imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want 
              to hear more;--and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while, 
              till another suspension brought Mrs. Elton's tones again distinctly 
              forward.--Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming, 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?-- 
              I was this moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be 
              impatient for tidings of us.&quot; <br>
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Jane!&quot;--repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize 
              and displeasure.-- &quot;That is easy--but Miss Fairfax does not 
              disapprove it, I suppose.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;How do you like Mrs. Elton?&quot; said Emma in a whisper. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Not at all.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You are ungrateful.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Ungrateful!--What do you mean?&quot; Then changing from a 
              frown to a smile--&quot;No, do not tell me--I do not want to know 
              what you mean.-- Where is my father?--When are we to begin dancing?&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour. He 
              walked off to find his father, but was quickly back again with both 
              Mr. and Mrs. Weston. He had met with them in a little perplexity, 
              which must be laid before Emma. It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston 
              that Mrs. Elton must be asked to begin the ball; that she would 
              expect it; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma 
              that distinction.--Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?&quot; 
              said Mr. Weston. &quot;She will think Frank ought to ask her.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; and 
              boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most 
              perfect approbation of--and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was 
              wanting him to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business 
              was to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.-- 
              Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss 
              Woodhouse followed. Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton, 
              though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her. 
              It was almost enough to make her think of marrying. Mrs. Elton had 
              undoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified; 
              for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill, she could 
              not lose by the change. Mr. Weston might be his son's superior.-- 
              In spite of this little rub, however, Emma was smiling with enjoyment, 
              delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming, 
              and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before 
              her.-- She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley's not dancing than 
              by any thing else.--There he was, among the standers-by, where he 
              ought not to be; he ought to be dancing,--not classing himself with 
              the husbands, and fathers, and whist-players, who were pretending 
              to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up,--so 
              young as he looked!-- He could not have appeared to greater advantage 
              perhaps anywhere, than where he had placed himself. His tall, firm, 
              upright figure, among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of 
              the elderly men, was such as Emma felt must draw every body's eyes; 
              and, excepting her own partner, there was not one among the whole 
              row of young men who could be compared with him.--He moved a few 
              steps nearer, and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike 
              a manner, with what natural grace, he must have danced, would he 
              but take the trouble.--Whenever she caught his eye, she forced him 
              to smile; but in general he was looking grave. She wished he could 
              love a ballroom better, and could like Frank Churchill better.-- 
              He seemed often observing her. She must not flatter herself that 
              he thought of her dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour, 
              she did not feel afraid. There was nothing like flirtation between 
              her and her partner. They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, 
              than lovers. That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had 
              done, was indubitable. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The ball proceeded pleasantly. The anxious cares, the incessant 
              attentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away. Every body seemed 
              happy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldom 
              bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given 
              in the very beginning of the existence of this. Of very important, 
              very recordable events, it was not more productive than such meetings 
              usually are. There was one, however, which Emma thought something 
              of.--The two last dances before supper were begun, and Harriet had 
              no partner;--the only young lady sitting down;-- and so equal had 
              been hitherto the number of dancers, that how there could be any 
              one disengaged was the wonder!--But Emma's wonder lessened soon 
              afterwards, on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about. He would not ask 
              Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided: she was sure 
              he would not--and she was expecting him every moment to escape into 
              the card-room. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Escape, however, was not his plan. He came to the part of the room 
              where the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about 
              in front of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution 
              of maintaining it. He did not omit being sometimes directly before 
              Miss Smith, or speaking to those who were close to her.--Emma saw 
              it. She was not yet dancing; she was working her way up from the 
              bottom, and had therefore leisure to look around, and by only turning 
              her head a little she saw it all. When she was half-way up the set, 
              the whole group were exactly behind her, and she would no longer 
              allow her eyes to watch; but Mr. Elton was so near, that she heard 
              every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between 
              him and Mrs. Weston; and she perceived that his wife, who was standing 
              immediately above her, was not only listening also, but even encouraging 
              him by significant glances.--The kind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston 
              had left her seat to join him and say, &quot;Do not you dance, Mr. 
              Elton?&quot; to which his prompt reply was, &quot;Most readily, 
              Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Me!--oh! no--I would get you a better partner than myself. 
              I am no dancer.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance,&quot; said he, &quot;I shall 
              have great pleasure, I am sure--for, though beginning to feel myself 
              rather an old married man, and that my dancing days are over, it 
              would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an 
              old friend like Mrs. Gilbert.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young 
              lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing--Miss 
              Smith.&quot; &quot;Miss Smith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You are 
              extremely obliging-- and if I were not an old married man.--But 
              my dancing days are over, Mrs. Weston. You will excuse me. Any thing 
              else I should be most happy to do, at your command--but my dancing 
              days are over.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what surprize 
              and mortification she must be returning to her seat. This was Mr. 
              Elton! the amiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.-- She looked round 
              for a moment; he had joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance, 
              and was arranging himself for settled conversation, while smiles 
              of high glee passed between him and his wife. <br>
            </p>
            <p>She would not look again. Her heart was in a glow, and she feared 
              her face might be as hot. <br>
            </p>
            <p>In another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr. Knightley leading 
              Harriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized, seldom more 
              delighted, than at that instant. She was all pleasure and gratitude, 
              both for Harriet and herself, and longed to be thanking him; and 
              though too distant for speech, her countenance said much, as soon 
              as she could catch his eye again. <br>
            </p>
            <p>His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it, extremely 
              good; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky, if it had 
              not been for the cruel state of things before, and for the very 
              complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which 
              her happy features announced. It was not thrown away on her, she 
              bounded higher than ever, flew farther down the middle, and was 
              in a continual course of smiles. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted) 
              very foolish. She did not think he was quite so hardened as his 
              wife, though growing very like her;--she spoke some of her feelings, 
              by observing audibly to her partner, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very 
              goodnatured, I declare.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Supper was announced. The move began; and Miss Bates might be heard 
              from that moment, without interruption, till her being seated at 
              table and taking up her spoon. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?--Here is your tippet. 
              Mrs. Weston begs you to put on your tippet. She says she is afraid 
              there will be draughts in the passage, though every thingas been 
              done--One door nailed up--Quantities of matting--My dear Jane, indeed 
              you must. Mr. Churchill, oh! you are too obliging! How well you 
              put it on!--so gratified! Excellent dancing indeed!-- Yes, my dear, 
              I ran home, as I said I should, to help randmama to bed, and got 
              back again, and nobody missed me.--I set off without saying a word, 
              just as I told you. Grandmama was quite well, had a charming evening 
              with Mr. Woodhouse, a vast deal of chat, and backgammon.--Tea was 
              made downstairs, biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came 
              away: amazing luck in some of her throws: and she inquired a great 
              deal about you, how you were amused, and who were your partners. 
              `Oh!' said I, `I shall not forestall Jane; I left her dancing with 
              Mr. George Otway; she will love to tell you all about it herself 
              to-morrow: her first partner was Mr. Elton, I do not know who will 
              ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.' My dear sir, you are too 
              obliging.--Is there nobody you would not rather?--I am not helpless. 
              Sir, you are most kind. Upon my word, Jane on one arm, and me on 
              the other!--Stop, stop, let us stand a little back, Mrs. Elton is 
              going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant she looks!--Beautiful lace!--Now 
              we all follow in her train. Quite the queen of the evening!--Well, 
              here we are at the passage. Two steps, Jane, take care of the two 
              steps. Oh! no, there is but one. Well, I was persuaded there were 
              two. How very odd! I was convinced there were two, and there is 
              but one. I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style--Candles 
              everywhere.--I was telling you of your grandmama, Jane,--There was 
              a little disappointment.-- The baked apples and biscuits, excellent 
              in their way, you know; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread 
              and some asparagus brought in at first, and good Mr. Woodhouse, 
              not hinking the asparagus quite boiled enough, sent it all out again. 
              Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and 
              asparagus-- so she was rather disappointed, but we agreed we would 
              not speak of it to any body, for fear of its getting round to dear 
              Miss Woodhouse, who would be so very much concerned!--Well, this 
              is brilliant! I am all amazement! could not have supposed any thing!--Such 
              elegance and profusion!--I have seen nothing like it since-- Well, 
              where shall we sit? where shall we sit? Anywhere, so that Jane is 
              not in a draught. Where I sit is of no consequence. Oh! do you recommend 
              this side?--Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchill-- only it seems too good--but 
              just as you please. What you direct in this house cannot be wrong. 
              Dear Jane, how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama? 
              Soup too! Bless me! I should not be helped so soon, but it smells 
              most excellent, and I cannot help beginning.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after 
              supper; but, when they were all in the ballroom again, her eyes 
              invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked. He was warm 
              in his reprobation of Mr. Elton's conduct; it had been unpardonable 
              rudeness; and Mrs. Elton's looks also received the due share of 
              censure. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;They aimed at wounding more than Harriet,&quot; said he. <br>
              &quot;Emma, why is it that they are your enemies?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>He looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving no answer, 
              added, &quot;She ought not to be angry with you, I suspect, whatever 
              he may be.--To that surmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, 
              Emma, that you did want him to marry Harriet.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I did,&quot; replied Emma, &quot;and they cannot forgive 
              me.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>He shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it, 
              and he only said, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I shall not scold you. I leave you to your own reflections.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Can you trust me with such flatterers?--Does my vain spirit 
              ever tell me I am wrong?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.--If one leads 
              you wrong, I am sure the other tells you of it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton. 
              There is a littleness about him which you discovered, and which 
              I did not: and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet. 
              It was through a series of strange blunders!&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you 
              the justice to say, that you would have chosen for him better than 
              he has chosen for himself.--Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, 
              which Mrs. Elton is totally without. An unpretending, single-minded, 
              artless girl-- infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and 
              taste to such a woman as Mrs. Elton. I found Harriet more conversable 
              than I expected.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma was extremely gratified.--They were interrupted by the bustle 
              of Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you 
              all doing?-- Come Emma, set your companions the example. Every body 
              is lazy! Every body is asleep!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I am ready,&quot; said Emma, &quot;whenever I am wanted.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Whom are you going to dance with?&quot; asked Mr. Knightley. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>She hesitated a moment, and then replied, &quot;With you, if you 
              will ask me.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Will you?&quot; said he, offering his hand. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Indeed I will. You have shewn that you can dance, and you 
              know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it 
              at all improper.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Brother and sister! no, indeed.&quot; </p>

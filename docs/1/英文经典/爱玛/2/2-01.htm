            <p align="center">CHAPTER I <br>
            </p>
            <p> Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and, in 
              Emma's opinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day. 
              She could not think that Harriet's solace or her own sins required 
              more; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject 
              as they returned;--but it burst out again when she thought she had 
              succeeded, and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer 
              in winter, and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive-- 
              &quot;Mr. Elton is so good to the poor!&quot; she found something 
              else must be done. <br>
            </p>
            <p>They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss 
              Bates. She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers. 
              There was always sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and 
              Miss Bates loved to be called on, and she knew she was considered 
              by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her, as 
              rather negligent in that respect, and as not contributing what she 
              ought to the stock of their scanty comforts. <br>
            </p>
            <p>She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own 
              heart, as to her deficiency--but none were equal to counteract the 
              persuasion of its being very disagreeable,--a waste of time--tiresome 
              women-- and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with 
              the second-rate and third-rate of Highbury, who were calling on 
              them for ever, and therefore she seldom went near them. But now 
              she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without 
              going in--observing, as she proposed it to Harriet, that, as well 
              as she could calculate, they were just now quite safe from any letter 
              from Jane Fairfax. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The house belonged to people in business. Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied 
              the drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized apartment, 
              which was every thing to them, the visitors were most cordially 
              and even gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who with 
              her knitting was seated in the warmest corner, wanting even to give 
              up her place to Miss Woodhouse, and her more active, talking daughter, 
              almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness, thanks for 
              their visit, solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after 
              Mr. Woodhouse's health, cheerful communications about her mother's, 
              and sweet-cake from the beaufet--&quot;Mrs. Cole had just been there, 
              just called in for ten minutes, and had been so good as to sit an 
              hour with them, and she had taken a piece of cake and been so kind 
              as to say she liked it very much; and, therefore, she hoped Miss 
              Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece 
              too.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. 
              Elton. There was intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from 
              Mr. Elton since his going away. Emma knew what was coming; they 
              must have the letter over again, and settle how long he had been 
              gone, and how much he was engaged in company, and what a favourite 
              he was wherever he went, and how full the Master of the Ceremonies' 
              ball had been; and she went through it very well, with all the interest 
              and all the commendation that could be requisite, and always putting 
              forward to prevent Harriet's being obliged to say a word. <br>
            </p>
            <p>This she had been prepared for when she entered the house; but 
              meant, having once talked him handsomely over, to be no farther 
              incommoded by any troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst 
              all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties. 
            </p>
            <p>She had not been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton; 
              but he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away from 
              him at last abruptly to the Coles, to usher in a letter from her 
              niece. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! yes--Mr. Elton, I understand--certainly as to dancing-- 
              Mrs. Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was-- 
              Mrs. Cole was so kind as to sit some time with us, talking of Jane; 
              for as soon as she came in, she began inquiring after her, Jane 
              is so very great a favourite there. Whenever she is with us, </p>
            <p>Mrs. Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough; and I 
              must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can. And so she 
              began inquiring after her directly, saying, `I know you cannot have 
              heard from Jane lately, because it is not her time for writing;' 
              and when I immediately said, `But indeed we have, we had a letter 
              this very morning,' I do not know that I ever saw any body more 
              surprized. `Have you, upon your honour?' said she; `well, that is 
              quite unexpected. Do let me hear what she says.'&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma's politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling interest-- 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately? I am extremely 
              happy.I hope she is well?&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Thank you. You are so kind!&quot; replied the happily deceived 
              aunt, while eagerly hunting for the letter.--&quot;Oh! here it is. 
              I was sure it could not be far off; but I had put my huswife upon 
              it, you see, without being aware, and so it was quite hid, but I 
              had it in my hand so very lately that I was almost sure it must 
              be on the table. I was reading it to Mrs. Cole, and since she went 
              away, I was reading it again to my mother, for it is such a pleasure 
              to her-- a letter from Jane--that she can never hear it often enough; 
              so I knew it could not be far off, and here it is, only just under 
              my huswife--and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she 
              says;--but, first of all, I really must, in justice to Jane, apologise 
              for her writing so short a letter--only two pages you see-- hardly 
              two--and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half. 
              My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well.She often 
              says, when the letter is first opened, `Well, Hetty, now I think 
              you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work'-- don't 
              you, ma'am?--And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive to 
              make it out herself, if she had nobody to do it for her-- every 
              word of it--I am sure she would pore over it till she had made out 
              every word. And, indeed, though my mother's eyes are not so good 
              as they were, she can see amazingly well still, thank God! with 
              the help of spectacles. It is such a blessing! My mother's are really 
              very good indeed. Jane often says, when she is here, `I am sure, 
              grandmama, you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do--and 
              so much fine work as you have done too!--I only wish my eyes may 
              last me as well.'&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath; 
              and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss 
              Fairfax's handwriting. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You are extremely kind,&quot; replied Miss Bates, highly 
              gratified; &quot;you who are such a judge, and write so beautifully 
              yourself. I am sure there is nobody's praise that could give us 
              so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouse's. My mother does not hear; she 
              is a little deaf you know. Ma'am,&quot; addressing her, &quot;do 
              you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging to say about Jane's 
              handwriting?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment 
              repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it. 
              She was pondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without 
              seeming very rude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfax's letter, 
              and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight 
              excuse, when Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My mother's deafness is very trifling you see--just nothing 
              at all. By only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three 
              times over, she is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice. 
              But it is very remarkable that she should always hear Jane better 
              than she does me. Jane speaks so distinct! However, she will not 
              find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago; which 
              is saying a great deal at my mother's time of life--and it really 
              is full two years, you know, since she was here. We never were so 
              long without seeing her before, and as I was telling Mrs. Cole, 
              we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh yes; next week.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Indeed!--that must be a very great pleasure.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Thank you. You are very kind. Yes, next week. Every body 
              is so surprized; and every body says the same obliging things. I 
              am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury, as 
              they can be to see her. Yes, Friday or Saturday; she cannot say 
              which, because Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself 
              one of those days. So very good of them to send her the whole way! 
              But they always do, you know. Oh yes, Friday or Saturday next. That 
              is what she writes about. That is the reason of her writing out 
              of rule, as we call it; for, in the common course, we should not 
              have heard from her before next Tuesday or Wednesday.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, so I imagined. I was afraid there could be little chance 
              of my hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;So obliging of you! No, we should not have heard, if it had 
              not been for this particular circumstance, of her being to come 
              here so soon. My mother is so delighted!--for she is to be three 
              months with us at least. Three months, she says so, positively, 
              as I am going to have the pleasure of reading to you. The case is, 
              you see, that the Campbells are going to Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has 
              persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly. 
              They had not intended to go over till the summer, but she is so 
              impatient to see them again--for till she married, last October, 
              she was never away from them so much as a week, which must make 
              it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was going to say, 
              but however different countries, and so she wrote a very urgent 
              letter to her mother--or her father, I declare I do not know which 
              it was, but we shall see presently in Jane's letter--wrote in Mr. 
              Dixon's name as well as her own, to press their coming over directly, 
              and they would give them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back 
              to their country seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy. Jane 
              has heard a great deal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean-- I 
              do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else; but 
              it was very natural, you know, that he should like to speak of his 
              own place while he was paying his addresses--and as Jane used to 
              be very often walking out with them--for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell 
              were very particular about their daughter's not walking out often 
              with only Mr. Dixon, for which I do not at all blame them; of course 
              she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell about his 
              own home in Ireland; and I think she wrote us word that he had shewn 
              them some drawings of the place, views that he had taken himself. 
              He is a most amiable, charming young man, I believe. Jane was quite 
              longing to go to Ireland, from his account of things.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              At this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma's 
              brain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon, and 
              the not going to Ireland, she said, with the insidious design of 
              farther discovery, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should 
              be allowed to come to you at such a time. Considering the very particular 
              friendship between her and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expected 
              her to be excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.&quot; 
              <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Very true, very true, indeed. The very thing that we have 
              always been rather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have 
              her at such a distance from us, for months together--not able to 
              come if any thing was to happen. But you see, every thing turns 
              out for the best. They want her (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively 
              to come over with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell; quite depend upon it; 
              nothing can be more kind or pressing than their joint invitation, 
              Jane says, as you will hear presently; Mr. Dixon does not seem in 
              the least backward in any attention. He is a most charming young 
              man. Ever since the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth, when they 
              were out in that party on the water, and she, by the sudden whirling 
              round of something or other among the sails, would have been dashed 
              into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone, if he had not, 
              with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her habit-- (I 
              can never think of it without trembling!)--But ever since we had 
              the history of that day, I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon!&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;But, in spite of all her friends' urgency, and her own wish 
              of seeing Ireland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you 
              and Mrs. Bates?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes--entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and 
              Colonel and Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right, just what 
              they should recommend; and indeed they particularly wish her to 
              try her native air, as she has not been quite so well as usual lately.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I am concerned to hear of it. I think they judge wisely. 
              But Mrs. Dixon must be very much disappointed. Mrs. Dixon, I understand, 
              has no remarkable degree of personal beauty; is not, by any means, 
              to be compared with Miss Fairfax.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! no. You are very obliging to say such things--but certainly 
              not. There is no comparison between them. Miss Campbell always was 
              absolutely plain--but extremely elegant and amiable.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, that of course.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th 
              of November, (as I am going to read to you,) and has never been 
              well since. A long time, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her? 
              She never mentioned it before, because she would not alarm us. Just 
              like her! so considerate!--But however, she is so far from well, 
              that her kind friends the Campbells think she had better come home, 
              and try an air that always agrees with her; and they have no doubt 
              that three or four months at Highbury will entirely cure her-- and 
              it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here, than 
              go to Ireland, if she is unwell. Nobody could nurse her, as we should 
              do.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and 
              the Campbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following-- 
              as you will find from Jane's letter. So sudden!--You may guess, 
              dear Miss Woodhouse, what a flurry it has thrown me in! If it was 
              not for the drawback of her illness--but I am afraid we must expect 
              to see her grown thin, and looking very poorly. I must tell you 
              what an unlucky thing happened to me, as to that. I always make 
              a point of reading Jane's letters through to myself first, before 
              I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for fear of there being 
              any thing in them to distress her. Jane desired me to do it, so 
              I always do: and so I began to-day with my usual caution; but no 
              sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell, than I burst 
              out, quite frightened, with `Bless me! poor Jane is ill!'-- which 
              my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed 
              at. However, when I read on, I found it was not near so bad as I 
              had fancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her, that 
              she does not think much about it. But I cannot imagine how I could 
              be so off my guard. If Jane does not get well soon, we will call 
              in Mr. Perry. The expense shall not be thought of; and though he 
              is so liberal, and so fond of Jane that I dare say he would not 
              mean to charge any thing for attendance, we could not suffer it 
              to be so, you know. He has a wife and family to maintain, and is 
              not to be giving away his time. Well, now I have just given you 
              a hint of what Jane writes about, we will turn to her letter, and 
              I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can 
              tell it for her.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I am afraid we must be running away,&quot; said Emma, glancing 
              at Harriet, and beginning to rise--&quot;My father will be expecting 
              us. I had no intention, I thought I had no power of staying more 
              than five minutes, when I first entered the house. I merely called, 
              because I would not pass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates; 
              but I have been so pleasantly detained! Now, however, we must wish 
              you and Mrs. Bates good morning.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded.She regained 
              the street--happy in this, that though much had been forced on her 
              against her will, though she had in fact heard the whole substance 
              of Jane Fairfax's letter, she had been able to escape the letter 
              itself. </p>

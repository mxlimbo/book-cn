            <p align="center">CHAPTER XVIII <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Frank Churchill did not come. When the time proposed drew near, 
              Mrs. Weston's fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of 
              excuse. For the present, he could not be spared, to his &quot;very 
              great mortification and regret; but still he looked forward with 
              the hope of coming to Randalls at no distant period.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed--much more disappointed, 
              in fact, than her husband, though her dependence on seeing the young 
              man had been so much more sober: but a sanguine temper, though for 
              ever expecting more good than occurs, does not always pay for its 
              hopes by any proportionate depression. It soon flies over the present 
              failure, and begins to hope again. For half an hour Mr. Weston was 
              surprized and sorry; but then he began to perceive that Frank's 
              coming two or three months later would be a much better plan; better 
              time of year; better weather; and that he would be able, without 
              any doubt, to stay considerably longer with them than if he had 
              come sooner. <br>
            </p>
            <p>These feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while Mrs. Weston, 
              of a more apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition 
              of excuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband 
              was to suffer, suffered a great deal more herself. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really 
              about Mr. Frank Churchill's not coming, except as a disappointment 
              at Randalls. The acquaintance at present had no charm for her. She 
              wanted, rather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as 
              it was desirable that she should appear, in general, like her usual 
              self, she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance, 
              and enter as warmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston's disappointment, as 
              might naturally belong to their friendship. </p>
            <p>She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed 
              quite as much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps 
              rather more,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away. 
              She then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the 
              advantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry; 
              the pleasure of looking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury 
              entire, which the sight of him would have made; and ending with 
              reflections on the Churchills again, found herself directly involved 
              in a disagreement with Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement, 
              perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from 
              her real opinion, and making use of Mrs. Weston's arguments against 
              herself. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;The Churchills are very likely in fault,&quot; said Mr. Knightley, 
              coolly; &quot;but I dare say he might come if he would.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I do not know why you should say so. He wishes exceedingly 
              to come; but his uncle and aunt will not spare him.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if 
              he made a point of it. It is too unlikely, for me to believe it 
              without proof.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;How odd you are! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make 
              you suppose him such an unnatural creature?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting 
              that he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care 
              very little for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with 
              those who have always set him the example of it. It is a great deal 
              more natural than one could wish, that a young man, brought up by 
              those who are proud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, 
              and selfish too. If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father, 
              he would have contrived it between September and January. A man 
              at his age--what is he?--three or four-and-twenty--cannot be without 
              the means of doing as much as that. It is impossible.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;That's easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always 
              been your own master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. 
              Knightley, of the difficulties of dependence. You do not know what 
              it is to have tempers to manage.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty 
              should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. He cannot 
              want money--he cannot want leisure. We know, on the contrary, that 
              he has so much of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at the 
              idlest haunts in the kingdom. We hear of him for ever at some watering-place 
              or other. A little while ago, he was at Weymouth. This proves that 
              he can leave the Churchills.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, sometimes he can.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; 
              whenever there is any temptation of pleasure.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It is very unfair to judge of any body's conduct, without 
              an intimate knowledge of their situation. Nobody, who has not been 
              in the interior of a family, can say what the difficulties of any 
              individual of that family may be. We ought to be acquainted with 
              Enscombe, and with Mrs. Churchill's temper, before we pretend to 
              decide upon what her nephew can do. He may, at times, be able to 
              do a great deal more than he can at others.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he 
              chuses, and that is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, 
              but by vigour and resolution. It is Frank Churchill's duty to pay 
              this attention to his father. He knows it to be so, by his promises 
              and messages;but if he wished to do it, it might be done. A man 
              who felt rightly would say at once, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. 
              Churchill-- `Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find 
              me ready to make to your convenience; but I must go and see my father 
              immediately. I know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark 
              of respect to him on the present occasion. I shall, therefore, set 
              off to-morrow.'-- If he would say so to her at once, in the tone 
              of decision becoming a man, there would be no opposition made to 
              his going.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Emma, laughing; &quot;but perhaps there might 
              be some made to his coming back again. Such language for a young 
              man entirely dependent, to use!--Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, 
              would imagine it possible. But you have not an idea of what is requisite 
              in situations directly opposite to your own. Mr. Frank Churchill 
              to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt, who have 
              brought him up, and are to provide for him!--Standing up in the 
              middle of the room, I suppose, and speaking as loud as he could!--How 
              can you imagine such conduct practicable?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty 
              in it. He would feel himself in the right; and the declaration--made, 
              of course, as a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner-- 
              would do him more good, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger 
              with the people he depended on, than all that a line of shifts and 
              expedients can ever do. Respect would be added to affection. They 
              would feel that they could trust him; that the nephew who had done 
              rightly by his father, would do rightly by them; for they know, 
              as well as he does, as well as all the world must know, that he 
              ought to pay this visit to his father; and while meanly exerting 
              their power to delay it, are in their hearts not thinking the better 
              of him for submitting to their whims. Respect for right conduct 
              is felt by every body. If he would act in this sort of manner, on 
              principle, consistently, regularly, their little minds would bend 
              to his.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I rather doubt that. You are very fond of bending little minds; 
              but where little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think 
              they have a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable 
              as great ones. I can imagine, that if you, as you are, Mr. Knightley, 
              were to be transported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill's 
              situation, you would be able to say and do just what you have been 
              recommending for him; and it might have a very good effect. The 
              Churchills might not have a word to say in return; but then, you 
              would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break 
              through. To him who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth 
              at once into perfect independence, and set all their claims on his 
              gratitude and regard at nought. He may have as strong a sense of 
              what would be right, as you can have, without being so equal, under 
              particular circumstances, to act up to it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Then it would not be so strong a sense. If it failed to produce 
              equal exertion, it could not be an equal conviction.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, the difference of situation and habit! I wish you would 
              try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel 
              in directly opposing those, whom as child and boy he has been looking 
              up to all his life.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be 
              the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right 
              against the will of others. It ought to have been a habit with him 
              by this time, of following his duty, instead of consulting expediency. 
              I can allow for the fears of the child, but not of the man. As he 
              became rational, he ought to have roused himself and shaken off 
              all that was unworthy in their authority. He ought to have opposed 
              the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father. Had 
              he begun as he ought, there would have been no difficulty now.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;We shall never agree about him,&quot; cried Emma; &quot;but 
              that is nothing extraordinary. I have not the least idea of his 
              being a weak young man: I feel sure that he is not. Mr. Weston would 
              not be blind to folly, though in his own son; but he is very likely 
              to have a more yielding, complying, mild disposition than would 
              suit your notions of man's perfection. I dare say he has; and though 
              it may cut him off from some advantages, it will secure him many 
              others.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to 
              move, and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying 
              himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it. He can sit down 
              and write a fine flourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods, 
              and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in 
              the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father's 
              having any right to complain. His letters disgust me.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Your feelings are singular. They seem to satisfy every body 
              else.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston. They hardly can 
              satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings: standing in 
              a mother's place, but without a mother's affection to blind her. 
              It is on her account that attention to Randalls is doubly due, and 
              she must doubly feel the omission. Had she been a person of consequence 
              herself, he would have come I dare say; and it would not have signified 
              whether he did or no. Can you think your friend behindhand in these 
              sort of considerations? Do you suppose she does not often say all 
              this to herself? No, Emma, your amiable young man can be amiable 
              only in French, not in English. He may be very `aimable,' have very 
              good manners, and be very agreeable; but he can have no English 
              delicacy towards the feelings of other people: nothing really amiable 
              about him.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You seem determined to think ill of him.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Me!--not at all,&quot; replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; 
              &quot;I do not want to think ill of him. I should be as ready to 
              acknowledge his merits as any other man; but I hear of none, except 
              what are merely personal; that he is well-grown and good-looking, 
              with smooth, plausible manners.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be 
              a treasure at Highbury. We do not often look upon fine young men, 
              well-bred and agreeable. We must not be nice and ask for all the 
              virtues into the bargain. Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley, what 
              a sensation his coming will produce? There will be but one subject 
              throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest-- 
              one object of curiosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill; we 
              shall think and speak of nobody else.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find 
              him conversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he 
              is only a chattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time 
              or thoughts.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to 
              the taste of every body, and has the power as well as the wish of 
              being universally agreeable. To you, he will talk of farming; to 
              me, of drawing or music; and so on to every body, having that general 
              information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the 
              lead, or take the lead, just as propriety may require, and to speak 
              extremely well on each; that is my idea of him.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And mine,&quot; said Mr. Knightley warmly, &quot;is, that 
              if he turn out any thing like it, he will be the most insufferable 
              fellow breathing! What! at three-and-twenty to be the king of his 
              company--the great man-- the practised politician, who is to read 
              every body's character, and make every body's talents conduce to 
              the display of his own superiority; to be dispensing his flatteries 
              around, that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself! 
              My dear Emma, your own good sense could not endure such a puppy 
              when it came to the point.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I will say no more about him,&quot; cried Emma, &quot;you 
              turn every thing to evil. We are both prejudiced; you against, I 
              for him; and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Prejudiced! I am not prejudiced.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;But I am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it. 
              My love for Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in 
              his favour.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;He is a person I never think of from one month's end to another,&quot; 
              said Mr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emma immediately 
              talk of something else, though she could not comprehend why he should 
              be angry. <br>
            </p>
            <p>To take a dislike to a young man, only because he appeared to be 
              of a different disposition from himself, was unworthy the real liberality 
              of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him; for with 
              all the high opinion of himself, which she had often laid to his 
              charge, she had never before for a moment supposed it could make 
              him unjust to the merit of another. </p>

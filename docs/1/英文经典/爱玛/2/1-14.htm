              VOLUME I<br>

            <p align="center">CHAPTER XIV <br>
            </p>
            <p> Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as 
              they walked into Mrs. Weston's drawing-room;--Mr. Elton must compose 
              his joyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill-humour. 
              Mr. Elton must smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more, to fit them 
              for the place.--Emma only might be as nature prompted, and shew 
              herself just as happy as she was. To her it was real enjoyment to 
              be with the Westons. Mr. Weston was a great favourite, and there 
              was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve, 
              as to his wife; not any one, to whom she related with such conviction 
              of being listened to and understood, of being always interesting 
              and always intelligible, the little affairs, arrangements, perplexities, 
              and pleasures of her father and herself. She could tell nothing 
              of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston had not a lively concern; and 
              half an hour's uninterrupted communication of all those little matters 
              on which the daily happiness of private life depends, was one of 
              the first gratifications of each. <br>
            </p>
            <p>This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day's visit might not 
              afford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; 
              but the very sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice 
              was grateful to Emma, and she determined to think as little as possible 
              of Mr. Elton's oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy 
              all that was enjoyable to the utmost. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The misfortune of Harriet's cold had been pretty well gone through 
              before her arrival. Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough 
              to give the history of it, besides all the history of his own and 
              Isabella's coming, and of Emma's being to follow, and had indeed 
              just got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and 
              see his daughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who 
              had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him, was able 
              to turn away and welcome her dear Emma. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather 
              sorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was 
              close to her. The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility 
              towards Harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, 
              but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice, 
              and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion. Instead of 
              forgetting him, his behaviour was such that she could not avoid 
              the internal suggestion of &quot;Can it really be as my brother 
              imagined? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer 
              his affections from Harriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!&quot;-- 
              Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm, would be 
              so interested about her father, and so delighted with Mrs. Weston; 
              and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal 
              and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would-be lover, 
              and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners. For 
              her own sake she could not be rude; and for Harriet's, in the hope 
              that all would yet turn out right, she was even positively civil; 
              but it was an effort; especially as something was going on amongst 
              the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton's nonsense, 
              which she particularly wished to listen to. She heard enough to 
              know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son; 
              she heard the words &quot;my son,&quot; and &quot;Frank,&quot; and 
              &quot;my son,&quot; repeated several times over; and, from a few 
              other half-syllables very much suspected that he was announcing 
              an early visit from his son; but before she could quiet Mr. Elton, 
              the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from 
              her would have been awkward. <br>
              <br>
              Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma's resolution of never 
              marrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank 
              Churchill, which always interested her. She had frequently thought--especially 
              since his father's marriage with Miss Taylor--that if she were to 
              marry, he was the very person to suit her in age, character and 
              condition. He seemed by this connexion between the families, quite 
              to belong to her. She could not but suppose it to be a match that 
              every body who knew them must think of. That Mr. and Mrs. Weston 
              did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded; and though not 
              meaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up a 
              situation which she believed more replete with good than any she 
              could change it for, she had a great curiosity to see him, a decided 
              intention of finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to a certain 
              degree, and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled 
              in their friends' imaginations. <br>
            </p>
            <p>With such sensations, Mr. Elton's civilities were dreadfully ill-timed; 
              but she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling 
              very cross--and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not 
              possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again, 
              or the substance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.--So it 
              proved;-- for when happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by 
              Mr. Weston, at dinner, he made use of the very first interval in 
              the cares of hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle 
              of mutton, to say to her, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;We want only two more to be just the right number. I should 
              like to see two more here,--your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, 
              and my son--and then I should say we were quite complete. I believe 
              you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing-room that 
              we are expecting Frank. I had a letter from him this morning,and 
              he will be with us within a fortnight.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented 
              to his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making 
              their party quite complete. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;He has been wanting to come to us,&quot; continued Mr. Weston, 
              &quot;ever since September: every letter has been full of it; but 
              he cannot command his own time. He has those to please who must 
              be pleased, and who (between ourselves) are sometimes to be pleased 
              only by a good many sacrifices. But now I have no doubt of seeing 
              him here about the second week in January.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston 
              is so anxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost 
              as happy as yourself.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another 
              put-off. She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do: but 
              she does not know the parties so well as I do. The case, you see, 
              is--(but this is quite between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable 
              of it in the other room. There are secrets in all families, you 
              know)--The case is, that a party of friends are invited to pay a 
              visit at Enscombe in January; and that Frank's coming depends upon 
              their being put off. If they are not put off, he cannot stir. But 
              I know they will, because it is a family that a certain lady, of 
              some consequence, at Enscombe, has a particular dislike to: and 
              though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three 
              years, they always are put off when it comes to the point. I have 
              not the smallest doubt of the issue. I am as confident of seeing 
              Frank here before the middle of January, as I am of being here myself: 
              but your good friend there (nodding towards the upper end of the 
              table) has so few vagaries herself, and has been so little used 
              to them at Hartfield, that she cannot calculate on their effects, 
              as I have been long in the practice of doing.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,&quot; 
              replied Emma; &quot;but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston. 
              If you think he will come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes--I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never 
              been at the place in my life.--She is an odd woman!--But I never 
              allow myself to speak ill of her, on Frank's account; for I do believe 
              her to be very fond of him. I used to think she was not capable 
              of being fond of any body, except herself: but she has always been 
              kind to him (in her way--allowing for little whims and caprices, 
              and expecting every thing to be as she likes). And it is no small 
              credit, in my opinion, to him, that he should excite such an affection; 
              for, though I would not say it to any body else, she has no more 
              heart than a stone to people in general; and the devil of a temper.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs. 
              Weston, very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing 
              her joy-- yet observing, that she knew the first meeting must be 
              rather alarming.-- Mrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she 
              should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a 
              first meeting at the time talked of: &quot;for I cannot depend upon 
              his coming. I cannot be so sanguine as Mr. Weston. I am very much 
              afraid that it will all end in nothing. Mr. Weston, I dare say, 
              has been telling you exactly how the matter stands?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes--it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of 
              Mrs. Churchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in 
              the world.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My Emma!&quot; replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, &quot;what is 
              the certainty of caprice?&quot; Then turning to Isabella, who had 
              not been attending before--&quot;You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley, 
              that we are by no means so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill, in 
              my opinion, as his father thinks. It depends entirely upon his aunt's 
              spirits and pleasure; in short, upon her temper. To you--to my two 
              daughters--I may venture on the truth. Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, 
              and is a very odd-tempered woman; and his coming now, depends upon 
              her being willing to spare him.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,&quot; 
              replied Isabella: &quot;and I am sure I never think of that poor 
              young man without the greatest compassion. To be constantly living 
              with an ill-tempered person, must be dreadful. It is what we happily 
              have never known any thing of; but it must be a life of misery. 
              What a blessing, that she never had any children! Poor little creatures, 
              how unhappy she would have made them!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston. She should then 
              have heard more: Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of 
              unreserve which she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really 
              believed, would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the 
              Churchills from her, excepting those views on the young man, of 
              which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive 
              knowledge. But at present there was nothing more to be said. Mr. 
              Woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting 
              long after dinner, was a confinement that he could not endure. Neither 
              wine nor conversation was any thing to him; and gladly did he move 
              to those with whom he was always comfortable.<br>
            </p>
            <p>While he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity 
              of saying, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by 
              any means certain. I am sorry for it. The introduction must be unpleasant, 
              whenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other 
              delays. Even if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am 
              still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us. 
              I cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side; but I am surethere 
              is a great wish on the Churchills' to keep him to themselves. There 
              is jealousy. They are jealous even of his regard for his father. 
              In short, I can feel no dependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. 
              Weston were less sanguine.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;He ought to come,&quot; said Emma. &quot;If he could stay 
              only a couple of days, he ought to come; and one can hardly conceive 
              a young man's not having it in his power to do as much as that. 
              A young woman, if she fall into bad hands, may be teazed, and kept 
              at a distance from those she wants to be with; but one cannot comprehend 
              a young man's being under such restraint, as not to be able to spend 
              a week with his father, if he likes it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family, 
              before one decides upon what he can do,&quot; replied Mrs. Weston. 
              &quot;One ought to use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of 
              the conduct of any one individual of any one family; but Enscombe, 
              I believe, certainly must not be judged by general rules: she is 
              so very unreasonable; and every thing gives way to her.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;But she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great a favourite. 
              Now, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural, 
              that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, 
              to whom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice 
              towards him, she should frequently be governed by the nephew, to 
              whom she owes nothing at all.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, 
              to understand a bad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let 
              it go its own way. I have no doubt of his having, at times, considerable 
              influence; but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand 
              when it will be.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma listened, and then coolly said, &quot;I shall not be satisfied, 
              unless he comes.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;He may have a great deal of influence on some points,&quot;continued 
              Mrs. Weston, &quot;and on others, very little: and among those, 
              on which she is beyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be this 
              very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us.&quot;

            <p>A very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came 
              one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after sitting 
              down and hesitating, thus began: <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Miss Woodhouse--if you are at leisure--I have something that 
              I should like to tell you--a sort of confession to make--and then, 
              you know, it will be over.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak. There 
              was a seriousness in Harriet's manner which prepared her, quite 
              as much as her words, for something more than ordinary. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish,&quot; she continued, 
              &quot;to have no reserves with you on this subject. As I am happily 
              quite an altered creature in one respect, it is very fit that you 
              should have the satisfaction of knowing it. I do not want to say 
              more than is necessary--I am too much ashamed of having given way 
              as I have done, and I dare say you understand me.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Emma, &quot;I hope I do.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;How I could so long a time be fancying myself! . . .&quot; 
              cried Harriet, warmly. &quot;It seems like madness! I can see nothing 
              at all extraordinary in him now.--I do not care whether I meet him 
              or not--except that of the two I had rather not see him-- and indeed 
              I would go any distance round to avoid him--but I do not envy his 
              wife in the least; I neither admire her nor envy her, as I have 
              done: she is very charming, I dare say, and all that, but I think 
              her very ill-tempered and disagreeable--I shall never forget her 
              look the other night!--However, I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, I 
              wish her no evil.--No, let them be ever so happy together, it will 
              not give me another moment's pang: and to convince you that I have 
              been speaking truth, I am now going to destroy--what I ought to 
              have destroyed long ago--what I ought never to have kept-- I know 
              that very well (blushing as she spoke).--However, now I will destroy 
              it all--and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence, 
              that you may see how rational I am grown. Cannot you guess what 
              this parcel holds?&quot; said she, with a conscious look. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Not the least in the world.--Did he ever give you any thing?&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No--I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I 
              have valued very much.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>She held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words Most precious 
              treasures on the top. Her curiosity was greatly excited. Harriet 
              unfolded the parcel, and she looked on with impatience. Within abundance 
              of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box, which Harriet 
              opened: it was well lined with the softest cotton; but, excepting 
              the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Now,&quot; said Harriet, &quot;you must recollect.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No, indeed I do not.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Dear me! I should not have thought it possible you could 
              forget what passed in this very room about court-plaister, one of 
              the very last times we ever met in it!--It was but a very few days 
              before I had my sore throat--just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley 
              came-- I think the very evening.--Do not you remember his cutting 
              his finger with your new penknife, and your recommending court-plaister?-- 
              But, as you had none about you, and knew I had, you desired me to 
              supply him; and so I took mine out and cut him a piece; but it was 
              a great deal too large, and he cut it smaller, and kept playing 
              some time with what was left, before he gave it back to me. And 
              so then, in my nonsense, I could not help making a treasure of it-- 
              so I put it by never to be used, and looked at it now and then as 
              a great treat.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My dearest Harriet!&quot; cried Emma, putting her hand before 
              her face, and jumping up, &quot;you make me more ashamed of myself 
              than I can bear. Remember it? Aye, I remember it all now; all, except 
              your saving this relic--I knew nothing of that till this moment--but 
              the cutting the finger, and my recommending court-plaister, and 
              saying I had none about me!--Oh! my sins, my sins!--And I had plenty 
              all the while in my pocket!--One of my senseless tricks!--I deserve 
              to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life.--Well--(sitting 
              down again)--go on--what else?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And had you really some at hand yourself? I am sure I never 
              suspected it, you did it so naturally.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for 
              his sake!&quot; said Emma, recovering from her state of shame and 
              feeling divided between wonder and amusement. And secretly she added 
              to herself, &quot;Lord bless me! when should I ever have thought 
              of putting by in cotton a piece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill 
              had been pulling about! I never was equal to this.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Here,&quot; resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, &quot;here 
              is something still more valuable, I mean that has been more valuable, 
              because this is what did really once belong to him, which the court-plaister 
              never did.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure. It was the 
              end of an old pencil,--the part without any lead. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;This was really his,&quot; said Harriet.--&quot;Do not you 
              remember one morning?--no, I dare say you do not. But one morning--I 
              forget exactly the day--but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday 
              before that evening, he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book; 
              it was about spruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him something 
              about brewing spruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down; but when 
              he took out his pencil, there was so little lead that he soon cut 
              it all away, and it would not do, so you lent him another, and this 
              was left upon the table as good for nothing. But I kept my eye on 
              it; and, as soon as I dared, caught it up, and never parted with 
              it again from that moment.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I do remember it,&quot; cried Emma; &quot;I perfectly remember 
              it.-- Talking about spruce-beer.--Oh! yes--Mr. Knightley and I both 
              saying we liked it, and Mr. Elton's seeming resolved to learn to 
              like it too. I perfectly remember it.--Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing 
              just here, was not he? I have an idea he was standing just here.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah! I do not know. I cannot recollect.--It is very odd, but 
              I cannot recollect.--Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember, much 
              about where I am now.&quot;-- <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, go on.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! that's all. I have nothing more to shew you, or to say-- 
              except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire,and 
              I wish you to see me do it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness 
              in treasuring up these things?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, simpleton as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now, 
              and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them. It was very 
              wrong of me, you know, to keep any remembrances, after he was married. 
              I knew it was--but had not resolution enough to part with them.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?--I 
              have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister 
              might be useful.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I shall be happier to burn it,&quot; replied Harriet. &quot;It 
              has a disagreeable look to me. I must get rid of every thing.-- 
              There it goes, and there is an end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And when,&quot; thought Emma, &quot;will there be a beginning 
              of Mr. Churchill?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was 
              already made, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she 
              had told no fortune, might be proved to have made Harriet's.--About 
              a fortnight after the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation, 
              and quite undesignedly. Emma was not thinking of it at the moment, 
              which made the information she received more valuable. She merely 
              said, in the course of some trivial chat, &quot;Well, Harriet, whenever 
              you marry I would advise you to do so and so&quot;--and thought 
              no more of it, till after a minute's silence she heard Harriet say 
              in a very serious tone, &quot;I shall never marry.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after 
              a moment's debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, 
              replied, <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Never marry!--This is a new resolution.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;It is one that I shall never change, however.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>After another short hesitation, &quot;I hope it does not proceed 
              from-- I hope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Mr. Elton indeed!&quot; cried Harriet indignantly.--&quot;Oh! 
              no&quot;--and Emma could just catch the words, &quot;so superior 
              to Mr. Elton!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>She then took a longer time for consideration. Should she proceed 
              no farther?--should she let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?-- 
              Perhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did; or perhaps 
              if she were totally silent, it might only drive Harriet into asking 
              her to hear too much; and against any thing like such an unreserve 
              as had been, such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances, 
              she was perfectly resolved.-- She believed it would be wiser for 
              her to say and know at once, all that she meant to say and know. 
              Plain dealing was always best. She had previously determined how 
              far she would proceed, on any application of the sort; and it would 
              be safer for both, to have the judicious law of her own brain laid 
              down with speed.-- She was decided, and thus spoke-- <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning. 
              Your resolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results 
              from an idea that the person whom you might prefer, would be too 
              greatly your superior in situation to think of you. Is not it so?&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption 
              to suppose-- Indeed I am not so mad.--But it is a pleasure to me 
              to admire him at a distance--and to think of his infinite superiority 
              to all the rest of the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, 
              which are so proper, in me especially.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet. The service he 
              rendered you was enough to warm your heart.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!--The 
              very recollection of it, and all that I felt at the time-- when 
              I saw him coming--his noble look--and my wretchedness before. Such 
              a change! In one moment such a change! From perfect misery to perfect 
              happiness!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It is very natural. It is natural, and it is honourable.-- 
              Yes, honourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.-- 
              But that it will be a fortunate preference is more that I can promise. 
              I do not advise you to give way to it, Harriet. I do not by any 
              means engage for its being returned. Consider what you are about. 
              Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you 
              can: at any rate do not let them carry you far, unless you are persuaded 
              of his liking you. Be observant of him. Let his behaviour be the 
              guide of your sensations. I give you this caution now, because I 
              shall never speak to you again on the subject. I am determined against 
              all interference. Henceforward I know nothing of the matter. Let 
              no name ever pass our lips. We were very wrong before; we will be 
              cautious now.--He is your superior, no doubt, and there do seem 
              objections and obstacles of a very serious nature; but yet, Harriet, 
              more wonderful things have taken place, there have been matches 
              of greater disparity. But take care of yourself. I would not have 
              you too sanguine; though, however it may end, be assured your raising 
              your thoughts to him, is a mark of good taste which I shall always 
              know how to value.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude. Emma 
              was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for 
              her friend. Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind-- 
              and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation. </p>

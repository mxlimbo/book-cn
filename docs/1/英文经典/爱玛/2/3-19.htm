              VOLUME III<br>

            <p align="center">CHAPTER XIX</p>
            <p align="center"> </p>
            <p>If Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet, 
              a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured 
              of her attachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept another 
              man from unbiased inclination, it was not long that she had to suffer 
              from the recurrence of any such uncertainty. A very few days brought 
              the party from London, and she had no sooner an opportunity of being 
              one hour alone with Harriet, than she became perfectly satisfied--unaccountable 
              as it was!-- that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley, 
              and was now forming all her views of happiness. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Harriet was a little distressed--did look a little foolish at first: 
              but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly, 
              and self-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die 
              away with the words, and leave her without a care for the past, 
              and with the fullest exultation in the present and future; for, 
              as to her friend's approbation, Emma had instantly removed every 
              fear of that nature, by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.-- 
              Harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at 
              Astley's, and the dinner the next day; she could dwell on it all 
              with the utmost delight. But what did such particulars explain?-- 
              The fact was, as Emma could now acknowledge, that Harriet had always 
              liked Robert Martin; and that his continuing to love her had been 
              irresistible.--Beyond this, it must ever be unintelligible to Emma. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her 
              fresh reason for thinking so.--Harriet's parentage became known. 
              She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford 
              her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent 
              enough to have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood 
              of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!-- 
              It was likely to be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many 
              a gentleman: but what a connexion had she been preparing for Mr. 
              Knightley--or for the Churchills--or even for Mr. Elton!-- The stain 
              of illegitimacy, unbleached by nobility or wealth, would have been 
              a stain indeed. <br>
            </p>
            <p>No objection was raised on the father's side; the young man was 
              treated liberally; it was all as it should be: and as Emma became 
              acquainted with Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield, 
              she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth 
              which could bid fairest for her little friend. She had no doubt 
              of Harriet's happiness with any good-tempered man; but with him, 
              and in the home he offered, there would be the hope of more, of 
              security, stability, and improvement. She would be placed in the 
              midst of those who loved her, and who had better sense than herself; 
              retired enough for safety, and occupied enough for cheerfulness. 
              She would be never led into temptation, nor left for it to find 
              her out. She would be respectable and happy; and Emma admitted her 
              to be the luckiest creature in the world, to have created so steady 
              and persevering an affection in such a man;--or, if not quite the 
              luckiest, to yield only to herself. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins, 
              was less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.-- 
              The intimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must 
              change into a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought 
              to be, and must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual, 
              natural manner. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Before the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and 
              saw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction, 
              as no remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before 
              them, could impair.--Perhaps, indeed, at that time she scarcely 
              saw Mr. Elton, but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar 
              might next fall on herself.--Robert Martin and Harriet Smith, the 
              latest couple engaged of the three, were the first to be married. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to 
              the comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.--The Mr. Churchills 
              were also in town; and they were only waiting for November. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared, 
              by Emma and Mr. Knightley.--They had determined that their marriage 
              ought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield, 
              to allow them the fortnight's absence in a tour to the seaside, 
            </p>
            <p>which was the plan.--John and Isabella, and every other friend, 
              were agreed in approving it. But Mr. Woodhouse--how was Mr. Woodhouse 
              to be induced to consent?--he, who had never yet alluded to their 
              marriage but as a distant event. <br>
              <br>
              When first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they 
              were almost hopeless.--A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.-- 
              He began to think it was to be, and that he could not prevent it-- 
              a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation. Still, 
              however, he was not happy. Nay, he appeared so much otherwise, that 
              his daughter's courage failed. She could not bear to see him suffering, 
              to know him fancying himself neglected; and though her understanding 
              almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys, that 
              when once the event were over, his distress would be soon over too, 
              she hesitated--she could not proceed. <br>
              In this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden 
              illumination of Mr. Woodhouse's mind, or any wonderful change of 
              his nervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another 
              way.-- Mrs. Weston's poultry-house was robbed one night of all her 
              turkeys-- evidently by the ingenuity of man. Other poultry-yards 
              in the neighbourhood also suffered.--Pilfering was housebreaking 
              to Mr. Woodhouse's fears.--He was very uneasy; and but for the sense 
              of his son-in-law's protection, would have been under wretched alarm 
              every night of his life. The strength, resolution, and presence 
              of mind of the Mr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence. 
              While either of them protected him and his, Hartfield was safe.-- 
            </p>
            <p>But Mr. John Knightley must be in London again by the end of the 
              first week in November. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary, 
              cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for 
              at the moment, she was able to fix her wedding-day--and Mr. Elton 
              was called on, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. 
              Robert Martin, to join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>The wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties 
              have no taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the particulars 
              detailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby, and very 
              inferior to her own.--&quot;Very little white satin, very few lace 
              veils; a most pitiful business!--Selina would stare when she heard 
              of it.&quot;--But, in spite of these deficiencies, the wishes, the 
              hopes, the confidence, the predictions of the small band of true 
              friends who witnessed the ceremony, were fully answered in the perfect 
              happiness of the union. <br>

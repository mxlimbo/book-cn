            <p align="center">CHAPTER XI <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Elton must now be left to himself. It was no longer in Emma's 
              power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures. The 
              coming of her sister's family was so very near at hand, that first 
              in anticipation, and then in reality, it became henceforth her prime 
              object of interest; and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield 
              it was not to be expected--she did not herself expect-- that any 
              thing beyond occasional, fortuitous assistance could be afforded 
              by her to the lovers. They might advance rapidly if they would, 
              however; they must advance somehow or other whether they would or 
              no. She hardly wished to have more leisure for them. There are people, 
              who the more you do for them, the less they will do for themselves. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual 
              absent from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the 
              usual interest. Till this year, every long vacation since their 
              marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but 
              all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for 
              the children, and it was therefore many months since they had been 
              seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions, or seen at all 
              by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not be induced to get so far as London, 
              even for poor Isabella's sake; and who consequently was now most 
              nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short 
              visit. <br>
            </p>
            <p>He thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a 
              little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to 
              bring some of the party the last half of the way; but his alarms 
              were needless; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and 
              Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, their five children, and a competent 
              number of nursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety. The bustle 
              and joy of such an arrival, the many to be talked to, welcomed, 
              encouraged, and variously dispersed and disposed of, produced a 
              noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under 
              any other cause, nor have endured much longer even for this; but 
              the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected 
              by Mrs. John Knightley, that in spite of maternal solicitude for 
              the immediate enjoyment of her little ones, and for their having 
              instantly all the liberty and attendance, all the eating and drinking, 
              and sleeping and playing, which they could possibly wish for, without 
              the smallest delay, the children were never allowed to be long a 
              disturbance to him, either in themselves or in any restless attendance 
              on them. <br>
              <br>
              Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle, 
              quiet manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate; 
              wrapt up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and so 
              tenderly attached to her father and sister that, but for these higher 
              ties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible. She could never 
              see a fault in any of them. She was not a woman of strong understanding 
              or any quickness; and with this resemblance of her father, she inherited 
              also much of his constitution; was delicate in her own health, over-careful 
              of that of her children, had many fears and many nerves, and was 
              as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be 
              of Mr. Perry. They were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper, 
              and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever 
              man; rising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his 
              private character; but with reserved manners which prevented his 
              being generally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of 
              humour. He was not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably 
              cross as to deserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his 
              great perfection; and, indeed, with such a worshipping wife, it 
              was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be 
              increased. The extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his. He 
              had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted, and 
              he could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing. <br>
            </p>
            <p>He was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing 
              wrong in him escaped her. She was quick in feeling the little injuries 
              to Isabella, which Isabella never felt herself. Perhaps she might 
              have passed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella's 
              sister, but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend, 
              without praise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personal 
              compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault 
              of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into, the want of respectful 
              forbearance towards her father. There he had not always the patience 
              that could have been wished. Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities and fidgetiness 
              were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp 
              retort equally ill-bestowed. It did not often happen; for Mr. John 
              Knightley had really a great regard for his father-in-law, and generally 
              a strong sense of what was due to him; but it was too often for 
              Emma's charity, especially as there was all the pain of apprehension 
              frequently to be endured, though the offence came not. The beginning, 
              however, of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings, 
              and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away 
              in unsullied cordiality. They had not been long seated and composed 
              when Mr. Woodhouse, with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh, 
              called his daughter's attention to the sad change at Hartfield since 
              she had been there last. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah, my dear,&quot; said he, &quot;poor Miss Taylor--It is 
              a grievous business.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Oh yes, sir,&quot; cried she with ready sympathy, &quot;how 
              you must miss her! And dear Emma, too!--What a dreadful loss to 
              you both!-- I have been so grieved for you.--I could not imagine 
              how you could possibly do without her.--It is a sad change indeed.--But 
              I hope she is pretty well, sir.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Pretty well, my dear--I hope--pretty well.--I do not know 
              but that the place agrees with her tolerably.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any 
              doubts of the air of Randalls. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! no--none in the least. I never saw Mrs. Weston better 
              in my life-- never looking so well. Papa is only speaking his own 
              regret.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Very much to the honour of both,&quot; was the handsome reply. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?&quot; asked Isabella 
              in the plaintive tone which just suited her father. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.--&quot;Not near so often, my dear, as 
              I could wish.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since 
              they married. Either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting 
              one, have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston, and generally 
              both, either at Randalls or here--and as you may suppose, Isabella, 
              most frequently here. They are very, very kind in their visits. 
              Mr. Weston is really as kind as herself. Papa, if you speak in that 
              melancholy way, you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all. 
              Every body must be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every 
              body ought also to be assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really 
              prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves 
              anticipated--which is the exact truth.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Just as it should be,&quot; said Mr. John Knightley, &quot;and 
              just as I hoped it was from your letters. Her wish of shewing you 
              attention could not be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social 
              man makes it all easy. I have been always telling you, my love, 
              that I had no idea of the change being so very material to Hartfield 
              as you apprehended; and now you have Emma's account, I hope you 
              will be satisfied.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Why, to be sure,&quot; said Mr. Woodhouse--&quot;yes, certainly--I 
              cannot deny that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see 
              us pretty often-- but then--she is always obliged to go away again.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.-- 
              You quite forget poor Mr. Weston.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I think, indeed,&quot; said John Knightley pleasantly, &quot;that 
              Mr. Weston has some little claim. You and I, Emma, will venture 
              to take the part of the poor husband. I, being a husband, and you 
              not being a wife, the claims of the man may very likely strike us 
              with equal force. As for Isabella, she has been married long enough 
              to see the convenience of putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much 
              as she can.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Me, my love,&quot; cried his wife, hearing and nderstanding 
              only in part.-- &quot;Are you talking about me?--I am sure nobody 
              ought to be, or can be, a greater advocate for matrimony than I 
              am; and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving Hartfield, 
              I should never have thought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate 
              woman in the world; and as to slighting Mr. Weston, that excellent 
              Mr. Weston, I think there is nothing he does not deserve. I believe 
              he is one of the very best-tempered men that ever existed. Excepting 
              yourself and your brother, I do not know his equal for temper. I 
              shall never forget his flying Henry's kite for him that very windy 
              day last Easter--and ever since his particular kindness last September 
              twelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o'clock at night, on 
              purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham, 
              I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor 
              a better man in existence.--If any body can deserve him, it must 
              be Miss Taylor.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Where is the young man?&quot; said John Knightley. &quot;Has 
              he been here on this occasion--or has he not?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;He has not been here yet,&quot; replied Emma. &quot;There 
              was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage, 
              but it ended in nothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,&quot; said 
              her father. &quot;He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate 
              her, and a very proper, handsome letter it was. She shewed it to 
              me. I thought it very well done of him indeed. Whether it was his 
              own idea you know, one cannot tell. He is but young, and his uncle, 
              perhaps--&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time 
              passes.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Three-and-twenty!--is he indeed?--Well, I could not have thought 
              it-- and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother! 
              Well, time does fly indeed!--and my memory is very bad. However, 
              it was an exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston 
              a great deal of pleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth, 
              and dated Sept. 28th--and began, `My dear Madam,' but I forget how 
              it went on; and it was signed `F. C. Weston Churchill.'-- I remember 
              that perfectly.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;How very pleasing and proper of him!&quot; cried the good-hearted 
              Mrs. John Knightley. &quot;I have no doubt of his being a most amiable 
              young man. But how sad it is that he should not live at home with 
              his father! There is something so shocking in a child's being taken 
              away from his parents and natural home! I never could comprehend 
              how Mr. Weston could part with him. To give up one's child! I really 
              never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to 
              any body else.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,&quot; 
              observed Mr. John Knightley coolly. &quot;But you need not imagine 
              Mr. Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or 
              John. Mr. Weston is rather an easy, cheerful-tempered man, than 
              a man of strong feelings; he takes things as he finds them, and 
              makes enjoyment of them somehow or other, depending, I suspect, 
              much more upon what is called society for his comforts, that is, 
              upon the power of eating and drinking, and playing whist with his 
              neighbours five times a week, than upon family affection, or any 
              thing that home affords.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston, 
              and had half a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let it 
              pass. She would keep the peace if possible; and there was something 
              honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits, the all-sufficiency 
              of home to himself, whence resulted her brother's disposition to 
              look down on the common rate of social intercourse, and those to 
              whom it was important.--It had a high claim to forbearance. </p>

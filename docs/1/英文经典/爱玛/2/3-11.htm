            <p>&quot;Harriet, poor Harriet!&quot;--Those were the words; in them 
              lay the tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which 
              constituted the real misery of the business to her. Frank Churchill 
              had behaved very ill by herself--very ill in many ways,--but it 
              was not so much his behaviour as her own, which made her so angry 
              with him. It was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet's 
              account, that gave the deepest hue to his offence.--Poor Harriet! 
              to be a second time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery. 
              Mr. Knightley had spoken prophetically, when he once said, &quot;Emma, 
              you have been no friend to Harriet Smith.&quot;--She was afraid 
              she had done her nothing but disservice.--It was true that she had 
              not to charge herself, in this instance as in the former, with being 
              the sole and original author of the mischief; with having suggested 
              such feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriet's imagination; 
              for Harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank 
              Churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject; but 
              she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have 
              repressed. She might have prevented the indulgence and increase 
              of such sentiments. Her influence would have been enough. And now 
              she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them.--She 
              felt that she had been risking her friend's happiness on most insufficient 
              grounds. </p>
            <p>Common sense would have directed her to tell Harriet, that she 
              must not allow herself to think of him, and that there were five 
              hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her.--&quot;But, 
              with common sense,&quot; she added, &quot;I am afraid I have had 
              little to do.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>She was extremely angry with herself. If she could not have been 
              angry with Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.-- As 
              for Jane Fairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings from any 
              present solicitude on her account. Harriet would be anxiety enough; 
              she need no longer be unhappy about Jane, whose troubles and whose 
              ill-health having, of course, the same origin, must be equally under 
              cure.--Her days of insignificance and evil were over.--She would 
              soon be well, and happy, and prosperous.-- Emma could now imagine 
              why her own attentions had been slighted. This discovery laid many 
              smaller matters open. No doubt it had been from jealousy.--In Jane's 
              eyes she had been a rival; and well might any thing she could offer 
              of assistance or regard be repulsed. An airing in the Hartfield 
              carriage would have been the rack, and arrowroot from the Hartfield 
              storeroom must have been poison. She understood it all; and as far 
              as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness 
              of angry feelings, she acknowledged that Jane Fairfax would have 
              neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert. But poor Harriet 
              was such an engrossing charge! There was little sympathy to be spared 
              for any body else. Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment 
              would be more severe than the first. Considering the very superior 
              claims of the object, it ought; and judging by its apparently stronger 
              effect on Harriet's mind, producing reserve and self-command, it 
              would.-- She must communicate the painful truth, however, and as 
              soon as possible. An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston's 
              parting words. &quot;For the present, the whole affair was to be 
              completely a secret. Mr. Churchill had made a point of it, as a 
              token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost; and every 
              body admitted it to be no more than due decorum.&quot;-- Emma had 
              promised; but still Harriet must be excepted. It was her superior 
              duty. <br>
            </p>
            <p>In spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost 
              ridiculous, that she should have the very same distressing and delicate 
              office to perform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through 
              by herself.The intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced 
              to her, she was now to be anxiously announcing to another. Her heart 
              beat quick on hearing Harriet's footstep and voice; so, she supposed, 
              had poor Mrs. Weston felt when she was approaching Randalls. Could 
              the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!-- But of 
              that, unfortunately, there could be no chance. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, Miss Woodhouse!&quot; cried Harriet, coming eagerly 
              into the room-- &quot;is not this the oddest news that ever was?&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;What news do you mean?&quot; replied Emma, unable to guess, 
              by look or voice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any 
              hint. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;About Jane Fairfax. Did you ever hear any thing so strange? 
              Oh!--you need not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has 
              told me himself. I met him just now. He told me it was to be a great 
              secret; and, therefore, I should not think of mentioning it to any 
              body but you, but he said you knew it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;What did Mr. Weston tell you?&quot;--said Emma, still perplexed. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank 
              Churchill are to be married, and that they have been privately engaged 
              to one another this long while. How very odd!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>It was, indeed, so odd; Harriet's behaviour was so extremely odd, 
              that Emma did not know how to understand it. Her character appeared 
              absolutely changed. She seemed to propose shewing no agitation, 
              or disappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery. Emma looked 
              at her, quite unable to speak. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Had you any idea,&quot; cried Harriet, &quot;of his being 
              in love with her?--You, perhaps, might.--You (blushing as she spoke) 
              who can see into every body's heart; but nobody else--&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Upon my word,&quot; said Emma, &quot;I begin to doubt my 
              having any such talent. Can you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether 
              I imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that I 
              was--tacitly, if not openly-- encouraging you to give way to your 
              own feelings?--I never had the slightest suspicion, till within 
              the last hour, of Mr. Frank Churchill's having the least regard 
              for Jane Fairfax. You may be very sure that if I had, I should have 
              cautioned you accordingly.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Me!&quot; cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished. &quot;Why 
              should you caution me?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank 
              Churchill.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,&quot; 
              replied Emma, smiling; &quot;but you do not mean to deny that there 
              was a time--and not very distant either--when you gave me reason 
              to understand that you did care about him?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Him!--never, never. Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so 
              mistake me?&quot; turning away distressed. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Harriet!&quot; cried Emma, after a moment's pause--&quot;What 
              do you mean?-- Good Heaven! what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am 
              I to suppose then?--&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>She could not speak another word.--Her voice was lost; and she 
              sat down, waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Harriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned 
              from her, did not immediately say any thing; and when she did speak, 
              it was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma's. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I should not have thought it possible,&quot; she began, &quot;that 
              you could have misunderstood me! I know we agreed never to name 
              him-- but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body 
              else, I should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed 
              to mean any other person. Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed! I do not 
              know who would ever look at him in the company of the other. I hope 
              I have a better taste than to think of Mr. Frank Churchill, who 
              is like nobody by his side. And that you should have been so mistaken, 
              is amazing!--I am sure, but for believing that you entirely approved 
              and meant to encourage me in my attachment, I should have considered 
              it at first too great a presumption almost, to dare to think of 
              him. At first, if you had not told me that more wonderful things 
              had happened; that there had been matches of greater disparity (those 
              were your very words);-- I should not have dared to give way to--I 
              should not have thought it possible--But if you, who had been always 
              acquainted with him--&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Harriet!&quot; cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely--&quot;Let 
              us understand each other now, without the possibility of farther 
              mistake. Are you speaking of--Mr. Knightley?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;To be sure I am. I never could have an idea of any body else-- 
              and so I thought you knew. When we talked about him, it was as clear 
              as possible.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Not quite,&quot; returned Emma, with forced calmness, &quot;for 
              all that you then said, appeared to me to relate to a different 
              person. I could almost assert that you had named Mr. Frank Churchill. 
              I am sure the service Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you, in protecting 
              you from the gipsies, was spoken of.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what 
              I said on the occasion. I told you that I did not wonder at your 
              attachment; that considering the service he had rendered you, it 
              was extremely natural:--and you agreed to it, expressing yourself 
              very warmly as to your sense of that service, and mentioning even 
              what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your 
              rescue.--The impression of it is strong on my memory.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, dear,&quot; cried Harriet, &quot;now I recollect what 
              you mean; but I was thinking of something very different at the 
              time. It was not the gipsies--it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that 
              I meant. No! (with some elevation) I was thinking of a much more 
              precious circumstance-- of Mr. Knightley's coming and asking me 
              to dance, when Mr. Elton would not stand up with me; and when there 
              was no other partner in the room. That was the kind action; that 
              was the noble benevolence and generosity; that was the service which 
              made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon 
              earth.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Good God!&quot; cried Emma, &quot;this has been a most unfortunate-- 
              most deplorable mistake!--What is to be done?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood 
              me? At least, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have 
              been, if the other had been the person; and now--it is possible--&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>She paused a few moments. Emma could not speak. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse,&quot; she resumed, &quot;that 
              you should feel a great difference between the two, as to me or 
              as to any body. You must think one five hundred million times more 
              above me than the other. But I hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing--that 
              if-- strange as it may appear--. But you know they were your own 
              words, that more wonderful things had happened, matches of greater 
              disparity had taken place than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me; 
              and, therefore, it seems as if such a thing even as this, may have 
              occurred before-- and if I should be so fortunate, beyond expression, 
              as to-- if Mr. Knightley should really--if he does not mind the 
              disparity, I hope, dear Miss Woodhouse, you will not set yourself 
              against it, and try to put difficulties in the way. But you are 
              too good for that, I am sure.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Harriet was standing at one of the windows. Emma turned round to 
              look at her in consternation, and hastily said, &quot;Have you any 
              idea of Mr. Knightley's returning your affection?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully--&quot;I 
              must say that I have.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma's eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating, 
              in a fixed attitude, for a few minutes. A few minutes were sufficient 
              for making her acquainted with her own heart. A mind like hers, 
              once opening to suspicion, made rapid progress. She touched-- she 
              admitted--she acknowledged the whole truth. Why was it so much worse 
              that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley, than with Frank 
              Churchill? Why was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet's 
              having some hope of a return? It darted through her, with the speed 
              of an arrow, that Mr. Knightley must marry no one but herself! <br>
            </p>
            <p>Her own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the 
              same few minutes. She saw it all with a clearness which had never 
              blessed her before. How improperly had she been acting by Harriet! 
              How inconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational, how unfeeling 
              had been her conduct! What blindness, what madness, had led her 
              on! It struck her with dreadful force, and she was ready to give 
              it every bad name in the world. Some portion of respect for herself, 
              however, in spite of all these demerits-- some concern for her own 
              appearance, and a strong sense of justice by Harriet--(there would 
              be no need of compassion to the girl who believed herself loved 
              by Mr. Knightley--but justice required that she should not be made 
              unhappy by any coldness now,) gave Emma the resolution to sit and 
              endure farther with calmness, with even apparent kindness.--For 
              her own advantage indeed, it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet's 
              hopes should be enquired into; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit 
              the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and 
              maintained--or to deserve to be slighted by the person, whose counsels 
              had never led her right.-- Rousing from reflection, therefore, and 
              subduing her emotion, she turned to Harriet again, and, in a more 
              inviting accent, renewed the conversation; for as to the subject 
              which had first introduced it, the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, 
              that was quite sunk and lost.-- Neither of them thought but of Mr. 
              Knightley and themselves. <br>
              Harriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very 
              glad to be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such 
              a judge, and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation, 
              to give the history of her hopes with great, though trembling delight.--Emma's 
              tremblings as she asked, and as she listened, were better concealed 
              than Harriet's, but they were not less. Her voice was not unsteady; 
              but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a development 
              of self, such a burst of threatening evil, such a confusion of sudden 
              and perplexing emotions, must create.-- She listened with much inward 
              suffering, but with great outward patience, to Harriet's detail.--Methodical, 
              or well arranged, or very well delivered, it could not be expected 
              to be; but it contained, when separated from all the feebleness 
              and tautology of the narration, a substance to sink her spirit-- 
              especially with the corroborating circumstances, which her own memory 
              brought in favour of Mr. Knightley's most improved opinion of Harriet. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever 
              since those two decisive dances.--Emma knew that he had, on that 
              occasion, found her much superior to his expectation. From that 
              evening, or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse's encouraging 
              her to think of him, Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking 
              to her much more than he had been used to do, and of his having 
              indeed quite a different manner towards her; a manner of kindness 
              and sweetness!--Latterly she had been more and more aware of it. 
              When they had been all walking together, he had so often come and 
              walked by her, and talked so very delightfully!--He seemed to want 
              to be acquainted with her. Emma knew it to have been very much the 
              case. </p>
            <p>She had often observed the change, to almost the same extent.-- 
              Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him-- 
              and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she 
              had known of his opinion of Harriet. He praised her for being without 
              art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous, feelings.-- 
              She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; he had dwelt 
              on them to her more than once.--Much that lived in Harriet's memory, 
              many little particulars of the notice she had received from him, 
              a look, a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a compliment 
              implied, a preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because unsuspected, 
              by Emma. <br>
              <br>
              Circumstances that might swell to half an hour's relation,and contained 
              multiplied proofs to her who had seen them, had passed undiscerned 
              by her who now heard them; but the two latest occurrences to be 
              mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet, were not without 
              some degree of witness from Emma herself.--The first, was his walking 
              with her apart from the others, in the lime-walk at Donwell, where 
              they had been walking some time before Emma came, and he had taken 
              pains (as she was convinced) to draw her from the rest to himself--and 
              at first, he had talked to her in a more particular way than he 
              had ever done before, in a very particular way indeed!--(Harriet 
              could not recall it without a blush.) He seemed to be almost asking 
              her, whether her affections were engaged.-- But as soon as she (Miss 
              Woodhouse) appeared likely to join them, he changed the subject, 
              and began talking about farming:-- The second, was his having sat 
              talking with her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from 
              her visit, the very last morning of his being at Hartfield--though, 
              when he first came in, he had said that he could not stay five minutes--and 
              his having told her, during their conversation, that though he must 
              go to London, it was very much against his inclination that he left 
              home at all, which was much more (as Emma felt) than he had acknowledged 
              to her. The superior degree of confidence towards Harriet, which 
              this one article marked, gave her severe pain. <br>
            </p>
            <p>On the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did, 
              after a little reflection, venture the following question. &quot;Might 
              he not?--Is not it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought, 
              into the state of your affections, he might be alluding to Mr. Martin-- 
              he might have Mr. Martin's interest in view? But Harriet rejected 
              the suspicion with spirit. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Mr. Martin! No indeed!--There was not a hint of Mr. Martin. 
              I hope I know better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be 
              suspected of it.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              When Harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear Miss 
              Woodhouse, to say whether she had not good ground for hope. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I never should have presumed to think of it at first,&quot; 
              said she, &quot;but for you. You told me to observe him carefully, 
              and let his behaviour be the rule of mine--and so I have. But now 
              I seem to feel that I may deserve him; and that if he does chuse 
              me, it will not be any thing so very wonderful.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter 
              feelings, made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma's side, to 
              enable her to say on reply, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley 
              is the last man in the world, who would intentionally give any woman 
              the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory; 
              and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which at that 
              moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her father's 
              footsteps. He was coming through the hall. Harriet was too much 
              agitated to encounter him. &quot;She could not compose herself-- 
              Mr. Woodhouse would be alarmed--she had better go;&quot;--with most 
              ready encouragement from her friend, therefore, she passed off through 
              another door--and the moment she was gone, this was the spontaneous 
              burst of Emma's feelings: &quot;Oh God! that I had never seen her!&quot; 
              <br>
              The rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough for 
              her thoughts.--She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that 
              had rushed on her within the last few hours. Every moment had brought 
              a fresh surprize; and every surprize must be matter of humiliation 
              to her.--How to understand it all! How to understand the deceptions 
              she had been thus practising on herself, and living under!--The 
              blunders, the blindness of her own head and heart!--she sat still, 
              she walked about, she tried her own room, she tried the shrubbery--in 
              every place, every posture, she perceived that she had acted most 
              weakly; that she had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying 
              degree; that she had been imposing on herself in a degree yet more 
              mortifying; that she was wretched, and should probably find this 
              day but the beginning of wretchedness. </p>
            <p>To understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the first 
              endeavour. To that point went every leisure moment which her father's 
              claims on her allowed, and every moment of involuntary absence of 
              mind. <br>
              <br>
              How long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her, as every feeling 
              declared him now to be? When had his influence, such influence begun?-- 
              When had he succeeded to that place in her affection, which Frank 
              Churchill had once, for a short period, occupied?--She looked back; 
              she compared the two--compared them, as they had always stood in 
              her estimation, from the time of the latter's becoming known to 
              her-- and as they must at any time have been compared by her, had 
              it--oh! had it, by any blessed felicity, occurred to her, to institute 
              the comparison.--She saw that there never had been a time when she 
              did not consider Mr. Knightley as infinitely the superior, or when 
              his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dea. She saw, 
              that in persuading herself, in fancying, in acting to the contrary, 
              she had been entirely under a delusion, totally ignorant of her 
              own heart--and, in short, that she had never really cared for Frank 
              Churchill at all! <br>
              <br>
              This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection. This 
              was the knowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry, 
              which she reached; and without being long in reaching it.-- She 
              was most sorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation but the 
              one revealed to her--her affection for Mr. Knightley.-- Every other 
              part of her mind was disgusting. <br>
            </p>
            <p>With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret 
              of every body's feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to 
              arrange every body's destiny. She was proved to have been universally 
              mistaken; and she had not quite done nothing--for she had done mischief. 
              She had brought evil on Harriet, on herself, and she too much feared, 
              on Mr. Knightley.--Were this most unequal of all connexions to take 
              place, on her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning; 
              for his attachment, she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness 
              of Harriet's;--and even were this not the case, he would never have 
              known Harriet at all but for her folly. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--It was a union to distance every 
              wonder of the kind.--The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane 
              Fairfax became commonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison, 
              exciting no surprize, presenting no disparity, affording nothing 
              to be said or thought.--Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--Such an 
              elevation on her side! Such a debasement on his! It was horrible 
              to Emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion, to 
              foresee the smiles, the sneers, the merriment it would prompt at 
              his expense; the mortification and disdain of his brother, the thousand 
              inconveniences to himself.--Could it be?--No; it was impossible. 
              And yet it was far, very far, from impossible.--Was it a new circumstance 
              for a man of first-rate abilities to be captivated by very inferior 
              powers? Was it new for one, perhaps too busy to seek, to be the 
              prize of a girl who would seek him?--Was it new for any thing in 
              this world to be unequal, inconsistent, incongruous--or for chance 
              and circumstance (as second causes) to direct the human fate? <br>
            </p>
            <p>Oh! had she never brought Harriet forward! Had she left her where 
              she ought, and where he had told her she ought!--Had she not, with 
              a folly which no tongue could express, prevented her marrying the 
              unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable 
              in the line of life to which she ought to belong-- all would have 
              been safe; none of this dreadful sequel would have been. <br>
            </p>
            <p>How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts 
              to Mr. Knightley!--How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen 
              of such a man till actually assured of it!-- But Harriet was less 
              humble, had fewer scruples than formerly.-- Her inferiority, whether 
              of mind or situation, seemed little felt.-- She had seemed more 
              sensible of Mr. Elton's being to stoop in marrying her, than she 
              now seemed of Mr. Knightley's.-- Alas! was not that her own doing 
              too? Who had been at pains to give Harriet notions of self-consequence 
              but herself?--Who but herself had taught her, that she was to elevate 
              herself if possible, and that her claims were great to a high worldly 
              establishment?-- If Harriet, from being humble, were grown vain, 
              it was her doing too. </p>

              VOLUME I<br>
            </p>
            <p align="center">CHAPTER IX <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel 
              with herself. He was so much displeased, that it was longer than 
              usual before he came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet, 
              his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven. She was sorry, 
              but could not repent. On the contrary, her plans and proceedings 
              were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general 
              appearances of the next few days. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after Mr. 
              Elton's return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common 
              sitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sighed out his half sentences 
              of admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet's feelings, they 
              were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment 
              as her youth and sort of mind admitted. Emma was soon perfectly 
              satisfied of Mr. Martin's being no otherwise remembered, than as 
              he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantage 
              to the latter. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Her views of improving her little friend's mind, by a great deal 
              of useful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than 
              a few first chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow. It 
              was much easier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let her 
              imagination range and work at Harriet's fortune, than to be labouring 
              to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts; and 
              the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present, the 
              only mental provision she was making for the evening of life, was 
              the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that 
              she could meet with, into a thin quarto of hot-pressed paper,made 
              up by her friend, and ornamented with ciphers and trophies. </p>
            <p>In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale 
              are not uncommon. Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard's, had 
              written out at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken the 
              first hint of it from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse's help, to 
              get a great many more. Emma assisted with her invention, memory 
              and taste; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand, it was likely 
              to be an arrangement of the first order, in form as well as quantity. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as 
              the girls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their 
              putting in. &quot;So many clever riddles as there used to be when 
              he was young-- he wondered he could not remember them! but he hoped 
              he should in time.&quot; </p>
            <p>And it always ended in &quot;Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>His good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject, 
              did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind; but he 
              had desired Perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about so 
              much, something, he thought, might come from that quarter. <br>
            </p>
            <p>It was by no means his daughter's wish that the intellects of Highbury 
              in general should be put under requisition. Mr. Elton was the only 
              one whose assistance she asked. He was invited to contribute any 
              really good enigmas, charades, or conundrums that he might recollect; 
              and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with 
              his recollections; and at the same time, as she could perceive, 
              most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant, nothing that did 
              not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips. They owed 
              to him their two or three politest puzzles; and the joy and exultation 
              with which at last he recalled, and rather sentimentally recited, 
              that well-known charade, My first doth affliction denote,Which my 
              second is destin'd to feel And my whole is the best antidote That 
              affliction to soften and heal.-- <br>
            </p>
            <p>made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it 
              some pages ago already. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?&quot; 
              said she; &quot;that is the only security for its freshness; and 
              nothing could be easier to you.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the 
              kind in his life. The stupidest fellow! He was afraid not even Miss 
              Woodhouse&quot;--he stopt a moment-- &quot;or Miss Smith could inspire 
              him.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration. He 
              called for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the 
              table containing, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had 
              addressed to a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which 
              from his manner, Emma was immediately convinced must be his own. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I do not offer it for Miss Smith's collection,&quot; said 
              he. &quot;Being my friend's, I have no right to expose it in any 
              degree to the public eye, but perhaps you may not dislike looking 
              at it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma could understand. 
              There was deep consciousness about him, and he found it easier to 
              meet her eye than her friend's. He was gone the next moment:--after 
              another moment's pause, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Take it,&quot; said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper 
              towards Harriet--&quot;it is for you. Take your own.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>But Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma, 
              never loth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself. To Miss-- 
            </p>
            <p> CHARADE. </p>
            <p> My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings, Lords of the earth! 
              their luxury and ease. Another view of man, my second brings, Behold 
              him there, the monarch of the seas! But ah! united, what reverse 
              we have! Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown; Lord of 
              the earth and sea, he bends a slave, And woman, lovely woman, reigns 
              alone. Thy ready wit the word will soon supply, May its approval 
              beam in that soft eye! </p>
            <p>She cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it 
              through again to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, 
              and then passing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying 
              to herself, while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the 
              confusion of hope and dulness, &quot;Very well, Mr. Elton, very 
              well indeed. I have read worse charades. Courtship--a very good 
              hint. I give you credit for it. This is feeling your way. This is 
              saying very plainly-- `Pray, Miss Smith, give me leave to pay my 
              addresses to you. Approve my charade and my intentions in the same 
              glance.' May its approval beam in that soft eye! <br>
            </p>
            <p>Harriet exactly. Soft is the very word for her eye--of all epithets, 
              the justest that could be given. </p>
            <p> Thy ready wit the word will soon supply. <br>
              <br>
              Humph--Harriet's ready wit! All the better. A man must be very much 
              in love, indeed, to describe her so. Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish you 
              had the benefit of this; I think this would convince you. For once 
              in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken. An excellent 
              charade indeed! and very much to the purpose.Things must come to 
              a crisis soon now.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations, 
              which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, bz the 
              eagerness of Harriet's wondering questions. &quot;What can it be, 
              Miss Woodhouse?--what can it be? I have not an idea--I cannot guess 
              it in the least. What can it possibly be? Do try to find it out, 
              Miss Woodhouse. Do help me. I never saw any thing so hard. Is it 
              kingdom? I wonder who the friend was--and who could be the young 
              lady. Do you think it is a good one? Can it be woman? And woman, 
              lovely woman, reigns alone. <br>
              <br>
              Can it be Neptune? <br>
              <br>
              Behold him there, the monarch of the seas! <br>
            </p>
            <p>Or a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only one 
              syllable. It must be very clever, or he would not have brought it. 
              Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find it out?&quot; 
              <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Mermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear Harriet, what are you 
              thinking of? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade 
              made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark? Give me the paper and 
              listen. </p>
            <p>For Miss ----------, read Miss Smith. My first displays the wealth 
              and pomp of kings, Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease. </p>
            <p>That is court.</p>
            <p> Another view of man, my second brings; </p>
            <p> Behold him there, the monarch of the seas! <br>
            </p>
            <p>That is ship;--plain as it can be.--Now for the cream. <br>
            </p>
            <p> But ah! united, (courtship, you know,) what reverse we have! Man's 
              boasted power and freedom, all are flown. Lord of the earth and 
              sea, he bends a slave, And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone. <br>
            </p>
            <p>A very proper compliment!--and then follows the application, which 
              I think, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending. 
              Read it in comfort to yourself. There can be no doubt of its being 
              written for you and to you.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion. She read 
              the concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness. She could 
              not speak. But she was not wanted to speak. It was enough for her 
              to feel. Emma spoke for her. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this 
              compliment,&quot; said she, &quot;that I cannot have a doubt as 
              to Mr. Elton's intentions. You are his object-- and you will soon 
              receive the completest proof of it. I thought it must be so. I thought 
              I could not be so deceived; but now, it is clear; the state of his 
              mind is as clear and decided, as my wishes on the subject have been 
              ever since I knew you. Yes, Harriet, just so long have I been wanting 
              the very circumstance to happen what has happened. I could never 
              tell whether an attachment between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable 
              or most natural. Its probability and its eligibility have really 
              so equalled each other! I am very happy. I congratulate you, my 
              dear Harriet, with all my heart. This is an attachment which a woman 
              may well feel pride in creating. This is a connexion which offers 
              nothing but good. It will give you every thing that you want--consideration, 
              independence, a proper home--it will fix you in the centre of all 
              your real friends, close to Hartfield and to me, and confirm our 
              intimacy for ever. This, Harriet, is an alliance which can never 
              raise a blush in either of us.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Dear Miss Woodhouse!&quot;--and &quot;Dear Miss Woodhouse,&quot; 
              was all that Harriet, with many tender embraces could articulate 
              at first; but when they did arrive at something more like conversation, 
              it was sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, 
              and remembered just as she ought. Mr. Elton's superiority had very 
              ample acknowledgment. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Whatever you say is always right,&quot; cried Harriet, &quot;and 
              therefore I suppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise 
              I could not have imagined it. It is so much beyond any thing I deserve. 
              Mr. Elton, who might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions 
              about him. He is so very superior. Only think of those sweet verses--&quot;To 
              Miss --------.&quot; Dear me, how clever!--Could it really be meant 
              for me?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that. 
              It is a certainty. Receive it on my judgment. It is a sort of prologue 
              to the play, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon followed by 
              matter-of-fact prose.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected. I 
              am sure, a month ago, I had no more idea myself!--The strangest 
              things do take place!&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted--they do indeed--and 
              really it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is 
              so evidently, so palpably desirable--what courts the pre-arrangement 
              of other people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper 
              form. You and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong 
              to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes. Your 
              marrying will be equal to the match at Randalls. There does seem 
              to be a something in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly 
              the right direction, and sends it into the very channel where it 
              ought to flow. <br>
            </p>
            <p> The course of true love never did run smooth-- <br>
            </p>
            <p>A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that 
              passage.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,--me, of all 
              people, who did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And 
              he, the very handsomest man that ever was, and a man that every 
              body looks up to, quite like Mr. Knightley! His company so sought 
              after, that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself 
              if he does not chuse it; that he has more invitations than there 
              are days in the week. And so excellent in the Church! Miss Nash 
              has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came 
              to Highbury. Dear me! When I look back to the first time I saw him! 
              How little did I think!-- The two Abbots and I ran into the front 
              room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by, 
              and Miss Nash came and scolded us away, and staid to look through 
              herself; however, she called me back presently, and let me look 
              too, which was very good-natured. And how beautiful we thought he 
              looked! He was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;This is an alliance which, whoever--whatever your friends 
              may be, must be agreeable to them, provided at least they have common 
              sense; and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools. If 
              they are anxious to see you happily married, here is a man whose 
              amiable character gives every assurance of it;--if they wish to 
              have you settled in the same country and circle which they have 
              chosen to place you in, here it will be accomplished; and if their 
              only object is that you should, in the common phrase, be well married, 
              here is the comfortable fortune, the respectable establishment, 
              the rise in the world which must satisfy them.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, very true. How nicely you talk; I love to hear you. 
              You understand every thing. You and Mr. Elton are one as clever 
              as the other. This charade!--If I had studied a twelvemonth, I could 
              never have made any thing like it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining 
              it yesterday.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever 
              read.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I never read one more to the purpose, certainly.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It is as long again as almost all we have had before.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour. 
              Such things in general cannot be too short.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear. The most satisfactory 
              comparisons were rising in her mind. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It is one thing,&quot; said she, presently--her cheeks in 
              a glow--&quot;to have very good sense in a common way, like every 
              body else, and if there is any thing to say, to sit down and write 
              a letter, and say just what you must, in a short way; and another, 
              to write verses and charades like this.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin's 
              prose. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Such sweet lines!&quot; continued Harriet--&quot;these two 
              last!--But how shall I ever be able to return the paper, or say 
              I have found it out?--Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what can we do about that?&quot; 
              <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Leave it to me. You do nothing. He will be here this evening, 
              I dare say, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense 
              or other will pass between us, and you shall not be committed.--Your 
              soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming. Trust to me.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this 
              beautiful charade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half 
              so good.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why 
              you should not write it into your book.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! but those two lines are&quot;-- <br>
              <br>
              --&quot;The best of all. Granted;--for private enjoyment; and for 
              private enjoyment keep them. They are not at all the less written 
              you know, because you divide them. The couplet does not cease to 
              be, nor does its meaning change. But take it away, and all appropriation 
              ceases, and a very pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection. 
              Depend upon it, he would not like to have his charade slighted, 
              much better than his passion. A poet in love must be encouraged 
              in both capacities, or neither. Give me the book, I will write it 
              down, and then there can be no possible reflection on you.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Harriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts, 
              so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a 
              declaration of love. It seemed too precious an offering for any 
              degree of publicity. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I shall never let that book go out of my own hands,&quot; 
              said she. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; replied Emma; &quot;a most natural feeling; 
              and the longer it lasts, the better I shall be pleased. But here 
              is my father coming: you will not object to my reading the charade 
              to him. It will be giving him so much pleasure! He loves any thing 
              of the sort, and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment. 
              He has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all!-- You must 
              let me read it to him.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Harriet looked grave. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this charade.--You 
              will betray your feelings improperly, if you are too conscious and 
              too quick, and appear to affix more meaning, or even quite all the 
              meaning which may be affixed to it. Do not be overpowered by such 
              a little tribute of admiration. If he had been anxious for secrecy, 
              he would not have left the paper while I was by; but he rather pushed 
              it towards me than towards you. Do not let us be too solemn on the 
              business. He has encouragement enough to proceed, without our sighing 
              out our souls over this charade.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Oh! no--I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it. Do as you 
              please.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again, 
              by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of &quot;Well, my 
              dears, how does your book go on?--Have you got any thing fresh?&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite 
              fresh. A piece of paper was found on the table this morning--(dropt, 
              we suppose, by a fairy)-- containing a very pretty charade, and 
              we have just copied it in.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>She read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read, slowly 
              and distinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations of 
              every part as she proceeded-- and he was very much pleased, and, 
              as she had foreseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Aye, that's very just, indeed, that's very properly said. 
              Very true. `Woman, lovely woman.' It is such a pretty charade, my 
              dear, that I can easily guess what fairy brought it.-- Nobody could 
              have written so prettily, but you, Emma.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma only nodded, and smiled.--After a little thinking, and a very 
              tender sigh, he added, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear 
              mother was so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! 
              But I can remember nothing;--not even that particular riddle which 
              you have heard me mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; 
              and there are several. <br>
              Kitty, a fair but frozen maid, Kindled a flame I yet deplore, The 
              hood-wink'd boy I called to aid, Though of his near approach afraid, 
              So fatal to my suit before. </p>
            <p>And that is all that I can recollect of it--but it is very clever 
              all the way through. But I think, my dear, you said you had got 
              it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page. We copied 
              it from the Elegant Extracts. It was Garrick's, you know.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Aye, very true.--I wish I could recollect more of it. <br>
            </p>
            <p> Kitty, a fair but frozen maid. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near 
              being christened Catherine after her grandmama. I hope we shall 
              have her here next week. Have you thought, my dear, where you shall 
              put her--and what room there will be for the children?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! yes--she will have her own room, of course; the room 
              she always has;--and there is the nursery for the children,--just 
              as usual, you know. Why should there be any change?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I do not know, my dear--but it is so long since she was here!--not 
              since last Easter, and then only for a few days.--Mr. John Knightley's 
              being a lawyer is very inconvenient.--Poor Isabella!--she is sadly 
              taken away from us all!--and how sorry she will be when she comes, 
              not to see Miss Taylor here!&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;She will not be surprized, papa, at least.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized 
              when I first heard she was going to be married.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella 
              is here.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, my dear, if there is time.--But--(in a very depressed 
              tone)--she is coming for only one week. There will not be time for 
              any thing.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer--but it seems 
              a case of necessity. Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on 
              the 28th, and we ought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have 
              the whole of the time they can give to the country, that two or 
              three days are not to be taken out for the Abbey. Mr. Knightley 
              promises to give up his claim this Christmas-- though you know it 
              is longer since they were with him, than with us.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella 
              were to be anywhere but at Hartfield.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley's claims on his 
              brother, or any body's claims on Isabella, except his own. <br>
              <br>
              He sat musing a little while, and then said, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go 
              back so soon, though he does. I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade 
              her to stay longer with us. She and the children might stay very 
              well.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah! papa--that is what you never have been able to accomplish, 
              and I do not think you ever will. Isabella cannot bear to stay behind 
              her husband.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>This was too true for contradiction. Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhouse 
              could only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits affected 
              by the idea of his daughter's attachment to her husband, she immediately 
              led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while 
              my brother and sister are here. I am sure she will be pleased with 
              the children. We are very proud of the children, are not we, papa? 
              I wonder which she will think the handsomest, Henry or John?&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Aye, I wonder which she will. Poor little dears, how glad 
              they will be to come. They are very fond of being at Hartfield, 
              Harriet.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is 
              not.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama. Henry 
              is the eldest, he was named after me, not after his father. John, 
              the second, is named after his father. Some people are surprized, 
              I believe, that the eldest was not, but Isabella would have him 
              called Henry, which I thought very pretty of her. And he is a very 
              clever boy, indeed. They are all remarkably clever; and they have 
              so many pretty ways. They will come and stand by my chair, and say, 
              `Grandpapa, can you give me a bit of string?' and once Henry asked 
              me for a knife, but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas. 
              I think their father is too rough with them very often.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;He appears rough to you,&quot; said Emma, &quot;because you 
              are so very gentle yourself; but if you could compare him with other 
              papas, you would not think him rough. He wishes his boys to be active 
              and hardy; and if they misbehave, can give them a sharp word now 
              and then; but he is an affectionate father--certainly Mr. John Knightley 
              is an affectionate father. The children are all fond of him.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the 
              ceiling in a very frightful way!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. 
              It is such enjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down 
              the rule of their taking turns, whichever began would never give 
              way to the other.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, I cannot understand it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world 
              cannot understand the pleasures of the other.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Later in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate 
              in preparation for the regular four o'clock dinner, the hero of 
              this inimitable charade walked in again. Harriet turned away; but 
              Emma could receive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye soon 
              discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push--of having 
              thrown a die; and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn 
              up. His ostensible reason, however, was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse's 
              party could be made up in the evening without him, or whether he 
              should be in the smallest degree necessary at Hartfield. If he were, 
              every thing else must give way; but otherwise his friend Cole had 
              been saying so much about his dining with him--had made such a point 
              of it, that he had promised him conditionally to come. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his 
              friend on their account; her father was sure of his rubber. He re-urged 
              --she re-declined; and he seemed then about to make his bow, when 
              taking the paper from the table, she returned it-- <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave 
              with us; thank you for the sight of it. We admired it so much, that 
              I have ventured to write it into Miss Smith's collection. Your friend 
              will not take it amiss I hope. Of course I have not transcribed 
              beyond the first eight lines.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say. He looked 
              rather doubtingly--rather confused; said something about &quot;honour,&quot;--glanced 
              at Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book open on the table, 
              took it up, and examined it very attentively. With the view of passing 
              off an awkward moment, Emma smilingly said, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a 
              charade must not be confined to one or two. He may be sure of every 
              woman's approbation while he writes with such gallantry.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I have no hesitation in saying,&quot; replied Mr. Elton, 
              though hesitating a good deal while he spoke; &quot;I have no hesitation 
              in saying--at least if my friend feels at all as I do--I have not 
              the smallest doubt that, could he see his little effusion honoured 
              as I see it, (looking at the book again, and replacing it on the 
              table), he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>After this speech he was gone as soon as possible. Emma could not 
              think it too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, 
              there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to 
              incline her to laugh. She ran away to indulge the inclination, leaving 
              the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet's share. </p>

            <p>What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house 
              from what she had brought out!--she had then been only daring to 
              hope for a little respite of suffering;--she was now in an exquisite 
              flutter of happiness, and such happiness moreover as she believed 
              must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away. 
              <br>
              <br>
              They sat down to tea--the same party round the same table-- how 
              often it had been collected!--and how often had her eyes fallen 
              on the same shrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful 
              effect of the western sun!--But never in such a state of spirits, 
              never in any thing like it; and it was with difficulty that she 
              could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of 
              the house, or even the attentive daughter. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Poor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him 
              in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and 
              so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride.--Could 
              he have seen the heart, he would have cared very little for the 
              lungs; but without the most distant imagination of the impending 
              evil, without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary 
              in the looks or ways of either, he repeated to them very comfortably 
              all the articles of news he had received from Mr. Perry, and talked 
              on with much self-contentment, totally unsuspicious of what they 
              could have told him in return. <br>
            </p>
            <p>As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma's fever continued; 
              but when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised and 
              subdued--and in the course of the sleepless night, which was the 
              tax for such an evening, she found one or two such very serious 
              points to consider, as made her feel, that even her happiness must 
              have some alloy. Her father--and Harriet. She could not be alone 
              without feeling the full weight of their separate claims; and how 
              to guard the comfort of both to the utmost, was the question. With 
              respect to her father, it was a question soon answered. She hardly 
              knew yet what Mr. Knightley would ask; but a very short parley with 
              her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting 
              her father.--She even wept over the idea of it, as a sin of thought. 
              While he lived, it must be only an engagement; but she flattered 
              herself, that if divested of the danger of drawing her away, it 
              might become an increase of comfort to him.-- How to do her best 
              by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;-- how to spare her from 
              any unnecessary pain; how to make her any possible atonement; how 
              to appear least her enemy?-- On these subjects, her perplexity and 
              distress were very great-- and her mind had to pass again and again 
              through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever 
              surrounded it.-- She could only resolve at last, that she would 
              still avoid a meeting with her, and communicate all that need be 
              told by letter;that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have 
              her removed just now for a time from Highbury, and--indulging in 
              one scheme more-- nearly resolve, that it might be practicable to 
              get an invitation for her to Brunswick Square.--Isabella had been 
              pleased with Harriet; and a few weeks spent in London must give 
              her some amusement.-- She did not think it in Harriet's nature to 
              escape being benefited by novelty and variety, by the streets, the 
              shops, and the children.-- At any rate, it would be a proof of attention 
              and kindness in herself, from whom every thing was due; a separation 
              for the present; an averting of the evil day, when they must all 
              be together again. <br>
            </p>
            <p>She rose early, and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment 
              which left her so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley, 
              in walking up to Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too 
              soon; and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground 
              again with him, literally and figuratively, was quite necessary 
              to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening 
              before. <br>
            </p>
            <p>He had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to have 
              the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a 
              letter was brought her from Randalls--a very thick letter;--she 
              guessed what it must contain, and deprecated the necessity of reading 
              it.-- She was now in perfect charity with Frank Churchill; she wanted 
              no explanations, she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself-- 
              and as for understanding any thing he wrote, she was sure she was 
              incapable of it.--It must be waded through, however. She opened 
              the packet; it was too surely so;--a note from Mrs. Weston to herself, 
              ushered in the letter from Frank to Mrs. Weston. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in forwarding 
              to you the enclosed. I know what thorough justice you will do it, 
              and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect.--I think we shall 
              never materially disagree about the writer again; but I will not 
              delay you by a long preface.--We are quite well.-- This letter has 
              been the cure of all the little nervousness I have been feeling 
              lately.--I did not quite like your looks on Tuesday, but it was 
              an ungenial morning; and though you will never own being affected 
              by weather, I think every body feels a north-east wind.-- I felt 
              for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday afternoon 
              and yesterday morning, but had the comfort of hearing last night, 
              by Mr. Perry, that it had not made him ill. &quot;Yours ever, </p>
            <p> &quot;A. W.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p> [To Mrs. Weston.] </p>
            <p> WINDSOR-JULY. </p>
            <p>MY DEAR MADAM, <br>
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;If I made myself intelligible yesterday, this letter will 
              be expected; but expected or not, I know it will be read with candour 
              and indulgence.-- You are all goodness, and I believe there will 
              be need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my 
              past conduct.--But I have been forgiven by one who had still more 
              to resent. My courage rises while I write. It is very difficult 
              for the prosperous to be humble. I have already met with such success 
              in two applications for pardon, that I may be in danger of thinking 
              myself too sure of yours, and of those among your friends who have 
              had any ground of offence.--You must all endeavour to comprehend 
              the exact nature of my situation when I first arrived at Randalls; 
              you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at 
              all hazards. This was the fact. My right to place myself in a situation 
              requiring such concealment, is another question. I shall not discuss 
              it here. For my temptation to think it a right, I refer every caviller 
              to a brick house, sashed windows below, and casements above, in 
              Highbury. I dared not address her openly; my difficulties in the 
              then state of Enscombe must be too well known to require definition; 
              and I was fortunate enough to prevail, before we parted at Weymouth, 
              and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop 
              in charity to a secret engagement.-- Had she refused, I should have 
              gone mad.--But you will be ready to say, what was your hope in doing 
              this?--What did you look forward to?-- To any thing, every thing--to 
              time, chance, circumstance, slow effects, sudden bursts, perseverance 
              and weariness, health and sickness. Every possibility of good was 
              before me, and the first of blessings secured, in obtaining her 
              promises of faith and correspondence.If you need farther explanation, 
              I have the honour, my dear madam, of being your husband's son, and 
              the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good, which 
              no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of.--See 
              me, then, under these circumstances, arriving on my first visit 
              to Randalls;--and here I am conscious of wrong, for that visit might 
              have been sooner paid. You will look back and see that I did not 
              come till Miss Fairfax was in Highbury; and as you were the person 
              slighted, you will forgive me instantly; but I must work on my father's 
              compassion, by reminding him, that so long as I absented myself 
              from his house, so long I lost the blessing of knowing you. My behaviour, 
              during the very happy fortnight which I spent with you, did not, 
              I hope, lay me open to reprehension, excepting on one point. And 
              now I come to the principal, the only important part of my conduct 
              while belonging to you, which excites my own anxiety, or requires 
              very solicitous explanation. With the greatest respect, and the 
              warmest friendship, do I mention Miss Woodhouse; my father perhaps 
              will think I ought to add, with the deepest humiliation.-- A few 
              words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion, and some 
              censure I acknowledge myself liable to.--My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse 
              indicated, I believe, more than it ought.--In order to assist a 
              concealment so essential to me, I was led on to make more than an 
              allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately 
              thrown.--I cannot deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object--but 
              I am sure you will believe the declaration, that had I not been 
              convinced of her indifference, I would not have been induced by 
              any selfish views to go on.-- Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse 
              is, she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached; 
              and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached 
              to me, was as much my conviction as my wish.--She received my attentions 
              with an easy, friendly, goodhumoured playfulness, which exactly 
              suited me. We seemed to understand each other. From our relative 
              situation, those attentions were her due, and were felt to be so.--Whether 
              Miss Woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration 
              of that fortnight, I cannot say;--when I called to take leave of 
              her, I remember that I was within a moment of confessing the truth, 
              and I then fancied she was not without suspicion; but I have no 
              doubt of her having since detected me, at least in some degree.-- 
              She may not have surmised the whole, but her quickness must have 
              penetrated a part. I cannot doubt it. You will find, whenever the 
              subject becomes freed from its present restraints, that it did not 
              take her wholly by surprize. She frequently gave me hints of it. 
              I remember her telling me at the ball, that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude 
              for her attentions to Miss Fairfax.-- I hope this history of my 
              conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great 
              extenuation of what you saw amiss. While you considered me as having 
              sinned against Emma Woodhouse, I could deserve nothing from either. 
              Acquit me here, and procure for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal 
              and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with 
              so much brotherly affection, as to long to have her as deeply and 
              as happily in love as myself.-- Whatever strange things I said or 
              did during that fortnight, you have now a key to. My heart was in 
              Highbury, and my business was to get my body thither as often as 
              might be, and with the least suspicion. If you remember any queernesses, 
              set them all to the right account.-- Of the pianoforte so much talked 
              of, I feel it only necessary to say, that its being ordered was 
              absolutely unknown to Miss F--, who would never have allowed me 
              to send it, had any choice been given her.-- The delicacy of her 
              mind throughout the whole engagement, my dear madam, is much beyond 
              my power of doing justice to. You will soon, I earnestly hope, know 
              her thoroughly yourself.-- No description can describe her. She 
              must tell you herself what she is-- yet not by word, for never was 
              there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own 
              merit.--Since I began this letter, which will be longer than I foresaw, 
              I have heard from her.-- She gives a good account of her own health; 
              but as she never complains, I dare not depend. I want to have your 
              opinion of her looks. I know you will soon call on her; she is living 
              in dread of the visit. Perhaps it is paid already. Let me hear from 
              you without delay; I am impatient for a thousand particulars. Remember 
              how few minutes I was at Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad 
              a state: and I am not much better yet; still insane either from 
              happiness or misery. When I think of the kindness and favour I have 
              met with, of her excellence and patience, and my uncle's generosity, 
              I am mad with joy: but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned 
              her, and how little I deserve to be forgiven, I am mad with anger. 
              If I could but see her again!--But I must not propose it yet. My 
              uncle has been too good for me to encroach.--I must still add to 
              this long letter. You have not heard all that you ought to hear. 
              I could not give any connected detail yesterday; but the suddenness, 
              and, in one light, the unseasonableness with which the affair burst 
              out, needs explanation; for though the event of the 26th ult., as 
              you will conclude, immediately opened to me the happiest prospects, 
              I should not have presumed on such early measures, but from the 
              very particular circumstances, which left me not an hour to lose. 
              I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty, and she would 
              have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement.-- 
              But I had no choice. The hasty engagement she had entered into with 
              that woman--Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to leave off abruptly, 
              to recollect and compose myself.--I have been walking over the country,and 
              am now, I hope, rational enough to make the rest of my letter what 
              it ought to be.--It is, in fact, a most mortifying retrospect for 
              me. I behaved shamefully. And here I can admit, that my manners 
              to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were highly blameable. 
              She disapproved them, which ought to have been enough.--My plea 
              of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient.--She was displeased; 
              I thought unreasonably so: I thought her, on a thousand occasions, 
              unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious: I thought her even cold. 
              But she was always right. If I had followed her judgment, and subdued 
              my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper, I should have 
              escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.--We quarrelled.-- 
              Do you remember the morning spent at Donwell?--There every little 
              dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis. I was 
              late; I met her walking home by herself, and wanted to walk with 
              her, but she would not suffer it. She absolutely refused to allow 
              me, which I then thought most unreasonable. Now, however, I see 
              nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion. 
              While I, to blind the world to our engagement, was behaving one 
              hour with objectionable particularity to another woman, was she 
              to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every 
              previous caution useless?--Had we been met walking together between 
              Donwell and Highbury, the truth must have been suspected.-- I was 
              mad enough, however, to resent.--I doubted her affection. I doubted 
              it more the next day on Box Hill; when, provoked by such conduct 
              on my side, such shameful, insolent neglect of her, and such apparent 
              devotion to Miss W., as it would have been impossible for any woman 
              of sense to endure, she spoke her resentment in a form of words 
              perfectly intelligible to me.-- In short, my dear madam, it was 
              a quarrel blameless on her side, abominable on mine; and I returned 
              the same evening to Richmond, though I might have staid with you 
              till the next morning, merely because I would be as angry with her 
              as possible. Even then, I was not such a fool as not to mean to 
              be reconciled in time; but I was the injured person, injured by 
              her coldness, and I went away determined that she should make the 
              first advances.--I shall always congratulate myself that you were 
              not of the Box Hill party. Had you witnessed my behaviour there, 
              I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again. 
              Its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced: 
              as soon as she found I was really gone from Randalls, she closed 
              with the offer of that officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of 
              whose treatment of her, by the bye, has ever filled me with indignation 
              and hatred. I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which 
              has been so richly extended towards myself; but, otherwise, I should 
              loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known.-- 
              &quot;Jane,&quot; indeed!--You will observe that I have not yet 
              indulged myself in calling her by that name, even to you. Think, 
              then, what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the 
              Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition, and all the 
              insolence of imaginary superiority. Have patience with me, I shall 
              soon have done.-- She closed with this offer, resolving to break 
              with me entirely, and wrote the next day to tell me that we never 
              were to meet again.-- She felt the engagement to be a source of 
              repentance and misery to each: she dissolved it.--This letter reached 
              me on the very morning of my poor aunt's death. I answered it within 
              an hour; but from the confusion of my mind, and the multiplicity 
              of usiness falling on me at once, my answer, instead of being sent 
              with all the many other letters of that day, was locked up in my 
              writing-desk; and I, trusting that I had written enough, though 
              but a few lines, to satisfy her, remained without any uneasiness.--I 
              was rather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily; 
              but I made excuses for her, and was too busy, and--may I add?-- 
              too cheerful in my views to be captious.--We removed to Windsor; 
              and two days afterwards I received a parcel from her, my own letters 
              all returned!--and a few lines at the same time by the post, stating 
              her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her 
              last; and adding, that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued, 
              and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate 
              arrangement concluded as soon as possible, she now sent me, by a 
              safe conveyance, all my letters, and requested, that if I could 
              not directly command hers, so as to send them to Highbury within 
              a week, I would forward them after that period to her at--: in short, 
              the full direction to Mr. Smallridge's, near Bristol, stared me 
              in the face. I knew the name, the place, I knew all about it, and 
              instantly saw what she had been doing. It was perfectly accordant 
              with that resolution of character which I knew her to possess; and 
              the secrecy she had maintained, as to any such design in her former 
              letter, was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy. For the 
              world would not she have seemed to threaten me.--Imagine the shock; 
              imagine how, till I had actually detected my own blunder, I raved 
              at the blunders of the post.-- What was to be done?--One thing only.--I 
              must speak to my uncle.Without his sanction I could not hope to 
              be listened to again.-- I spoke; circumstances were in my favour; 
              the late event had softened away his pride, and he was, earlier 
              than I could have anticipated, wholly reconciled and complying; 
              and could say at last, poor man! with a deep sigh, that he wished 
              I might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done.--I 
              felt that it would be of a different sort.--Are you disposed to 
              pity me for what I must have suffered in opening the cause to him, 
              for my suspense while all was at stake?--No; do not pity me till 
              I reached Highbury, and saw how ill I had made her. Do not pity 
              me till I saw her wan, sick looks.--I reached Highbury at the time 
              of day when, from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour, I was 
              certain of a good chance of finding her alone.--I was not disappointed; 
              and at last I was not disappointed either in the object of my journey. 
              A great deal of very reasonable, very just displeasure I had to 
              persuade away. But it is done; we are reconciled, dearer, much dearer, 
              than ever, and no moment's uneasiness can ever occur between us 
              again. Now, my dear madam, I will release you; but I could not conclude 
              before. A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you 
              have ever shewn me, and ten thousand for the attentions your heart 
              will dictate towards her.--If you think me in a way to be happier 
              than I deserve, I am quite of your opinion.--Miss W. calls me the 
              child of good fortune. I hope she is right.--In one respect, my 
              good fortune is undoubted, that of being able to subscribe myself, 
              Your obliged and affectionate Son, </p>

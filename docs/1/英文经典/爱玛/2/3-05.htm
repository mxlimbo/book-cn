            <p>In this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened 
              upon Hartfield. To Highbury in general it brought no material change. 
              The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings, and 
              of the use to be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax 
              was still at her grandmother's; and as the return of the Campbells 
              from Ireland was again delayed, and August, instead of Midsummer, 
              fixed for it, she was likely to remain there full two months longer, 
              provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs. Elton's activity 
              in her service, and save herself from being hurried into a delightful 
              situation against her will. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had 
              certainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growing 
              to dislike him more. He began to suspect him of some double dealing 
              in his pursuit of Emma. That Emma was his object appeared indisputable. 
              Every thing declared it; his own attentions, his father's hints, 
              his mother-in-law's guarded silence; it was all in unison; words, 
              conduct, discretion, and indiscretion, told the same story. But 
              while so many were devoting him to Emma, and Emma herself making 
              him over to Harriet, Mr. Knightley began to suspect him of some 
              inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax. He could not understand 
              it; but there were symptoms of intelligence between them--he thought 
              so at least-- symptoms of admiration on his side, which, having 
              once observed, he could not persuade himself to think entirely void 
              of meaning, however he might wish to escape any of Emma's errors 
              of imagination. She was not present when the suspicion first arose. 
              He was dining with the Randalls family, and Jane, at the Eltons'; 
              and he had seen a look, more than a single look, at Miss Fairfax, 
              which, from the admirer of Miss Woodhouse, seemed somewhat out of 
              place. When he was again in their company, he could not help remembering 
              what he had seen; nor could he avoid observations which, unless 
              it were like Cowper and his fire at twilight, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Myself creating what I saw,&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of 
              private liking, of private understanding even, between Frank Churchill 
              and Jane. <br>
              <br>
              He had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did, to 
              spend his evening at Hartfield. Emma and Harriet were going to walk; 
              he joined them; and, on returning, they fell in with a larger party, 
              who, like themselves, judged it wisest to take their exercise early, 
              as the weather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their son, 
              Miss Bates and her niece, who had accidentally met. They all united; 
              and, on reaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it was exactly 
              the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father, pressed 
              them all to go in and drink tea with him. The Randalls party agreed 
              to it immediately; and after a pretty long speech from Miss Bates, 
              which few persons listened to, she also found it possible to accept 
              dear Miss Woodhouse's most obliging invitation. <br>
            </p>
            <p>As they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on horseback. 
              The gentlemen spoke of his horse. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;By the bye,&quot; said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently, 
              &quot;what became of Mr. Perry's plan of setting up his carriage?&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, &quot;I did not know that 
              he ever had any such plan.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Nay, I had it from you. You wrote me word of it three months 
              ago.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Me! impossible!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Indeed you did. I remember it perfectly. You mentioned it 
              as what was certainly to be very soon. Mrs. Perry had told somebody, 
              and was extremely happy about it. It was owing to her persuasion, 
              as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal 
              of harm. You must remember it now?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Never! really, never!--Bless me! how could it be?--Then I 
              must have dreamt it--but I was completely persuaded--Miss Smith, 
              you walk as if you were tired. You will not be sorry to find yourself 
              at home.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;What is this?--What is this?&quot; cried Mr. Weston, &quot;about 
              Perry and a carriage? Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank? 
              I am glad he can afford it. You had it from himself, had you?&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No, sir,&quot; replied his son, laughing, &quot;I seem to 
              have had it from nobody.--Very odd!--I really was persuaded of Mrs. 
              Weston's having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, 
              many weeks ago, with all these particulars--but as she declares 
              she never heard a syllable of it before, of course it must have 
              been a dream. I am a great dreamer. I dream of every body at Highbury 
              when I am away-- and when I have gone through my particular friends, 
              then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs. Perry.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It is odd though,&quot; observed his father, &quot;that you 
              should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom 
              it was not very likely you should be thinking of at Enscombe. Perry's 
              setting up his carriage! and his wife's persuading him to it, out 
              of care for his health-- just what will happen, I have no doubt, 
              some time or other; only a little premature. What an air of probability 
              sometimes runs through a dream! And at others, what a heap of absurdities 
              it is! Well, Frank, your dream certainly shews that Highbury is 
              in your thoughts when you are absent. Emma, you are a great dreamer, 
              I think?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma was out of hearing. She had hurried on before her guests to 
              prepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach 
              of Mr. Weston's hint. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Why, to own the truth,&quot; cried Miss Bates, who had been 
              trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes, &quot;if I must 
              speak on this subject, there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill 
              might have--I do not mean to say that he did not dream it--I am 
              sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world--but if I am 
              questioned about it, I must acknowledge that there was such an idea 
              last spring; for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother, and 
              the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves--but it was quite a secret, 
              known to nobody else, and only thought of about three days. Mrs. 
              Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage, and came 
              to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she 
              had prevailed. Jane, don't you remember grandmama's telling us of 
              it when we got home? I forget where we had been walking to-- very 
              likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to Randalls. Mrs. Perry 
              was always particularly fond of my mother--indeed I do not know 
              who is not--and she had mentioned it to her in confidence; she had 
              no objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not to go 
              beyond: and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it to a soul 
              that I know of. At the same time, I will not positively answer for 
              my having never dropt a hint, because I know I do sometimes pop 
              out a thing before I am aware. I am a talker, you know; I am rather 
              a talker; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I 
              should not. I am not like Jane; I wish I were. I will answer for 
              it she never betrayed the least thing in the world. Where is she?--Oh! 
              just behind. Perfectly remember Mrs. Perry's coming.-- Extraordinary 
              dream, indeed!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>They were entering the hall. Mr. Knightley's eyes had preceded 
              Miss Bates's in a glance at Jane. From Frank Churchill's face, where 
              he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he had involuntarily 
              turned to hers; but she was indeed behind, and too busy with her 
              shawl. Mr. Weston had walked in. The two other gentlemen waited 
              at the door to let her pass. Mr. nightley suspected in Frank Churchill 
              the determination of catching her eye-- he seemed watching her intently--in 
              vain, however, if it were so-- Jane passed between them into the 
              hall, and looked at neither. <br>
            </p>
            <p>There was no time for farther remark or explanation. The dream 
              must be borne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the 
              rest round the large modern circular table which Emma had introduced 
              at Hartfield, and which none but Emma could have had power to place 
              there and persuade her father to use, instead of the small-sized 
              Pembroke, on which two of his daily meals had, for forty years been 
              crowded. Tea passed pleasantly, and nobody seemed in a hurry to 
              move. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Miss Woodhouse,&quot; said Frank Churchill, after examining 
              a table behind him, which he could reach as he sat, &quot;have your 
              nephews taken away their alphabets--their box of letters? It used 
              to stand here. Where is it? This is a sort of dull-looking evening, 
              that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer. We had great 
              amusement with those letters one morning. I want to puzzle you again.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table 
              was quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so 
              much disposed to employ as their two selves. They were rapidly forming 
              words for each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled. 
              The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. 
              Woodhouse, who had often been distressed by the more animated sort, 
              which Mr. Weston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily 
              occupied in lamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure 
              of the &quot;poor little boys,&quot; or in fondly pointing out, 
              as he took up any stray letter near him, how beautifully Emma had 
              written it. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax. She gave a slight 
              glance round the table, and applied herself to it. Frank was next 
              to Emma, Jane opposite to them--and Mr. Knightley so placed as to 
              see them all; and it was his object to see as much as he could, 
              with as little apparent observation. The word was discovered, and 
              with a faint smile pushed away. If meant to be immediately mixed 
              with the others, and buried from sight, she should have looked on 
              the table instead of looking just across, for it was not mixed; 
              and Harriet, eager after every fresh word, and finding out none, 
              directly took it up, and fell to work. She was sitting by Mr. Knightley, 
              and turned to him for help. The word was blunder; and as Harriet 
              exultingly proclaimed it, there was a blush on Jane's cheek which 
              gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible. Mr. Knightley connected 
              it with the dream; but how it could all be, was beyond his comprehension. 
              How the delicacy, the discretion of his favourite could have been 
              so lain asleep! He feared there must be some decided involvement. 
              Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every 
              turn. These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick. 
              It was a child's play, chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank 
              Churchill's part. </p>
            <p>With great indignation did he continue to observe him; with great 
              alarm and distrust, to observe also his two blinded companions. 
              He saw a short word prepared for Emma, and given to her with a look 
              sly and demure. He saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found 
              it highly entertaining, though it was something which she judged 
              it proper to appear to censure; for she said, &quot;Nonsense! for 
              shame!&quot; He heard Frank Churchill next say, with a glance towards 
              Jane, &quot;I will give it to her--shall I?&quot;--and as clearly 
              heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth. &quot;No, no, 
              you must not; you shall not, indeed.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>It was done however. This gallant young man, who seemed to love 
              without feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance, 
              directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular 
              degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it. Mr. Knightley's 
              excessive curiosity to know what this word might be, made him seize 
              every possible moment for darting his eye towards it, and it was 
              not long before he saw it to be Dixon. Jane Fairfax's perception 
              seemed to accompany his; her comprehension was certainly more equal 
              to the covert meaning, the superior intelligence, of those five 
              letters so arranged. She was evidently displeased; looked up, and 
              seeing herself watched, blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived 
              her, and saying only, &quot;I did not know that proper names were 
              allowed,&quot; pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit, 
              and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be 
              offered. Her face was averted from those who had made the attack, 
              and turned towards her aunt. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Aye, very true, my dear,&quot; cried the latter, though Jane 
              had not spoken a word--&quot;I was just going to say the same thing. 
              It is time for us to be going indeed. The evening is closing in, 
              and grandmama will be looking for us. My dear sir, you are too obliging. 
              We really must wish you good night.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Jane's alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt had 
              preconceived. She was immediately up, and wanting to quit the table; 
              but so many were also moving, that she could not get away; and Mr. 
              Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously 
              pushed towards her, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined. 
              She was afterwards looking for her shawl--Frank Churchill was looking 
              also--it was growing dusk, and the room was in confusion; and how 
              they parted, Mr. Knightley could not tell. <br>
            </p>
            <p>He remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full 
              of what he had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist 
              his observations, he must--yes, he certainly must, as a friend-- 
              an anxious friend--give Emma some hint, ask her some question. He 
              could not see her in a situation of such danger, without trying 
              to preserve her. It was his duty. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Pray, Emma,&quot; said he, &quot;may I ask in what lay the 
              great amusement, the poignant sting of the last word given to you 
              and Miss Fairfax? I saw the word, and am curious to know how it 
              could be so very entertaining to the one, and so very distressing 
              to the other.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma was extremely confused. She could not endure to give him the 
              true explanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed, 
              she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; she cried in evident embarrassment, &quot;it all 
              meant nothing; a mere joke among ourselves.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;The joke,&quot; he replied gravely, &quot;seemed confined 
              to you and Mr. Churchill.&quot; </p>
            <p>He had hoped she would speak again, but she did not. She would 
              rather busy herself about any thing than speak. He sat a little 
              while in doubt. A variety of evils crossed his mind. Interference-- 
              fruitless interference. Emma's confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy, 
              seemed to declare her affection engaged. Yet he would speak. He 
              owed it to her, to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome 
              interference, rather than her welfare; to encounter any thing, rather 
              than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My dear Emma,&quot; said he at last, with earnest kindness, 
              &quot;do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance 
              between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax? Oh! yes, perfectly.-- 
              Why do you make a doubt of it?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired 
              her, or that she admired him?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Never, never!&quot; she cried with a most open eagerness--&quot;Never, 
              for the twentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me. 
              And how could it possibly come into your head?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment 
              between them-- certain expressive looks, which I did not believe 
              meant to be public.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! you amuse me excessively. I am delighted to find that 
              you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander--but it will not 
              do-- very sorry to check you in your first essay--but indeed it 
              will not do. There is no admiration between them, I do assure you; 
              and the appearances which have caught you, have arisen from some 
              peculiar circumstances--feelings rather of a totally different nature-- 
              it is impossible exactly to explain:--there is a good deal of nonsense 
              in it--but the part which is capable of being communicated, which 
              is sense, is, that they are as far from any attachment or admiration 
              for one another, as any two beings in the world can be. That is, 
              I presume it to be so on her side, and I can answer for its being 
              so on his. I will answer for the gentleman's indifference.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>She spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction 
              which silenced, Mr. Knightley. She was in gay spirits, and would 
              have prolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars 
              of his suspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and 
              hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her: but his gaiety 
              did not meet hers. He found he could not be useful, and his feelings 
              were too much irritated for talking. That he might not be irritated 
              into an absolute fever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse's tender 
              habits required almost every evening throughout the year, he soon 
              afterwards took a hasty leave, and walked home to the coolness and 
              solitude of Donwell Abbey. </p>

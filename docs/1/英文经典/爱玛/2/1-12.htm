            <p align="center">CHAPTER XII <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Knightley was to dine with them--rather against the inclination 
              of Mr. Woodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with 
              him in Isabella's first day. Emma's sense of right however had decided 
              it; and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother, 
              she had particular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late disagreement 
              between Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him the proper invitation. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>She hoped they might now become friends again. She thought it was 
              time to make up. Making-up indeed would not do. She certainly had 
              not been in the wrong, and he would never own that he had. Concession 
              must be out of the question; but it was time to appear to forget 
              that they had ever quarrelled; and she hoped it might rather assist 
              the restoration of friendship, that when he came into the room she 
              had one of the children with her--the youngest, a nice little girl 
              about eight months old, who was now making her first visit to Hartfield, 
              and very happy to be danced about in her aunt's arms. It did assist; 
              for though he began with grave looks and short questions, he was 
              soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way, and to take the 
              child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect 
              amity. Emma felt they were friends again; and the conviction giving 
              her at first great satisfaction, and then a little sauciness, she 
              could not help saying, as he was admiring the baby, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews 
              and nieces. As to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very 
              different; but with regard to these children, I observe we never 
              disagree.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of 
              men and women, and as little under the power of fancy and whim in 
              your dealings with them, as you are where these children are concerned, 
              we might always think alike.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;To be sure--our discordancies must always arise from my being 
              in the wrong.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said he, smiling--&quot;and reason good. I was 
              sixteen years old when you were born.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;A material difference then,&quot; she replied--&quot;and 
              no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of 
              our lives; but does not the lapse of one-and-twenty years bring 
              our understandings a good deal nearer?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes--a good deal nearer.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right, 
              if we think differently.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years' experience, 
              and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child. Come, 
              my dear Emma, let us be friends, and say no more about it. Tell 
              your aunt, little Emma, that she ought to set you a better example 
              than to be renewing old grievances, and that if she were not wrong 
              before, she is now.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;That's true,&quot; she cried--&quot;very true. Little Emma, 
              grow up a better woman than your aunt. Be infinitely cleverer and 
              not half so conceited. Now, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and 
              I have done. As far as good intentions went, we were both right, 
              and I must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet 
              proved wrong. I only want to know that Mr. Martin is not very, very 
              bitterly disappointed.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;A man cannot be more so,&quot; was his short, full answer. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah!--Indeed I am very sorry.--Come, shake hands with me.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>This had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John 
              Knightley made his appearance, and &quot;How d'ye do, George?&quot; 
              and &quot;John, how are you?&quot; succeeded in the true English 
              style, burying under a calmness that seemed all but indifference, 
              the real attachment which would have led either of them, if requisite, 
              to do every thing for the good of the other. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined 
              cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella, 
              and the little party made two natural divisions; on one side he 
              and his daughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys; their subjects 
              totally distinct, or very rarely mixing--and Emma only occasionally 
              joining in one or the other. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principally 
              of those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative, 
              and who was always the greater talker. As a magistrate, he had generally 
              some point of law to consult John about, or, at least,some curious 
              anecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand the home-farm 
              at Donwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear next year, 
              and to give all such local information as could not fail of being 
              interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest 
              part of his life, and whose attachments were strong. The plan of 
              a drain, the change of a fence, the felling of a tree, and the destination 
              of every acre for wheat, turnips, or spring corn, was entered into 
              with as much equality of interest by John, as his cooler manners 
              rendered possible; and if his willing brother ever left him any 
              thing to inquire about, his inquiries even approached a tone of 
              eagerness. <br>
            </p>
            <p>While they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying 
              a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My poor dear Isabella,&quot; said he, fondly taking her hand, 
              and interrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one 
              of her five children--&quot;How long it is, how terribly long since 
              you were here! And how tired you must be after your journey! You 
              must go to bed early, my dear--and I recommend a little gruel to 
              you before you go.--You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together. 
              My dear Emma, suppose we all have a little gruel.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did, that 
              both the Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as 
              herself;--and two basins only were ordered. After a little more 
              discourse in praise of gruel, with some wondering at its not being 
              taken every evening by every body, he proceeded to say, with an 
              air of grave reflection, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn 
              at South End instead of coming here. I never had much opinion of 
              the sea air.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir--or we 
              should not have gone. He recommended it for all the children, but 
              particularly for the weakness in little Bella's throat,-- both sea 
              air and bathing.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing 
              her any good; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced, 
              though perhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very 
              rarely of use to any body. I am sure it almost killed me once.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Come, come,&quot; cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe 
              subject, &quot;I must beg you not to talk of the sea. It makes me 
              envious and miserable;-- I who have never seen it! South End is 
              prohibited, if you please. My dear Isabella, I have not heard you 
              make one inquiry about Mr. Perry yet; and he never forgets you.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! good Mr. Perry--how is he, sir?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Why, pretty well; but not quite well. Poor Perry is bilious, 
              and he has not time to take care of himself--he tells me he has 
              not time to take care of himself--which is very sad--but he is always 
              wanted all round the country. I suppose there is not a man in such 
              practice anywhere. But then there is not so clever a man any where.&quot; 
              <br>
              <br>
              &quot;And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the children 
              grow? I have a great regard for Mr. Perry. I hope he will be calling 
              soon. He will be so pleased to see my little ones.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or 
              two to ask him about myself of some consequence. And, my dear, whenever 
              he comes, you had better let him look at little Bella's throat.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have 
              hardly any uneasiness about it. Either bathing has been of the greatest 
              service to her, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation 
              of Mr. Wingfield's, which we have been applying at times ever since 
              August.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have 
              been of use to her--and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation, 
              I would have spoken to-- <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates,&quot; 
              said Emma, &quot;I have not heard one inquiry after them.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! the good Bateses--I am quite ashamed of myself--but you 
              mention them in most of your letters. I hope they are quite well. 
              Good old Mrs. Bates--I will call upon her to-morrow, and take my 
              children.--They are always so pleased to see my children.-- And 
              that excellent Miss Bates!--such thorough worthy people!-- How are 
              they, sir?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. But poor Mrs. 
              Bates had a bad cold about a month ago.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;How sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as they 
              have been this autumn. Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known 
              them more general or heavy--except when it has been quite an influenza.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the 
              degree you mention. Perry says that colds have been very general, 
              but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November. Perry 
              does not call it altogether a sickly season.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it very sickly 
              except-- <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is 
              always a sickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can 
              be. It is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so 
              far off!-- and the air so bad!&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;No, indeed--we are not at all in a bad air. Our part of London 
              is very superior to most others!--You must not confound us with 
              London in general, my dear sir. The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square 
              is very different from almost all the rest. We are so very airy! 
              I should be unwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;-- 
              there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children 
              in: but we are so remarkably airy!--Mr. Wingfield thinks the vicinity 
              of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield. You make the best 
              of it-- but after you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all 
              of you different creatures; you do not look like the same. Now I 
              cannot say, that I think you are any of you looking well at present.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting 
              those little nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never 
              entirely free from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the 
              children were rather pale before they went to bed, it was only because 
              they were a little more tired than usual, from their journey and 
              the happiness of coming. I hope you will think better of their looks 
              to-morrow; for I assure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did not 
              believe he had ever sent us off altogether, in such good case. I 
              trust, at least, that you do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill,&quot; 
              turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. John 
              Knightley very far from looking well.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;What is the matter, sir?--Did you speak to me?&quot; cried 
              Mr. John Knightley, hearing his own name. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think 
              you looking well--but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. 
              I could have wished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr. 
              Wingfield before you left home.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My dear Isabella,&quot;--exclaimed he hastily--&quot;pray 
              do not concern yourself about my looks. Be satisfied with doctoring 
              and coddling yourself and the children, and let me look as I chuse.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your 
              brother,&quot; cried Emma, &quot;about your friend Mr. Graham's 
              intending to have a bailiff from Scotland, to look after his new 
              estate. What will it answer? Will not the old prejudice be too strong?&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>And she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when 
              forced to give her attention again to her father and sister, she 
              had nothing worse to hear than Isabella's kind inquiry after Jane 
              Fairfax; and Jane Fairfax, though no great favourite with her in 
              general, she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!&quot; said Mrs. John Knightley.-- 
              &quot;It is so long since I have seen her, except now and then for 
              a moment accidentally in town! What happiness it must be to her 
              good old grandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit 
              them! I always regret excessively on dear Emma's account that she 
              cannot be more at Highbury; but now their daughter is married, I 
              suppose Colonel and Mrs. Campbell will not be able to part with 
              her at all. She would be such a delightful companion for Emma.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another 
              pretty kind of young person. You will like Harriet. Emma could not 
              have a better companion than Harriet.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I am most happy to hear it--but only Jane Fairfax one knows 
              to be so very accomplished and superior!--and exactly Emma's age.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>This topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of 
              similar moment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening 
              did not close without a little return of agitation. The gruel came 
              and supplied a great deal to be said--much praise and many comments-- 
              undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, 
              and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never 
              met with tolerable;--but, unfortunately, among the failures which 
              the daughter had to instance, the most recent, and therefore most 
              prominent, was in her own cook at South End, a young woman hired 
              for the time, who never had been able to understand what she meant 
              by a basin of nice smooth gruel, thin, but not too thin. Often as 
              she had wished for and ordered it, she had never been able to get 
              any thing tolerable. Here was a dangerous opening. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah!&quot; said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing 
              his eyes on her with tender concern.--The ejaculation in Emma's 
              ear expressed, &quot;Ah! there is no end of the sad consequences 
              of your going to South End. It does not bear talking of.&quot; And 
              for a little while she hoped he would not talk of it, and that a 
              silent rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of 
              his own smooth gruel. After an interval of some minutes, however, 
              he began with, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this 
              autumn, instead of coming here.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;But why should you be sorry, sir?--I assure you, it did the 
              children a great deal of good.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not 
              have been to South End. South End is an unhealthy place. Perry was 
              surprized to hear you had fixed upon South End.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed 
              it is quite a mistake, sir.--We all had our health perfectly well 
              there, never found the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. 
              Wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; 
              and I am sure he may be depended on, for he thoroughly understands 
              the nature of the air, and his own brother and family have been 
              there repeatedly.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.-- 
              Perry was a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best 
              of all the sea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very 
              pure air. And, by what I understand, you might have had lodgings 
              there quite away from the sea--a quarter of a mile off--very comfortable. 
              You should have consulted Perry.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;--only consider 
              how great it would have been.--An hundred miles, perhaps, instead 
              of forty.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing 
              else should be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not 
              much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred.--Better not move 
              at all, better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles 
              to get into a worse air. This is just what Perry said. It seemed 
              to him a very ill-judged measure.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              Emma's attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he had 
              reached such a point as this, she could not wonder at her brother-in-law's 
              breaking out. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Mr. Perry,&quot; said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure, 
              &quot;would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for. 
              Why does he make it any business of his, to wonder at what I do?-- 
              at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another?--I may 
              be allowed, I hope, the use of my judgment as well as Mr. Perry.-- 
              I want his directions no more than his drugs.&quot; He paused-- 
              and growing cooler in a moment, added, with only sarcastic dryness, 
              &quot;If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children 
              a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense 
              or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as willing 
              to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;True, true,&quot; cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready interposition-- 
              &quot;very true. That's a consideration indeed.--But John, as to 
              what I was telling you of my idea of moving the path to Langham, 
              of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the 
              home meadows, I cannot conceive any difficulty. I should not attempt 
              it, if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury 
              people, but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the 
              path. . . . The only way of proving it, however, will be to turn 
              to our maps. I shall see you at the Abbey to-morrow morning I hope, 
              and then we will look them over, and you shall give me your opinion.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on 
              his friend Perry, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously, 
              been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions;-- but 
              the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present 
              evil, and the immediate alertness of one brother, and better recollections 
              of the other, prevented any renewal of it. </p>

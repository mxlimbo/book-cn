            <p align="center">CHAPTER XV</p>
            <p align="center"> </p>
            <p>Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract 
              her ill opinion of Mrs. Elton. Her observation had been pretty correct. 
              Such as Mrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview, such 
              she appeared whenever they met again,--self-important, presuming, 
              familiar, ignorant, and ill-bred. She had a little beauty and a 
              little accomplishment, but so little judgment that she thought herself 
              coming with superior knowledge of the world, to enliven and improve 
              a country neighbourhood; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held 
              such a place in society as Mrs. Elton's consequence only could surpass. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>There was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently 
              from his wife. He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud. He 
              had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman 
              to Highbury, as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal; and the greater 
              part of her new acquaintance, disposed to commend, or not in the 
              habit of judging, following the lead of Miss Bates's good-will, 
              or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as 
              agreeable as she professed herself, were very well satisfied; so 
              that Mrs. Elton's praise passed from one mouth to another as it 
              ought to do, unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse, who readily continued 
              her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being 
              &quot;very pleasant and very elegantly dressed.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>In one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared 
              at first. Her feelings altered towards Emma.--Offended, probably, 
              by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met 
              with, she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold 
              and distant; and though the effect was agreeable, the ill-will which 
              produced it was necessarily increasing Emma's dislike. Her manners, 
              too--and Mr. Elton's, were unpleasant towards Harriet. They were 
              sneering and negligent. Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet's 
              cure; but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk 
              them both very much.--It was not to be doubted that poor Harriet's 
              attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve, and her own 
              share in the story, under a colouring the least favourable to her 
              and the most soothing to him, had in all likelihood been given also. 
              She was, of course, the object of their joint dislike.-- When they 
              had nothing else to say, it must be always easy to begin abusing 
              Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity which they dared not shew in open 
              disrespect to her, found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment 
              of Harriet. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first. 
              Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be 
              supposed to recommend the other, but from the very first; and she 
              was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration-- 
              but without solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting 
              to assist and befriend her.--Before Emma had forfeited her confidence, 
              and about the third time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton's 
              knight-errantry on the subject.-- <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.--I quite 
              rave about Jane Fairfax.--A sweet, interesting creature. So mild 
              and ladylike--and with such talents!--I assure you I think she has 
              very extraordinary talents. I do not scruple to say that she plays 
              extremely well. I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that 
              point. Oh! she is absolutely charming! You will laugh at my warmth--but, 
              upon my word, I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.-- And her situation 
              is so calculated to affect one!--Miss Woodhouse, we must exert ourselves 
              and endeavour to do something for her. We must bring her forward. 
              Such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown.--I dare 
              say you have heard those charming lines of the poet, <br>
            </p>
            <p> `Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, `And waste its fragrance 
              on the desert air.' <br>
            </p>
            <p>We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I cannot think there is any danger of it,&quot; was Emma's 
              calm answer-- &quot;and when you are better acquainted with Miss 
              Fairfax's situation and understand what her home has been, with 
              Colonel and Mrs. Campbell, I have no idea that you will suppose 
              her talents can be unknown.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement, 
              such obscurity, so thrown away.--Whatever advantages she may have 
              enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end! And I think 
              she feels it. I am sure she does. She is very timid and silent. 
              One can see that she feels the want of encouragement. I like her 
              the better for it. I must confess it is a recommendation to me. 
              I am a great advocate for timidity--and I am sure one does not often 
              meet with it.--But in those who are at all inferior, it is extremely 
              prepossessing. Oh! I assure you, Jane Fairfax is a very delightful 
              character, and interests me more than I can express.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You appear to feel a great deal--but I am not aware how you 
              or any of Miss Fairfax's acquaintance here, any of those who have 
              known her longer than yourself, can shew her any other attention 
              than&quot;-- <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those 
              who dare to act. You and I need not be afraid. If we set the example, 
              many will follow it as far as they can; though all have not our 
              situations. We have carriages to fetch and convey her home, and 
              we live in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax, 
              at any time, the least inconvenient.--I should be extremely displeased 
              if Wright were to send us up such a dinner, as could make me regret 
              having asked more than Jane Fairfax to partake of it. I have no 
              idea of that sort of thing. It is not likely that I should, considering 
              what I have been used to. My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, 
              may be quite the other way, in doing too much, and being too careless 
              of expense. Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought 
              to be-- for we do not at all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling, 
              in income.--However, my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane 
              Fairfax.-- I shall certainly have her very often at my house, shall 
              introduce her wherever I can, shall have musical parties to draw 
              out her talents, and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible 
              situation. My acquaintance is so very extensive, that I have little 
              doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly.--I shall introduce 
              her, of course, very particularly to my brother and sister when 
              they come to us. I am sure they will like her extremely; and when 
              she gets a little acquainted with them, her fears will completely 
              wear off, for there really is nothing in the manners of either but 
              what is highly conciliating.--I shall have her very often indeed 
              while they are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a 
              seat for her in the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Poor Jane Fairfax!&quot;--thought Emma.--&quot;You have not 
              deserved this. You may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, 
              but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited!--The 
              kindness and protection of Mrs. Elton!--`Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.' 
              Heavens! Let me not suppose that she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing 
              me!-- But upon my honour, there seems no limits to the licentiousness 
              of that woman's tongue!&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma had not to listen to such paradings again--to any so exclusively 
              addressed to herself--so disgustingly decorated with a &quot;dear 
              Miss Woodhouse.&quot; The change on Mrs. Elton's side soon afterwards 
              appeared, and she was left in peace--neither forced to be the very 
              particular friend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton's guidance, 
              the very active patroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with 
              others in a general way, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, 
              what was done. <br>
            </p>
            <p>She looked on with some amusement.--Miss Bates's gratitude for 
              Mrs. Elton's attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless 
              simplicity and warmth. She was quite one of her worthies-- the most 
              amiable, affable, delightful woman--just as accomplished and condescending 
              as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered. Emma's only surprize was that 
              Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs. Elton 
              as she seemed to do. She heard of her walking with the Eltons, sitting 
              with the Eltons, spending a day with the Eltons! This was astonishing!--She 
              could not have believed it possible that the taste or the pride 
              of Miss Fairfax could endure such society and friendship as the 
              Vicarage had to offer. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;She is a riddle, quite a riddle!&quot; said she.--&quot;To 
              chuse to remain here month after month, under privations of every 
              sort! And now to chuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton's notice 
              and the penury of her conversation, rather than return to the superior 
              companions who have always loved her with such real, generous affection.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells 
              were gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells had 
              promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer, and fresh 
              invitations had arrived for her to join them there. According to 
              Miss Bates--it all came from her--Mrs. Dixon had written most pressingly. 
              Would Jane but go, means were to be found, servants sent, friends 
              contrived--no travelling difficulty allowed to exist; but still 
              she had declined it! <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for 
              refusing this invitation,&quot; was Emma's conclusion. &quot;She 
              must be under some sort of penance, inflicted either by the Campbells 
              or herself. There is great fear, great caution, great resolution 
              somewhere.-- She is not to be with the Dixons. The decree is issued 
              by somebody. But why must she consent to be with the Eltons?--Here 
              is quite a separate puzzle.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject, 
              before the few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston ventured 
              this apology for Jane. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the 
              Vicarage, my dear Emma--but it is better than being always at home. 
              Her aunt is a good creature, but, as a constant companion, must 
              be very tiresome. We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits, before 
              we condemn her taste for what she goes to.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You are right, Mrs. Weston,&quot; said Mr. Knightley warmly, 
              &quot;Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just 
              opinion of Mrs. Elton. Could she have chosen with whom to associate, 
              she would not have chosen her. But (with a reproachful smile at 
              Emma) she receives attentions from Mrs. Elton, which nobody else 
              pays her.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance; and 
              she was herself struck by his warmth. With a faint blush, she presently 
              replied, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Such attentions as Mrs. Elton's, I should have imagined, 
              would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton's invitations 
              I should have imagined any thing but inviting.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I should not wonder,&quot; said Mrs. Weston, &quot;if Miss 
              Fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination, by 
              her aunt's eagerness in accepting Mrs. Elton's civilities for her. 
              Poor Miss Bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried 
              her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense 
              would have dictated, in spite of the very natural wish of a little 
              change.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few 
              minutes silence, he said, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Another thing must be taken into consideration too--Mrs. 
              Elton does not talk to Miss Fairfax as she speaks of her. We all 
              know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou, the 
              plainest spoken amongst us; we all feel the influence of a something 
              beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other-- 
              a something more early implanted. We cannot give any body the disagreeable 
              hints that we may have been very full of the hour before. We feel 
              things differently. And besides the operation of this, as a general 
              principle, you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by 
              her superiority both of mind and manner; and that, face to face, 
              Mrs. Elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim 
              to. Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs. Elton's 
              way before--and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging 
              her own comparative littleness in action, if not in consciousness.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax,&quot; said Emma. 
              Little Henry was in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy 
              made her irresolute what else to say. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Yes,&quot; he replied, &quot;any body may know how highly 
              I think of her.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And yet,&quot; said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch 
              look, but soon stopping--it was better, however, to know the worst 
              at once-- she hurried on--&quot;And yet, perhaps, you may hardly 
              be aware yourself how highly it is. The extent of your admiration 
              may take you by surprize some day or other.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick 
              leather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together, 
              or some other cause, brought the colour into his face, as he answered, 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! are you there?--But you are miserably behindhand. Mr. 
              Cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>He stopped.--Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did 
              not herself know what to think. In a moment he went on-- <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;That will never be, however, I can assure you. Miss Fairfax, 
              I dare say, would not have me if I were to ask her--and I am very 
              sure I shall never ask her.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma returned her friend's pressure with interest; and was pleased 
              enough to exclaim, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You are not vain, Mr. Knightley. I will say that for you.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>He seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful--and in a manner 
              which shewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;No indeed I have not. You have scolded me too much for match-making, 
              for me to presume to take such a liberty with you. What I said just 
              now, meant nothing. One says those sort of things, of course, without 
              any idea of a serious meaning. Oh! no, upon my word I have not the 
              smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body. You 
              would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way, if you 
              were married.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Knightley was thoughtful again. The result of his reverie was, 
              &quot;No, Emma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her 
              will ever take me by surprize.--I never had a thought of her in 
              that way, I assure you.&quot; And soon afterwards, &quot;Jane Fairfax 
              is a very charming young woman--but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect. 
              She has a fault. She has not the open temper which a man would wish 
              for in a wife.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault. &quot;Well,&quot; 
              said she, &quot;and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, very soon. He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he was 
              mistaken; he asked my pardon and said no more. Cole does not want 
              to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to 
              be wiser and wittier than all the world! I wonder how she speaks 
              of the Coles-- what she calls them! How can she find any appellation 
              for them, deep enough in familiar vulgarity? She calls you, Knightley--what 
              can she do for Mr. Cole? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane 
              Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her. Mrs. 
              Weston, your argument weighs most with me. I can much more readily 
              enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates, than 
              I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax's mind over Mrs. Elton. 
              I have no faith in Mrs. Elton's acknowledging herself the inferior 
              in thought, word, or deed; or in her being under any restraint beyond 
              her own scanty rule of good-breeding. I cannot imagine that she 
              will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise, encouragement, 
              and offers of service; that she will not be continually detailing 
              her magnificent intentions, from the procuring her a permanent situation 
              to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which 
              are to take place in the barouche-landau.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Jane Fairfax has feeling,&quot; said Mr. Knightley--&quot;I 
              do not accuse her of want of feeling. Her sensibilities, I suspect, 
              are strong--and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance, 
              patience, self-controul; but it wants openness. She is reserved, 
              more reserved, I think, than she used to be--And I love an open 
              temper. No--till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment, it had 
              never entered my head. I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed with her, 
              with admiration and pleasure always--but with no thought beyond.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, Mrs. Weston,&quot; said Emma triumphantly when he left 
              them, &quot;what do you say now to Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane 
              Fairfax?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied 
              by the idea of not being in love with her, that I should not wonder 
              if it were to end in his being so at last. Do not beat me.&quot;

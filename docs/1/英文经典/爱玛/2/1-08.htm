            <p align="center">CHAPTER VIII<br>
            </p>
            <p>Harriet slept at Hartfield that night. For some weeks past she 
              had been spending more than half her time there, and gradually getting 
              to have a bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma judged it best 
              in every respect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them as much 
              as possible just at present. She was obliged to go the next morning 
              for an hour or two to Mrs. Goddard's, but it was then to be settled 
              that she should return to Hartfield,to make a regular visit of some 
              days. <br>
            </p>
            <p>While she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with 
              Mr. Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made 
              up his mind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer 
              it, and was induced by the entreaties of both, though against the 
              scruples of his own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose. 
              Mr. Knightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering 
              by his short, decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted 
              apologies and civil hesitations of the other. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if 
              you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take 
              Emma's advice and go out for a quarter of an hour. As the sun is 
              out, I believe I had better take my three turns while I can. I treat 
              you without ceremony, Mr. Knightley. We invalids think we are privileged 
              people.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter. Emma will 
              be happy to entertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your 
              excuse and take my three turns--my winter walk.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You cannot do better, sir.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley, 
              but I am a very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you; 
              and, besides, you have another long walk before you, to Donwell 
              Abbey.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; 
              and I think the sooner you go the better. I will fetch your greatcoat 
              and open the garden door for you.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of being 
              immediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined for 
              more chat. He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking of her with 
              more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I cannot rate her beauty as you do,&quot; said he; &quot;but 
              she is a pretty little creature, and I am inclined to think very 
              well of her disposition. Her character depends upon those she is 
              with; but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not 
              be wanting.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Come,&quot; said he, &quot;you are anxious for a compliment, 
              so I will tell you that you have improved her. You have cured her 
              of her school-girl's giggle; she really does you credit.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe 
              I had been of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow 
              praise where they may. You do not often overpower me with it.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Almost every moment. She has been gone longer already than 
              she intended.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Highbury gossips!--Tiresome wretches!&quot; <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would.&quot; 
              Emma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore said 
              nothing. He presently added, with a smile, </p>
            <p>&quot;I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell 
              you that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon 
              hear of something to her advantage.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Indeed! how so? of what sort?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;A very serious sort, I assure you;&quot; still smiling. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Very serious! I can think of but one thing--Who is in love 
              with her? Who makes you their confidant?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton's having dropt a 
              hint. Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and 
              she knew Mr. Elton looked up to him. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I have reason to think,&quot; he replied, &quot;that Harriet 
              Smith will soon have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable 
              quarter:--Robert Martin is the man. Her visit to Abbey-Mill, this 
              summer, seems to have done his business. He is desperately in love 
              and means to marry her.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;He is very obliging,&quot; said Emma; &quot;but is he sure 
              that Harriet means to marry him?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well, well, means to make her an offer then. Will that do? 
              He came to the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me 
              about it. He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his 
              family, and, I believe, considers me as one of his best friends. 
              He came to ask me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him 
              to settle so early; whether I thought her too young: in short, whether 
              I approved his choice altogether; having some apprehension perhaps 
              of her being considered (especially since your making so much of 
              her) as in a line of society above him. I was very much pleased 
              with all that he said. I never hear better sense from any one than 
              Robert Martin. He always speaks to the purpose; open, straightforward, 
              and very well judging. He told me every thing; his circumstances 
              and plans, and what they all proposed doing in the event of his 
              marriage. He is an excellent young man, both as son and brother. 
              I had no hesitation in advising him to marry. He proved to me that 
              he could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he 
              could not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether 
              sent him away very happy. If he had never esteemed my opinion before, 
              he would have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the 
              house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had. This 
              happened the night before last. Now, as we may fairly suppose, he 
              would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and 
              as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely 
              that he should be at Mrs. Goddard's to-day; and she may be detained 
              by a visitor,without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Pray, Mr. Knightley,&quot; said Emma, who had been smiling 
              to herself through a great part of this speech, &quot;how do you 
              know that Mr. Martin did not speak yesterday?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; replied he, surprized, &quot;I do not absolutely 
              know it; but it may be inferred. Was not she the whole day with 
              you?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Come,&quot; said she, &quot;I will tell you something, in 
              return for what you have told me. He did speak yesterday--that is, 
              he wrote, and was refused.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed; and 
              Mr. Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, 
              as he stood up, in tall indignation, and said, <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her.What 
              is the foolish girl about?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! to be sure,&quot; cried Emma, &quot;it is always incomprehensible 
              to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. A 
              man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her.&quot; 
              <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. But what 
              is the meaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness, 
              if it is so; but I hope you are mistaken.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I saw her answer!--nothing could be clearer.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You saw her answer!--you wrote her answer too. Emma, this 
              is your doing. You persuaded her to refuse him.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I 
              should not feel that I had done wrong. Mr. Martin is a very respectable 
              young man, but I cannot admit him to be Harriet's equal; and am 
              rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address 
              her. By your account, he does seem to have had some scruples. It 
              is a pity that they were ever got over.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Not Harriet's equal!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly 
              and warmly; and with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, 
              &quot;No, he is not her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior 
              in sense as in situation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl 
              blinds you. What are Harriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature 
              or education, to any connexion higher than Robert Martin? She is 
              the natural daughter of nobody knows whom, with probably no settled 
              provision at all, and certainly no respectable relations. She is 
              known only as parlour-boarder at a common school. She is not a sensible 
              girl, nor a girl of any information. She has been taught nothing 
              useful, and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing 
              herself. At her age she can have no experience, and with her little 
              wit, is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her. She 
              is pretty, and she is good tempered, and that is all. My only scruple 
              in advising the match was on his account, as being </p>

            <p>The next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again. He came with 
              Mrs. Weston, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially. 
              He had been sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at 
              home, till her usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse 
              their walk, immediately fixed on Highbury.--&quot;He did not doubt 
              there being very pleasant walks in every direction, but if left 
              to him, he should always chuse the same. Highbury, that airy, cheerful, 
              happy-looking Highbury, would be his constant attraction.&quot;-- 
              Highbury, with Mrs. Weston, stood for Hartfield; and she trusted 
              to its bearing the same construction with him. They walked thither 
              directly. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma had hardly expected them: for Mr. Weston, who had called in 
              for half a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome, 
              knew nothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize to 
              her, therefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together,arm 
              in arm. She was wanting to see him again, and especially to see 
              him in company with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom her 
              opinion of him was to depend. If he were deficient there, nothing 
              should make amends for it. But on seeing them together, she became 
              perfectly satisfied. It was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical 
              compliment that he paid his duty; nothing could be more proper or 
              pleasing than his whole manner to her--othing could more agreeably 
              denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her 
              affection. And there was time enough for Emma to form a reasonable 
              judgment, as their visit included all the rest of the morning. They 
              were all three walking about together for an hour or two-- first 
              round the shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwards in Highbury. 
              He was delighted with every thing; admired Hartfield sufficiently 
              for Mr. Woodhouse's ear; and when their going farther was resolved 
              on, confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village, 
              and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than 
              Emma could have supposed. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings. 
              He begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so 
              long, and which had been the home of his father's father; and on 
              recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still living, 
              walked in quest of her cottage from one end of the street to the 
              other; and though in some points of pursuit or observation there 
              was no positive merit, they shewed, altogether, a good-will towards 
              Highbury in general, which must be very like a merit to those he 
              was with. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn, 
              it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily 
              absenting himself; that he had not been acting a part, or making 
              a parade of insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly 
              had not done him justice. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Their first pause was at the Crown Inn, an nconsiderable house, 
              though the principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of 
              post-horses were kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood 
              than from any run on the road; and his companions had not expected 
              to be detained by any interest excited there; but in passing it 
              they gave the history of the large room visibly added; it had been 
              built many years ago for a ball-room, and while the neighbourhood 
              had been in a particularly populous, dancing state, had been occasionally 
              used as such;--but such brilliant days had long passed away, and 
              now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate 
              a whist club established among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen 
              of the place.He was immediately interested. Its character as a ball-room 
              caught him; and instead of passing on, he stopt for several minutes 
              at the two superior sashed windows which were open, to look in and 
              contemplate its capabilities, and lament that its original purpose 
              should have ceased. He saw no fault in the room, he would acknowledge 
              none which they suggested. No, it was long enough, broad enough, 
              handsome enough. It would hold the very number for comfort. They 
              ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter. 
              Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former good old days of the 
              room?--She who could do any thing in Highbury! The want of proper 
              families in the place, and the conviction that none beyond the place 
              and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend, were mentioned; 
              but he was not satisfied. He could not be persuaded that so many 
              good-looking houses as he saw around him, could not furnish numbers 
              enough for such a meeting; and even when particulars were given 
              and families described, he was still unwilling to admit that the 
              inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing, or that there 
              would be the smallest difficulty in every body's returning into 
              their proper place the next morning. He argued like a young man 
              very much bent on dancing; and Emma was rather surprized to see 
              the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedly against the 
              habits of the Churchills. He seemed to have all the life and spirit, 
              cheerful feelings, and social inclinations of his father, and nothing 
              of the pride or reserve of Enscombe. Of pride, indeed, there was, 
              perhaps, scarcely enough; his indifference to a confusion of rank, 
              bordered too much on inelegance of mind. He could be no judge, however, 
              of the evil he was holding cheap. It was but an effusion of lively 
              spirits. <br>
            </p>
            <p>At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown; 
              and being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged, 
              Emma recollected his intended visit the day before, and asked him 
              if he had paid it. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, oh! yes&quot;--he replied; &quot;I was just going to 
              mention it. A very successful visit:--I saw all the three ladies; 
              and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint. If 
              the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize, it must have been 
              the death of me. As it was, I was only betrayed into paying a most 
              unreasonable visit. Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary, 
              perhaps all that was proper; and I had told my father I should certainly 
              be at home before him--but there was no getting away, no pause; 
              and, to my utter astonishment, I found, when he (finding me nowhere 
              else) joined me there at last, that I had been actually sitting 
              with them very nearly three-quarters of an hour. The good lady had 
              not given me the possibility of escape before.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Ill, very ill--that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed 
              to look ill. But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, 
              is it? Ladies can never look ill. And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is 
              naturally so pale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill 
              health.-- A most deplorable want of complexion.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Emma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss 
              Fairfax's complexion. &quot;It was certainly never brilliant, but 
              she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there 
              was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance 
              to the character of her face.&quot; He listened with all due deference; 
              acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same--but yet 
              he must confess, that to him nothing could make amends for the want 
              of the fine glow of health. Where features were indifferent, a fine 
              complexion gave beauty to them all; and where they were good, the 
              effect was--fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the 
              effect was. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Emma, &quot;there is no disputing about 
              taste.--At least you admire her except her complexion.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>He shook his head and laughed.--&quot;I cannot separate Miss Fairfax 
              and her complexion.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Did you see her often at Weymouth? Were you often in the 
              same society?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>At this moment they were approaching Ford's, and he hastily exclaimed, 
              &quot;Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends every 
              day of their lives, as my father informs me. He comes to Highbury 
              himself, he says, six days out of the seven, and has always business 
              at Ford's. If it be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, 
              that I may prove myself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen 
              of Highbury. I must buy something at Ford's. It will be taking out 
              my freedom.-- I dare say they sell gloves.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! yes, gloves and every thing. I do admire your patriotism. 
              You will be adored in Highbury. You were very popular before you 
              came, because you were Mr. Weston's son--but lay out half a guinea 
              at Ford's, and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>They went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of &quot;Men's 
              Beavers&quot; and &quot;York Tan&quot; were bringing down and displaying 
              on the counter, he said--&quot;But I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, 
              you were speaking to me, you were saying something at the very moment 
              of this burst of my amor patriae. Do not let me lose it. I assure 
              you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for 
              the loss of any happiness in private life.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax 
              and her party at Weymouth.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce 
              it to be a very unfair one. It is always the lady's right to decide 
              on the degree of acquaintance. Miss Fairfax must already have given 
              her account.-- I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she 
              may chuse to allow.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself. 
              But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, she 
              is so very reserved, so very unwilling to give the least information 
              about any body, that I really think you may say what you like of 
              your acquaintance with her.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;May I, indeed?--Then I will speak the truth, and nothing 
              suits me so well. I met her frequently at Weymouth. I had known 
              the Campbells a little in town; and at Weymouth we were very much 
              in the same set. Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. 
              Campbell a friendly, warm-hearted woman. I like them all.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You know Miss Fairfax's situation in life, I conclude; what 
              she is destined to be?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes--(rather hesitatingly)--I believe I do.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You get upon delicate subjects, Emma,&quot; said Mrs. Weston 
              smiling; &quot;remember that I am here.--Mr. Frank Churchill hardly 
              knows what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax's situation in 
              life. I will move a little farther off.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I certainly do forget to think of her,&quot; said Emma, &quot;as 
              having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>When the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop again, 
              &quot;Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?&quot; 
              said Frank Churchill. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;Ever hear her!&quot; repeated Emma. &quot;You forget how much 
              she belongs to Highbury. I have heard her every year of our lives 
              since we both began. She plays charmingly.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You think so, do you?--I wanted the opinion of some one who 
              could really judge. She appeared to me to play well, that is, with 
              considerable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.-- I 
              am excessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill or 
              right of judging of any body's performance.--I have been used to 
              hear her's admired; and I remember one proof of her being thought 
              to play well:--a man, a very musical man, and in love with another 
              woman--engaged to her--on the point of marriage-- would yet never 
              ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument, if the lady 
              in question could sit down instead--never seemed to like to hear 
              one if he could hear the other. That, I thought, in a man of known 
              musical talent, was some proof.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Proof indeed!&quot; said Emma, highly amused.--&quot;Mr. 
              Dixon is very musical, is he? We shall know more about them all, 
              in half an hour, from you, than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed 
              in half a year. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I 
              thought it a very strong proof.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Certainly--very strong it was; to own the truth, a great 
              deal stronger than, if I had been Miss Campbell, would have been 
              at all agreeable to me. I could not excuse a man's having more music 
              than love--more ear than eye--a more acute sensibility to fine sounds 
              than to my feelings. How did Miss Campbell appear to like it?&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It was her very particular friend, you know.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Poor comfort!&quot; said Emma, laughing. &quot;One would 
              rather have a stranger preferred than one's very particular friend--with 
              a stranger it might not recur again--but the misery of having a 
              very particular friend always at hand, to do every thing better 
              than one does oneself!-- Poor Mrs. Dixon! Well, I am glad she is 
              gone to settle in Ireland.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You are right. It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell; 
              but she really did not seem to feel it.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;So much the better--or so much the worse:--I do not know 
              which. But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her--quickness 
              of friendship, or dulness of feeling--there was one person, I think, 
              who must have felt it: Miss Fairfax herself. She must have felt 
              the improper and dangerous distinction.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;As to that--I do not--&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax's 
              sensations from you, or from any body else. They are known to no 
              human being, I guess, but herself. But if she continued to play 
              whenever she was asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among 
              them all--&quot; he began rather quickly, but checking himself, 
              added, &quot;however, it is impossible for me to say on what terms 
              they really were-- how it might all be behind the scenes. I can 
              only say that there was smoothness outwardly. But you, who have 
              known Miss Fairfax from a child, must be a better judge of her character, 
              and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations, 
              than I can be.&quot; <br>

            <p>&quot;I have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we have been 
              children and women together; and it is natural to suppose that we 
              should be intimate,--that we should have taken to each other whenever 
              she visited her friends. But we never did. I hardly know how it 
              has happened; a little, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side 
              which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so 
              cried up as she always was, by her aunt and grandmother, and all 
              their set. And then, her reserve--I never could attach myself to 
              any one so completely reserved.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;It is a most repulsive quality, indeed,&quot; said he. &quot;Oftentimes 
              very convenient, no doubt, but never pleasing. There is safety in 
              reserve, but no attraction. One cannot love a reserved person.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the 
              attraction may be the greater. But I must be more in want of a friend, 
              or an agreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take the trouble 
              of conquering any body's reserve to procure one. Intimacy between 
              Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question. I have no reason 
              to think ill of her--not the least--except that such extreme and 
              perpetual cautiousness of word and manner,such a dread of giving 
              a distinct idea about any body, is apt to suggest suspicions of 
              there being something to conceal.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>He perfectly agreed with her: and after walking together so long, 
              and thinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted 
              with him, that she could hardly believe it to be only their second 
              meeting. He was not exactly what she had expected; less of the man 
              of the world in some of his notions, less of the spoiled child of 
              fortune, therefore better than she had expected. His ideas seemed 
              more moderate-- his feelings warmer. She was particularly struck 
              by his manner of considering Mr. Elton's house, which, as well as 
              the church, he would go and look at, and would not join them in 
              finding much fault with. No, he could not believe it a bad house; 
              not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having. If it were 
              to be shared with the woman he loved, he could not think any man 
              to be pitied for having that house. There must be ample room in 
              it for every real comfort. The man must be a blockhead who wanted 
              more. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was talking 
              about. Used only to a large house himself, and without ever thinking 
              how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size, 
              he could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a 
              small one. But Emma, in her own mind, determined that he did know 
              what he was talking about, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination 
              to settle early in life, and to marry, from worthy motives. He might 
              not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by 
              no housekeeper's room, or a bad butler's pantry, but no doubt he 
              did perfectly feel that Enscombe could not make him happy, and that 
              whenever he were attached, he would willingly give up much of wealth 
              to be allowed an early establishment. </p>

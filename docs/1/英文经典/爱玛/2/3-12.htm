              VOLUME III<br>
            </p>
            <p align="center">CHAPTER XII</p>
            <p align="center"> </p>
            <p>Till now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never 
              known how much of her happiness depended on being first with Mr. 
              Knightley, first in interest and affection.--Satisfied that it was 
              so, and feeling it her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection; 
              and only in the dread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly 
            </p>
            <p>important it had been.--Long, very long, she felt she had been 
              first; for, having no female connexions of his own, there had been 
              only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers, and she 
              had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella. 
              She had herself been first with him for many years past. </p>
            <p>She had not deserved it; she had often been negligent or perverse, 
              slighting his advice, or even wilfully opposing him, insensible 
              of half his merits, and quarrelling with him because he would not 
              acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own--but still, 
              from family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of mind, 
              he had loved her, and watched over her from a girl, with an endeavour 
              to improve her, and an anxiety for her doing right, which no other 
              creature had at all shared. In spite of all her faults, she knew 
              she was dear to him; might she not say, very dear?-- When the suggestions 
              of hope, however, which must follow here, presented themselves, 
              she could not presume to indulge them. Harriet Smith might think 
              herself not unworthy of being peculiarly, exclusively, passionately 
              loved by Mr. Knightley. She could not. She could not flatter herself 
              with any idea of blindness in his attachment to her. She had received 
              a very recent proof of its impartiality.-- How shocked had he been 
              by her behaviour to Miss Bates! How directly, how strongly had he 
              expressed himself to her on the subject!--Not too strongly for the 
              offence--but far, far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer 
              than upright justice and clear-sighted goodwill.-- She had no hope, 
              nothing to deserve the name of hope, that he could have that sort 
              of affection for herself which was now in question; but there was 
              a hope (at times a slight one, at times much stronger,) that Harriet 
              might have deceived herself, and be overrating his regard for her.--Wish 
              it she must, for his sake--be the consequence nothing to herself, 
              but his remaining single all his life. Could she be secure of that, 
              indeed, of his never marrying at all, she believed she should be 
              perfectly satisfied.--Let him but continue the same Mr. Knightley 
              to her and her father, the same Mr. Knightley to all the world; 
              let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse 
              of friendship and confidence, and her peace would be fully secured.--Marriage, 
              in fact, would not do for her. It would be incompatible with what 
              she owed to her father, and with what she felt for him. Nothing 
              should separate her from her father. She would not marry, even if 
              she were asked by Mr. Knightley. <br>
            </p>
            <p>It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed; 
              and she hoped, that when able to see them together again, she might 
              at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She 
              should see them henceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly 
              as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching, she 
              did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here.-- He was 
              expected back every day. The power of observation would be soon 
              given--frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one 
              course. In the meanwhile, she resolved against seeing Harriet.-- 
              It would do neither of them good, it would do the subject no good, 
              to be talking of it farther.--She was resolved not to be convinced, 
              as long as she could doubt, and yet had no authority for opposing 
              Harriet's confidence. To talk would be only to irritate.--She wrote 
              to her, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to beg that she would 
              not, at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it to be her conviction, 
              that all farther confidential discussion of one topic had better 
              be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were allowed to pass 
              before they met again, except in the company of others--she objected 
              only to a tete-a-tete--they might be able to act as if they had 
              forgotten the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted, and 
              approved, and was grateful. <br>
            </p>
            <p>This point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma's 
              thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them, 
              sleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours--Mrs. Weston, who 
              had been calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield 
              in her way home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to 
              herself, to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates's, and gone through 
              his share of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having 
              then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned 
              with much more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction, than 
              a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates's parlour, with all the 
              encumbrance of awkward feelings, could have afforded. <br>
            </p>
            <p>A little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while 
              her friend related. Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in 
              a good deal of agitation herself; and in the first place had wished 
              not to go at all at present, to be allowed merely to write to Miss 
              Fairfax instead, and to defer this ceremonious call till a little 
              time had passed, and Mr. Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement's 
              becoming known; as, considering every thing, she thought such a 
              visit could not be paid without leading to reports:-- but Mr. Weston 
              had thought differently; he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation 
              to Miss Fairfax and her family, and did not conceive that any suspicion 
              could be excited by it; or if it were, that it would be of any consequence; 
              for &quot;such things,&quot; he observed, &quot;always got about.&quot; 
              Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston had very good reason for saying 
              so. They had gone, in short--and very great had been the evident 
              distress and confusion of the lady. She had hardly been able to 
              speak a word, and every look and action had shewn how deeply she 
              was suffering from consciousness. The quiet, heart-felt satisfaction 
              of the old lady, and the rapturous delight of her daughter--who 
              proved even too joyous to talk as usual, had been a gratifying, 
              yet almost an affecting, scene. They were both so truly respectable 
              in their happiness, so disinterested in every sensation; thought 
              so much of Jane; so much of every body, and so little of themselves, 
              that every kindly feeling was at work for them. Miss Fairfax's recent 
              illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs. Weston to invite her to 
              an airing; she had drawn back and declined at first, but, on being 
              pressed had yielded; and, in the course of their drive, Mrs. Weston 
              had, by gentle encouragement, overcome so much of her embarrassment, 
              as to bring her to converse on the important subject. Apologies 
              for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception, and 
              the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling 
              towards herself and Mr. Weston, must necessarily open the cause; 
              but when these effusions were put by, they had talked a good deal 
              of the present and of the future state of the engagement. Mrs. Weston 
              was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief 
              to her companion, pent up within her own mind as every thing had 
              so long been, and was very much pleased with all that she had said 
              on the subject. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;On the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment 
              of so many months,&quot; continued Mrs. Weston, &quot;she was energetic. 
              This was one of her expressions. `I will not say, that since I entered 
              into the engagement I have not had some happy moments; but I can 
              say, that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'-- 
              and the quivering lip, Emma, which uttered it, was an attestation 
              that I felt at my heart.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Poor girl!&quot; said Emma. &quot;She thinks herself wrong, 
              then, for having consented to a private engagement?&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Wrong! No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is 
              disposed to blame herself. `The consequence,' said she, `has been 
              a state of perpetual suffering to me; and so it ought. But after 
              all the punishment that misconduct can bring, it is still not less 
              misconduct. Pain is no expiation. I never can be blameless. I have 
              been acting contrary to all my sense of right; and the fortunate 
              turn that every thing has taken, and the kindness I am now receiving, 
              is what my conscience tells me ought not to be.' `Do not imagine, 
              madam,' she continued, `that I was taught wrong. Do not let any 
              reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who 
              brought me up. The error has been all my own; and I do assure you 
              that, with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear 
              to give, I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell.'&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Poor girl!&quot; said Emma again. &quot;She loves him then 
              excessively, I suppose. It must have been from attachment only, 
              that she could be led to form the engagement. Her affection must 
              have overpowered her judgment.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him.&quot; 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;I am afraid,&quot; returned Emma, sighing, &quot;that I must 
              often have contributed to make her unhappy.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;On your side, my love, it was very innocently done. But she 
              probably had something of that in her thoughts, when alluding to 
              the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before. One 
              natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in,&quot; 
              she said, &quot;was that of making her unreasonable. The consciousness 
              of having done amiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes,and 
              made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been-- 
              that had been--hard for him to bear. `I did not make the allowances,' 
              said she, `which I ought to have done, for his temper and spirits--his 
              delightful spirits, and that gaiety, that playfulness of disposition, 
              which, under any other circumstances, would, I am sure, have been 
              as constantly bewitching to me, as they were at first.' She then 
              began to speak of you, and of the great kindness you had shewn her 
              during her illness; and with a blush which shewed me how it was 
              all connected, desired me, whenever I had an opportunity, to thank 
              you--I could not thank you too much--for every wish and every endeavour 
              to do her good. She was sensible that you had never received any 
              proper acknowledgment from herself.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;If I did not know her to be happy now,&quot; said Emma, seriously, 
              &quot;which, in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous 
              conscience, she must be, I could not bear these thanks;--for, oh! 
              Mrs. Weston, if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the 
              good I have done Miss Fairfax!--Well (checking herself,and trying 
              to be more lively), this is all to be forgotten. You are very kind 
              to bring me these interesting particulars. They shew her to the 
              greatest advantage. I am sure she is very good-- I hope she will 
              be very happy. It is fit that the fortune should be on his side, 
              for I think the merit will be all on hers.&quot; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston. She 
              thought well of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more, 
              she loved him very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest. 
              She talked with a great deal of reason, and at least equal affection-- 
              but she had too much to urge for Emma's attention; it was soon gone 
              to Brunswick Square or to Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen; 
              and when Mrs. Weston ended with, &quot;We have not yet had the letter 
              we are so anxious for, you know, but I hope it will soon come,&quot; 
              she was obliged to pause before she answered, and at last obliged 
              to answer at random, before she could at all recollect what letter 
              it was which they were so anxious for. <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Are you well, my Emma?&quot; was Mrs. Weston's parting question. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Oh! perfectly. I am always well, you know. Be sure to give 
              me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible.&quot; <br>
              <br>
              Mrs. Weston's communications furnished Emma with more food for unpleasant 
              reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion, and her sense 
              of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax. She bitterly regretted not 
              having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed for the 
              envious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure, the 
              cause. Had she followed Mr. Knightley's known wishes, in paying 
              that attention to Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had 
              she tried to know her better; had she done her part towards intimacy; 
              had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet 
              Smith; she must, in all probability, have been spared from every 
              pain which pressed on her now.--Birth, abilities, and education, 
              had been equally marking one as an associate for her, to be received 
              with gratitude; and the other--what was she?--Supposing even that 
              they had never become intimate friends; that she had never been 
              admitted into Miss Fairfax's confidence on this important matter-- 
              which was most probable--still, in knowing her as she ought, and 
              as she might, she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions 
              of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had not only so 
              foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so unpardonably 
              imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject 
              of material distress to the delicacy of Jane's feelings, by the 
              levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill's. Of all the sources 
              of evil surrounding the former, since her coming to Highbury, she 
              was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst. She must 
              have been a perpetual enemy. They never could have been all three 
              together, without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax's peace in a thousand 
              instances; and on Box Hill, perhaps, it had been the agony of a 
              mind that would bear no more. </p>
            <p>The evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield. 
              The weather added what it could of gloom. A cold stormy rain set 
              in, and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which 
              the wind was despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made 
              such cruel sights the longer visible. <br>
              <br>
              The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he could only be kept tolerably 
              comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter's side, 
              and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before. It 
              reminded her of their first forlorn tete-a-tete, on the evening 
              of Mrs. Weston's wedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked in then, 
              soon after tea, and dissipated every melancholy fancy. Alas! such 
              delightful proofs of Hartfield's attraction, as those sort of visits 
              conveyed, might shortly be over. The picture which she had then 
              drawn of the privations of the approaching winter, had proved erroneous; 
              no friends had deserted them, no pleasures had been lost.--But her 
              present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction. 
              The prospect before her now, was threatening to a degree that could 
              not be entirely dispelled-- that might not be even partially brightened. 
              If all took place that might take place among the circle of her 
              friends, Hartfield must be comparatively deserted; and she left 
              to cheer her father with the spirits only of ruined happiness. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer 
              than herself; and Mrs. Weston's heart and time would be occupied 
              by it. They should lose her; and, probably, in great measure, her 
              husband also.--Frank Churchill would return among them no more; 
              and Miss Fairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease 
              to belong to Highbury. They would be married, and settled either 
              at or near Enscombe. All that were good would be withdrawn; and 
              if to these losses, the loss of Donwell were to be added, what would 
              remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach? Mr. 
              Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort!-- 
              No longer walking in at all hours, as if ever willing to change 
              his own home for their's!--How was it to be endured? And if he were 
              to be lost to them for Harriet's sake; if he were to be thought 
              of hereafter, as finding in Harriet's society all that he wanted; 
              if Harriet were to be the chosen, the first, the dearest, the friend, 
              the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence; 
              what could be increasing Emma's wretchedness but the reflection 
              never far distant from her mind, that it had been all her own work?

              <br>
              When it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrain 
              from a start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room 
              for a few seconds--and the only source whence any thing like consolation 
              or composure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own better 
              conduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and gaiety 
              might be the following and every future winter of her life to the 
              past, it would yet find her more rational, more acquainted with 
              herself, and leave her less to regret when it were gone. </p>

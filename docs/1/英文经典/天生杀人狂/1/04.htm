              Mickey and Mallory's idea of an armed robbery was a little different 
              than most. It was an assault, actually.</p>

            <p>BISHOP<br>
              Well. I knew that Mickey and Mallory kill everybody when they're 
              through, except for one clerk. There were a couple of people in 
              the store then, and I was working with Stevo. And I like Stevo, 
              you know? But I was thinking, what could I do to make them pick 
              me to be the clerk that gets to live?</p>

            <p>Mallory BLASTS a FEMALE CUSTOMER who lies on the ground screaming.</p>

              Money! Money! Money! Fast! Fast! Faster! Faster! Faster than that!</p>

              boxes and wearing a walkman.</p>

              what renaissance psychopaths they really are. To break up the monotony 
              in between bank jobs, or what have you, they started butchering

              The Mickey and Mallory Knox murder trial was so event filled it 
              made the crime spree that took place before pale by comparison. 
              The first point was the decision of Mickey's to act as his own council. 
              Now this in itself is not unheard of, for instance, Ted Bundy acted 
              as his own council as well. What was unexpected was how well Mickey's 
              performance would be.</p>

            <p>WAYNE (V.O.)<br>
              We spoke with Burt Steinsma, who was the presiding judge during 
              the Knox trial.</p>
            <p>JUDGE STEINSMA<br>
              Mickey was surprisingly effective. When I was told I was to be the 
              judge of this trial and then I was told Mickey Knox would be handling 
              his own defense, I got a headache that lasted five days. But at 
              first I breathed a sigh of relief. Mickey showed up very prepared, 
              and proved to be an excellent amateur lawyer.</p>

            <p>Interview with state prosecutor WANDA BISBING, an attractive woman 
              in her forties.</p>
            <p>WAYNE (V.O.)<br>
              However, this opinion isn't shared by the state's prosecutor on 
              this case, Wanda Bisbing.</p>
            <p>Wayne's with Bisbing</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Judge Steinsma said that Mickey showed up very prepared and proved 
              to be an excellent amateur attorney.</p>
            <p>BISBING<br>
              Oh, that's rich. Well, considering that Mickey Knox turn his court 
              into a mockery and personally made him look like a fool, I'd say 
              that's very benevolent of Judge Steinsma. As far as Mickey being 
              an excellent amateur lawyer, maybe I'm old fashioned, but when I 
              went to law school, we were taught the object was to win the case, 
              which I did.</p>

              attorney became apparent. Law students from all ends of the country 
              converged on Los Angeles as legal history took a new course. But

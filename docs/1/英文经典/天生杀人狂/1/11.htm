              INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY</p>
            <p>CAMERA is inside a holding cell fixed on the cell door. The cell 
              door is unlocked, then opened. The two deputies bring Mallory inside. 
              Scagnetti wanders in, trailing behind.</p>
            <p>Bingham pumps his shotgun slide and places the barrel next to Mallory's 
              head. Washington unlocks the cuffs around Mallory's wrists.</p>
            <p>Mallory's silent.</p>
            <p>Scagnetti leans up against the wall, smoking his cigarette.</p>
            <p>BINGHAM<br>
              Turn around and face the wall!</p>
            <p>Mallory does.</p>
            <p>Bingham and Washington move to the door.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              Wait outside for a second, fellas.</p>
            <p>BINGHAM<br>
              We're not supposed -</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              Don't worry about it.</p>
            <p>Bingham and Washington move outside.</p>
            <p>Scagnetti takes out his gun and tosses it to Washington. Before 
              they can protest, Scagnetti closes the door.</p>
            <p>Mallory stands in the middle of the cell, motionless, her back 
              to him.</p>
            <p>Scagnetti walks up behind her.</p>
            <p>Mallory doesn't move.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              Want a smoke?</p>
            <p>Mallory's steel eyes glare at Scagnetti.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              C'mon, I already lit one for you. I know you smoke.</p>
            <p>Mallory doesn't respond. Scagnetti takes the cigarette from his 
              mouth and puts it between Mallory's lips. Hold on CLOSEUP of Mallory.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              I was reading the file on you. You know what it said during your 
              trial, whenever they put you on the stand, no matter what they asked, 
              your answer was always the same... &quot;I love Mickey.&quot; It 
              also says that when they gave you a polygraph, &quot;I love Mickey&quot; 
              was the only thing you said that registered as the truth.</p>
            <p>Scagnetti appears at the side of frame next to Mallory.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              Who are you supposed to be? Squeaky Fromme? Is that it? Is Mickey 
              your Charles Manson? Is Mickey Jesus? Is that the attraction? Or 
              does he just got a big dick?</p>
            <p>Scagnetti changes to Mallory's other ear.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              That's it, isn't it? Mickey's got a big donkey dick.</p>
            <p>Scagnetti presses closer.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              Can you remember the last time you fucked? Huh? What I want you 
              to do is close your eyes and remember... remember the last time 
              ol' Mickey gave you the high hard one. Are ya thinkin' about it? 
              Good. Remember it. Don't ever forget it cause it ain't never gonna 
              happen again. Cause when they get through with all that electroshock 
              shit they got lined up for you two, Mick's dick ain't gonna be worth 
              shit.</p>
            <p>Mallory spits the lit cigarette unto Scagnetti's face. Scagnetti 
              spins her around and slaps her.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              Look. You're gonna sit here for a couple hours while I finish up 
              the arrangements. The reason they picked me to be your chaperone 
              is they know I won't hesitate to put a bullet in you.</p>
            <p>Scagnetti has Mallory clutched tightly by her shoulders.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              So, during our journey, if any wild hairs spring up on your ass, 
              you'd better slap a muzzle on 'em! Fuck with me, bitch, even a little 
              bit, you're gonna get accidentally shot! Comprehende?</p>
            <p>Mallory looks at him for a moment, then gives his a massive HEAD 
              BUTT. As we hear the CRACKING of his nose, Scagnetti lets out a 
              horrible scream.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. HOLDING CELL - DAY</p>
            <p>Bingham and Washington fumble with the keys to open the cell door.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY</p>
            <p>Bingham and Washington burst through the door to find Scagnetti 
              face down on the ground.</p>
            <p>Mallory's standing, her foot pressed against the middle of Scagnetti's 
              back, pulling his arms behind him trying to break his back. His 
              body is bending like a branch, and he's screaming.</p>
            <p>The two deputies proceed to BEAT the shit out of her with their 
              shotguns.</p>
            <p>Scagnetti rolls around in the BACKGROUND, holding his bloody nose, 
              screaming.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              She broke my fucking nose! That bitch broke my nose!</p>
            <p>Washington comes over to him and helps him up.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              (blood down his face)<br>
              She broke my nose.</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON<br>
              I'll fix it.</p>
            <p>He grabs Scagnetti's nose, then SNAPS it back into place. Scagnetti 
              lets out another horrible scream, and hops up and down from the 
              pain.</p>
            <p>When the rush of pain passes, Scagnetti brings his hands down from 
              his face, looking over at Mallory.</p>
            <p>Bingham has Mallory in the corner of the cell with the shotgun 
              barrel placed in her mouth.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP on Scagnetti. He's a hand grenade with the pin pulled.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              Hold her, boys.</p>
            <p>Scagnetti walks to the corner where Mallory is. The shotgun barrels' 
              out of her mouth. Bingham and Washington stand on either side of 
              her, holding her in place.</p>
            <p>Scagnetti grabs a can of mace from Washington's belt, and brings 
              it up to Mallory's face.</p>
            <p>Mallory and Scagnetti trade looks.</p>
            <p>Scagnetti gives her an intense blast of mace right in the face, 
              eyes, and all over her body.</p>
            <p>Mallory crumples to the floor, screaming in agony.</p>
            <p>TWO SHOT of Bingham and Washington looking down at Mallory on the 
              ground. We can hear Scagnetti still spraying her. They can't look 
              at this anymore.</p>
            <p>Mallory wiggles on the floor as Scagnetti continues spraying her 
              all over her body.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Scagnetti's bloody face smiling. We hear the SOUND of 
              the can of mace running empty. It spurts to a stop.</p>
            <p>Scagnetti rises up to the two deputies. He hands the empty can 
              back to Washington.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              I want this filled before we leave.</p>
            <p>The three men walk out of the holding cell, closing and locking 
              the door behind them. We can still hear Mallory's screams of excruciating 
              pain.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p>Mickey's sitting in a chair eating a donut. Roger's attaching a 
              microphone to his shirt. Unruly Julie's applying make-up to Mickey's 
              face.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              (to Unruly Julie)<br>
              How come you never talk?</p>
            <p>ROGER<br>
              She was born without a tongue.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              (repulsed)<br>
              Oh my God!<br>
              (to Unruly Julie)<br>
              Sorry.</p>
            <p>Unruly Julie shrugs her shoulders like &quot;what are you gonna 
              do&quot; and continues applying make-up.</p>
            <p>Wayne and Wurlitzer talk.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              So we got a deal. Four deputies -</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              And me.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Why don't we make it three deputies and you?</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget 
              the whole thing?</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're 
              about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              Don't call 'em assholes.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              I didn't mean they were assholes. I mean if they're leaving, get 
              'em outta here.</p>
            <p>Wayne leaves Wurlitzer and goes over to Scott, who's setting up 
              a light stand.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Okay, Scotty, we're stuck with four of these assholes. Now I want 
              to create the illusion that this is just Mickey and I chewin' the 
              fat all by ourselves. So make sure you don't film these assholes. 
              I don't want to see 'em on film ever. Oh, and &quot;Live at Five&quot; 
              slated our spot as human interest which means we'll go live at just 
              after five-thirty.</p>
            <p>Wayne exits to reveal Mickey in background.</p>
            <p>Wurlitzer's speaking with his four deputies.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              This asshole's tryin' to tell me what I'm gonna do in my jail. Fuck 
              him! This nanderfuck doesn't know what he's dealin' with here, but 
              we do. And if shit happens, he ain't gonna be responsible, we are. 
              So keep your shotguns out, your fingers on the triggers, and be 
              ready to fire at a moment's notice.</p>
            <p>BACK TO: </p>
            <p><br>
              MICKEY</p>
            <p>Alone in FRAME, sitting in a chair and eating a donut. He takes 
              a big bite.</p>
            <p>ROGER<br>
              Say something.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              (mouthful of donut)<br>
              What?</p>
            <p>ROGER<br>
              Anything.</p>
            <p>Mickey swallows the bite of donut, pauses, then recites a poem.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              (talking in rhyme)<br>
              I stand amid the roar<br>
              Of a surf tormented shore,<br>
              As I hold within my hand<br>
              Grains of the golden sand -<br>
              How few! yet how they creep<br>
              Through my fingers to the deep,<br>
              While I weep - while I weep!<br>
              O God! can I not save<br>
              One from the pitiless wave?<br>
              Is all that we see or seem<br>
              But a dream within a dream?</p>
            <p>Mickey bites into the donut.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              (mouthful of donut)<br>
              How was that?</p>
            <p>Roger joins him in FRAME and adjusts the mike.</p>
            <p>ROGER<br>
              Ah... fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to 
              rock 'n roll. Oh... uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate 
              cream filled I asked for in your box.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              There's a chocolate cream filled in there?</p>
            <p>ROGER<br>
              Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Tough titty, it's mine now.</p>
            <p>ROGER<br>
              Look, I'll trade you.</p>
            <p>Wayne enters frame.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop 
              bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.</p>
            <p>ROGER<br>
              (to himself)<br>
              Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial 
              killer.</p>
            <p>Roger exits FRAME.</p>
            <p>Wayne grabs a chair and sets it in front of Mickey.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Sorry about that.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Don't worry about it.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Let's do it.</p>
            <p>Wayne smiles and exits FRAME.</p>
            <p>WAYNE (O.S.)<br>
              Okay people! Let's start to settle down here.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>

              INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p>16mm - BLACK &amp; WHITE</p>
            <p>SCENE is now SHOT through Scott's CAMERA which holds a EXTREME 
              CLOSEUP of Mickey's eye.</p>
            <p>CAMERA focuses then pulls out to include his whole face.</p>
            <p>WAYNE (O.S.)<br>
              Are you comfortable?</p>
            <p>Mickey looks to Wayne OFF SCREEN and nods.</p>
            <p>WAYNE (O.S.)<br>
              Roger?</p>
            <p>ROGER (O.S.)<br>
              Rockin'!</p>
            <p>WAYNE (O.S.)<br>

            <p>WAYNE (O.S.)<br>
              Slate it.</p>
            <p>CAMERA SLATE reading &quot;KNOX INTERVIEW - ROLL #1&quot; is thrust 
              into view and clapped. The CAMERA ZOOMS out to include Wayne in 
              the FRAME.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Aside from the obvious?</p>
            <p>Mickey breaks out laughing.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              (not amused)<br>
              Yes. Aside from the obvious.</p>
            <p>Mickey's laughing slowly runs its course.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Okay, let me see now. What do I do for fun?<br>
              (to people O.S.)<br>
              Does anybody got a smoke? You guys are drivin' me crazy with your 
              cigarettes.<br>
              (to camera)<br>
              Sorry out there in TV land. I'm just sittin' here lookin'' at these 
              deputies smokin' up a storm, and it's really doin' it to me.</p>
            <p>A deputy comes into FRAME, hands Mickey a cigarette, then lights 
              it. Deputy exits FRAME.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do 
              for fun or what I did for fun?</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              What I did for fun for starters.<br>
              (thinking)<br>
              Well, something I used to do... always was a lot of fun... <br>
              (pause)<br>
              No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't 
              we come back to that question. Ask me something else.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Do you miss Mallory?</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in 
              a long time. What a stupid question.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Then was it worth it?</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Was what worth it?</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your 
              wife for the rest of your life?</p>
            <p>Mickey takes a drag from his cigarette.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tonge?</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the 
              question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory 
              in a year. Was it worth it?</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant 
              of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's 
              only the chorus, it's not the whole song.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              (passionately)<br>
              Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't 
              live without in five year old Danny Hillhouse's blown off head? 
              Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this 
              planet because they me you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about 
              that?</p>
            <p>CAMERA ZOOMS in on Mickey's face. Mickey looks at Wayne, takes 
              a slow drag off his cigarette.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Where the purity comes into play -</p>
            <p>The image on the SCREEN starts to flutter, and the jams.</p>
            <p>WHITE LEADER fills the SCREEN.</p>
            <p>SCOTT (V.O.)<br>
              Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.</p>
            <p>WAYNE (V.O.)<br>
              Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!</p>

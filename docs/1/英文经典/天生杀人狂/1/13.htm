              INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p>SHOT through Scott's CAMERA:</p>
            <p>FOCUSING on Mickey, who's standing in a MEDIUM SHOT.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?</p>
            <p>WAYNE (O.S.)<br>
              Sure.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty funny. It's a Little Johnny 
              joke. Now in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk. And Little Johnny's 
              teenage sister asks her mother if she can go out on a date.</p>
            <p>As Mickey tells this joke, he moves around the room. Scott's CAMERA 
              follows.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              The mother asks, 'Where's he taking you?' The sister says, 'The 
              drive-in movie.' The mother tells her she can only go if she takes 
              Little Johnny with her. She says okay. They go to the drive-in, 
              they come back. The mother gets Little Johnny and says, 'Okay, what 
              happened? Where did ya go?'</p>
            <p>Mickey, as Little Johnny, draws a square in the air, and acts like 
              he's driving.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Mother says, 'The drive-in movie. What did they do?'</p>
            <p>Mickey, as Little Johnny, acts like he's kissing.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              'They kissed. What else?'</p>
            <p>Mickey, as Little Johnny, starts squeezing imaginary breasts.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              'He felt her up? What else?'</p>
            <p>Mickey , as Little Johnny, act like he's undressing.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              (dumbfounded)<br>
              'They took off their clothes? What else?'</p>
            <p>Mickey, as Little Johnny, vigorously acts as if he's having sex.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              'They did it? What were you doing?'</p>
            <p>Mickey, as Little Johnny, vigorously acts as if he's jacking off.</p>
            <p>Everyone in the room breaks up. Wayne, the boys, the deputies, 
              even Scagnetti cracks a smile.</p>
            <p>As Mickey was telling the joke, he stopped in front of Deputy #4 
              during the punchline.</p>
            <p>While everybody's laughing, Mickey SLAMS his elbow in Deputy #4's 
              face. Mickey grabs hold of the shotgun, rips it from Deputy #4's 
              grasp, then BASHES him in the face tree times with the butt.</p>
            <p>Deputy #4 drops, ugly and unconscious.</p>
            <p>Scott's CAMERA goes wild.</p>
            <p><br>
              BACK TO: COLOR 35MM</p>
            <p>The other deputies react.</p>
            <p>Mickey pumps the shotgun slide and shoots, hitting Deputy #5 in 
              the chest, BLOWING him off his feet. He lands on his back with a 
              THUD.</p>
            <p>Deputy #3 raises his shotgun. Mickey drops to a crouching position 
              and FIRES, BLASTING Deputy #3 in the groin.</p>
            <p>Deputy #3 crumples into the wall, FIRING his gun - SLOW MOTION.</p>
            <p>The stray bullet THUNKS Scott right in the chest, BLOWING him out 
              of FRAME.</p>
            <p>Deputy #3 drops to the floor, FIRING his shotgun straight up - 
              SLOW MOTION.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of ceiling being BLASTED.</p>
            <p>Chunks of plaster and rock rain down on Sheriff #3.</p>
            <p>Scagnetti has whipped out his gun and is bringing it up to fire 
              - SLOW MOTION.</p>
            <p>Mickey, still crouched down, spins around toward Scagnetti - SLOW 
              MOTION.</p>
            <p>Scagnetti has his gun aimed at Mickey.</p>
            <p>Squatting, Mickey has the shotgun trained on Scagnetti.</p>
            <p>They're positioned across from each other on opposite sides of 
              the room.</p>
            <p>Nobody fires.</p>
            <p>We DOLLY past the faces of both Wayne and Roger, who are flat on 
              the ground, scared to death.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP on Scagnetti's face.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP on Mickey's face.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP on Scagnetti's finger putting pressure on the trigger, 
              then CAMERA moves up to a CLOSEUP profile of his face.</p>
            <p>OVERHEAD SHOT of Mickey. CAMERA moves down in front of him into 
              a CLOSEUP on his face.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Looks like we go a Mexican standoff.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put 
              your forehead on the floor.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between 
              the eyes.</p>
            <p>Mickey rises.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              If you don't drop that toy, I'm blowin' you in half on three. So, 
              if you got me locked, take the shot. One... </p>
            <p>DOLLY in on Scagnetti's gun in foreground, past the gun, to his 
              face.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of barrel of shotgun.</p>
            <p>MICKEY (O.S.)<br>
              Two... </p>
            <p>DOLLY continues closing in on Scagnetti's face.</p>
            <p>Wayne watches, wide eyed.</p>
            <p>EXTREME CLOSEUP on Mickey's face.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Three!</p>
            <p>MEDIUM SHOT on Scagnetti.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              Hold it! Don't shoot!</p>
            <p>He CLICKS the hammer back into place on his gun, then points the 
              gun up.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Open the chamber. Empty the shells.</p>
            <p>Scagnetti does. The shells fall out.</p>
            <p>The shells fall on the floor at Scagnetti's feet - SLOW MOTION.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Toss it.</p>
            <p>Scagnetti does.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Now put your hands behind your head.</p>
            <p>Scagnetti does.</p>
            <p>Mickey, holding the shotgun, walks up to Scagnetti. They stand, 
              facing each other.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Did you ever see &quot;Eldorado?&quot;</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              What?</p>
            <p>Mickey CLOUTS him across the face with the shotgun. Scagnetti hits 
              the ground. Blood coughs from his broken nose.</p>
            <p>Mickey looks at Wayne and Roger on the ground.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              You guys stay on your bellies.</p>
            <p>ROGER<br>
              Yes, sir.</p>
            <p>Mickey bends over Scagnetti and takes hold of his right hand.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              I am the most dangerous man in the world.</p>
            <p>Mickey SNAPS the trigger finger on Scagnetti's right hand.</p>
            <p>Scagnetti screams.</p>
            <p>Mickey's still bent over Scagnetti.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              (points at Scagnetti)<br>
              You're the law.<br>
              (points at himself)<br>
              I'm the law breaker.</p>
            <p>Scagnetti's not going to give Mickey and more trouble.</p>
            <p>Mickey stands straight, looks toward Wayne and Roger.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Scott's dead. And unless you wanna play follow the leader, shut 
              up and do as you're told.</p>
            <p>Roger's checking the camera. He turns on the motor. It sounds like 
              a lawn mower.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              How is it?</p>
            <p>ROGER<br>
              Not good.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Do you have a back up.</p>
            <p>ROGER<br>
              It's video.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Even better. Wayne call your station, tell 'em we're going live 
              a little early today. Make it happen!</p>

              INT. JAIL LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p>Wurlitzer steps into the BLACK FRAME. This SCENE becomes a TRAVELLING 
              CLOSEUP that never leaves Wurlitzer. Although we'll only see Wurlitzer, 
              we can make out activity in the edges of the FRAME and we can vividly 
              hear the SOUNDS of chaos around us.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              I want two men stationed in that tier, and I want men with rifles 
              all along the walkway.</p>

            <p>Wurlitzer walks over to a table and looks down.</p>
            <p>PITNEY (O.S.)<br>
              Here's the layout of the laundry room.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              Where do the air ducts lead?</p>
            <p>PITNEY (O.S.)<br>
              Here.</p>
            <p>SMITHY (O.S.)<br>
              Problem is they'll hear somebody approaching that way.</p>
            <p>PITNEY (O.S.)<br>
              We turned off the power when they took over the room.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              We turn it back on. The machines go back on supplying us with the 
              cover noise we need. Smithy, do it.</p>
            <p>SMITHY (O.S.)<br>
              Right away, Capt'n.</p>
            <p>CAMERA follows Wurlitzer as he heads another direction.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              Jonesy, are the sharpshooters in place?</p>
            <p>JONESY (O.S.)<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              You sure?</p>
            <p>JONESY (O.S.)<br>
              I think -</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              Never say you think when you know, or you know when you think.</p>
            <p>Wurlitzer snatches a walkie talkie.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              (into walkie talkie)<br>
              Bergman, you in place?</p>
            <p>BERGMAN (O.S.)<br>
              (from walkie talkie)<br>
              Sure am, Capt'n. Nothin' clean yet.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              (into walkie talkie)<br>
              Pass this to your team... the second they get a lock on a blue, 
              they're to take the shot. Do you understand?</p>
            <p>BERGMAN (O.S.)<br>
              (from walkie talkie)<br>
              That's a big ten-four, Capt'n.</p>
            <p>Wurlitzer looks to his right.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that 
              they really have in there?</p>
            <p>PITNEY (O.S.)<br>
              It's hard to say Capt'n.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              Take a wild stab!</p>
            <p>PITNEY (O.S.)<br>
              I'll say enough to destroy this wing.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              The entire wing?</p>
            <p>PITNEY (O.S.)<br>
              That's my opinion.</p>

              INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p>Wayne and his crew have set up in the food supply room off from 
              the cafeteria. Being big, roomy, and unpopulated, it's perfect for 
              an interview. There's eight L.A. County DEPUTY SHERIFFS around the 
              room along with Wurlitzer. Roger's setting up his sound equipment 
              while Unruly Julie is checking her notebook.</p>
            <p>Wurlitzer and a few Deputies talk among themselves. CAMERA moves 
              from person to person without cutting.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              (to two Deputies)<br>
              This is just for an interview, I was on the set of `Dukes of Hazzard' 
              once. It was a much bigger deal than this. They had a crew of maybe 
              seventy-five people.</p>
            <p>CAMERA moves to Wayne and Scott.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              We're gonna be talking over here. But I want enough freedom so if 
              I wanna get up and move around, we can.</p>
            <p>Wayne grabs Scott and walks him to the left.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Take him and walk him over this way.<br>
              (pretending Scott's Mickey)<br>
              So, Mickey, killing Mallory's parents, what the hell was that all 
              about?<br>
              (pauses - to Scott)<br>
              Then maybe take him to the window.</p>
            <p>He walks Scott to the window.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              (pretending Scott's Mickey)<br>
              So, Mickey, if you were let outta jail today, what's the first thing 
              you'd do?<br>
              (pause - to Scott)<br>
              Little shit like that. I don't wanna have to feel I gotta stay in 
              the chairs. We're after a cinema verit√©, anything can happen, truth 
              twenty-four times a second kinda feel.</p>
            <p>End of single SHOT.</p>
            <p>Wurlitzer's talking with Deputies.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              And when it's lunch time, they don't just go to McDonalds. They 
              got cooks there servin' great food. Swedish meatballs... </p>
            <p>Wayne walks over to Wurlitzer and Deputies.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I 
              could have a small word with you.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              By all means.</p>
            <p>Wayne puts his hand on Wurlitzer's shoulder. They walk around the 
              room.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, 
              I could sooner do without my are than Unruly Julie.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              Is that her real name?</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Just a little nickname. Yep, they're my kids and they're all I need. 
              After working together these past coupla years, we're like well-oiled 
              machinery. No, more like a Formula race car. No, scratch that one, 
              too. What we're really like is a Swiss watch. Small, intricate, 
              compact... it shouldn't work as well as it does, but it does. Because 
              of the craftsmanship, the expertise, and the artist's loving hand.</p>
            <p>Wayne gives Wurlitzer a moment to digest this.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              I see.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before -</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              (proudly)<br>
              Ya know, I was.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              (acting surprised)<br>
              Really?</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              I was on the `Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              (still acting surprised)<br>
              Well... small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood 
              does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and 
              fifty crew members -</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              Oh, that `Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five 
              people there, maybe more.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              It sure is.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              They got a asshole over here.<br>
              (pointing to his left)<br>
              A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there.<br>
              (points to his right)<br>
              A asshole perched up there.<br>
              (points straight up)<br>
              Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, 
              bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about 
              is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I 
              was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask 
              you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this... 
              <br>
              (indicates the hustle and bustle of a set)<br>
              ... you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking 
              a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for 
              intimacy.</p>
            <p>Wayne gives Wurlitzer a chance to take this in.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              That's why my crew is only three... an invisible three.<br>
              (switching gears)<br>
              Which brings me to what I wanted to talk to you about. I have to 
              get Mickey Knox to relax... Mickey Knox to share what he's never 
              shared before... Mickey Knox to open doors which 'till today have 
              bee closed. Well, how can we expect him to do that when we got Los 
              Angeles County Sheriffs up the walls.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, things get short between the two men.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              (snorts)<br>
              Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Lose 'em.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's 
              career.</p>
            <p>They're out and out angry.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed -</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you 
              do.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. 
              If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck 
              like a twig.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              One... I cam take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighborhood, 
              and I've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox 
              doesn't scare me. Two... I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take 
              that risk. Three... it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell 
              you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game 
              according to Hoyle.<br>
              (pause)<br>
              Wait a minute. We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which 
              is not what I want.<br>
              (pause)<br>
              But seriously, Phil, look at this.</p>
            <p>Wayne scans the room, counting the deputy sheriffs.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              (counting)<br>
              We got one... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight. 
              I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these 
              guys.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              Wayne, if it was anybody else -</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs 
              all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy 
              am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I 
              feel it.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              What are we talking about?</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Two guys?</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              Okay. I'll take two guys off.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              I can't do that. Five guys.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Three.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MICKEY'S CELL - DAY</p>
            <p>Mickey lays on his be with his hands behind his head.</p>
            <p>CAMERA DOLLIES BACK to include the bars of Mickey's cell door in 
              the foreground as two DEPUTY SHERIFFS enter FRAME and slide it open. 
              The deputies each carry shotguns and a shit load of chains and shackles.</p>
            <p>DEPUTY #1<br>
              On your feet! Turn your face to the wall.</p>
            <p>Mickey gets up</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Now what you're supposed to say is: 'Five minutes, Mr. Knox.'</p>
            <p>OFF SCREEN the cell door slams closed</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MALLORY'S CELL - DAY</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Mallory asleep in her bunk. The echo of Mickey's cell 
              door makes her up with a jolt.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI (O.S.)<br>
              Rise and shine, Mallory!</p>
            <p>Mallory springs out of bed, and into a fighting stance.</p>
            <p>CAMERA WHIP PANS to Scagnetti, inside her cell, flanked by two 
              deputies with shotguns. The deputies are BINGHAM and WASHINGTON.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              Beautiful day for a drive, isn't it?</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Mallory's bare feet walking in front of Bingham and 
              Washington's shiny black shoes.</p>
            <p>The SOUND of Mallory's bare feet slapping the concrete floor, along 
              with the clip-clop-clip-clop of the deputies' shoes, reverberates 
              throughout the scene.</p>
            <p>Mallory walks slightly ahead of the two shotgun wielding deputies, 
              when Scagnetti slips in beside her. He lights up a cigarette with 
              his Zippo, and talks a long drag.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              It's a long trip to Bakersfield. Long and hot. Ever been to Bakersfield?</p>
            <p>Mallory looks straight ahead.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              See, I've been there twice. And I'm not lookin' forward to goin' 
              back. But I'm in and out. You, on the other hand, sweetheart, are 
              gonna spend the rest of your life there. Now that's what I call 
              cruel and inhuman punishment.</p>
            <p>Mallory shows no emotion, just keeps on walking.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              Course you're not gonna give a shit. 'Cause when the good doctor's 
              get through givin' you the zap... <br>
              (he puts his finger next to his temple, pantomimes being electrocuted)<br>
              ... You won't know where the hell you are. They'll just put you 
              on a window sill, and water you every other day.</p>
            <p>Mallory lets out a big yawn.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p>Wayne stands at the window speaking to Scott, Roger and Unruly 
              Julie. One the other side of the room Wurlitzer and his entourage 
              of deputies are yucking it up, and occasionally bursting into laughter.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              (to his crew)<br>
              And when he gets here, its no dick'n around time. Make him up, clip 
              a mike on him, then leave him alone. I don't want you talking to 
              him. I don't want you getting in his face. I want you hiding behind 
              you gear. You are invisible.</p>
            <p>CAMERA PANS to the door as two deputies lead Mickey into the supply 
              room. Mickey is shackled head to toe, its a wonder how he can still 
              walk.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              (to his crew)<br>
              Okay, break.</p>
            <p>Wayne's team disburses.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              Okay, boys, lets start undoing him.</p>
            <p>Two deputies hold shotguns to Mickey's head, while two others start 
              unlocking the chains. As they do, Mickey looks at Wayne.</p>
            <p>Wayne approaches Mickey.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              (to Wayne)<br>
              Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have 
              to get clear about.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              All right, Mickey.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Let's discuss it when I'm unbound.</p>
            <p>CAMERA holds on Mickey standing still as the two deputies remove 
              the chains.</p>

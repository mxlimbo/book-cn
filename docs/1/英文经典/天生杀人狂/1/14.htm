            <p>NOTE: The video footage is all handheld and harshly lit, until 
              otherwise specified.</p>

            <p>WAYNE<br>
              This is Wayne Gayle reporting live from the Los Angeles County Jail, 
              where you can tell from the bloody carnage behind me that the final 
              chapter in the book called Mickey and Mallory has not yet been written.</p>
            <p>Mickey enters the FRAME with shotgun in hand, pushing Wayne out.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Thank you, Wayne, but our little movie just underwent a title change. 
              It's now called 'The Escape of Mickey and Mallory.' Starring me, 
              you, Mallory, and special guest accomplice, Jack-fucked-up-fingers-Scagnetti.<br>
              (into CAMERA)<br>
              Okay, Donut, move in for a close up. I want this for prosperity.</p>
            <p>CAMERA ZOOMS into a CLOSEUP of Scagnetti.</p>
            <p>MICKEY (O.S.)<br>
              Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, 
              and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as 
              a director will be your death scene.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              (slightly out of it)<br>
              She's in the holding cell, on this floor.</p>
            <p>MICKEY (O.S.)<br>
              You're taking us to that holding cell now.<br>

              All right, Cut!</p>
            <p>The CAMERA shuts off. SCREEN fills with STATIC.</p>

              Ladies and gentlemen, in case you have just tuned in, it appears 
              that a hostage situation involving Mickey Knox is developing presently 
              at the Los Angeles County Jail. We have seen that he is armed and 
              apparently there has been some loss of life. We will try to re-establish 
              contact with Wayne Gayle and bring you more on this late breaking 
              story. Please stay tuned.</p>
            <p><br>
              INSERT TITLE CARD: &quot;SPECIAL REPORT&quot;</p>
            <p>TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)<br>
              This has been a KKTV Special Report.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p>BACK TO: COLOR 35MM</p>
            <p>WIDE SHOT of Mickey, holding his shotgun. He walks over and grabs 
              the shotgun from dead Deputy #5. Deputy #5 won't let go of the gun 
              from his dead man's grip. Mickey finally yanks it loose. He extracts 
              all the shells from the gun, picks them off the floor, and puts 
              them in his pocket.</p>
            <p>Mickey picks up Scagnetti's gun, inserts the loose bullets and 
              slips it into his pants.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Okay, Jack, this is what we're doing. Stand behind me, put your 
              back against mine and extend your arms behind you.</p>
            <p>Scagnetti rises, insecurely. He presses his back against Mickey's.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Now if I feel your back move away from mine, you're gonna be ripped 
              apart. Got it?</p>
            <p>Scagnetti's back to back with Mickey. His arms flank Mickey.</p>
            <p>SCAGNETTI<br>
              Yeah.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Okay, Wayne, step forward.</p>
            <p>Wayne enters FRAME. Mickey extends the shotgun.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Keep comin'. Put your solar plexus against the barrel.</p>
            <p>Wayne does.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Grab his arms.</p>
            <p>Wayne does and Mickey quickly binds their arms together with gaffer's 
              tape, forming a two man rind around him.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Either one of you two move, it's gonna be shotgun city. You understand?</p>
            <p>WAYNE &amp; SCAGNETTI<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p>Mickey tucks the tape roll into his shirt.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              You ready, Donut?</p>
            <p>ROGER<br>
              Ready.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Wagons, hooaaa!</p>
            <p>The hostage train starts moving. Wayne's walking backwards with 
              the shotgun barrel pressed against his midsection. Scagnetti's walking 
              back to back with Mickey and his own pistol pressed to his neck.</p>
            <p>Roger follows with the camera.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY</p>
            <p>Mallory's sitting Indian style, singing Girl Scout songs to herself, 
              and doing the hand motions.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              (singing)<br>
              Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha<br>
              dodaleedo, dodaleedo.<br>
              Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha<br>
              dodaleedo, dodaleedo. Simplest thing there isn't much to it.<br>
              All ya gotta do is dodaleedo it. I like the rest,<br>
              but the best part I like is<br>
              Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha dodaleedo,<br>
              dodaleedo, do<br>
              quack, quack.</p>
            <p>The cell door opens and the hostage train of Wayne, Mickey, Scagnetti, 
              Roger and the camera, and two DEPUTIES they picked up along the 
              way enters the room. The hostages are all wrapped with tape.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP on Mallory. She can't believe her eyes.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              (to Mallory)<br>
              Honey, I'm home.</p>
            <p>Mallory runs into Mickey's arms, passionately kissing. This kiss 
              has been a year coming. Now they're doing something everybody told 
              them they would never do again.</p>
            <p>For this moment they are the only two people on earth. We're enraptured, 
              too. CAMERA does a 360 around the loving couple.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              (in between kisses)<br>
              It's taken you so long to come to me.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. JAIL LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY</p>
            <p>A sheet of paper flashes through FRAME.</p>
            <p>BAILEY (O.S.)<br>
              Here's the list of the rioters.</p>
            <p>CAMERA TILTS to Wurlitzer reading, then looking up.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              Wait an minute, Bailey. Where's the list of the hostages?</p>
            <p>BAILEY (O.S.)<br>
              I'm working on it Capt'n.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              Keep on it, son.</p>
            <p>Wurlitzer reads the list to himself as he paces.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              (reading the names)<br>
              Alvarado, Issacs, Julian, Martinez, Newendyke, Olvera, Pool, Ramos, 
              Schmidt, Spivey, Walsh, Westerguard... </p>
            <p>Wurlitzer drops into a chair, exhausted. He rubs his face with 
              his hands.</p>
            <p>NAPALATONI (O.S.)<br>
              Capt'n.</p>
            <p>Wurlitzer looks up, then looks back down.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              What is it Napalatoni?</p>
            <p>NAPALATONI (O.S.)<br>
              Mickey Knox is loose.</p>
            <p>Wurlitzer looks up.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              What do you mean he's loose?</p>
            <p>NAPALATONI (O.S.)<br>
              He's armed, he's killed three deputies and one of Wayne Gayle's 
              guys. At the moment, he's hold up with Mallory Knox in her holding 
              cell with Wayne Gayle, another TV guy, that cop fella, and two other 
              deputies as hostages. And Capt'n, they have one of them news cameras 
              goin' live to KKTV. They won't stop playin' it. What do you want 
              us to do?</p>
            <p>Wurlitzer holds a frozen look, as if a fuse has blown and his mind 
              has shut down. If he were to open his mouth now nothing would come 
              out. He just sits.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY</p>
            <p>The hostages have been cut free from each other and sit against 
              the wall. Roger cradles the Betacam in his lap, rocking slowly as 
              if in a trance, while Scagnetti feebly splints his broken fingers 
              with the tape that hangs from his wrists. Wayne is standing, alert 
              and ready for action.</p>
            <p>As for the two deputies, HOSTAGE DEPUTY #1 sits in anger, tight-lipped 
              and stolic. The other, DEPUTY DUNCAN HOMOLKA is panicked and jumpy, 
              one may never see a more nervous man.</p>
            <p>Mickey and Mallory stand over them with their weapons drawn.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the 
              hall and right out of the building.<br>
              (to Wayne)<br>
              Donut said something about a news van.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Yeah, we have a van.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Where's it parked?</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Out front.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Let me have the keys.</p>
            <p>Wayne points to Roger. Roger digs through his pocket and tosses 
              the keys to Mickey.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Mickey, can I talk to you alone?</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              No.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              This is crazy. You can't escape like this.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              We'll all be killed.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              Exciting, isn't it?</p>
            <p>Duncan begins to cry.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. 
              If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say 
              right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              Are we in a big hurry?</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              You got something you want to do?</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              Yeah.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              By all means, know yourself out.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.</p>
            <p>Roger snaps up and hoists the camera to his shoulder.</p>
            <p><br>
              VIDEO FOOTAGE:</p>
            <p>Shot through Roger's CAMERA: IMAGE FOCUSES on Mallory as she points 
              to Scagnetti sitting on the floor.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              You! Stand up!</p>
            <p>Scagnetti gulps, then rises knowing that he has fucked with the 
              wrong woman.</p>
            <p>Mallory walks up to him with pistol in hand.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              You probably thought it was pretty funny, didn't ya?</p>
            <p>She raises Scagnetti's pistol, aiming it at it's former owner. 
              Scagnetti flinches and squirms.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              Can you remember the last time you fucked with me? Close your eyes 
              and remember... Are ya thinking about it? Good.</p>
            <p>Mallory fires three shots into Scagnetti's chest.</p>
            <p>Roger's CAMERA jumps, then follows the body to the floor. Roger 
              HOLDS on Scagnetti slumped on the floor.</p>
            <p>DUNCAN (O.S.)<br>
              Oh God! Oh God! Ohhhh... </p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              We're sending out a hostage. Don't touch him!</p>
            <p>OFF SCREEN the door is kicked open.</p>
            <p>Roger's CAMERA whips around to witness Mickey and Mallory jumping 
              into the corridor, BLASTING with their guns while using the hostages 
              for shields. Roger's CAMERA moves out of the cell and... </p>

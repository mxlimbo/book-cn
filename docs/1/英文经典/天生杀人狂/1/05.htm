            <p>Interviewing Russell Vossler, Harvard law student.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Tell me, Mr. Vossler, how many days of the trial have you attended?</p>
            <p>RUSSELL<br>
              Ahhh yesss, I've been fortunate enough to attend two days. Law history 
              in the making. I've been a participant.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              And you being a Harvard law student, what is your opinion of Mickey 
              Knox's performance?</p>
            <p>RUSSELL<br>
              Ahhh, Mickey's pistolero savvy in the courtroom trial rivals, dare 
              I say conquers that of master Melvin Belli. He's like a magnificent 
              loose cannon, firing point blank in the prosecutor's face. It is 
              my anticipation -</p>

              INT. GOLD'S GYM - DAY</p>
            <p>Wayne's sitting in the gym. Behind him MUSCLE MEN are working out. 
              Their GRUNTING sounds fill the background. Wayne looks up and just 
              OFF CAMERA to the people he's interviewing.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              What do you think of Mickey and Mallory?</p>
            <p><br>
              EXTREME CLOSEUP</p>
            <p>On SIMON and NORMAN HUN, two brothers/bodybuilders, in a head SHOT.</p>
            <p>SIMON<br>
              I admire them.</p>
            <p>NORMAN<br>
              I do, too.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              (confused)<br>
              But how can you say that?</p>
            <p>SIMON<br>
              They're mesmerising.</p>
            <p>NORMAN<br>
              Hypnotizing.</p>
            <p>SIMON<br>
              Have you seen &quot;Pumping Iron?&quot;</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p>NORMAN<br>
              Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwarzenegger is talking 
              to Lou Ferigno.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p>SIMON<br>
              Through the power of the simple word -</p>
            <p>NORMAN<br>
              And a snake-eye glare.</p>
            <p>SIMON<br>
              - and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any 
              confidence Ferigno had.</p>
            <p>NORMAN<br>
              He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.</p>
            <p>SIMON<br>
              He had the edge. The mind's edge.</p>
            <p>NORMAN<br>
              Mickey and Mallory have that edge.</p>
            <p>SIMON<br>
              Only on a much grander scale.</p>
            <p>NORMAN<br>
              They've hypnotized the nation.</p>
            <p>SIMON<br>
              Schwarzenegger was the king of the edge before they came along.</p>
            <p>The CLOSEUP of the brothers ZOOMS back.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              You say this and yet... you two are both victims of Mickey and Mallory.</p>
            <p>SHOT has zoomed back to reveal that both Simon and Norman are in 
              wheelchairs (their legs maimed or gone).</p>
            <p>SIMON<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p>NORMAN<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              How can you say that you 'admire' them?</p>
            <p>NORMAN<br>
              It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting 
              for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, 
              yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark 
              room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can 
              make the first move.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?</p>
            <p>NORMAN<br>
              They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless 
              killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              And they made the first move?</p>
            <p>NORMAN<br>
              Unfortunately, yes.</p>
            <p>SIMON<br>
              But you see, that's okay, Wayne.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Why?</p>
            <p>SIMON<br>
              They passed the 'edge' along to us.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              How so?</p>
            <p>SIMON<br>
              By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead 
              than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. 
              They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. 
              Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like 
              the devil to get whole again.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              But you'll never be whole again.</p>
            <p>SIMON<br>
              Never is a very long time, Wayne. A word only the weak use. I'm 
              not a sore loser. Even if I don't have a leg to stand on, I'm going 
              to get up and fight this world until I'm on top again.</p>
            <p>NORMAN<br>
              That's the Mickey and Mallory way.</p>
            <p>SIMON<br>
              That's the way of the world.</p>
            <p>NORMAN<br>
              They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.</p>
            <p>SIMON<br>
              Survival of the fittest.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              One last question. Usually Mickey and Mallory kill all of their 
              victims. Why did they let you two survive?</p>
            <p>The brothers pause, then turn to Wayne.</p>
            <p>NORMAN<br>
              They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen 
              the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before 
              they were gonna kill us.</p>
            <p>SIMON<br>
              Just for fun, I guess.</p>
            <p>NORMAN<br>
              And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers 
              Hun.'</p>
            <p>SIMON<br>
              Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest 
              fan!'</p>
            <p>NORMAN<br>
              Apparently, they've seen all our films.</p>
            <p>SIMON<br>
              They were especially influenced by &quot;Conquering Huns of Neptune.&quot;</p>
            <p>NORMAN<br>
              So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.</p>
            <p>SIMON<br>
              They actually apologized.</p>

            <p>NEIL POPE<br>
              It is my belief that Mickey and Mallory Knox are a cultural phenomena 
              that could only exist in our sexually repressed society. A flower 
              that could only bloom amidst a grotesque fast food culture. A what 
              I tried to do with 'Thrill Killers' was trace the root of the problem 
              all the way down the vine to the original bad seed. Yet amidst the 
              violence and murder and carnage, you've got the structure of a Wagnarian 
              love story.</p>

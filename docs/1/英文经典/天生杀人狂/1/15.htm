              INT. JAIL CORRIDOR (OUTSIDE THE HOLDING CELL) - DAY</p>
            <p>There are even more DEPUTY SHERIFFS in the corridor.</p>
            <p>CROSS FIRE whistles by as Roger dodges to catch up with the caravan.</p>
            <p>The footage is very similar to Vietnam footage. It's shaky, real, 
              harsh, and it captures the pandemonium of battle.</p>
            <p>The soundtrack is a mixture of yelling, crying, laughing, and gunfire.</p>
            <p>HOSTAGE DEPUTY #1 is SHOT, and discarded by Mickey.</p>
            <p>The wild caravan runs down the hallway, FIRING behind them.</p>
            <p>Mickey's HIT, but keeps on running and FIRING. Mallory sees this 
              and screams.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              Mickey!</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Don't stop!</p>
            <p>Roger's CAMERA runs along with them.</p>
            <p>ROGER (O.S.)<br>
              Man, oh, man... this is better than Vietnam!</p>
            <p>More DEPUTIES appear at the end of the hallway.</p>
            <p>Mickey and Mallory get back to back with each other, using DUNCAN 
              as a shield in front of them and Wayne behind them. Mickey FIRES 
              from the front, Mallory FIRES from the rear.</p>
            <p>DUNCAN<br>
              Please don't kill me! Don't kill me... </p>
            <p>CAMERA WHIP PANS to catch a Deputy hopping around the corner. The 
              SCREEN FLASHES WHITE with a BLAST.</p>
            <p>Roger's HIT, and the CAMERA goes haywire, reeling out of control, 
              the THUNKING to the ground. Roger screams O.S.</p>
            <p>CAMERA lies on the floor, video still transmitting. Roger rolls 
              into FRAME screaming.</p>
            <p>MICKEY (O.S.)<br>
              Get the camera! Get the fucking camera!</p>
            <p><br>
              BACK TO: COLOR 35MM</p>
            <p>As Mickey FIRES cover for her, Mallory swipes the camera from Roger's 
              side.</p>
            <p>The Knox's start running again, still holding Wayne and last hostage.</p>
            <p>Deputies are lying on the ground, wounded and screaming, or dead 
              and silent.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              (to Mallory)<br>
              This way.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. STAIRWELL - DAY</p>
            <p>The caravan bursts into the stairwell. Mickey turns to Duncan the 
              remaining hostage deputy.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              (to Duncan)<br>
              Where does this lead?</p>
            <p>Duncan is hyper-ventilating. Mickey pushes him against to wall.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Where!?!</p>
            <p>DUNCAN<br>
              Th... the ground floor.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              Is that the front door?</p>
            <p>Duncan nod frantically.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Let's go.</p>
            <p>Mickey grabs Duncan and the caravan starts running down the stairs. 
              They go down a few flights.</p>
            <p>As they run down one last flight, they find Wurlitzer and a team 
              of DEPUTIES waiting for them on the ground floor. The deputies raise 
              their guns.</p>
            <p>Mallory grabs hold of Wayne, and gets behind him with one hand 
              pressing the barrel of her gun against his temple and her other 
              are wrapped around his neck, holding him close to her.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              Back off or I'll blast him! Back off or I'll blast him! Back off 
              or I'll blast him!</p>
            <p>None of the deputies lower their guns, but they appear less likely 
              to start shooting.</p>
            <p>Wayne screams.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Don't shoot. I beg you, don't shoot! Please, please, please... </p>
            <p>Wayne continues begging.</p>
            <p>Wurlitzer steps forward.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              Now Mickey, Mallory, just let me say -</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              Shut up! Don't talk, I don't wanna hear it!</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              You have to know -</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              I said shut up... </p>
            <p>Mallory quickly lowers her gun from Wayne's head and SHOOTS him 
              in the thigh. She whips the gun back up to his head.</p>
            <p>Wayne's screaming in pain.</p>
            <p>The deputies jump back.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              ... and I mean shut up!</p>
            <p>There's a bit of a silent standoff.</p>
            <p>Tears are streaming down Duncan's face as the caravan slowly retreats 
              back up the stairs to the next flight.</p>
            <p>The deputies hold their present position.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. PRISON STAIRWELL - DAY</p>
            <p>The caravan goes up one flight, then stops. Mickey and Mallory 
              let their two hostages sit down.</p>
            <p>Duncan is out and out hysterical, urine stains the front of his 
              uniform.</p>
            <p>Mickey's pacing.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Think... think... think... </p>
            <p>Mallory leans up against the wall, holding her side with her hand. 
              Blood trickles out between the fingers. We see now she's been shot.</p>
            <p>Over Duncan's impassioned clamor they can hear Wurlitzer yelling 
              from below.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER (O.S.)<br>
              Give up! There's no other way out!</p>
            <p>Mickey sits down, utterly exhausted. Mallory sits down next to 
              him. She winces in pain. He puts his arm around her.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              Look, lover boy, we're not getting outta here. So I say the hell 
              with going back to our cells. Let's do a Butch Cassidy and the Sundance 
              Kid. Run down these stairs shootin', go out in a hail of bullets, 
              but take as many of those motherfuckers with us as possible.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, Mickey's exhaustion lifts. He has a plan.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              We'll do that when all else fails.</p>
            <p>Mickey stands.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              Hasn't it?</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              We still got a few tricks up our sleeves.</p>
            <p>Mickey confronts the two hostages. He points at Duncan.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              You married?</p>
            <p>DUNCAN<br>
              Oh, I don't wanna die... </p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Are you married? Do you have kids?</p>
            <p>Duncan nods pathetically.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Good. People, we're goin' all the way to the front door. Now, the 
              only way we're gonna get there is if they don't want to kill you 
              two more than they want to kill us.</p>
            <p><br>
              INSERT:</p>
            <p>SHOTS of deputies with guns in their hands, just itching to kill 
              Mickey and Mallory. We hear Mickey's voice over this SHOT.</p>
            <p>MICKEY (V.O.)<br>
              Right now I find that highly unlikely. So, let's help 'em out, shall 
              we?</p>
            <p><br>
              BACK TO PRISON STAIRWELL:</p>
            <p>Mickey is squatting in front of Wayne.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Now, say I tell those guys down there if they shoot or make a move, 
              I'm killin' Wayne Gayle. And they shoot or make a move anyway. Now 
              say by some freak accident, you didn't die, you live though it. 
              What would you do?</p>
            <p>Mickey pulls the roll of GAFFER'S TAPE from his shirt and starts 
              tearing strips of tape and sticking them to the wall.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              What would I do? Me and my network would sue the entire Los Angeles 
              County Sheriffs Department for flagrantly disregarding my safety. 
              I'd go straight to my buddy, the mayor, and make sure everyone of 
              those son-of-a-bitches down there ends up on the unemployment line. 
              In fact, I'd sue every man down there personally. I would make it 
              my life's ambition to bring the LA County Jail to its knees. I would 
              do expose after expose on the brutality, and the conditions, and 
              the inhumanity that exists here.</p>
            <p>Mickey tosses the tape roll to Mallory and gestures to Duncan. 
              Mallory winks at Mickey. Mickey smiles and begins wrapping tape 
              around the barrel of his shotgun.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              That's what I thought. You tell them that. When we go down those 
              stairs, I want you to scream what you just told me. 'My name is 
              Wayne Gayle! I am the star of American Maniacs watched every week 
              by' - how many people?</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              On average forty million.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' 
              Have you won any awards?</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award... 
            </p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              'Respected journalist' - On your knees... </p>
            <p>Wayne kneels in front of Mickey. While Mickey speaks he props his 
              shotgun under Wayne's chin and wraps the tape from the barrel around 
              his neck.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              (continues)<br>
              ... 'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among 
              others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his 
              address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment 
              lines. You getting the idea?</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Yes.</p>
            <p>Mickey stands with Wayne as he tapes his trigger hand to the stock 
              of the shotgun.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Say it. Scream it. All the way out the front door and into your 
              van. And if you stop screaming, I swear to God I'll blow your head 
              off.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Got it.</p>
            <p>Mickey grabs the camera, and lifts it to his shoulder before shouting 
              to Duncan.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              You! What's your name?</p>
            <p>Duncan can't answer, Mallory has gagged him with his tape. Mallory 
              grabs Duncan by the collar and lifts him off the floor before reading 
              his name badge.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              Duncan... Homolka?</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. PRISON STAIRWELL (GROUND FLOOR) - DAY</p>
            <p>Wurlitzer and the deputies are deciding their next move when they 
              hear:</p>
            <p>MICKEY (O.S.)<br>
              Start.</p>
            <p>Wayne and Duncan come into view with the Knoxs behind them.</p>
            <p>The deputies quickly raise their guns, but soon realize if they 
              take out either Mickey of Mallory that Wayne or Duncan would die.</p>
            <p>Mallory's right hand is taped to the trigger and stock of the shotgun 
              that's wrapped firmly to Duncan's neck. The pistol in her left hand 
              is trained on Wurlitzer.</p>
            <p>Mickey's left hand masters the shotgun leash on Wayne, while he 
              monitors the Deputies with the CAMERA on his right shoulder.</p>
            <p>NOTE: The following scene will intercut between VIDEO FOOTAGE and 
              COLOR 35mm.</p>
            <p>Wayne starts belting out his speech as Mickey focus the CAMERA 
              on Wurlitzer. Duncan simply cries and begs for his life to be spared.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              (yelling)<br>
              My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of `American Maniacs', watched 
              by forty million people every week! I am a respected journalist, 
              winners of the Golden Globe, the Edward R. Murrows Award among others! 
              If anybody puts me in danger, my network will sue The Los Angeles 
              County Sheriffs Department. My estate will sue every officer personally 
              who fires. The network's law firm is Rowlands, Davis and Sinclair... 
            </p>
            <p>Mickey knew what he was doing. This has an effect on the deputies.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              (yelling)<br>
              Make a path!</p>
            <p>The wall of deputies starts moving backward.</p>
            <p>The Knoxs and their hostages start moving forward with Wayne yelling 
              all the way.</p>
            <p>The deputies keep their guns trained on the caravan, but they keep 
              giving ground, until they reach the doors of the front lobby and 
              they being to part like the Red Sea.</p>
            <p>Wurlitzer stands his ground.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              How far do you think your gonna get?</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Right out the front door.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              That'll never happen.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              It is happening.</p>
            <p>The caravan marches forth. Wayne and Duncan keep shouting their 
              speeches. Nobody dares to move on them, but the deputies keep their 
              weapons ready.</p>
            <p>Wayne stops his speech to take a breath.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              Don't stop!</p>
            <p>Wayne starts up again.</p>
            <p>The deputies are completely frustrated. Mickey and Wurlitzer are 
              nose to nose.</p>
            <p>WURLITZER<br>
              (to Mickey)<br>
              I will personally hunt you down, blow the head off your fucking-whore-wife, 
              and plant your sick ass in the ground all by myself.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              (calmly)<br>
              Another day perhaps, but not today.</p>
            <p>Mickey leaves FRAME.</p>

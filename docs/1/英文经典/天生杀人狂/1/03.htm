            <p>MICKEY (V.O.)<br>
              ... and imagine kissing you. Not making love, just kissing for hours 
              and hours on end. I remember everything about our time. I remember 
              every joke you ever told.</p>

              CLOSEUP OF THE LETTER</p>
            <p>Being written over the WIDE SHOT.</p>
            <p>MICKEY (V.O.)<br>
              I remember every secret you ever shared. Shared or revealed? I think 
              shared is proper. I remember every single time you laughed.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXTREME CLOSEUP OF MICKEY</p>
            <p>Mouthing the words as he writes, we can hear Mallory's laugh - 
              a distant haunting echo.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              I remember every meal we ever ate. I remember your cooking. I especially 
              remember your casseroles. I remember watching David Letterman.</p>
            <p>We hear the echo of television laughter.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              I remember driving fast... faster, man, fast behind the wheel of 
              the Coupe de Ville.</p>

            <p>CAMERA sits on the hood looking down at Mickey and Mallory, driving 
              fast - SLOW MOTION. A hurricane of wind whips through their hair. 
              Mallory laughs wildly as she wraps her arms around Mickey and kisses.</p>
            <p>MICKEY (V.O.)<br>
              You, baby, by my side. Your bare feet up on the dash, singing along 
              with the radio 'Needles And Pins', 'He's A Rebel', 'You're My World', 
              'Ring Of Fire', 'Love Grows Where My Rosemary Goes', 'Groove Me'...

            <p>Coupe de Ville parked on the road side. Mickey is in the drivers 
              seat with his feet on the dash watching Mallory dance on the hood 
              of the car.</p>
            <p>MICKEY (V.O.)<br>
              And your dancing, my God, you dancing. I lie on my bed and go over 
              every day, every minute of our happiness. Every day take a day of 
              our time and go through it hour by hour. I don't jump ahead either. 
              I take it as it comes, and I live that day again. That way when

            <p>The screen erupts with fire. Mickey and Mallory's faces appear 
              in the flame kissing passionately.</p>
            <p>MICKEY (V.O.)<br>
              The killing of your parents, our wedding... They're not just memories. 
              I feel that joy again... </p>

            <p><br>
              INT. RESTAURANT - DAY</p>
            <p>MEDIUM CLOSEUP of Wayne holding a piece of paper in front of his 
              face and reading from it out loud. We hear Wayne's VOICE over Mallory's 
              singing before the last scene DISSOLVES.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              (reading out loud)<br>
              'After taking a few days to reflect on your offer, I've come to 
              the conclusion that you are one hundred percent correct. A national 
              TV interview would be very advantageous to both Mallory and I. The 
              only obstacle is they're shipping me out to the funny farm in four 
              days. However, that is your problem and not mine. I feel confident 
              you'll manage. Here's to us making television history. Sincerely, 
              Mickey Knox.'</p>
            <p>Wayne drops the letter down from in front of his face.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Am I a God or what?</p>
            <p>We now see the restaurant adorned with the standard Denny's decorum. 
              Wayne's team is gathered in a booth that surrounds the remains of 
              a greasy meal. In response to his last remark, they all pretend 
              they are praying to him.</p>
            <p>The team consists of SCOTT, the cameraman, who wears wild T-shirts 
              (presently a T-shirt with the movie &quot;She Devils On Wheels&quot; 
              splashed on the front); ROGER, the soundman, who wears wild Hawaiian 
              shirts and Bermuda shorts; and UNRULY JULIE, Wayne's assistant, 
              a young lady who wears Bermuda shorts, a baseball jersey, and a 
              dark sports coat no matter how hot the weather is at any time. Roger's 
              never seen without his recorder, Scott's never without his camera, 
              and Unruly Julie always has her giant notebook. These dishevelled 
              film types are all in their twenties and are a marked contrast to 
              Wayne's stylish yuppie demeanor.</p>
            <p>Unruly Julie pops the cork on a champagne bottle. The guys hold 
              out coffee mugs, while Julie fills. Julie, however drinks straight 
              from the bottle.</p>
            <p>NOTE: This scene is to be played at a rapid fire &quot;His Girl 
              Friday&quot; pace.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Drink up! This is a celebration. This is the day we received word 
              we were gonna make television history. We're gonna have the first 
              sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer 
              ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for 
              the rest of his life. This is one of those golden moments that happens 
              maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career. This is Wallace 
              with Noriega, this is Elton John confessing is bi-sexuality to the 
              Rolling Stone, this is the tearful reporting of the Hindenberg disaster, 
              this is Truffaut setting the record straight on Hitchcock, this 
              is a Robert Capa photo, this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting Deep 
              Throat in an underground parking lot, this is John Ried reporting 
              'The Ten Days That Shook The World', this is the hippies' bloody 
              palms at Kent State, the Maysles brothers at Altamont, this is the 
              Nixon/Frost interviews... </p>
            <p>ROGER<br>
              This is Raymond Burr witnessing the destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.</p>
            <p>Everybody laughs.</p>
            <p>SCOTT<br>
              What's the schedule, mein fuehrer?</p>
            <p>As Wayne talks, Unruly Julie writes furiously in her notebook. 
              She never speaks, just writes.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after 
              that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox 
              interview, 'cause the next day he goes.</p>
            <p>SCOTT<br>
              Would the network really not run it without the interview?</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Are you kidding? The last thing they expected was Mickey Knox to 
              get up close and personal. They wanted a follow up episode and would've 
              taken anything I had given them. I'm not gonna tell Mickey Knox 
              that. I'm gonna make him think his grey matter depends on it. When 
              I told Woody and the brass about this coup, they practically shit 
              a brick. I'm talkin' an adobe brick. They want to expand the show 
              to a hour, and they want it on immediately.</p>
            <p>ROGER<br>
              How immediate is immediately?</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Next week's episode.</p>
            <p>Wayne's team all spit out mouthfuls of champagne.</p>
            <p>ROGER<br>
              We don't got enough footage for a hour follow up.</p>
            <p>SCOTT<br>
              (pointing at Roger)<br>
              What he said.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Rape and pillage the first episode, just change the order a bit. 
              Those sons of bitches out there ain't gonna know the difference. 
              All that shit is just filler for the interview anyway. We film a 
              new intro. Show some old footage from the first episode so the get 
              a brief history of Mickey and Mallory. We introduce a new angle... 
              what the prison board is up to. We see some of that new shit, then 
              the rest of the show is the interview. Now what's so fuckin' hard 
              about that? Oh, Julie make a note: I need Woody to get me thirty 
              seconds of the &quot;Live at Five&quot; broadcast to promote next 
              weeks show. We'll do a feed right from the jail while we're wrapping 
              up with Mickey.</p>
            <p>Unruly Julie scribbles in her notebook. Wayne snaps at Scott.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              You too Scott, Betacam and a remote, keep it simple.</p>
            <p>Scott closes his eyes in concentration, and repeats Wayne.</p>
            <p>SCOTT<br>
              Betacam with remote and two-way comm link. Got it.<br>
              (opens eyes)<br>
              How about the interview... What camera do you want to use?</p>
            <p>Wayne closes his eyes.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              I see... high contrast sixteen millimetre black and white, and I 
              mean black and white, where the black's black and the white's white. 
              This is for prosperity, so fuck video. Film! Film! Film!</p>
            <p>Wayne pounds on the table.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Unruly Julie writing in her notebook: &quot;Film... 
              film... film!&quot;</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview.<br>
              (points at Roger &amp; Scott)<br>
              You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the 
              new footage, put it together, and see what we got. Get it into shape 
              so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in.</p>
            <p>SCOTT<br>
              When do you want the assembly?</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Tomorrow.</p>

            <p><br>
              INT. TV STATION CORRIDOR - DAY</p>
            <p>CAMERA leads Wayne, who's talking to Unruly Julie. As they march 
              quickly through the halls Julie writes furiously in her notebook.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              At that point I'll ask him if he believes in God. If he says yes, 
              I'll ask him what he thinks God would make of his actions. And is 
              he worried about burning in hell? If he says no, I'll say, 'Well, 
              Mickey, what do you believe in?' And hopefully he'll say something 
              like a live round of ammo, the expression on the face of a man he 
              just split up the middle, Mallory's eyes, sex, drugs, and rock 'n 
              roll. He's bound to say something provocative.</p>
            <p>Wayne and Unruly Julie enter the video editing room. Scott and 
              Roger are sitting at the editing bay. Everybody is wearing, and 
              looks like they slept in, the same clothes as the night before, 
              except Wayne, who's in another sweater and looks alert and snappy.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Okay, boys, lets have it.</p>
            <p>SCOTT<br>
              Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first... 
            </p>
            <p>ROGER<br>
              But we changed the order around so it wasn't super obvious... </p>
            <p>SCOTT<br>
              Then we added the new shit to the tail... </p>
            <p>ROGER<br>
              So we film the interview, and we can just slap it on at the end.</p>
            <p>Wayne and Unruly Julie grab chairs and sit.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Okay, let's see it.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of video monitor screen. We see a show rewinding.</p>
            <p>ROGER (O.S.)<br>
              Now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode. But we 
              put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily 
              so you can see it with some scope.</p>
            <p>WAYNE (V.O.)<br>

            <p>Wayne is standing in the middle of an empty highway. The CAMERA 
              looks up from the ground. With a WIDE ANGLE lens, he looks practically 
              mythic.</p>
            <p>Wayne speaks into the camera.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Hello. Welcome to &quot;American Maniacs&quot;. I'm your host Wayne 
              Gayle. And this is Highway 58.</p>
            <p>Wayne walks toward the CAMERA. We DOLLY back.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              To some the fastest distance between point A and point B. To others 
              a beautiful stretch to the American landscape. But to Mickey and 
              Mallory Know, it was a candy land of murder and mayhem.</p>
            <p>While we hear Wayne's narration, we see a MONTAGE of home 8mm movie

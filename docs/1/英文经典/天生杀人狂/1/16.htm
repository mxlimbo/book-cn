              EXT. COUNTY JAIL - DAY</p>
            <p>The doors swing wide in SLOW MOTION as the caravan of Mickey, Mallory, 
              Wayne and Duncan take their first step into the open air.</p>
            <p>A crescent of deputies frame the group in the BACKGROUND while 
              Wurlitzer stands, defeated, just behind Mickey.</p>
            <p>FREEZE FRAME on WIDE ANGLE.</p>
            <p>Image DISSOLVES to BLACK &amp; WHITE before BURNING into WHITE 
              LEADER.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. WOODS - DAY</p>
            <p>The WHITE LEADER is disrupted by a fogged image in BLACK &amp; 
              WHITE. The image settles into a EXTREME CLOSEUP of Wayne. He's being 
              filmed by a 16mm CAMERA that he is presently balancing on a fence 
              post.</p>
            <p>This entire SCENE is played out cinema verite. The SOUND is not 
              in sync as Wayne steps back into a MED SHOT. He looks directly into 
              the CAMERA.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              This is Wayne Gayle. I'm wounded and my crew, Roger and Scott, are 
              dead. This may be out of sync 'cause we are shooting with a wild 
              camera and a standard recorder we found in the van. Mickey Knox's 
              plan worked. We walked out the front door, into my news van and 
              made our getaway. When we were followed by patrol cars, Mallory 
              Knox killed Deputy Sheriff Duncan Homolka and tosses his body out 
              of the back. Mickey told authorities over my police band that I 
              would surely be next if they didn't give up the pursuit. They took 
              Mickey at his word and called off the pursuit. Why helicopters weren't 
              employed, I don't know. My only thought is it all happened too fast 
              for arrangements to be made. We've just pulled off to the side of 
              the road to do this interview. Tensions run high -</p>
            <p>Mickey screams off screen.</p>
            <p>MICKEY (O.S.)<br>
              We ain't got all fuckin' day!</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory... </p>
            <p>Wayne steps forward and picks up the CAMERA and while conducting 
              his interview, the CAMERA remains hand held.</p>
            <p>CAMERA focuses on Mallory sitting on a stump, while Mickey paces 
              in and out of FRAME in the BACKGROUND.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan? Did you think it would 
              work?</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized 
              they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of 
              the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' 
              But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt 
              in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. 
              He knew it would work.</p>
            <p>WAYNE (O.S.)<br>
              What did you think them?</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. 
              And I wondered it I could wait that long.</p>
            <p>WAYNE (O.S.)<br>
              Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said?... Oh, I'm 
              sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?</p>
            <p>WAYNE (O.S.)<br>
              Try to keep it to a minimum.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              We had nothing to do with that riot. That riot was just - whatchacallit 
              -</p>
            <p>Mickey can be heard faintly in the BACKGROUND.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Divine intervention.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              What he said. We didn't know jack shit about and riot. It just happened. 
              It was kismet. We didn't even know those people. How are we supposed 
              to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the 
              past year? Just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.<br>
              (laughs)<br>
              I mean, it's not like we care. If they wanna say we masterminded 
              the whole thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep us up at night. 
              But you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just 
              lucky.</p>
            <p>Mickey's snapping his fingers in the background.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.</p>
            <p>WAYNE (O.S.)<br>
              So, what now?</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy. Just enjoy each 
              other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, 
              stuff like that.</p>
            <p>WAYNE (O.S.)<br>
              How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous 
              couple in America.</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              Well, back in slave times they had a thing called the underground 
              railroad. And we got a whole fan club out there just waiting to 
              be conductors.<br>
              (to the camera)<br>
              So, you kids out there, keep the faith. Cause Mickey and Mallory 
              will be comin' to your town real soon.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Okay, that's enough. End of interview. We gotta move.</p>
            <p>Mickey approaches Wayne. CAMERA goes a little haywire as Wayne 
              lowers it from his eye.</p>
            <p>WAYNE (O.S.)<br>
              Okay, just let me swing around and film myself asking the questions. 
              And then I'll do my little wrap up.</p>
            <p>Mickey takes the CAMERA from Wayne, and while he speaks, he balances 
              it on a fence post.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Oh, we're gonna do a little wrap up, all right. But it won't be 
              you starin' in the camera, looking dumb, and acting stupid. Instead, 
              you're gonna be starin' down the barrels of our shotguns and we're 
              gonna be pullin' the triggers.</p>
            <p>Wayne forces a chuckle. Mickey steps away from the CAMERA and into 
              a THREE SHOT. The NEWS VAN is parked in the background.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              That's a joke right?</p>
            <p>Mickey pumps the slide of his shotgun. Mallory grabs her shotgun 
              from off the ground.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Just wait one fucking minute.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just 
              did a interview.<br>
              (to Mallory)<br>
              We did an interview, didn't we?</p>
            <p>MALLORY<br>
              Looked like an interview to me.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill 
              you.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Wait! I don't know, but I kinda felt during this... this whole escape 
              that a kind of bond -</p>
            <p>Wayne is shaking.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              (continues)<br>
              ... developed between the tree of us. We're kinda in this together, 
              don't ya think?</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              No. Not really.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven 
              that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead... Wayne 
              Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But 
              me! I'll be your passport outta -</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate you. If anybody in the fuckin' 
              world deserves to die, it's you.</p>
            <p>Wayne is grasping for anything.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and Mallory always leave somebody 
              alive to tell the tale.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              We are.<br>
              (points to camera)<br>
              Your camera.</p>
            <p>Mickey turns to Mallory.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              (John Wayne voice)<br>
              Let's make a little music, Colorada.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              NO!!!</p>
            <p>The two interview subjects start PUMPING rounds into Wayne, who's 
              body dances like a puppet before collapsing to the ground.</p>
            <p>Mickey and Mallory kiss each other passionately, then climbing 
              into the news van, they drive away.</p>
            <p>Wayne's body lay peacefully in FRAME until the CAMERA eventually 
              runs out of film.</p>

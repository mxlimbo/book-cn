              INT. GRACE'S HOME - NIGHT</p>
            <p>CAMERA is LOW ANGLE as Tim backs up after his attack. We notice 
              the High School Ring he wears on his right fist as he steps into 
              a fighting stance, ready for Mickey to drop.</p>
            <p>Mickey, however, spits out a stream of blood, and smiles at him.</p>

              INT. COURTROOM - DAY</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Mickey.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Then, after shrugging off four blows to the head like I was Superman. 
              I lifted Tim-nine-years-of-Jeet-Kune-Do-Mulberry off the ground 
              and threw him across the room.</p>
            <p>Mickey, with arms raised over his head, pantomimes throwing Tim's 
              body.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. GRACE'S HOME - NIGHT</p>
            <p>WIDE SHOT as Tim flies into FRAME, CRASHING into the living room 
              wall.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. COURTROOM - DAY</p>
            <p>We quickly PAN down a number of items with white evidence tags 
              on them. We stop at Mickey's Buck Knife. Mickey's hand comes into 
              FRAME and picks up the knife.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Then I took... </p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Mickey as he brings the knife into FRAME.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              ... this knife and proceeded to tear him limb from limb. And this 
              man, whose hands are lethal weapons -</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Bisbing as she stands.</p>
            <p>BISBING<br>
              Objection, defense is intimidating the witness with the murder weapon.</p>
            <p>JUDGE STEINSMA (O.S.)<br>
              Sustained. Mr. Knox, put the knife down.</p>
            <p>Mickey is locked on Grace.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              (continued)<br>
              - had little to no defense.</p>
            <p>GRACE<br>
              (yelling)<br>
              I don't know how you did it, but you did it!</p>
            <p>JUDGE STEINSMA<br>
              Mr. Knox! The knife!</p>
            <p>Mickey glances to the judge, then slowly places the knife back 
              on the table.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              How do you think a human being could possibly be capable of doing 
              something like that?</p>
            <p>Mickey locks eyes with eyes.</p>
            <p>GRACE<br>
              (yelling)<br>
              I don't know!</p>
            <p>Mickey is on top of her.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              Now... I don't believe that Grace. I think you have a definite opinion 
              on how I was able to do those things you described. Now, I'm going 
              to ask you again. And I want you to remember you are under oath.</p>
            <p>Grace collects herself.</p>
            <p>MICKEY (O.S.)<br>
              In your opinion, Miss Mulberry, how was I able to murder you brother 
              Tim Mulberry in the manner you described.</p>
            <p>The Judge looks down at Grace.</p>
            <p>Grace looks back into her open palm.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of the ring.</p>
            <p>BACK TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              MICKEY</p>
            <p>bearing down on her, waiting for an answer.</p>
            <p>BACK TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              GRACE</p>
            <p>As we slowly DOLLY closer she looks up at Mickey timidly.</p>
            <p>GRACE<br>
              (softly)<br>
              You're not human.</p>
            <p>Mickey smiles.</p>
            <p>GRACE<br>
              I thought about it a lot. And the only thing I could figure is that 
              you're not human.</p>
            <p>Bisbing hides her disappointment by looking down.</p>
            <p>Mickey straightens up as Grace continues.</p>
            <p>GRACE<br>
              You're a vampire, or the devil, or a monster, or cyborg, or something 
              like that. But you're not human.</p>
            <p>Grace breaks down. Putting her hands to her head to stop the pain.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Mickey smiling down at her.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Mallory smiling proudly at Mickey.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Judge Steinsma betraying no emotion looks down at Grace.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Grace sobbing, she tries to collect herself by clutching 
              the ring tighter.</p>
            <p>Mickey rolls his pencil in his hand the CAMERA tilts up as he leans 
              into a CLOSEUP.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              (softly)<br>
              Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing... </p>
            <p>GRACE<br>
              (softly into her lap)<br>
              What... </p>
            <p>Mickey smiles.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              You're right.</p>
            <p>Grace tearfully looks up and meets Mickey's demonic glare as he 
              plunges his pencil deep into her chest. Grace's eyes go wide as 
              Mickey's vicious attack continues.</p>
            <p>CAMERA whips to CLOSEUP of Bisbing jumping up screaming as pandemonium 
              breaks out behind her in SLOW MOTION.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of pencil puncturing Grace's blood soaked chest in SLOW 
              MOTION.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Judge Steinsma slams his gavel while directing the Sheriff 
              Deputies in SLOW MOTION.</p>

            <p>EXTREME CLOSEUP of Grace a tear rolls out of her widen eye in SLOW 
              MOTION.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Mickey. His attack is unending in SLOW MOTION.</p>
            <p>MEDIUM CLOSEUP of Grace goes limp. As the Sheriff Deputies reach 
              Mickey from all sides the pencil breaks off inside Grace in SLOW 
              MOTION.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of the bloody eraser end of the pencil in Mickey's hand 
              in SLOW MOTION.</p>
            <p>SIDE ANGLE as Grace's head falls back into a CLOSEUP. Her mouth 
              plops open and as her eyelids close, they pinch out a tear that 
              rolls down her cheek in SLOW MOTION.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Mickey's torso as the Sheriff Deputies wrestle him away 
              from Grace. Mickey still has the bloody end of the pencil.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of Grace's hand dropping into frame and as her fist opens, 
              the ring falls in SLOW MOTION.</p>
            <p>CLOSEUP of the ring hitting the floor and rolling out of frame.</p>
            <p>DOLLY along side the rolling ring on the floor until it hits a 
              shoe and stops.</p>
            <p>EXTREME CLOSEUP of Mickey's eyes looking down at his feet.</p>
            <p>EXTREME CLOSEUP of Mickey dropping the bloody pencil stub. CAMERA 
              follows it in SLOW MOTION.</p>

            <p>Mickey smiles and glances toward Judge.</p>
            <p>MICKEY<br>
              No further questions your honor.</p>
            <p>Mickey turns forward still wrestling the Deputies.</p>

            <p><br>
              EXT. COURTHOUSE REAR - DAY</p>
            <p>Mickey, dressed in county blues, is led out of the courtroom by 
              sheriffs deputies. He's cuffed hand and leg. Reporters throw out 
              questions, photographers shoot photos, Mickey is somewhere else, 
              no mugging to the crowd this time.</p>
            <p>WAYNE (V.O.)<br>
              After the deadly brewhaha in the courtroom, the judge, honorable 
              Burt Steinsma, passed down a sentence that was to make legal history.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. JUDGE'S DEN - DAY</p>
            <p>Interview with Judge Steinsma in his den at home.</p>
            <p>MOS SHOT of Wayne and Judge talking.</p>
            <p>WAYNE (V.O.)<br>
              We spoke with retired Judge Steinsma at his home in Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
            <p>The interview:</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Was there any vengeance on your part with your unique sentence?</p>
            <p>JUDGE STEINSMA<br>
              Yes, unquestionably. After they did what they did in my court, and 
              judge worth his robe will tell you the same thing. It couldn't help 
              but affect my decision. That's why they have judges. We're supposed 
              to be fair to a fault, but when it's showtime, we have to make a 
              decision. That's why we don't just input all the facts into a computer 
              for the appropriate punishment. I couldn't give them the death penalty. 
              Se, California hops back and forth on that issue. Mickey and Mallory 
              went to court when it was out of favor, which is actually good because 
              it leaves more room for imagination. Anybody can give somebody the 
              chair. When you have someone who deserves to die and you can't kill 
              them, you have to be creative. And if the bastards had let it stand, 
              it would of been the perfect sentence. It hit 'em right where they 
              lived. Far more punishing than the death sentence.</p>
            <p>WAYNE<br>
              Would you please describe for our viewers what your sentence was?</p>
            <p>JUDGE STEINSMA<br>
              Well, in a rouge's gallery of killers, Mickey and Mallory are very 
              unique. I've seen a lot of killers in my day and they're a very 
              cold lot. They have no more feelings about taking a person's life 
              than squashing a tiny bug. It's all the same to them. Well, Mickey 
              and Mallory were that &quot;kill 'em to watch their expression change&quot; 
              attitude personified. Except with each other. And, since they lived 
              only for each other, I wanted to attack that, at its very root. 
              So, in a nutshell, my sentence was double life for each without 
              any possibility for parole. That would be fairly standard in their 
              case. The twist I added was that the husband and wife would have 
              no contact or correspondence with each other for the rest of their 
              lives. And they would never receive any word or information about 
              the other. So, basically once the cell door slams shut, Mickey and 
              Mallory will completely disappear from each other's life. They'll 
              never know when the other dies. But alas, the best laid plans of 
              mice and men... </p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. COURTHOUSE REAR - DAY</p>
            <p>Mallory in tears, hysterically actually, is cuffed hand to foot, 
              and being dragged by sheriff's deputies into the prison bus. Reporters 
              throw out questions, photographers shoot photos, TV news people 
              capture the moment on video.</p>
            <p>The bus pulls out onto the street.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>

            <p>Shot though bars of Mallory in her cell. Her back is to the camera.</p>
            <p>WAYNE (V.O.)<br>
              The sentence was never to reach that point. Because after only a 
              year, Mickey and Mallory created so much mayhem that it was decided... 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              INSERT: FRONT PAGE NEWSPAPER</p>

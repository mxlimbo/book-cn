            <p>EXT. WINDMILL -- DAY</p>
            <p>A massive, wooden WINDMILL, raised off the ground on a 7' center 
              post. Ichabod and Masbath walk to it.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. WINDMILL -- DAY</p>
            <p>Ichabod and Young Masbath enter via a ladder from the underbelly. 
              Gears and counter wheels turn millstones. A few men work in the 
              grain powder filled air.</p>
            <p>Ichabod leads the way to a staircase, up twists and turns.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATHM<br>
              Where are we going?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Up.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. WINDMILL ROOF -- DAY</p>
            <p>Ichabod and Young Masbath climb out a door to the roof. The rotors 
              spin nearby. Ichabod searches the countryside.</p>
            <p>Below, MANY MEN are ride up the long straight road.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              What is it?</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              It's payment day. Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each 
              month. Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers.</p>
            <p>Ichabod sits, takes a bowl from his bag and gives it to Masbath, 
              then produces a bottle of water... fills the bowl.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              (points)<br>
              Out there. What do you see?</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              The Western Woods.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Look again.</p>
            <p>A plume of smoke rises from woods, far.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Smoke. Chimney smoke.</p>
            <p>Ichabod holds a piece of straw in his mouth, rubs the point of 
              a sewing needle against a small BLACK ROCK.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Are you familiar with magnets?</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              What kind of nuts?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Not for eating, I assure you. Watch here.</p>
            <p>Ichabod shows the magnet grab the needle. Young Masbath is amazed, 
              reaching for it. Ichabod watches him play with it.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              It's spectacular.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              (smiles, pause)<br>
              Yes... I suppose it is. Keep it.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              No, I couldn't...</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              I have others. All I need is this.</p>
            <p>Ichabod takes the needle, poking its butt end into the tip of the 
              straw. Young Masbath studies the rock, pockets it.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Thank you.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              (nods, almost shy)<br>
              Now, hold the bowl steady. Back to business.</p>
            <p>Young Masbath lifts the bowl. Ichabod drops the in needle/straw, 
              which floats and turns compass-like.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for 
              ourselves.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              (uneasy)<br>
              Father said witches live there.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Witches do not exist. However...</p>
            <p>Ichabod uses a knife to notch the bowl lip where the needle points, 
              then surveys the smoke, making a second notch.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Not long ago, I would have said the same for Headless Horseman.</p>
            <p>KATRINA (o.s.)<br>
              Constable... !</p>
            <p>Katrina's on horseback below, unhappy.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              I need to speak with you. Alone.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. VAN TASSEL GREAT LAWN -- DAY</p>
            <p>Ichabod and Katrina lead their horses. A heated argument.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Why would you do such a thing?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              No stone may be left unturned. it may appear harsh...</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              I have misjudged you I think. I did not imagine you were so cruel.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run 
              through by a sword. I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose 
              path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my 
              own eyes.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              What are you on about?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to 
              birthing. The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Must I hear this?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              There was no blind stabbing. This singular thrust found its target 
              omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died 
              with its mother.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              And this gives worth to butchery?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              It was not butchery.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              What is it then? Scientific method? How can any of this matter in 
              the slightest?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore 
              it.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane. He follows 
              with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand. But, what 
              do you want?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              To avenge his father, and the others.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              But, why? Tell me why.</p>
            <p>Ichabod struggles for a reply.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the 
              whole of your heart into it. Can't you see? You'll bring dignity 
              to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to 
              do it.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              (fed up, growing anger)<br>
              If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's 
              life, you would not question it. Not for a moment. So, let me be 
              the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering 
              mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking 
              as yours. And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world 
              will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.</p>
            <p>Katrina storms away. Ichabod's already regretting.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. BELLTOWER FIELD -- DAY</p>
            <p>Ichabod and Young Masbath ride to the Western Woods, horses loaded 
              for expedition. At the Belltower remnants, Ichabod slows, looking 
              to the wreckage.<br>
              At forest's edge, Young Masbath waits.</p>
            <p>Ichabod circles the tower. With a sigh, he rides to join Young 
              Masbath. They head into the woods.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. WESTERN WOODS -- DAY</p>
            <p>Dark, dense and creepy. Ichabod and Young Masbath move through. 
              Young Masbath halts his horse and looks around.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              What is it?</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Listen.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              (listens, looks)<br>
              I hear nothing.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              No crickets or cicadas calling. No bird songs.</p>
            <p>Stark quiet. Ichabod notes this unhappily.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. WESTERN WOODS -- LATER DAY</p>
            <p>Ichabod's hand drops the needle/straw in the water bowl. The needle 
              spins. The bowl is turned to match notches.</p>
            <p>Ichabod points the way to Young Masbath.</p>
            <p>ELSEWHERE, SOMEONE WATCHES: A MOVING P.O.V, WATCHES them as they 
              ride. FOLLOWS.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. WESTERN WOODS, FURTHER ON -- LATER DAY</p>
            <p>Ichabod and Masbath reach a hill crest. They stop, uneasy. Below: 
              a CAVE with a rock archway. An ill-fitting door covers the mouth. 
              The chimney spews smoke.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              We have apparently arrived.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. CAVE HOME -- DAY</p>
            <p>The horses are tied to a tree. Ichabod walks to the cave door. 
              Unsure, he hesitantly knocks.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. CAVE HOME -- DAY</p>
            <p>Ichabod and Young Masbath step in.</p>
            <p>Walls are hung with skins and skeletons, dry flowers and reed grass 
              in patterns. An OLD CRONE sits facing away.</p>
            <p>The old Crone, a mountain woman with matted hair and grey features, 
              sits disinterested. Ichabod edges closer.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Pardon. You did not answer when I knocked. Are we intruding?</p>
            <p>OLD CRONE<br>
              You are from the Hollow?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              In a way, yes.</p>
            <p>Ichabod looks at tables of gourd bowls of dead insects and acorns. 
              Knifes, scissors, yellow bones. He takes the Lenape's piece of reed 
              grass from his pocket.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              The Lenape who lived in these woods ... do you know him? The Redman? 
              (uncomfortable wait)<br>
              I should tell you... he has been murdered.</p>
            <p>OLD CRONE<br>
              Leave me. You are not welcome here.</p>
            <p>The old Crone places something on a table beside her -- a dead 
              cardinal, bright red.</p>
            <p>Ichabod is afraid, backing away, but Young Masbath takes the woven 
              piece and steps to the Crone.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Were you a friend to the Indian? (waits)<br>
              You should have this... if you were his friend.</p>
            <p>Young Masbath puts the woven piece beside the cardinal. He walks 
              to join Ichabod in leaving.</p>
            <p>OLD CRONE<br>
              You seek remedy against the Horseman?</p>
            <p>The Old Crone reaches to pick up the weaving. She stands, faces 
              them. Tall. Ichabod nods.</p>
            <p>OLD CRONE<br>
              (to Young Masbath)<br>
              Go out and keep away, child.<br>
              (to Ichabod)<br>
              You stay. Follow with me.</p>
            <p>The Old Crone takes a candle and walks, deep into the cave.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. CAVE HOME, LOWER CAVE -- DAY</p>
            <p>The Old Crone comes through a passage in the wet walls. Ichabod 
              enters, scared, bent under low ceiling.</p>
            <p>OLD CRONE<br>
              I hear him. He rides to the Hollow and back.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              The Horseman. Yes.</p>
            <p><br>
              OLD CRONE<br>
              Sit.</p>
            <p>Ichabod sits on crooked stool. The old Crone kneels with her back 
              to him, gathers straw in a pile on the floor.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Can you help?</p>
            <p>OLD CRONE<br>
              You want to see into the nether world... I can show you. Whatever 
              you see, do not move or speak. I will hold him.</p>
            <p>She gathers bowls, putting grass and powder on the pile.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              What... what are you doing?</p>
            <p>OLD CRONE<br>
              (turns, furious)<br>
              Close your mouth! Keep silent.</p>
            <p>She takes two jars f rom a table, pours ashes on the pile from 
              one. She shakes the other roughly, takes the lid off and upends 
              it. A baby bat squirms on the floor, dazed.</p>
            <p>The Old Crone holds the bat, using a knife to cut off its head. 
              -She soaks the straw with blood, SPEAKING IN TONGUES, guttural. 
              Using a wick, she lights the straw.</p>
            <p>She grasps two METAL CUFFS with chains attached, slides these onto 
              her bony wrists, then bends to inhale smoke.</p>
            <p>OLD CRONE<br>
              He comes now.</p>
            <p>Ichabod would like to leave now.</p>

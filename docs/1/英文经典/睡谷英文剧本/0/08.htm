            <p>Dawn light, is visible over forests pounded by rain.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALL -- MORNING</p>
            <p>Ichabod exits his room, satchel in hand. He looks down the hall, 
              then steps back in to take a white rose from a vase.</p>
            <p>AROUND A CORNER, Ichabod comes to the last door. He bends, slipping 
              the white rose under the crack of the door.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- MORNING</p>
            <p>Rain. Ichabod comes out. Across the lawn, Young Masbath is bringing 
              the horses.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL (O.S.)<br>
              Good morrow, Constable.</p>
            <p>Ichabod turns to see Lady Van Tassel in a chair, sewing.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              Returning to the western Woods?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Yes, actually.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              Use caution.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              (nods, studies her)<br>
              Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from 
              you my entire time here.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              As my husband says, a wife should be always like an echo, and at 
              the same time, quite unlike an echo.<br>
              (off Ichabod's confusion) Like an echo, she should speak only when 
              spoken to, and unlike an echo, should never try to have the last 
              word. or, at least that is what he believes.</p>
            <p>Baltus comes out the door, irritable, skillet in hand.</p>
            <p>BALTUS<br>
              Constable... did you notice anything out of the ordinary during 
              the night?</p>
            <p>Ichabod eyes the skillet, ill at ease, trying not to be.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              um... I ... I did not... no. Why?</p>
            <p>BALTUS<br>
              Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl. Her things are gone. 
              Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.<br>
              (to Lady Van Tassel) What about breakfast, woman? Or, am I to starve 
              to death?</p>
            <p>Lady Van Tassel gets up and goes in, taking the skillet.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              I should be going... good day to you.</p>
            <p>Ichabod heads towards Young Masbath. Baltus watches from the porch, 
              disgruntled. He goes in.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. WESTERN WOODS -- DAY</p>
            <p>Heavy rain. Ichabod and Young Masbath ride side by side.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by 
              the Hessian. Someone only tried to make it look that way.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              You grow sharper by the minute, little man. It boggles my mind, 
              but I begin to prefer your company over all others.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              (laughs)<br>
              True enough.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Then, who murdered the Old Crone? And why?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.</p>
            <p>A SOUND is HEARD. Ichabod looks back, then to Masbath.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Quicken pace.</p>
            <p>Ichabod rides faster. Young Masbath keeps up.</p>
            <p>FURTHER ON, they charge over a hill. Ichabod halts Gunpowder and 
              climbs clumsily off.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Ride on.</p>
            <p>Young Masbath obeys. Ichabod takes out his pistol and wades into 
              forest growth, backtracking.</p>
            <p>INSIDE THE FOREST, Ichabod bounds through underbrush, low. A HORSE 
              is HEARD SNORTING. He pushes through branches...</p>
            <p>Moving behind a FIGURE IN A GREY CLOAK on horseback.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Halt and turn. I have a pistol aimed at your head.</p>
            <p>The figure stops, pushes off the cloak hood. Katrina.</p>
            <p><br>
              KATRINA<br>
              It is only me.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Katrina. why do you follow?</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              I apologize if I worried you.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              A woman should not be out alone in these woods.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              But, I am not alone, am I? I only wished to see what you were up 
              to, and...<br>
              (takes out WHITE ROSE)To thank you.</p>
            <p>Ichabod softens, but doesn't want to.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Come along.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- DAY</p>
            <p>Raining still. Ichabod, Masbath and Katrina come into a clearing, 
              mouths falling open at the sight of...</p>
            <p>A monstrously huge TREE OF THE DEAD, at the clearing's center, 
              with branches reaching far and wide, knotted and gross, like agony 
              captured in wood sculpture.</p>
            <p>Ichabod dismounts, crossing a line beyond which grass and weeds 
              will not grow. Young Masbath and Katrina dismount.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              You were right... it does draw attention to itself.</p>
            <p>Ichabod stares up into the endless, dead canopy of branches. He 
              circles the incredibly wide trunk.</p>
            <p>There's a VERTICAL WOUND in the bark, as if the tree once had a 
              terrible hole in it, now partially healed and disgustingly scarred. 
              Ichabod approaches.</p>
            <p>He feels the mushy scar, picking at its scabs till much sap begins 
              to trickle. It is red and Ichabod fingers it.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Blood.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              What did you say?</p>
            <p>Ichabod goes to where Katrina and Masbath wait with the horses, 
              digs in a saddle bag for a hand axe.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              What is it?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Stay back.</p>
            <p>At the trunk, Ichabod thumps the flat end of the axe against the 
              suture. It sounds hollow. Ichabod begins to chop.<br>
              He pulls away loose bark. The tree drips more blood and a clear 
              goo. Ichabod uses both hands on the axe to hack at the festering 
              suture.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              What are you doing?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Just... keep where you are.</p>
            <p>Ignoring, Young Masbath moves closer. Ichabod keeps chopping, then 
              grips a large, loose flap of wood, trying to bend it. It's not easy. 
              Ichabod struggles.</p>
            <p>Katrina follows Masbath's slow advance.</p>
            <p>Ichabod's pulling... the flap suddenly gives, revealing a blood-soaked, 
              wide-eyed, gap-mouthed HUMAN HEAD.</p>
            <p>Ichabod recoils. Behind him, Katrina stifles a scream, taking Young 
              Masbath in her arms to keep him from looking.</p>
            <p>It is Philipse's head, hanging off the trunk flap, held by roots 
              grown around and into the flesh.</p>
            <p>Ichabod reapproaches, back of his hand to his mouth.</p>
            <p>FOUR other SEVERED, DECAYING HEADS are held by ingrown roots within 
              the dewy innards.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              My God... what has happened?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.</p>
            <p>He looks to the branches towering above.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Must be some sort of gateway. But, why this place... ?</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              We should go.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Why this tree?</p>
            <p>Ichabod begins looking at the ground, moving around the tree. He 
              gets to his knees, pushing mud away.</p>
            <p>Uncovering a flush HEADSTONE carved with &quot;666.&quot;</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              (to himself)<br>
              &quot;Climb down to the Horseman's soulless place.&quot;</p>
            <p>(to Masbath)<br>
              Bring the shovel.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- LATER DAY</p>
            <p>Rain. Young Masbath's crouched, muddy, rifle across his knees. 
              He's watching the tree.<br>
              Behind him, Katrina climbs out of the shallow grave near a pile 
              of mud. Ichabod hands up the shovel.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Masbath, we've found it.</p>
            <p>Young Masbath goes to the grave. Ichabod pulls at thick burlap 
              cloth, straining as it comes away.</p>
            <p>Ichabod looks down, disbelieving.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              It cannot be true.</p>
            <p>WE SEE: roots have gripped the Horseman's bones and tattered uniform. 
              The skeleton is all there -- except the skull.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              The skull is gone.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Yes. I did notice that, thank you.</p>
            <p>Ichabod climbs out, weary in body and spirit. LIGHTNING. THUNDER. 
              He stares at the bones.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              This is his silent shrieking... and his desire, to reclaim his head.</p>
            <p>Ichabod turns, looking to the bordering forest.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              &quot;He who holds fast the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping 
              hand.&quot;<br>
              (pause)<br>
              Someone controls the Horseman.</p>
            <p>KATRINA (o.s.)<br>
              Ichabod!</p>
            <p>Ichabod turns, looks...</p>
            <p>Katrina and Young Masbath back away, because the ROOTS in the grave 
              are ALIVE, further entwining around remains.</p>
            <p>Ichabod spins to the twisted tree...</p>
            <p>The vertical SUTURE SEETHES, pulling inwards... sucking Philipse's 
              head back in and closing, bubbling.</p>
            <p>Ichabod bounds over grave dirt pile, hastening Katrina and Young 
              Masbath along as he flees.</p>
            <p>At the tree, the suture swells.</p>
            <p>Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath pass where their freaking horses 
              are tied to a fallen trunk, heading for cover.</p>
            <p>A RUMBLING is HEARD from the twisted tree, which suddenly BURSTS 
              wide, spitting smoldering cinders.</p>
            <p>At the tree line, Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath cower, looking 
              back.</p>
            <p>From the tree wound, a glow brightens, till the Headless Horseman 
              and Daredevil EXPLODE-into existence...</p>
            <p>They hit the ground running.</p>
            <p>Ichabod watches the Horseman ride away with bolts of LIGHTNING 
              STRIKING the GROUND BEHIND.</p>
            <p>The Horseman disappears in the forest.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              His next victim is chosen!</p>
            <p>(to Masbath)<br>
              Give me distance, then guide her back to the Hollow.</p>
            <p>Ichabod runs towards the horses.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Constable!</p>

            <p>The Horseman-rips past on Daredevil.</p>

              EXT. BEHIND IN WESTERN WOODS -- DAY</p>
            <p>Ichabod rides as fast as Gunpowder is able.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY</p>
            <p>Small home. Killian, Thomas and Beth have finished supper. Beth 
              clears plates as Killian picks his teeth with a knife.</p>
            <p>THOMAS<br>
              May I be excused, father?</p>
            <p>KILLIAN<br>
              Do you deserve to be?</p>
            <p>THIRD MAN<br>
              (shyly)<br>
              I think so.</p>
            <p>KILLIAN<br>
              (smiles)<br>
              Then, go.</p>
            <p>Thomas gets down from his chair. He goes to the fireplace to light 
              a tallow wick, which he takes to the next room.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><br>
              INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY</p>
            <p>Thomas plops on the floor and lights his MAGIC LANTERN: a lantern 
              with an outer sleeve of glass painted with silhouettes of lions 
              and monsters.</p>
            <p>Thomas turns the lantern and looks to the walls where the creatures, 
              shadows are thrown. He roars for them, imagining them real and having 
              a grand time.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY</p>
            <p>Beth comes for more dishes.</p>
            <p>BETH<br>
              Don't pick teeth. You teach Thomas bad habits.</p>
            <p>Killian pulls her to him, playful.</p>
            <p>KILLIAN<br>
              I am a bad habit. There's nothing for it.</p>
            <p>BETH<br>
              (kisses him)<br>
              No one knows better than I.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY</p>
            <p>Thomas continues his fun, shadow animals circling him.</p>
            <p>In the shifting light, a baby spider comes from a crack in the 
              wall. Then, another spider skitters out. More follow.</p>

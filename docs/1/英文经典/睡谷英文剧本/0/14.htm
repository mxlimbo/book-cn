          <td> EXT. THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT 
            <p>The coach hits the long straight road, away from the house.</p>
            <p>Katrina and Masbath hold on as the coach shakes violently.<br>
              KATRINA<br>
              Where are we going?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              I do not know. Away.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Here he comes!</p>
            <p>Behind, the Horseman can be seen on the forest bordered road. Closing 
              fast. Breakneck pace.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              We might make it to the church.</p>
            <p>Masbath takes a lantern, crawls back to the roof.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Masbath... !</p>
            <p>He ignores, reaching the rear of the coach and throwing the lantern 
              at the Horseman. It smashes on the trail.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Damn it, boy, get back here!</p>
            <p>Young Masbath slides back. Katrina helps him.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              What can we do?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Take the reins.</p>
            <p>Young Masbath takes them. Ichabod slings Van Ripper's rifle over 
              his shoulder and starts back. Katrina grips him.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Masbath is right. We must do something.</p>
            <p>She releases. Ichabod gets to the luggage area at the rear, struggling 
              to open a storage box.</p>
            <p>Behind, the Horseman draws his sword, closer.</p>
            <p>Ichabod opens the box, hefting out a long, jagged SAW.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Ichabod!</p>
            <p>Ichabod looks. The Horseman rides up, swinging...</p>
            <p>Ichabod recoils -- THWACK -- just missed by sword.</p>
            <p>The Horseman lets the coach get a ahead, shifting to the other 
              side of the trail... coming along side.</p>
            <p>Ichabod backpedals, looking to Masbath.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Keep him off! Block him!</p>
            <p>Masbath guides the horses over. The Horseman must fall behind to 
              avoid the wheels.</p>
            <p>The coach hits a large, fallen tree trunk.</p>
            <p>Ichabod bounces, falling...</p>
            <p>He hangs off the side of the coach.</p>
            <p>Katrina climbs to offer her hand. Ichabod offers the saw.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Take it!</p>
            <p>Katrina takes the saw. Now with both hands, Ichabod tries for better 
              purchase. He grips the coach door. It opens...</p>
            <p>Ichabod clings to the open door as branches slam him.</p>
            <p>He's reaching to the coach threshold, reaching...</p>
            <p>Ichabod pulls himself inside.</p>
            <p>BOOM -- the door hits a tree trunk, bashed to pieces.</p>
            <p>Ichabod looks out from the coach, dazed. He climbs.</p>
            <p>Katrina looks back as Young Masbath guides the coach to block the 
              Horseman again.</p>
            <p>The Horseman sheaths his sword, riding... reaching to grip the 
              back corner of the coach.</p>
            <p>The Horseman dismounts, clinging, climbing...</p>
            <p>Ichabod takes the rifle off his shoulder, aiming...</p>
            <p>BANG! -- splattering the Horseman's hand point blank. The Horseman 
              hangs on with his other hand.</p>
            <p>The Horseman re-grips with the blasted hand, amazing since it now 
              all mush and bone.</p>
            <p>Ichabod throws the rifle on his way to the driver's perch, taking 
              the saw from Katrina.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Move forward!</p>
            <p>Katrina looks to the horses, then at Ichabod.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Go!</p>
            <p>Ichabod takes the reins from Young Masbath.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Help her.</p>
            <p>Reins in one hand and saw in the other, Ichabod waits. The Horseman 
              rises up and moves in, taking out his sword.</p>
            <p>Young Masbath climbs down to the wooden pole connecting the coach 
              to the bridles, puts out his hand. Katrina takes it.<br>
              Behind, the Horseman swings. Ichabod blocks with the saw.</p>
            <p>Young Masbath guides Katrina as she leaps onto one horse. Bareback. 
              Young Masbath straddles the horse beside her.</p>
            <p>The Horseman swings, backhanded knocks the sword from Ichabod's 
              hand as Ichabod falls back...</p>
            <p>Ichabod hits the bridle post, hanging onto straps for dear life. 
              His feet drag on the trail.</p>
            <p>Above, the Horseman comes to the driver's perch, close enough to 
              kill Katrina. He raises his sword...</p>
            <p>Katrina screams, ducking, helpless...</p>
            <p>Below, Ichabod pulls a bolt from the coach's hitching-rod.</p>
            <p>He shoves off with his feet.</p>
            <p>The Horseman swings.... missing.</p>
            <p>The horses detach from the coach, dragging Ichabod along.</p>
            <p>The coach careens out of control.</p>
            <p>It flies off the trail, hits an incline and sails off, throwing 
              the Horseman</p>
            <p>The coach hits a tree trunk and SMASHES.</p>
            <p>FURTHER DOWN THE TRAIL, the coach horses stop. Young Masbath and 
              Katrina climb off as Ichabod gets to his feet, hurting, clutching 
              his previously wounded shoulder.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              What now?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              I doubt that's the end.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              The church.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              He moves too fast.</p>
            <p>Ichabod unhooks; a lantern off the bridle rail. The trail behind 
              is silent, till a bone chilling SCREECH is HEARD.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              What was that?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              His horse.</p>
            <p>They start moving. Ichabod looks around. He sees...</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              There...</p>
            <p>Through the tree line, the Hollow's massive windmill can be seen 
              against the sky. Katrina and Young Masbath run.<br>
              EXT. WINDMILL FIELD -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath run into this open area, heading 
              to the windmill. Another HORRIBLE SQUEAL echoes.</p>
            <p>Ichabod looks over his shoulder.</p>
            <p>Heavy, low handing BRANCHES and VINES at the forest edge creep 
              to life, parting... forming a sort of black tunnel.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              He's coming!</p>
            <p>The Horseman gallops out, throwing leaves in his wake.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Hurry!</p>
            <p>The Horseman readies a battle axe.</p>
            <p>Ichabod gets under the windmill, helping Young Masbath up the ladder 
              and in. Katrina next.</p>
            <p>The Horseman is almost there.</p>
            <p>Ichabod follows Katrina. He gets in, feet dangling. The Horseman 
              dismounts...</p>
            <p>INT. WINDMILL -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod leaps up and struggles with the heavy trap door... slams 
              it. He closes the latch just as the Horseman hits. The door buckles.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              It won't hold.</p>
            <p>Ichabod goes to a large GRINDSTONE against a wall. He struggles 
              to roll it.</p>
            <p>Young Masbath helps him roll it to the trap door. It falls on top 
              with a thud. The Horseman's sword jabs up through a grindstone's 
              center hole.</p>
            <p>The sword withdraws. A POUNDING begins.</p>
            <p>EXT. WINDMILL -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>The Horseman chops at the door with his axe.</p>
            <p>INT. WINDMILL -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>POUNDING CONTINUES. The grindstone shifts. Katrina and Young Masbath 
              back away. Ichabod holds his lantern up, desperate for ideas, searching.</p>
            <p>Above, to the right, is the milling platform, where grain is ground 
              and bagged. To the left is the crooked staircase.</p>
            <p>Ichabod picks up a bailing hook, a plan forming. He gives his lantern 
              to Katrina and points.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Get up those stairs. open the door to the roof and wait.</p>
            <p>Katrina and Young Masbath obey. Ichabod crosses and climbs the 
              ladder to the milling platform. He grasps a wooden lever, pulling 
              it. Gears above begin to turn.</p>
            <p>EXT. WINDMILL -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>The windmill's rotors CREAK to life, spinning.</p>
            <p>UNDER THE WINDMILL, the Horseman keeps chopping. His axe exposes 
              grindstone, throwing sparks.</p>
            <p>INT. WINDMILL -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Katrina looks down from the stairs.</p>
            <p>The Horseman's axe pries at the seam of the trap door.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Ichabod...</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Keep climbing. I will follow...</p>
            <p>Ichabod pulls bags of grain, lining them up at the edge of the 
              milling platform.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              (under his breath)<br>
              Hopefully.</p>
            <p>ABOVE, Young Masbath reaches the ceiling, throws open the door 
              to the roof.</p>
            <p>BELOW, Ichabod cuts holes into the grain bags, so milled grain 
              spills out and falls to the floor, creating dust.</p>
            <p>He grabs one open bag and dumps it. More grain dust.</p>
            <p>EXT. WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Masbath and Katrina come out. Rotors spin behind them.</p>
            <p>INT. WINDMILL -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod sees below... the Horseman sticks a hand through, trying 
              to push the grindstone aside, then withdrawing. The RACKING axe 
              continues. Won't be long.</p>
            <p>Ichabod grabs one half-full bag of grain, swings it with effort, 
              throws...</p>
            <p>The bag smashes on the grindstone, busting the door...</p>
            <p>EXT. WINDMILL -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>The grindstone falls through, SLAMMING the Horseman down...</p>
            <p>INT. WINDMILL -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod slices into a sack hanging from a pulley system. More and 
              more dust rises.</p>
            <p>Below, the Horseman enters. Katrina shouts from above.</p>
            <p><br>
              YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Look out!</p>
            <p>The Horseman moves toward the milling platform ladder, but Ichabod 
              grabs it, pulling it up...</p>
            <p>The Horseman just misses the final rung.</p>
            <p>Ichabod throws the ladder aside as the Horseman backs off.</p>
            <p>Ichabod looks to the staircase. No way to climb down from the milling 
              platform and get there.</p>
            <p>The Horseman runs and leaps, grabbing a hanging chain...</p>
            <p>The Horseman climbs the chain, swinging ...</p>
            <p>Ichabod runs across the platform, jumps ...</p>
            <p>Ichabod grasps the frail rail of the staircase, barely.</p>
            <p>The rail creaks, about to break. Behind, the Horseman lands on 
              the milling platform.</p>
            <p>Ichabod is losing grip. Young Masbath races down the stairs, grabs 
              his hand. He pulls Ichabod up.</p>
            <p>Ichabod's pistol slips from its holster and falls.</p>
            <p>Ichabod and Young Masbath look...</p>
            <p>The Horseman, following Ichabod's lead, runs across the milling 
              platform and leaps...</p>
            <p>Grabs the staircase rail, only a few feet from Ichabod and Masbath. 
              Ichabod kicks the rail, breaking it...</p>
            <p>The Horseman falls in billowing dust, crashing below.</p>
            <p>Ichabod pushes Masbath up the stairs.</p>
            <p>EXT. WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Katrina helps them onto the roof.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Quickly, close it.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              No.<br>
              (takes lantern, points)<br>
              Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Jump? Jump where?</p>
            <p>INT. WINDMILL -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>The Horseman runs, agile, up the stairs.</p>
            <p>EXT. WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod shepherds Katrina and Young Masbath to the edge where the 
              rotors spin close.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for 
              me.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              I... I can't do this.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              We have no choice.</p>
            <p>Ichabod moves back to the trap door.</p>
            <p>Katrina and Young Masbath look at the rotors, and down at the long 
              distance between them and the ground.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Be ready...</p>
            <p>Ichabod throws the lantern into the windmill and runs.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Now!</p>
            <p>INT. WINDMILL -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>The Horseman continues up. The lantern falls past.</p>
            <p>EXT. WINDMILL, ROOF -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Young Masbath jumps. Ichabod grips Katrina and jumps...</p>
            <p>They hit one rotor and cling to the frame and cloth. The rotor 
              begins its downwards swing.</p>
            <p>INT. WINDMILL -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>The lantern hits the ground and shatters. FLAMES EXPLODE!</p>
            <p>Grain dust is consumed instantaneously -- FLAMES ROAR upwards, 
              filling the windmill...</p>
            <p>Engulfing the Horseman.</p>
            <p>EXT. WINDMILL -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>The rotor is halfway to its lowest point. Masbath, Katrina and 
              Ichabod hang on as the entire structure trembles.</p>
            <p>BOOM -- flames shoot out the windows, doors and seams, lighting 
              up the night.</p>
            <p>On the rattling rotor, Ichabod struggles to hold the frame with 
              one hand and keep a grip on Katrina.</p>
            <p>Masbath drops. Ichabod releases Katrina, then drops.</p>
            <p>They hit the ground. Ichabod rolls, gasping, holding his shoulder. 
              They all look at each other in disbelief a moment. Ichabod lets 
              out a sort of rasping laugh, standing.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Okay... come on...</p>
            <p>Ichabod ushers them across the field, uphill. Running. Lightning 
              flashes across the sky. THUNDER RUMBLES.<br>
              A bolt strikes the windmill, and it EXPLODES... </p>
            <p>SHOCKWAVE DEAFENING. The rotors bust apart. Splinters of burning 
              wood spin all directions.</p>
            <p>ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath keep running. 
              There is a WOODEN CART parked ahead.</p>
            <p>IN THE WINDMILL RUBBLE, the Horseman rises, shoving off burning 
              debris. His flame-ravaged uniform smolders.</p>
            <p>ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod stumbles onwards, but notices something 
              horrible...</p>
            <p>In the distance, Lady Van Tassel's white horse roams free.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              (as this registers)<br>
              Oh, no...</p>
            <p>Young Masbath and Katrina are just past the cart when Lady Van 
              Tassel rises from behind it, swings a plank...</p>
            <p>SLAMS Ichabod in the chest and sends him down.</p>
            <p>Lady Van Tassel grabs Katrina's hair, drags her.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              Should have stayed away, Constable.</p>
            <p>Ichabod gets up slow, furious, reaches to his holster, only to 
              find it empty. He moves forward.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              Keep back, or I kill her.</p>
            <p>She takes out scissors, holds them to Katrina's neck. Katrina ceases 
              struggling.</p>
            <p>Ichabod keeps Masbath behind him, keeps his distance. Lady Van 
              Tassel shoots a glance...</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              See him...</p>
            <p>Far off, the Horseman strides from the wreckage.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              You cannot kill what is already dead.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Let her go!</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              Yes... yes. I think I will...</p>
            <p>Lady Van Tassel spins and throws Katrina in the cart, shoving against 
              it.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              No!</p>
            <p>The cart rolls downhill. Ichabod moves forward.</p>
            <p>Lady Van Tassel turns, brandishing the scissors, slashing and missing. 
              Ichabod backs off.</p>
            <p>DOWNHILL, the cart picks up speed, headed for the Horseman. </p>
            <p>The Horseman starts running to meet it.</p>
            <p>UPHILL, Lady Van Tassel grins.</p>
            <p>LADY VAN TASSEL<br>
              Say goodbye to her.</p>
            <p>Lady Van Tassel lunges, stabbing. Ichabod avoids, puts all his 
              fury behind his fist -- punches her in the face.</p>
            <p>Lady Van Tassel hits the ground and her bag falls open, sending 
              the Horseman's skull rolling out...</p>
            <p>The skull rolls... rolls... landing far away.</p>
            <p>DOWNHILL, Katrina leaps out from the cart...</p>
            <p>She lands hard..</p>
            <p>The Horseman shoves the empty cart aside, still on the move.</p>
            <p>UPHILL, Ichabod sees the skull. He runs towards it.</p>
            <p>Lady van Tassel grabs Ichabod by the ankle. He falls.</p>
            <p>DOWNHILL, Katrina runs back. The Horseman is catching up.</p>
            <p>UPHILL, Ichabod tries to pull free from Lady Van Tassel.</p>
            <p>Young Masbath comes behind her - BAM - hits her in the head with 
              the wooden plank. She's out.</p>
            <p>Ichabod scrambles to his feet.</p>
            <p>DOWNHILL, the Horseman catches Katrina, taking her by the hair 
              as she falls to her knees and screams.</p>
            <p>UPHILL, Ichabod runs... grasps the Horseman's skull.</p>
            <p>He runs towards the Horseman and Katrina.</p>
            <p>DOWNHILL, Katrina struggles, but the Horseman holds her ready by 
              her hair... raises his sword...</p>
            <p>UPHILL, Ichabod throws the skull...</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Horseman!</p>
            <p>The skull spins through the air...</p>
            <p>The Horseman drops Katrina, reaches up...</p>
            <p>Catches the skull.</p>
            <p>Katrina runs.</p>
            <p>Ichabod runs to meet her, grabs her as she falls, exhausted. Together, 
              they back away from the Horseman.<br>
              The Horseman holds the skull out, then brings it to his shoulders, 
              to its rightful place. THUNDER POUNDS.</p>
            <p>TRANSFORMATION begins -- blood and flesh rise up from the Horseman's 
              throat and grip the skull.</p>
            <p>Young Masbath drops the plank, watching in awe.</p>
            <p>The Horseman's reformation continues. Muscle forms. Liquids become 
              solids. He is made whole once more, the same evil, human face we 
              saw in Baltus' stories.</p>
            <p>He looks to Ichabod and Katrina, touches his restored face.</p>
            <p>Daredevil rides up, SCREECHING. The Horseman replaces his sword 
              and climbs into the saddle.</p>
            <p>He rides towards Katrina and Ichabod, but passes them by. They 
              are so exhausted they fall down.</p>
            <p>Young Masbath backs up as the Horseman comes, but the Horseman 
              does not want him either.</p>
            <p>The Horseman leans to grab Lady Van Tassel's unconscious form, 
              pulls her up across Daredevil's back.</p>
            <p>He rides away with her.</p>
            <p>Ichabod and Katrina watch him go. They look at each other, then 
              kiss gratefully.</p>
            <p>Ichabod looks to Young Masbath.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              How are you?</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              Tired.</p>
            <p>Ichabod smiles and holds out his arm. Masbath comes over. Group 
              hug. Lightning brightens the farmland around them.</p>
            <p>EXT. WESTERN WOODS, BURIAL GROUND -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>HOOFBEATS. The Horseman enters the clearing, keeping a hand on 
              Lady Van Tassel. Ahead, the twisted tree awaits.</p>
            <p>Lady van Tassel is awakening, face bloody. She turns her head and 
              looks forward. She screams.</p>
            <p>The twisted tree's wound opens, wide and glowing.</p>
            <p>Daredevil picks up speed...</p>
            <p>Daredevil leaps just as a lightning bolt blasts down, striking 
              the Horseman.</p>
            <p>For an instant, Horseman and horse are transformed, SKELETONS OF 
              LIGHT, entering the tree.</p>
            <p>Silence and smoke. At the tree, Lady Van Tassel's hand sticks out 
              from the tight-shut suture.</p>
            <p>The sewn wound on her palm seeps blood.</p>
            <p>EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET, ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY</p>
            <p>A bright, busy day in New York. A coach pulls up to Ichabod's home. 
              Ichabod is the driver. He gets off, goes and opens the coach door. 
              He helps Katrina down. Next,<br>
              Young Masbath sticks his head out.</p>
            <p>Ichabod goes about unloading bags. Katrina holds Young Masbath's 
              hand, and they look down the street in wonder.</p>
            <p>THE END</p>

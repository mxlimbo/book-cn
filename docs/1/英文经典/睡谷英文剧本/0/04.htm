            <p>EXT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- DAY</p>
            <p>Ichabod comes out. KILLIAN, a dashingly rustic man, carries his 
              son, THOMAS, 5, and chats with Baltus. Doctor Lancaster peers off 
              at something through a SPYGLASS.</p>
            <p>BALTUS<br>
              Hail, Constable. How are you?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Well enough. Your gathering does honor to the deceased.</p>
            <p>DOCTOR LANCASTER<br>
              (still using spyglass)<br>
              We must be a curious sight to him.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              What are you spying on?</p>
            <p>DOCTOR LANCASTER<br>
              (offers the spyglass)<br>
              The Lenape. He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD'S POINT OF VIEW -- THROUGH SPYGLASS</p>
            <p>Searching a line of trees and foliage far away...</p>
            <p>DOCTOR LANCASTER (O.S.)<br>
              Do you see the Redskinned bastard?</p>
            <p>There he is -- the LENAPE. A towering savage with misshapen features 
              covered in tumors. He ducks away.</p>
            <p><br>
              BACK TO SCENE ON PORCH</p>
            <p>Ichabod lowers the spyglass, a little awed.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              He is a behemoth.</p>
            <p>DOCTOR LANCASTER<br>
              A diseased monster.</p>
            <p>BALTUS<br>
              If you gentlemen will excuse the doctor and I... we have financial 
              matters to discuss.</p>
            <p>Ichabod and Killian nod as Baltus and Lancaster head in.</p>
            <p>KILLIAN<br>
              Master Crane, sir. I'm glad we have time alone. You've been told 
              plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              More than enough, actually. (tired laugh)<br>
              I beg you, no more, please.</p>
            <p>KILLIAN<br>
              No, sir, no. If you ask me, I say you just laid eyes on our murderer 
              through that glass.</p>
            <p>Ichabod ponders, folding the spyglass.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Tell me something. (pause)<br>
              What becomes of Young Masbath?</p>
            <p>KILLIAN<br>
              Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him. They have children and 
              a good home and good land.</p>
            <p>Ichabod nods. He turns to look THROUGH THE WINDOW. In the DINING 
              ROOM,, Van Ripper rises, ill. His wife questions his health, but 
              he holds her off and vomits.</p>
            <p>Ichabod notes this with a deep sigh.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. VAN TASSEL ORCHARD -- EARLY EVENING</p>
            <p>Ocher dusk. Ichabod rides to Young Masbath, seated on the ground, 
              miserable. Young Masbath does not look up.</p>
            <p><br>
              ICHABOD<br>
              Find yourself a place in the servants' residence and wake me before 
              dawn. Our first task will be an unsavory one.</p>
            <p>Ichabod rides. Young Masbath runs to his horse and follows.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- DAWN</p>
            <p>Steenwyck is on horseback, looking down at Ichabod, furious.</p>
            <p>FATHER STEENWYCK<br>
              It is sacrilege!</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.</p>
            <p>Steenwyck looks to men with shovels. Killian's there. Philipse, 
              hung-over, stands beside Young Masbath.</p>
            <p>FATHER STEENWYCK<br>
              Magistrate Philipse, surely you can stop this.</p>
            <p>Philipse just looks up with a helpless expression.</p>
            <p>FATHER STEENWYCK<br>
              I will not allow it. I will not!</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Protest to my superiors if you like.</p>
            <p>FATHER STEENWYCK<br>
              Your superiors are two days away!</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing 
              to help me today.</p>
            <p>Ichabod motions. Killian leads the men to the graveyard. Steenwyck 
              watches, enraged. He kicks his horse and rides. Philipse looks worried.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- LATER MORNING (TIME CUT)</p>
            <p>A PSALM is HEARD READ by STEENWYCK O.S. while a coffin is exhumed. 
              Ichabod guides the lifting. The coffin is put near the headstone 
              &quot;WINDSOR.&quot; Ichabod looks...</p>
            <p>At the church, Steenwyck faces about fifty people who now take 
              up the PRAYER.</p>
            <p>Across the cemetery, two coffins, one small, one large, are pried 
              open. &quot;VAN GARRETT, 1799.&quot; Killian leads the effort with 
              Young Masbath's aid...</p>
            <p>The lids come off, revealing the HEADLESS BODIES of a MAN and a 
              little BOY. Young Masbath backs away.</p>
            <p>At the &quot;WINDSOR&quot; coffin, nails creak as Ichabod opens 
              the lid. WE Do NOT SEE inside, but when Ichabod does, he is aghast. 
              He looks to the men, angry.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Why was I not told of this?<br>
              No answer. Killian arrives, nods solemnly.</p>
            <p>KILLIAN<br>
              The Widow Windsor.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Is that all you say? Look at her.</p>
            <p>KILLIAN<br>
              It's not something people speak of openly. She did not remarry.</p>
            <p>Ichabod kneels, studying. Now, WE SEE: the belly of the headless 
              corpse is bulbous, because the Widow Windsor was very far along 
              in a pregnancy.</p>
            <p>Ichabod notices: a tear in the cloth of widow's blouse. He reaches 
              through the tear, feeling the stomach.</p>
            <p>He straightens, greatly troubled.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- MORNING</p>
            <p>Scissors cut open the widow's blouse. There's an inch-long WOUND 
              on the moldering belly; a sword puncture.</p>
            <p>Ichabod examines the corpse on a table. Lancaster watches, anxiously 
              mopping his face. Young masbath's in a corner. Ichabod goes to write 
              in his ledger full of notes.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              What is the common thread between these victims?</p>
            <p>YOUNG MASBATH<br>
              I'm sure I don't know.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              We must discover it. The reason the murderer chose these persons.</p>
            <p>Ichabod goes to look at the widow's corpse, pondering.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              The wounds are the same. Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures 
              either. One stroke took the head. Have you seen, doctor... ? (pointing 
              to it)<br>
              Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.</p>
            <p>DOCTOR LANCASTER<br>
              I do not care. You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... 
              return her to her resting place.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              In time, doctor. Soon as I finish.</p>
            <p>Ichabod picks up an iron knife. He looks to Young Masbath.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              You should step outside.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. CHURCHYARD CEMETERY -- EARLY EVENING</p>
            <p>Ichabod and others restore graves. Ichabod looks to the church, 
              where Clergyman Steenwyck stands in the door.</p>
            <p>FATHER STEENWYCK<br>
              The devil sent you, Ichabod Crane. (pause)<br>
              The Lord will not forgive your sins.</p>
            <p>Steenwyck shuts the creaky doors.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod sleeps, dreaming...</p>
            <p><br>
              ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FARMLAND -- DAY</p>
            <p>A young BOY, 10, stands in a wheat field with his back to us. A 
              FEMALE VOICE is HEARD FAINTLY, getting LOUDER.</p>
            <p>FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)<br>
              Ichabod! Ichabod... come along.</p>
            <p>The boy, YOUNG ICHABOD, turns, smiling. He runs. We FOLLOW to a 
              clearing behind a frontier home. MOTHER waits. Lovely woman. She 
              kisses him.</p>
            <p><br>
              ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Dark. Young Ichabod, in bed, has one eye open. Across the room, 
              Mother has her back to him. She's WHISPERING something to no one. 
              She turns...</p>
            <p>Young Ichabod pretends he is asleep.</p>
            <p>A DRAWER is HEARD SHUTTING. Mother exits. Ichabod gets up, curious, 
              opens a drawer... finds something behind clothing.</p>
            <p>It's a piece of reed grass, woven into an elaborate pattern with 
              shafts of wheat twisted into the center. Young Ichabod replaces 
              it, closes the drawer.</p>
            <p><br>
              ICHABOD'S DREAM -- MARKET SQUARE -- DAY</p>
            <p>A busy, muddy street lined by wares and produce. Young Ichabod 
              walks with FATHER, an emotionless man. Father stops to examine tools. 
              Young Ichabod stays by him, but something captures his attention...</p>
            <p>Across the way, Mother is involved in a argument with a FREAKISH-LOOKING 
              WOMAN. They shout. People stop to watch. Can't make out words, but 
              Freakish Woman is furious.</p>
            <p><br>
              ICHABOD'S DREAM -- STORM SKY -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>LIGHTNING flashes over tree tops. THUNDER BOOMS.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod jerks awake in his bed.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Ichabod enters with a lantern and his ledger. He sits, studies 
              notes, then notices there's a light down the hall.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- NIGHT</p>
            <p>Opposite an elaborate loom, Katrina reads by candlelight. She looks 
              up, seeing Ichabod enter.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Sorry for disturbing you. I thought a forgotten candle was burning.</p>
            <p>Katrina self-consciously closes her shabby book, puts it with another 
              on her lap and covers them.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              You do not disturb me. Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              You pay great attention to small things. I hide these as I hide 
              all my books. Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.</p>
            <p>Ichabod sits, looking through his ledger.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              These are strange... may I?</p>
            <p>She takes his hand, spreads the fingers to the palm. She touches 
              the many evenly spaced scars.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              These scars. How did you get them?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              I have had them since childhood. I cannot remember what from.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              It would be interesting to find out.</p>
            <p>Their eyes meet. Ichabod gets back to the ledger. Katrina seems 
              to relish the effect she has. Ichabod finds a paper disk on string, 
              illustrated thusly:</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Here it is. A bird on one side. His cage on the other. Now, stare 
              at it. (spinning it)<br>
              The bird seems to be in his cage.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Yes, he does. May I try?<br>
              Ichabod gives it. She spins it, smiling.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              He only appears to be inside the cage. The point being...</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              You made this, and the drawings?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Yes, but listen. The illusion is easily explained. The eye retains 
              each image, till they combine. And yet, some would call this toy 
              magic.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Don't you see why? Look closely a moment. Put your intellect aside. 
              (spinning it)<br>
              Can't you see what is inexplicable?</p>
            <p>Ichabod watches it spin. He shakes his head, unimpressed.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Oh, you are hopeless. May I keep it at least?</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              If you want. But...</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              Then, I also have a gift for you. True magic which even you will 
              not be able to deny.</p>
            <p>She hands him a book. &quot;ROMEO AND JULIET.&quot; Ichabod stands, 
              offering it back, but she will not take it.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              Thank you. No. Here...</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              I insist that you have it.</p>
            <p>ICHABOD<br>
              (resigned, leaving)<br>
              Very well. But, it will only sit gathering dust.</p>
            <p>KATRINA<br>
              That would be a pity. Those words might show you something you've 
              never seen before.</p>
            <p>Ichabod stops at the door, looks back. He exits.</p>

              PART 3</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. MONKEY'S PAW - NIGHT</p>
            <p>The joint is jumping with musclehead BOUNCERS picking and choosing 
              from the crowd of terminally trendy WANNABE'S gathered around the 
              entrance. A light drizzle is falling.</p>
            <p>A parade of swanky cars pulls up one by one as CAR HOPS scurry 
              to keep up with the flow;</p>
            <p>A glistening pearlescent Rolls Royce.</p>
            <p>A fire engine red Ferrari.</p>
            <p>A classic two tone Corniche in tan and burgundy.</p>
            <p>And finally a broken down Citroen in rust bucket red and spackle 
              gray RUMBLES up to the front of the club with a disgruntled Stanley 
              behind the wheel.</p>
            <p>A car hop attempts to open the door, but it's rusted shut. Stanley 
              throws his shoulder into it and the door finally pops open with 
              a SCREECH of metal. Stanley nearly tumbles out into the street.</p>
            <p>He smiles nervously at a high class couple looking with disdain 
              at the eyesore-mobile. He pats the hood.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              It's a classic.</p>
            <p>The car hop jumps in and tries to throw the car into gear with 
              a horrible GRINDING. He finally waves over two other car hops who 
              quickly push it off down the street.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Hey, Stanley. Nice wheels. What<br>
              is that, a Rolls Canardley?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              A what?</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              You know, a Rolls Canardley.<br>
              Rolls down one hill canardley roll<br>
              up the next.<br>
              (he cracks up)</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              We are not discussing the car,<br>
              okay?</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Whatever you say, man.</p>
            <p>Charlie gestures expansively towards the club.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              What do you think? Pretty<br>
              terrific, huh? This place make<br>
              Sodom and Gomorrah look like<br>
              Mayberry.</p>
            <p>Stanley now notices a life-sized poster of Tina Carlyle standing 
              by the main entrance that reads &quot;Featuring the Musical Stylings 
              of Miss Tina Carlyle.&quot;</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Hey, isn't that...</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Right. The wet dream from the<br>
              bank.<br>
              (pauses)<br>
              Hold on... I think I see my future<br>
              ex-wife.</p>
            <p>Two rather tacky looking GIRLS beckon Charlie from the crowd.</p>
            <p>GIRLS<br>
              Hey Charlie! Charlie!</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              (waves)<br>
              We're in luck. It's Barbie and<br>
              Pebbles.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Doesn't it bother you that all<br>
              the women you know are named after<br>
              cartoon characters?</p>
            <p>Barbie and Pebbles hurry over through the crowd.</p>
            <p>BARBIE<br>
              We've been waiting out here for<br>
              hours. Can you get us in?</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              No, problemo. Ladies, this is my<br>
              pal Stanley Ipkiss.<br>
              (leans closer)<br>
              Stanley's very influential in the<br>
              banking business.</p>
            <p>Charlie is truly in his element as he elbows his way through the 
              crowd dragging his entourage with him.</p>
            <p>EXT. THE FRONT DOOR</p>
            <p>Charlie finally makes through the crush of badies at the entry 
              way's velvet ropes and calls to one of the two hulking BOUNCERS 
              that guard the door.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Hey Bobby! Bobby, buddy. What's<br>
              happening man?</p>
            <p>Bobby completely ignores Charlie as he ushers a pasty faced ROCK 
              STAR and his underage TARTLET past the ropes.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE (CONT.)<br>
              (to the girls)<br>
              This will just take a second.<br>
              (to the other bouncer)<br>
              Yo Nick! It's me... Charlie!</p>
            <p>Nick is also completely oblivious.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Forget it, Charlie. I refuse to<br>
              stand here waiting to be judged<br>
              by these power-mad steroid<br>
              jockeys.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              How much cash you got on you?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              What?</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              You heard me. How much you got?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              I dunno, fifty or sixty bucks.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Hand it over.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              No way.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Hey, I'll pay you back! I'm only<br>
              carrying plastic. C'mon man, you<br>
              want to stand out here all night?</p>
            <p>Stanley begrudgingly starts to count out some cash. Charlie snatches 
              the whole wad and elbows his way back around to the ropes.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              (subtly flashing bills)<br>
              Hey Bobby!</p>
            <p>Bobby's uncanny tip radar suddenly lights up.</p>
            <p>BOBBY<br>
              Charlie, how you doin' man? Long<br>
              time no see.</p>
            <p>Bobby unsnaps the rope for Charlie and gets the cash handshake 
              he longs for.</p>
            <p>The crowd surges around Charlie, Barbie and Pebbles as they step 
              by, briefly cutting Stanley off.</p>
            <p>He catches up just as the all-important rope is SNAPPED closed.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Hey, wait a minute! Charlie!</p>
            <p>But Charlie and the girls have already been whisked inside. Dorian 
              now steps out of the club and begins to check Bobby's list.</p>
            <p>STANLEY (CONT.)<br>
              I'm with them! Hey, Bobby!</p>
            <p>But Bobby is back into his deaf and dumb routine. Stanley unsnaps 
              the rope himself and starts throgh. Bobby and BOUNCER #2 immediately 
              grab Stanley and quickly subdue him.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Hey! Leggo... awk!</p>
            <p>Dorian glares at Stanley.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Lose him.</p>
            <p>The bouncers drag Stanley through the crowd and unceremoniously 
              toss him out into the rain-slick street.</p>
            <p>ANGLE ON THE STREET</p>
            <p>Stanley slowly rises, smoothing out his disheveled clothing. A 
              horn BLARES and Stanley scrambles to one side as a limo swings into 
              the club's alleyway, splattering him with a wave of muddy water.</p>
            <p>Stanley wipes the mud from his eyes just in time to see Tina Carlyle 
              escorted from the back of the limo by a CHAUFFEUR carrying an umbrella. 
              She's shoe-horned into a heart-stopping red dress that's fighting 
              a losing battle to restrain her decolletage.</p>
            <p>Their EYES MEET. Tina pauses as she recognizes him.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              (smiles)<br>
              Oh... Stanley. Hi.</p>
            <p>Stanley realizes he looks ridiculous but gives a pathetic little 
              wave hello anyway.</p>
            <p>TINA (CONT.)<br>
              Are you okay?</p>
            <p>Stanley gestures &quot;no problem&quot; and tries to strike a casual 
              pose against a street lamp, but slips and nearly falls.</p>
            <p>With a SQUEAL of grinding gears and the KA-POW of a backfire, the 
              car hop pulls Stanley's battered loaner right up behind him.</p>
            <p>Stanley flashes a last nervous smile at Tina, and digs for the 
              car hop's tip money... nothing.</p>
            <p>He shrugs apologetically to the disgusted car hop and climbs in. 
              The car RATTLES, COUGHS the finally ROARS off in a cloud of noxious 
              exhaust fumes.</p>
            <p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
            <p>EXT. TAHOOCHIE BRIDGE - NIGHT</p>
            <p>A forlorn looking spot on the outskirts of Edge City. We can hear 
              Stanley's car SPUTTERING and POPPING along before it actually pulls 
              into sight on the dark rain-slick street.</p>
            <p>INT. CAR</p>
            <p>Stanley drives along in a miserable daze. Suddenly the engine starts 
              KNOCKING violently and the car dies.</p>
            <p>EXT. BRIDGE</p>
            <p>Steam HISSES from the radiator as the car slowly rolls to a stop. 
              Stanley GRINDS the ignition key again and again trying futilely 
              to restart the engine.</p>
            <p>Finally, Stanley fights his way out of the rusted door with a SQUEAL 
              of metal, turns and kicks the bumper&iexcl;&shy; which promptly 
              falls off with a resounding CLUNK.</p>
            <p>Beat.</p>
            <p>The front axle collapses, the tires fall off and the driver's side 
              door CLATTERS to the ground.</p>
            <p>Stanley stands there staring at the steaming heap of useless metal&iexcl;&shy; 
              his mind a complete blank.</p>
            <p>He slowly turns, looking down at the black brackish water swirling 
              along beneath the Tahoochie Bridge. A wave of melancholy sweeps 
              over him. Stanley plucks a button from his coat and watches as it 
              drops down&iexcl;&shy; down to the river below.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, something catches Stanley's eye&iexcl;&shy; a BODY, floating 
              along in the darkness. He snaps back to reality.</p>
            <p>STANLEY (CONT.)<br>
              Hey&iexcl;&shy; Hey mister!</p>
            <p>EXT. RIVER BANK</p>
            <p>Stanley rushes down the slippery embankment beneath the bridge. 
              He spots the body dead ahead, floating along in the moonlight and 
              hurries as fast as he can.</p>
            <p>CAMERA DOLLIES with Stanley as he scrambles down the slope; a black 
              cat YOWLS as it races past him. He steps on and shatters a discarded 
              mirror, and he ducks under an old ladder that leans against the 
              bridge's foundation as he finally reaches the shore.</p>
            <p>Stanley splashes into the waist deep water just in time to catch 
              the body as it floats by.</p>
            <p>CLOSER - BODY</p>
            <p>As Stanley grabs it, the &quot;body&quot; falls to pieces&iexcl;&shy; 
              revealing that it's nothing but a trash bag, an old tire and some 
              floating bits of garbage all clinging to the &quot;head&quot;: an 
              old wooden Mask.</p>
            <p>Stanley shakes his head in disgust&iexcl;&shy; some lifesaver.</p>
            <p>Stanley inspects the Mask more closely; strange ritualistic symbols 
              carved into a puckish face with a leering grin and eerie empty eye 
              holes.</p>
            <p>The faintest sound of a haunting &quot;Mask SFX Theme&quot; rises 
              as Stanley turns the Mask around and inspects the inside&iexcl;&shy; 
              slowly bringing it closer and closer to his face. The surface of 
              the Mask begins to SHIMMER.</p>
            <p>But then&iexcl;&shy; RIBET! A frog jumps out of it, right into 
              Stanley's face. Stanley nearly loses his footing on the slippery 
              river bottom.</p>
            <p>Suddenly a blinding SPOTLIGHT shines down from the bridge and an 
              amplified voice calls out from a squad car.</p>
            <p>POLICEMAN<br>
              Hey, you! What are you doing down<br>
              there?</p>
            <p>Stanley squints into the light, trying to think of a reasonable 
              answer.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              I was just looking for&iexcl;&shy;<br>
              (holds up Mask)<br>
              My mask.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p>INT. MONKEY'S PAW - NIGHT</p>
            <p>The club is closing up. WAITERS stack chairs on top of tables in 
              the B.G. as Tina gathers her sheet music from her PIANIST.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Thanks Reno, you're the greatest.</p>
            <p>RENO<br>
              G'night, doll.</p>
            <p>Tina crosses to the bar area where Dorian lounges with DR. FREEZE, 
              SWEET EDDY and CHUN WOO. Dorian toasts her as she pulls up a bar 
              stool.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              That was a great performance,<br>
              baby. But not as great as the<br>
              one you pulled off at the bank.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Yeah, well don't get used to it.<br>
              I'm not going to start running<br>
              cons for you again, Dorian. I'm<br>
              a singer now and that's it.</p>
            <p>Dorian rolls his eyes at Freeze, &quot;Get her&quot;.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Oh, really? And you had such a<br>
              red hot career before you latched<br>
              on to me?</p>
            <p>Tina pours herself a drink.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Who latched on to who?</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Get real, Tina. You'll do what<br>
              I say or I'll drop you back where<br>
              I found you, slingin' hash and<br>
              dodgin' horny peterbuilt drivers.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              (downs a shot)<br>
              Don't push me, Nicky. I might<br>
              just take a walk I should have<br>
              taken a long time ago.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              (chuckles)<br>
              Easy, baby. Easy.<br>
              (to his men)<br>
              I love it when she gets pissed.</p>
            <p>Dorian scoots over and puts an arm around Tina. She remains cool.</p>
            <p>DORIAN (CONT.)<br>
              C'mere. You take a hike and who's<br>
              gonna kiss you like Dorian Tyrel.</p>
            <p>Tina pours another shot.</p>
            <p>DORIAN (CONT.)<br>
              C'mon. Who?</p>
            <p>Tina finally cracks a smile.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Nobody.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              (pulls her close)<br>
              That's right, baby. C'mere.</p>
            <p>Tina slowly leans in for a kiss, her lips softly parted&iexcl;&shy; 
              but raises a finger to Dorian's lips, stopping him cold. She glances 
              over at Freeze.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Sorry. I never get personal in<br>
              front of the help.</p>
            <p>Tina abruptly stands and exits as Freeze glares at her.</p>
            <p>Dorian breaks into laughter.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              That broad kills me.</p>
            <p>DR. FREEZE<br>
              She just might, man. The bitch<br>
              is trouble.</p>
            <p>Dorian pours them all a drink.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              C'mon Doctor, lighten up.<br>
              (raises his glass)<br>
              Here's to Edge City Bank.<br>
              May it crack like an egg on Easter<br>
              Sunday.</p>
            <p>Their glasses CLINK.</p>

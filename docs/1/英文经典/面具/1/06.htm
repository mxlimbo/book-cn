              PART 6</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. RIPLEY'S AUTO FINISHING - DAY</p>
            <p>The place looks like it's been hit by cartoon graffiti guerrillas: 
              Everything's printed in polka-dots, checks, tartan, etc. The &quot;Ripley 
              Auto Finishing&quot; sign hangs askew over the doorway. Letters 
              have been sprayed out to read &quot;Rip Off!&quot;</p>
            <p>Several REPORTERS and curious ONLOOKERS stand nearby as Kellaway 
              and his men take it all in. PARAMEDICS appear wheeling Burt and 
              Irv out of the building on two gurneys.</p>
            <p>They're both in severe discomfort and look more like cars than 
              men: Bodies spray painted metallic colors, hood ornaments glued 
              to their foreheads, wire rims under each limb, and gleaming four 
              foot long mufflers sticking out of their rear ends.</p>
            <p>They wince in pain at each tiny bump of the gurney.</p>
            <p>BURT AND IRV<br>
              Ah!&iexcl;&shy; Eeeh!&iexcl;&shy; Ooh!</p>
            <p>Paramedic #3 speaks into his emergency radio-phone as Burt and 
              Irv are loaded into the van.</p>
            <p>PARAMEDIC #3<br>
              I want a proctologist standing<br>
              by! Yeah, you heard me! The best<br>
              one you can find.</p>
            <p>An OFFICER steps out of the building and approaches Kellaway.</p>
            <p>OFFICER<br>
              We were able to get a description<br>
              Lt., but it's pretty weird.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              (sighs)<br>
              Let me guess&iexcl;&shy; Big green head.<br>
              Zoot suit.</p>
            <p>OFFICER<br>
              How did you&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>KELLWAY<br>
              Whoever this guy is, he's a world<br>
              class twisto.</p>
            <p>PEGGY BRANDT, an attractive young woman in her mid twenties, appears 
              besides the other reporters and approaches Kellaway, notepad in 
              hand.</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              Excuse me, Lt., I'm with the<br>
              Evening Star. Can you tell me<br>
              what happened here?</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              Sorry. Too early to comment.</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              It looks like some kind of mob<br>
              scare tactic.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              I said no comment. Now break it<br>
              up. This is a crime scene.</p>
            <p>As the officers disperse the reporters and other onlookers, Peggy 
              slips away from the group. Even though it's closed off with yellow 
              police tape, Peggy slips inside the garage.</p>
            <p>INT. MECHANIC'S OFFICE - DAY</p>
            <p>The empty garage has been turned into a topsy-turvy nightmare. 
              The same cartoon paint job covers the walls. Peggy looks around, 
              sifting through some papers scattered all over the floor. Nothing.</p>
            <p>Then she spies the COMPLAINT BOX. Peggy opens it and pulls out 
              a HANDFUL of pink &quot;comment&quot; slips. She looks at them. 
              Almost all of them are from one customer - STANLEY IPKISS.</p>
            <p>INT. BANK - DAY</p>
            <p>Stanley, still looking rumpled and unshaven, hurriedly takes off 
              his coat and powers up his computer. Charlie steps over to his desk 
              carrying a newspaper.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              What happened to you last night?<br>
              The girls and I were looking all<br>
              over for you.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              I uh, didn't feel so good. I<br>
              decided to go home early.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              As a matter of fact, you don't<br>
              look so good. You got to take<br>
              better care of yourself, man.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              How was the club?</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Are you kidding? It was hotter<br>
              than a pistol. Did you see the<br>
              paper?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              No.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Your girlfriend got a great<br>
              review.</p>
            <p>Chralie flips open the Entertainment section of the Evening Star. 
              There's a great close-up of Tina singing her heart out with the 
              headline &quot;Bombshell Explodes at Monnkey's Paw.&quot;</p>
            <p>MR. DICKEY, the smarmy office manager who is younger than Stanley, 
              now appears.</p>
            <p>DICKEY<br>
              Ipkiss! You're forty minutes<br>
              late! Every time you do that<br>
              you're robbing this bank of its<br>
              time and money!</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Sorry, Mr. Dicky. It won't<br>
              happen again.</p>
            <p>DICKEY<br>
              (snatches newspaper)<br>
              If you weren't so busy ogling<br>
              girlie pictures you'd get some<br>
              work done around here.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Ah&iexcl;&shy; She's a prospective client<br>
              of Stanley's, sir.</p>
            <p>DICKEY<br>
              (sudden attitude change)<br>
              She is? Well&iexcl;&shy; Next time she<br>
              comes in see that you send her<br>
              directly to my office.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Yes sir, Mr. Dickey.</p>
            <p>Dickey tosses the paper back on Stanley's desk and marches off 
              through the bank.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Look at that little creep. If<br>
              it wasn't for his daddy he'd be<br>
              out somewhere shakin' down school<br>
              kids for lunch money.</p>
            <p>Stanley toys with the Kleenex that bears Tina's lipstick &quot;kiss&quot;.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              You think she ever will come back,<br>
              Charlie?</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Who knows? Forget about her,<br>
              Stanley. A dame like that is<br>
              always looking for the B.B.D.<br>
              The bigger better deal. Ask her<br>
              what her sign is and she'll say<br>
              dollar.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              You don't know that. She's an<br>
              artist. Maybe she's sensitive.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Yeah. She can sense a guy's<br>
              credit line at two hundred yards.<br>
              Stanley, you need a girl you can<br>
              depend on. Someone a little more<br>
              down to earth... someone like...</p>
            <p>ANGLE ACROSS THE BANK</p>
            <p>as Peggy Brandt stops by a teller's window, looking sharp and pretty 
              in a blazer and jeans.</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              Excuse me, can you tell me where<br>
              I can find Stanley Ipkiss?</p>
            <p>BACK TO CHARLIE</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Like her! Someone like her.<br>
              (straightens tie)<br>
              As a matter of fact I could use<br>
              someone like her myself.<br>
              (rises as Peggy approaches)<br>
              Hel-lo there. May I be of some<br>
              assistance?</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              Stanley Ipkiss?</p>
            <p>Charlie begrudgingly points to Stanley.</p>
            <p>PEGGY (CONT.)<br>
              Hi. I'm Peggy Brandt. I'm with<br>
              the Evening Star.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Oh, hi. I already have a<br>
              subscription, thanks.</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              Oh no, actually I just wanted to<br>
              ask you a few questions.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Really? About what?</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              Ripley Auto Finishing. You're<br>
              a customer of theirs aren't you?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              I... uh. No. I think you must<br>
              have made a mistake.</p>
            <p>Peggy produces one of the complaint slips.</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              Isn't this a form of theirs you<br>
              filled out?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              (nervous chuckle)<br>
              Oh, that Ripley Auto. I guess<br>
              I have stopped in there once or<br>
              twice, Miss... what did you say<br>
              your name was?</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              Peggy Brandt.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Wait a minute... Peggy Brandt of<br>
              &quot;Ask Peggy&quot;?</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              That's right.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              (brightens up)<br>
              You printed my letter last year,<br>
              remember? &quot;Nice Guys Finish<br>
              Last.&quot;</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              You're Mr. Nice Guy? Stanley do<br>
              you realize how much mail we got<br>
              about that letter? There's<br>
              hundreds of women out there who<br>
              are looking for a man just like<br>
              you.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Are you serious?</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              Of course. DO you know how hard<br>
              it is to find a decent man in this<br>
              town? Most of them think monogamy<br>
              is some kind of wood.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Why are you covering this story?</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              They cut my salary. I just can't<br>
              make it by on &quot;Dear Peggy&quot;<br>
              anymore. The truth is, I want<br>
              to be a real reporter and if I<br>
              can break this story I know<br>
              they'll let me.<br>
              (sits closer)<br>
              Look Stanley, I know Ripley Auto<br>
              is a crooked operation. They may<br>
              even have had ties to the Mob.<br>
              I'm not out to get you. I just<br>
              want the truth.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              I wish I knew the truth, Peggy.<br>
              I really do.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p>EXT. MONKEY'S PAW ENTRANCE - AFTERNOON</p>
            <p>A well dressed MAN checks from beneath his sunglasses to see nobody's 
              watching and RAPS on the door. It opens and he quickly disappears 
              inside.</p>
            <p>INT. DORIAN'S OFFICE</p>
            <p>Sweet Eddy escorts him inside. The man removes his glasses and 
              glances about nervously. Dorian sits at his desk. Dr. Freeze and 
              Chun Woo are going over an array of high tech burglary equipment 
              laid out on the air hockey table.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Good afternoon, Councilman Snell.<br>
              Nice of you to drop by.</p>
            <p>SNELL<br>
              Cut the crap. Dorian. What's so<br>
              important that I had to come here<br>
              in person?</p>
            <p>Dorian gazes out the window to the Valhalla Casino.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              I got a little job for you, Tom.<br>
              I want you to pull the Swede's<br>
              gambling license.</p>
            <p>SNELL<br>
              That's impossible. He was<br>
              approved six months ago.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Pull a few strings. Find<br>
              something in the fine print. I<br>
              don't care how you do it, but do<br>
              it. You owe me.</p>
            <p>SNELL<br>
              (chuckles)<br>
              I owe you nothing, you little<br>
              piece of shit. I got your<br>
              liquor license when nobody else<br>
              would touch...</p>
            <p>Dorian suddenly EXPLODES, overturning his desk and sending Snell 
              tumbling backwards. In less than a heartbeat, he grabs Snell by 
              his shirt ffront, SLAMS him up against the wall, SMASHES a whiskey 
              bottle and presses the jagged edge to his throat.</p>
            <p>Snell hangs there whimpering. Dorian has a crazed look in his eyes 
              as he gazes at the Councilman's lapel.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              (softly)<br>
              That's pretty. What is that, a<br>
              carnation?</p>
            <p>Snell nods. Dorian takes a deep whiff.</p>
            <p>DORIAN (CONT.)<br>
              Nice. Hey, Eddy... call my<br>
              florist. Two dozen pink<br>
              carnations to Mrs. Snell with my<br>
              regrets over her husband's<br>
              untimely accident.</p>
            <p>Tears begin to well up in Snell's eyes.</p>
            <p>SNELL<br>
              (gasping)<br>
              No... please. I can do it. I<br>
              can make it happen.</p>
            <p>Dorian eases back... brushes off Snell's coat.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              That's smart. You're a very smart<br>
              man. Now pull yourself together.<br>
              Look at you.</p>
            <p>Dorian picks up an Uzi from Dr. Freeze's equipment.</p>
            <p>DORIAN (CONT.)<br>
              Shut the Swede down, Snell. We'll<br>
              buy him out cheap with a little<br>
              collateral the bank is about to<br>
              provide us.<br>
              (looks at his men)<br>
              And Gentlemen... we are going to<br>
              be in the casino business.</p>

            <p><br>
              EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT</p>
            <p>The police car pulls up in front of Stanley's brownstone and he 
              wearily climbs out.</p>
            <p>OFFICER<br>
              Okay, Mr. Ipkiss. Try to be a<br>
              little more careful next time.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Thanks Officer.</p>
            <p>The black and white pulls away and Stanley starts across the empty 
              street.</p>
            <p>VOICE<br>
              Hey, mister&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>Stanley turns.</p>
            <p>A razor-cut DEATH'S HEAD PUNKER hops down from a fire escape in 
              a darkened alleyway.</p>
            <p>DEATH'S HEAD<br>
              You a cop or something?</p>
            <p>A half dozen other DEATH'S HEADS appear out of the shadows all 
              decked out in nipple chains, tattoos and other self-mutilation-as-fashion 
              oddments.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Uh&iexcl;&shy; no. They just gave me a<br>
              lift.</p>
            <p>DEATH'S HEAD<br>
              A cop chauffeur? I never seen<br>
              that before. How about you boys?</p>
            <p>The other Death's Heads pipe up with &quot;Not Me,&quot; &quot;Nope,&quot; 
              &quot;Pretty special,&quot; etc. as they slowly surround Stanley.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Alright, you guys. It's been a<br>
              tough night. I haven't got any<br>
              money. I haven't got a car. All<br>
              I have is this and you're<br>
              welcome to it.</p>
            <p>Stanley tosses Death's Head #1 the Mask.</p>
            <p>He briefly inspects the funky looking antique, still slick with 
              river slime, then tosses it back. He approaches Stanley.</p>
            <p>DEATH'S HEAD<br>
              Hey, man. You got us all wrong.<br>
              We don't want any trouble. I was<br>
              just going to ask you for the<br>
              time. That's all. You got the<br>
              time?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Uh&iexcl;&shy; yeah.</p>
            <p>As Stanley pulls back his sleeve to check his watch, the Death's 
              Head flicks out a butterfly knife. With a FLASH of steel, he slices 
              straight through Stanley's watch band and snatches the watch.</p>
            <p>DEATH'S HEAD<br>
              (holding up his prize)<br>
              See, I only wanted the time! Heh,<br>
              he, heh&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>All the punkers laugh like the half-wits they are as Death's Head 
              #1 shoves Stanley into Death's Head #2. #2 pushes him back across 
              to #3 and so on. Stanley is roughly bounced back and forth more 
              and more violently within the circle of giggling street toughs. 
              He finally breaks free and scrambles to his front door, still reeling 
              with dizziness. He fumbles with the key and SLAMS the door behind 
              him as the Death's Heads roar with laughter.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p>INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT</p>
            <p>Stanley's wet shoes SQUEAK as he tiptoes past -</p>
            <p>APARTMENT &quot;A&quot; - MANAGER</p>
            <p>A sign that reads &quot;Quiet Please&quot; hangs from the doorknob. 
              Stanley continues past it to Apartment &quot;B&quot;. Just as he 
              removes his keys - the Manager's door flies open and MRS. PEENMAN 
              appears. She's an old dragon in hair curlers who will probably live 
              forever just to spite her relatives.</p>
            <p>MRS. PEENMAN<br>
              Ipkiss! Do you have any idea what<br>
              time it is?</p>
            <p>Reflexively, he looks at his (now empty) wrist.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Actually, no.</p>
            <p>MRS. PEENMAN<br>
              It's three o'clock in the morning!<br>
              First, you wake up the entire<br>
              building laughing it up with your<br>
              pals. Then, you come in and start<br>
              squeak -<br>
              (sees puddles)<br>
              My new carpet! Just look at that!<br>
              This is coming out of your<br>
              cleaning deposit Ipkiss!</p>
            <p>Stanley, battered, bruised and soaking wet is deep in urban shell-shock.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              (softly)<br>
              Are you done?</p>
            <p>MRS. PEENMAN<br>
              &#133;Yes.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              I think I'll be going to bed now.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Peenman SLAMS her door.</p>
            <p>INT. STANLEY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUES</p>
            <p>Small, full of books but very neat. A few cherished animation cels 
              from 1940s cartoons are framed on the wall. As Stanley locks the 
              door behind him - he's greeted by MILO, a happy little terrie sized 
              mutt with a big heart.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Hello, Milo.</p>
            <p>Milo gets so excited he starts GAGGING and COUGHING.</p>
            <p>STANLEY (CONT.)<br>
              Easy, buddy. I missed you too.</p>
            <p>Stanley pats Milo on the rump, crosses his tiny kitchenette and 
              heads straight into&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>THE BEDROOM</p>
            <p>Stanley's prized collection of &quot;golden Age&quot; Looney Tunes 
              tapes are neatly displayed on a simple bookshelf.</p>
            <p>He tosses the Mask down on his bedside table, pops one of his cherished 
              Tex Avery cartoons into the V.C.R., plops down on his bed and starts 
              to strip off his shoes and socks.</p>
            <p>MILO</p>
            <p>enters, holding a Frisbee in his mouth.</p>
            <p>STANLEY (CONT.)<br>
              C'mon, Milo. I'm beat.<br>
              (to the dog YIPS)<br>
              Okay, okay. One throw.</p>
            <p>Stanley tosses the Frisbee into the air. The disk sails&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>OUT OF THE BEDROOM AND INTO THE HALLWAY</p>
            <p>Milo runs it down, leaps up, and makes a perfect catch. He trots 
              back to the bedroom, and drops it in Stanley's lap.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Easy. This is the best part.</p>
            <p>On the screen a cartoon dog ZZZIPS into frame and drops a frizzing 
              stick of dynamite down a bad guy's pants. KA-BOOM! The dog LAUGHS 
              maniacally.</p>
            <p>Suddenly there is a POUNDING on the wall that rattles Stanley's 
              framed cartoon cels.</p>
            <p>STANLEY (CONT.)<br>
              (calls out)<br>
              Sorry Mrs. Peenman.</p>
            <p>With a sigh, he ejects the tape and a much quieter talk show POPS 
              on. Larry King and a guest.</p>
            <p>Stanley rises and crosses into the bathroom to wash up.</p>
            <p>ANGLE ON T.V.</p>
            <p>King's guest, Dr. Arthur Neuman, is replying to a caller.</p>
            <p>DR. NEUMAN<br>
              That's correct. The truth is we<br>
              all wear masks, metaphorically<br>
              speaking. We repress the Id&iexcl;&shy;<br>
              our darkest desires and hide<br>
              behind a more socially acceptable<br>
              image of ourselves in order to<br>
              cope with the frustrations of our<br>
              day to day lives.</p>
            <p>Stanley's only half listening though the open bathroom door as 
              he brushes his teeth.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Think I'm repressed, Milo?</p>
            <p>Stanley tries a couple of fierce expressions in the bathroom mirror, 
              his mouth foaming with toothpaste.</p>
            <p>Milo does that doggie-head-cocked-sideways &quot;What the hell?&quot; 
              look.</p>
            <p>STANLEY (CONT.)<br>
              (half-heartedly)<br>
              Nah.</p>
            <p>He spits and rinses.</p>
            <p>ANGLE ON T.V.</p>
            <p>as King wraps it up, displaying the doctor's book.</p>
            <p>LARRY KING<br>
              The book is &quot;The Masks We Wear,&quot;<br>
              by Dr. Arthur Neuman. Thank you<br>
              Dr. Neuman.</p>
            <p>Stanley pops off the T.V.with his remote.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              No thank you, Dr. Neuman.</p>
            <p>As he buttons up his P.J.s, Stanley notices Milo warily sniffing 
              at the strange Mask, which is still lying on the bedside table. 
              A subtle SHIMMER crosses its surface. Milo WHIMPERS and quickly 
              hops off the bed.</p>
            <p>We now begin to hear the &quot;Mask Theme&quot;&iexcl;&shy; echoes 
              of the POUNDING Viking drums&iexcl;&shy; growing louder. Haunting 
              whispery VOICES seem to call to Stanley as he slowly crosses to 
              the bedside. He picks up the Mask and turns it over in his hands 
              running his fingers across the time work wood. The music builds&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>He turns back to the bathroom mirror and slowly raises the Mask 
              to his face. Milo watches apprehensively from beneath the bed.</p>
            <p>For an instant - the MASK SHRINK WRAPS like a vacuum over Stanley's 
              head. We hear the PIERCING MASK SFX.</p>
            <p>Then, a beat later, the Mask is off with a POP. The SFX STOP.</p>
            <p>STANLEY (CONT.)<br>
              Whoa.</p>
            <p>Stanley studies the old mask, then his own face in the mirror. 
              Everything's status quo. It must have been his imagination.</p>
            <p>STANLEY (CONT.)<br>
              Naw&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>He puts the Mask on again - firmly this time. Milo dives under 
              the bed as&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>AN INCREDIBLE METAMORPHOSIS BEGINS:</p>
            <p>RUBBERY WOODEN WHIPS shoot out of the Mask and wrap around Stanley's 
              head - locking the Mask in place.</p>
            <p>STANLEY'S PAJAMAS magically reweave themselves&iexcl;&shy; growing 
              in all directions.</p>
            <p>HIS HEAD THROBS AND EXPANDS, turning lime green as it unites with 
              the Mask.</p>
            <p>STANLEY GRABS HIS HEAD - His body begins to move uncontrollably.</p>
            <p>Spinning faster and faster like a gyroscope. The SFX get loonier 
              and loonier as he becomes&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>A HUMAN TORNADO. Stanley's words are almost unintelligible as his 
              voice jumps one, two, five octaves.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Hellllllllppppmmmmmmmeeeeeeeee&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>A HAND reaches out of the twister and locks onto the bedpost. The 
              whirlwind SCREECHES to a halt, causing sparks and smoke to rise 
              from the singed carpet. The smoke clears revealing&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>THE MASK CREATURE</p>
            <p>He's dressed in a snazzy zoot suit - a distortion of the paisley 
              material of Stanley's pajamas.</p>
            <p>The head is no longer Stanley's. It's large, bald and bright green. 
              The huge bug-eyes glow with mischief. The nose is small, bony and 
              beaked. The mouth and teeth are enormous and gleaming white as he 
              breaks into a learning grin.</p>
            <p>The overall effect is devilishly loony, but not altogether unhuman. 
              In fact, there's something downright charming about him.</p>
            <p>The Mask checks himself out in the mirror and likes what he sees.</p>
            <p>THE MASK<br>
              S-s-s-nazzy!</p>
            <p>He SNAPS his bow tie with a crazy gleam in his eyes.</p>
            <p>THE MASK (CONT.)<br>
              It's party time!</p>
            <p>INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT</p>
            <p>Trying to ber VERY, VERY quiet, the Mask tiptoes down the darkened 
              corridor. The floor makes a barely audible CREEEEK as the Mask steps 
              with exaggerated care pst APARTMENT &quot;A&quot; with it's little 
              &quot;Quiet Please&quot; sign. He raises a finger to his lip, making 
              the &quot;SHUSH&quot; sign.</p>
            <p>Suddenly - and unexplicably - a ringing ALARM CLOCK leaps out of 
              Stanley/Mask's pocket and starts jittering down the hall.</p>
            <p>STANLEY/MASK<br>
              O, jeepers--!</p>
            <p>Stanley/Mask tries to snag the clock, but it bounces away every 
              time. Frustrated, he pulls a full sized SLEDGEHAMMER from his pocket 
              and starts POUNDING the floor in an effort to stop the clock. Glancing 
              blows shatter the clock face and most of the works, but those bells 
              just keep ringing.</p>
            <p>The hammer, of course, slams craters the size of manhole covers 
              into the floor and reverberates through the building like THUNDERBOLTS.</p>
            <p>The door bursts open and Mrs. Peenman's angry face pops out covered 
              in blue mud pack and framed in curlers. She gets one look at the 
              Mask with his oversized carnival mallet raised over his head and 
              SCREAMS bloody murder.</p>
            <p>The Mask SCREAMS in response, his eyes bugging out on stalks and 
              his mouth expanding to the size of a tuba in mock horror.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Peenman's door SLAMS shut and reopens a beat later as she 
              appears cocking an enormous shotgun.</p>
            <p>MASK<br>
              Easy lady! I was just killin'<br>
              time!</p>
            <p>The Mask starts ricocheting off the walls HOOTING maniacal laughter 
              as Mrs. Peenman lets loose with both barrels. KA-BOOM.</p>
            <p>The Mask bounces off walls as Mrs. Peenman continues to blast away, 
              and finally leaps straight out the window. KEE-RASH.</p>
            <p>EXT. APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
            <p>Sending his body SAILING our through the air towards the street 
              seven stories below.</p>
            <p>STANLEY/MASK<br>
              Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh-</p>
            <p>EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT</p>
            <p>SPLAT. Stanley/Mask lands face up in the middle of the street. 
              He slow&iexcl;&shy; painfully starts to rise as a STREET CLEANING 
              machine turns a corner and RUNS DIRECTLY OVER HIM. The machine disappears 
              down the street as we HOLD on Stanley/Mask's flattened body.</p>
            <p>He raises one arm, grabs himself by the head and peels himself 
              off the street. He shakes himself out with one sharp CRACK and straightens 
              his zoot suit. He's shocked to find a tiny SPOT on his sleeve.</p>
            <p>STANLEY/MASK<br>
              Hey! You missed a spot!</p>
            <p>As if on cue, a SECOND street cleaning machine SLAMS into him and 
              RUNS OVER HIM AGAIN. This time he reinflates himself back into 3-D 
              by blowing into his thumb and hops up.</p>
            <p>STANLEY/MASK<br>
              And next time, no starch!</p>
            <p>Fully recovered, Stanley/Mask starts down the street, strutting 
              like a prize fighter.</p>
            <p>VOICE<br>
              Hey mister&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>Death's Head punker #1 hops down from his fire esscape behind the 
              Mask.</p>
            <p>DEATH'S HEAD #1<br>
              (grins evilly)<br>
              &#133;You got the time?</p>
            <p>The Mask turns to see he is surrounded by the Death's Head punkers. 
              He seems to be delighted by their presence, but now that they see 
              his face, they're totally freaked.</p>
            <p>MASK<br>
              (wiggles eyebrows)<br>
              Why of course, Cubbie. I got all<br>
              the time in the world!</p>
            <p>He whips out his forearm (which grows large for emphasis cartoon-style). 
              It's covered with crazily spinning watches, CHIMING cuckoo clocks 
              and sun dials.</p>
            <p>MASK<br>
              London, Paris, Rome, standard,<br>
              substandard and no standards at<br>
              all! And for our English friends<br>
              we have&iexcl;&shy; Big Ben!</p>
            <p>DEATH'S HEAD #1<br>
              Big Ben?</p>
            <p><br>
              Stanley/Mask KICKS a nearby street post, snapping it in half and 
              sending a large decorative street clock PLUMMETING into the sidewalk. 
              KA-BONG! It completely obliterates Death's Head #1. The other gang 
              members jump back in shock as the Mask races around the corner.</p>
            <p>DEATH'S HEAD #2<br>
              Get him!</p>
            <p>The Death's Heads pull out nasty homemade weapons and race around 
              the corner into the alleyway.</p>

            <p>Pedestrians scramble for cover in the sudden downpour.</p>
            <p>INT. BANK - FOYER</p>
            <p>A young woman scurries into the bank holding a newspaper over her 
              head. She's soaking wet and pauses in the foyer to straighten herself 
              out.</p>
            <p>Charlie immediately notices her&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Hold the phone. Killer at three<br>
              o'clock.</p>
            <p>Stanley follows his gaze.</p>
            <p>STANLEY'S P.O.V.</p>
            <p>CAMERA does a classic CHEESECAKE TILT-UP starting with the woman's 
              million dollar legs as she squeezes some of the water out of her 
              skirt&iexcl;&shy; up past her body, which through her damp summer 
              clothes is undeniable proof that there is a God&iexcl;&shy; up&iexcl;&shy; 
              up&iexcl;&shy; to her face as that newspaper is tossed aside. She's 
              a heart-stopping woman/child with a Cupid's bow mouth and ice blue 
              eyes. In other words she's trouble. Big trouble, also known as TINA 
              CARLYLE.</p>
            <p>Charlie may as well have just seen the Virgin of Guadalupe.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              (hushed reverence)<br>
              Oh my god&iexcl;&shy; A perfect dime. The<br>
              dame of dames. The Moby of my<br>
              dick.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Easy Charlie. You'll sprain your<br>
              eyes.</p>
            <p>Tina now enters and walks towards Stanley and Charlie.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Excuse me, where can I open a new<br>
              account?</p>
            <p>Charlie flashes his best 100 watt smile.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              You've come to the right place,<br>
              ma'am. Just step right this way<br>
              and pull up a chair&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>Charlie tries to steer Tina to his desk, but she's still preoccupied 
              with her damp clothing.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a complete<br>
              wreck. Will you hold this please?</p>
            <p>She hands her shoulder bag to Stanley and peels off her wet blazer, 
              creating another awe-inspiring visual moment.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Here, let me take that for you.</p>
            <p>Charlie clutches her jacket with white knuckles.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Thanks.</p>
            <p>But Tina turns and sits at Stanley's desk; Charlie is stunned at 
              his near miss, but there's not a thing he can do about it.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              So, uh, what kind of account did<br>
              you have in mind?</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              (smiles sweetly)<br>
              Well, I'm not sure exactly. I'm<br>
              just terrible with things like<br>
              that. That's an interesting tie<br>
              Mr&iexcl;&shy;?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Ipkiss. Stanley Ipkiss&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>Tina extends her hand.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Tina Carlyle. Pleased to meet<br>
              you.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              The, uh&iexcl;&shy; pleasure's all mine.</p>
            <p>Tina notices a box of Kleenex on Stanley's desk.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              May I? I'm such a mess.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Oh... of course.</p>
            <p>Tina takes out a compact and daintily blots the moisture from her 
              face.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              As I was saying about that tie. It's<br>
              like one of those, what do you<br>
              call them, ink blot tests.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              A Rorschach test.</p>
            <p>She twists open a tube of lip gloss andbegins to run it across 
              her incredibly lush liips.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              That's it. It looks like... um.<br>
              A young woman riding bareback.<br>
              You know, like a Lady Godiva or<br>
              something.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Really? I don't think I can...</p>
            <p>She slowly runs a finger along Stanley's tie.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Or... if that's not a horse it<br>
              could be two lovers. A man and<br>
              a woman. That would be the woman<br>
              on top, of course.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              (mesmerized)<br>
              ...Of course.</p>
            <p>She licks her lips and blots them on the Kleenex, leaving a perfect 
              kiss impression and drops it on Stanley's desk.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              What do you see, Mr. Ipkiss?</p>
            <p>Stanley starts to get uncomfortable under her gaze.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              I don't know. ...Bold colors.<br>
              It's a power tie, y'know? They're<br>
              supposed to make you feel...<br>
              powerful.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Does it work?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Sort of. It's just a tie. Now,<br>
              about that account.</p>
            <p>CLOSE-UP</p>
            <p>as Tina drops her compact back in her shoulder bag and we see her 
              flick a red L.E.D. light on. She carefully adjusts the bag, aiming 
              a tiny CAMERA LENS neatly concealed within it.</p>
            <p>Tina's pointing the bag at the open bank vault that stands a short 
              distance from Stanley's desk.</p>

              stud and Matsuda jacket watches the video broadcast from his inner 
              sanctum; an eclectic post-modern playroom with an array of electronic 
              toys and minimalist gun racks.</p>

            <p>His two gunsels, SWEET EDDY and CHUN WOO are busy at the back of

              shoulder holsters.</p>
            <p>DORIAN (CONT.)<br>
              Hey, will you guys keep it down<br>
              back there?</p>

            <p>DR. FREEZE<br>
              Layout's not bad. We got us a<br>

              are putting the chill on my<br>
              thrill.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Can you pull it off?</p>
            <p>DR. FREEZE<br>
              Hey, you're talkin' with the<br>

            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Yeah, well the meter's runnin'<br>
              on this one. We got less than<br>
              a week.</p>
            <p>DR. FREEZE<br>
              Not cool. What about the coin?</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              There's plenty. And I'll be happy<br>
              to invest your share.</p>
            <p>DR. FREEZE<br>
              What you talkin' about, man?</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              This isn't about the lousy couple<br>
              hundred thou' that's sitting in<br>

              Doctor. Take a look.</p>
            <p>Dorian pulls back a curtain. An amazingly gaudy building stands 
              on a pier across the river from Dorian's club. A huge sign across 
              it's archway reads: &quot;Opening Soon Valhalla Casino&quot;.</p>
            <p>DORIAN (CONT.)<br>
              The Valhalla Casino. Twenty mil<br>
              of glass, neon, booze and dice.<br>
              World class sucker bait. The<br>

              But I say if you can't beat 'em,<br>
              take 'em over.</p>
            <p>DR. FREEZE<br>
              Yeah? That's Arnie the Swede's<br>

              meatball eatin' motha fucker.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Leave him to me. You pull off<br>
              this heist and I promise you,<br>

            <p>A large WHARF RAT now creeps out along the garbage sniffing curiously

            <p>EXT. CITY STREET - EARLY EVENING</p>
            <p>Stanley and Charlie are riding along at breakneck speed in a taxi 
              cab.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Hold it up right here, please.</p>
            <p>A gun port suddenly SLAMS open and the wild-eyed Albanian TAXI 
              DRIVER wheels about and cocks a huge .45 from his side of the bullet 
              riddled partition as the cab continues to barrel through traffic.</p>
            <p>DRIVER<br>
              Hold up?! No hold up! I keel<br>
              you very well! I splatter your<br>
              guts big time, Mr. Cowboy Man!</p>
            <p>Stanley dives for cover.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              No! No! He only wants you to<br>
              stop the cab!</p>
            <p>The driver instantly SLAMS on the brakes, throwing his passengers 
              forward mercilessly.</p>
            <p>DRIVER<br>
              (now totally calm)<br>
              Hokay. Pardon you very much.</p>
            <p>Charlie helps Stanley sit back up.</p>

            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Why are you getting out here?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              I gotta pick up my car.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Fine. Now don't forget. Ten<br>
              o'clock at the Monkey's Paw. I've<br>
              already got us lined up with a<br>
              couple of authentic dimes.</p>
            <p>Stanley steps out of the cab.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Charlie, please. The last time<br>
              you said that you showed up with<br>
              two lesbian mud-wrestlers.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Well, I can't promise we'll get<br>
              that lucky again... Later!</p>

              the area for signs of life. We can hear the CLANK-CLANK-CRASH of 
              some less than light-fingered automotive work in progress.</p>

              of greasy hair, pops up from beneath a car, RIPS out of chunk of 
              motor and wiring and holds it up to Irv.</p>
            <p>BURT<br>
              (examining part)<br>
              Hey Irv, what the hell is this?</p>
            <p>IRV<br>
              (eyes it carefully)<br>
              Ohh... I dunno. About seven<br>
              hundred bucks.</p>
            <p>They both laugh evilly as Irv slaps Burt on the back. Irv makes 
              his way over to Stanley, still chuckling to himself.</p>
            <p>IRV<br>
              Now what can I do for you, Bub?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              I'm here for the Civic.</p>
            <p>IRV<br>
              Japanese car, right? Kind of a<br>
              nasty pea soup green?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Well, they call it Emeral Forest,<br>
              actually...</p>
            <p>Irv turns back to Burt.</p>
            <p>IRV<br>
              Burt! Pea green Civic!</p>
            <p>Burt pops back up from beneath the hood.</p>
            <p>BURT<br>
              Green Civic... Green Civic. Oh<br>
              yeah! Brake drums are still on<br>
              order and I'm only halfway through<br>
              rebuilding the trans.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              But I just brought it in for an<br>
              oil change!</p>
            <p>IRV<br>
              Yeah? Well you're lucky we caught<br>
              those other problems before they<br>
              caused some serious trouble.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Alright. Alright. When will it<br>
              be ready?</p>
            <p>Irv looks over at Burt, who gives him a &quot;Make something up&quot; 
              look.</p>
            <p>IRV<br>
              Come back tomorro...<br>
              (Burt shakes his head &quot;no&quot;.)<br>
              ...First thing next wee...<br>
              (Burt shakes again)<br>
              ...next month?<br>
              (Burt shakes an enthusiastic &quot;yes&quot;.)<br>
              Yeah, first thing next month.<br>
              That's if we can get the parts.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              What am I going to do in the<br>
              meantime? I can't afford to keep<br>
              taking cabs all over town.</p>
            <p>Irv smiles a rotten-toothed smile.</p>
            <p>IRV<br>
              Oh, hell... we can take care of<br>
              that!<br>
              (to Burt archly)<br>
              Hey Burt, bring around the loaner.<br>
              (to Stanley)<br>
              And for you little buddy, only<br>
              ten bucks a day.</p>

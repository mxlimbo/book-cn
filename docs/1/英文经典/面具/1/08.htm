              PART 8</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. MONKEY'S PAW</p>
            <p>The die-hard crowd of TRENDIES is piled up outside as usual clamoring 
              to get in. But a buzz of excitement begins to travel through the 
              crowd as one by one they notice...</p>
            <p>A LIMOUSINE</p>
            <p>But not just any limousine. As it slowly pulls up by the front 
              of the club we realized it's long... longer... the longest limousine 
              we'vve ever seen. Finally the passenger door rolls into sight and 
              the limo comes to a halt.</p>
            <p>The door bursts open and out leaps the Mask.</p>
            <p>THE MASK<br>
              Ah... my public!</p>
            <p>The crowd parts like the Red Sea as the Mask sashays to the front 
              door. Bobby the Bouncer gets one look at the Mask and actually loses 
              his cool.</p>
            <p>BOBBY<br>
              Er, uh... Are you on the list?</p>
            <p>THE MASK<br>
              No, but I believe my friends are.<br>
              (fans a wad of cash)<br>
              Jackson, Lincoln and Roosevelt.</p>
            <p>He tosses a handful of loot in the air and struts into the club 
              as the crowd scrambles for the cash.</p>
            <p>INT. MONKEY'S PAW</p>
            <p>This is the first time we've gotten a good look at the place and 
              it's a real eyeful. CAMERA BOOMS DOWN TO REVEAL its wild tropical 
              decor complete with live exotic birds in huge indoor Banyon trees. 
              WAITRESSES in leopard skin leotards make their way across the crowded 
              dance floor with trays full of oversized tropical drinks.</p>
            <p>CAMERA ENDFRAMES as the hostess seats Dorian at his favorite ringside 
              table and removes the &quot;reserved&quot; sign. The lights dim 
              an all eyes go to the bandstand.</p>
            <p>ANGLE OF THE BANDSTAND</p>
            <p>A spotlight hits the stage and tropical ferns part like a gigantic 
              fan revealing...</p>
            <p>TINA CARLYLE</p>
            <p>in a glittering gown that's made of little more than sequins and 
              mesh. If there were such a thing as fashion police this dress would 
              be arrested for disturbing the peace.</p>
            <p>She talks/sings the intro of her number a capella.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              There's all kinds of men<br>
              In this old world<br>
              That seek the affections<br>
              Of a beautiful girl.</p>
            <p>But of the men from<br>
              Which to choose<br>
              There's only one type<br>
              That I... ap...aprooove.</p>
            <p>And now the band slides in, in classic torch song style as Tina 
              sings &quot;Checks Appeal&quot;. She works the room throughout the 
              song, driving the men crazy as she lingers by each table.</p>
            <p>TINA (CONT.)<br>
              You can keep your cowboys<br>
              on the farm<br>
              The gigolos don't make me warm<br>
              It's mink my fingers<br>
              crave to feel<br>
              I need a man with checks appeal.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
            <p>The Mask is seated at a table on the other side of the club and 
              immediately reacts when he lays eyes on Tina.</p>
            <p>His eyes BUG OUT on stalks, an AHOOGA horn sounds and his heart 
              starts POUNDING wildly, shooting two feet out of his chest with 
              each beat. Customers at nearby tables are astonished.</p>
            <p>TINA (CONT.)<br>
              Pretty boys are such a bore<br>
              There's manly macho types galore<br>
              But you'll always know<br>
              The diamond's real<br>
              If you've got a man with checks appeal.</p>
            <p>The Mask snatches a bottle off a passing WAITRESS' tray and sucks 
              it down in one gulp. His head VIBRATES like an electric paint shaker. 
              WWWOOOING! He CLAPS both hands on his head to hold it still.</p>
            <p>DORIAN'S TABLE</p>
            <p>Sweet Eddy looks nervous as hell as he appears beside Dorian.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              What the hell are you doing here?</p>
            <p>EDDY<br>
              We got trouble. You better come<br>
              upstairs.</p>
            <p>Dorian immediately rises and hurries through the corwd towards 
              his office.</p>
            <p>ANGLE ON THE MASK</p>
            <p>as he continues to ogle Tina. His face now elongates into a wolf's. 
              He HOWLS, WHISTLES, pounds his fist on the table and stomps his 
              foot on the floor.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Don't want to see too fanatic<br>
              But dollar signs are so romantic<br>
              I want a love<br>
              That's deep and real<br>
              Just with a man that's got...<br>
              (big finish)<br>
              Checks ap-peaaal.</p>
            <p>The audience goes crazy. Tina takes a bow.</p>
            <p>Suddenly the Mask ZZZIPS around the perimiter of the club, leaps 
              up on top of the piano and SNAPS his fingers. A spotlight hits him.</p>
            <p>THE MASK<br>
              Let's rock this joint!</p>
            <p>He grabs the stuffy, tuxedoed PIANIST'S stool and spins it hard. 
              When the pianist stops twirling, he been transformed into a hip, 
              beatnik BE-BOPPER who immediately starts pounding out a mean BOOGIE-WOOGIE.</p>
            <p>The Mask produces a conductor's baton from thin air, spins around 
              and magically whips the rest of the band into a frenzy, WAILING 
              out a driving rock 'n roll tune.</p>
            <p>Satisfied with the music, the Mask leaps down onto the dance floor, 
              grabs the astonished Tina and drags her off her feet into a wild 
              special FX JITTERBUG.</p>
            <p>THE CROWD</p>
            <p>watches amazed as...</p>
            <p>THE MASK AND TINA</p>
            <p>put Fred and Ginger to shame. Jiving away at warp speed, the Mask 
              movves like a combination of Gumby and Barishnikov. He SHOOTS Tina 
              beneath his legs, SNAPS her back into midair, SPINS her like a baton 
              and hits the floor in the splits without missing a beat.</p>
            <p>THE MASK<br>
              S-s-s-smokin!</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p>INT. DORIAN'S OFFICE</p>
            <p>Dorian and Sweet Eddy enter to find Dr. Freeze, sitting there, 
              gasping in pain with a bar towel pressed against a bloody wound 
              in his side.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              What the hell happened to you?</p>
            <p>FREEZE<br>
              I'll be okay. Nobody puts the<br>
              chill on Freeze.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Where's the money?</p>
            <p>FREEZE<br>
              Deal went south, Bro'. Someone<br>
              else hit the place before we did.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Who?</p>
            <p>FREEZE<br>
              Don't know. Dude looked like<br>
              a freakin' goblin or something.<br>
              Next thing we know there's cops<br>
              all over us, man.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Where's Chun Woo?</p>
            <p>FREEZE<br>
              Takin' a dirt nap. It was bad,<br>
              man. Real bad.<br>
              (swallows hard)<br>
              I need a smoke.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Yeah... sure.</p>
            <p>Dorian taps out a cigarette, places it between Dr. Freeze's lips 
              and lights it... but the flame doesn't draw.</p>
            <p>Beat.</p>
            <p>The cigarette tumbles from Freeze's mouth.</p>
            <p>Dorian glances back up and sees that Dr. Freeze's eyes are glazed 
              over in death.</p>
            <p>Dorian leaps to his feat and hurls his chair across the room in 
              anger. It SMASHES the mirror over his bar.</p>
            <p>DORIAN (CONT.)<br>
              Son of a bitch! Who did this<br>
              Eddy? Who?</p>
            <p>Eddy is staring at Dorian's T.V. monitor. On it the Mask can still 
              be seen in the midst of his wild dance with Tina.</p>
            <p>EDDY<br>
              That's him... That's the guy!</p>
            <p>Dorian grabs a .45 from his desk, checks the barrel and jams it 
              in his coat.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Come on!</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p>INT. DANCE FLOOR</p>
            <p>The Mask spins Tina all around him like a top and then SHOOTS her 
              straight up into the air.</p>
            <p>Amazingly, she continues somersaulting at the apex of her ascent, 
              suspended in mid-air by her magical momentum.</p>
            <p>THE MASK</p>
            <p>stands there nonchalantly filing his nails, whistling to himself.</p>
            <p>Tina continues to SPIN in place high above him.</p>
            <p>THE MASK</p>
            <p>casually checks his watch. Without looking up he holds out one 
              hand for the catch.</p>
            <p>TINA</p>
            <p>perfect timing... A final somesault and she drops right back down 
              into his arms. They go straight back into a rockin' hitterbug without 
              missing a beat.</p>
            <p>THE WINDING STAIRCASE</p>
            <p>Dorian and Eddy race down the steps, guns drawn. Dorian calls to 
              Bobby by the hostess' stand.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Clear the club. Now!</p>
            <p>DANCE FLOOR</p>
            <p>The dance's grand finale. The Mask spins Tina around and around 
              his body like a baton in one of those awful Hawaiian fire dances.</p>
            <p>As the band bangs out the final bars of the tune, the Mask SCREECHES 
              Tina to a halt, bends her over backwards and nails her with a Valentino 
              kiss that literally blows her shoes off; SSSMACK! KAPOW!</p>
            <p>She hangs onto the Mask's tie for support when BANG the tie is 
              shot in half. Tina falls on her cute behind.</p>
            <p>C.U. - TIE</p>
            <p>The shot-away piece of the Mask's tie flutters to the floor and 
              MORPHS back into a piece of Stanley's pajamas.</p>
            <p>DORIAN</p>
            <p>stands at the edge of the dance floor, his smoking gun trained 
              on the Mask.</p>
            <p>THE MASK<br>
              (gasps in mock horror)<br>
              Gee willickers! Does this mean<br>
              we won't make the Star Search<br>
              finals?</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              This means you won't make it out<br>
              of this club alive if you don't<br>
              tell me where my money is.</p>
            <p>THE MASK<br>
              Okay...</p>
            <p>The Mask immediately whips out an old fashioned pull handle calculator, 
              snaps on a green visor and starts tabulating. KA-CHING.</p>
            <p>THE MASK (CONT.)<br>
              (fast talking)<br>
              You got a 27.5% in T-Bills<br>
              amortized over the fiscal yeah<br>
              16-3/4% in stocks and bonds/<br>
              (KA-CHING, KA-CHING)<br>
              Carry the nine and divide by the<br>
              Gross National Product...</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Now cut that out!<br>
              (turns to Eddy)<br>
              Ventilate this goon!</p>
            <p>Eddy pulls out his .38 and starts blasting BLAM. BLAM.</p>
            <p>The Mask dodges the bullets by contorting his cartoon-flexible 
              body.</p>
            <p>BLAM. The Mask SPINS once and freezes in a pirouette, now dressed 
              in a tutu.</p>
            <p>BLAM. The Mask SPINS again and stops dressed as a matador, the 
              bullet whizzes under his cape.</p>
            <p>BLAM BLAM BLAM</p>
            <p>A hockey goalie bats the bullet away.</p>
            <p>A Russian Dancer leaps over the shot.</p>
            <p>A Cowboy DING! takes the hit.</p>
            <p>The Mask staggers back... the forwards in a classic Western death 
              scene. He throws an arm around Sweet Eddy for support.</p>
            <p>MASK<br>
              Ak... you got me Pahdnuh.<br>
              (cough... cough)</p>
            <p>Eddy seems touched by the Mask's dying words as he holds him in 
              his arms.</p>
            <p>MASK (CONT.)<br>
              Hold me close, Red. It's a<br>
              gettin' dark.<br>
              (cough)<br>
              Tell Auntie Em to let Old Yeller<br>
              out.<br>
              (cough... cough)<br>
              Tell Tint Tim I won't be makin'<br>
              it home for Christmas.<br>
              (cough)<br>
              Tell Scarlet I do give a damn...<br>
              I... I... UUG!</p>
            <p>And the Mask gives up the ghost, his pink tongue flops out the 
              side of his mouth. Eddy bursts into tears.</p>
            <p>Suddenly a huge cartoon AUDIENCE pops up silhouetted in the foreground, 
              applauding wildly. An off-camera ARM shoots into frame handing the 
              Mask an Oscar.</p>
            <p>The Mask leaps to his feet and starts taking bows.</p>
            <p>THE MASK (CONT.)<br>
              Thank you! You love me! You<br>
              really love me!</p>
            <p>Dorian pulls out his own .45 and opens fire.</p>
            <p>The Mask starts HOOTING laughter and ricochets off the dance floor.</p>
            <p>Dorian gives chase, but suddenly the nightclub doors are KICKED 
              OPEN and Kellaway and a squad of police burst into the room with 
              their guns drawn.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              Drop it, Tyrel!</p>
            <p>Dorian lets his .45 CLATTER to the ground. Kellaway retrieves it.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Hello, Kellaway. You got a<br>
              warrant or did you just drop by<br>
              for a night cap?</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              I got probable cause. A couple<br>
              of your boys were spotted knocking<br>
              over Edge City Bank.</p>
            <p>One of his men begins to roughly frisk Dorian</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Easy, junior. You're givin' me<br>
              a woodey.</p>
            <p>KELLWAY<br>
              One of them was wearin' some kind<br>
              of big green mask.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              For once you're on the right<br>
              track, but that's not one of my<br>
              men. Maybe you ought to try a<br>
              little actual police work instead<br>
              of this harassment bullshit.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              This isn't harassment. You want<br>
              to see some harassment?<br>
              (to his men)<br>
              Search the place, boys.</p>
            <p>His men begin to tear the club apart.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Ever wonder why you didn't make<br>
              Captain, asshole? I got friends<br>
              so high up they'd give you a nose<br>
              bleed.</p>
            <p>Kellaway hauls off and CRACKS him in the face with a solid right 
              cross.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              Well what d'ya know? I guess they<br>
              gave you one too.</p>
            <p>Dorian shakes it off and glares at him.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              (softly)<br>
              You're a dead man.</p>
            <p>One of the officers now appears on the stairway.</p>
            <p>OFFICER<br>
              Lt., we got a stiff upstairs.<br>
              One of the guys from the heist.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              (cuffs him)<br>
              Better call that high-priced<br>
              lawyer of yours, Tyrel. You're<br>
              comin' downtown.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              I'll be back on the streets before<br>
              sunrise and you know it.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              Then just think of this as the<br>
              city's way of showing you a little<br>
              hospitality.<br>
              (pats him on the cheek)<br>
              I'll stop by to tuck you in<br>
              myself.</p>
            <p>As the police drag Dorian outside, Kellaway notices someting on 
              the dance floor.</p>
            <p>CLOSER</p>
            <p>Kellaway picks up the slice of pajama fabric that was once the 
              Mask's tie and inspects it closely... It's the same fabric Kellaway 
              saw Stalney wearing that morning.</p>

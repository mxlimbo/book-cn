              PART 11</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. FORD TAURUS - DAY</p>
            <p>Lt. Kellaway sits in this unmarked police car, finishing up lunch. 
              The police band comes on. Kellaway grabs it.</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY<br>
              Yeah?</p>
            <p>OLIVERAS (V.O.)<br>
              I've got that cross-check from<br>
              the bank files.</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY<br>
              And?</p>
            <p>OLIVERAS (V.O.)<br>
              It's Ipkiss, Alright. Stanley<br>
              Ipkiss.</p>
            <p>Kellaway smiles to himself. At that moment -</p>
            <p>STANLEY</p>
            <p>comes out of Dr. Neuman's office building. He gets in his car and 
              drives off.</p>
            <p>OLIVERAS (V.O.)<br>
              You want us to pick him up?</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY<br>
              Don't do a thing until I tell you.<br>
              Just keep the SWAT team standing<br>
              by. If this guy is half as bad<br>
              as he's supposed to be we'll need<br>
              all the help we can get.</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY</p>
            <p>fires up his engine and pulls away.</p>
            <p>EXT. PARK - SUNSET</p>
            <p>Topiaried ivy reads: &quot;Welcome to Peninsula Park.&quot; A small 
              sign below that reads: &quot;No dumping.&quot;</p>
            <p>Carrying his briefcase, Stanley enters the park.</p>
            <p>EXT. BENCH</p>
            <p>Stanley passes through a stand of trees and nearly bumps into Tina.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Stanley, what are you doing here?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Oh, Tina&iexcl;&shy; Hi. You are early.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              A little.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              I just&iexcl;&shy; wanted to make sure you<br>
              two got together okay.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              That's nice.<br>
              (sits down)<br>
              You know, I hardly ever stop by<br>
              here. It's hard to believe it<br>
              was just a garbage heap.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              (looking at the sky)<br>
              It's always beautiful at sunset.<br>
              Those methane emissions really<br>
              pick up the colors.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Wow. They really do. All those<br>
              pinks and greens.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Well&iexcl;&shy; I' m sure my cousin will<br>
              be along any minute. He never<br>
              shows up anywhere till after<br>
              sundown. He's sort of strange<br>
              that way.<br>
              (rises)<br>
              I guess I'll get going.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              No, Stanley. Stay for a second.<br>
              I was thinking about what you said<br>
              and I, uh, I want you to know I<br>
              appreciate it. Maybe you're<br>
              right. If I believed in myself<br>
              a little more I wouldn't rely on<br>
              guys like Dorian.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Dorian&iexcl;&shy; You mean Dorian Tyrel?</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Yeah. He's sort of my manager.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Tina, you've got to be careful<br>
              of that guy. He's a dangerous<br>
              criminal.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              You really mean that, don't you?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Absolutely. You ought to hear<br>
              the stories&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              No, I mean, you're really worried<br>
              about me. That's&iexcl;&shy; real sweet,<br>
              Stanley.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              C'mon, Tina this is serious. How<br>
              involved are you with this guy?</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              I can take care of myself,<br>
              Stanley. I always have.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Oh, really? People close to Tyrel<br>
              have a nasty habit of turning up<br>
              dead, or haven't you noticed?</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Look, this may sound a little cold<br>
              but I do what I have to do to get<br>
              by, okay? I'sm nobody in this town<br>
              without Dorian.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              And who are you with him Tina?<br>
              I'm not exactly sure who I am<br>
              anymore but at least I'm trying<br>
              to find out. If you really had<br>
              any faith in yourself, you<br>
              wouldn't be hanging on to some<br>
              kind of free ride.</p>
            <p>That last bit stung, and Stanley knows it. A shadow falls over 
              them as the last rays of the sun disappear behind the clouds.</p>
            <p>STANLEY (CONT.)<br>
              (sighs)<br>
              I'm sorry Tina. I guess I better<br>
              get going.</p>
            <p>Stanley gets up and hurries off through the trees.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              (rises)<br>
              Stanley&iexcl;&shy; wait!</p>
            <p>But he's already disappeared. Tina starts to follow after when 
              she hears a strange WHOOOSH. A whirlwind begins to kick up the leaves 
              all around her.</p>
            <p>The Mask leaps out from behind a stand of trees in all his glory 
              and literally sweeps her off her feet. With his lower lip thrust 
              out he romances Tina in a deep syrupy French voice.</p>
            <p>THE MASK<br>
              Cher! Ce moi! Je&#146;taime, Je'<br>
              taime, Je any old tame! At last<br>
              we are together mon petite bon<br>
              bon!</p>
            <p>ANGLE ON THE BUSHES</p>
            <p>Kellaway, Doyle, and two other officers are watching from a distance. 
              He speaks into his walkie talkie in hushed tones.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              This is Kellaway. I need back<br>
              up and I need it now! Every<br>
              available man down to Peninsula<br>
              Park.</p>
            <p>INT. NEWSROOM - BULLPEN</p>
            <p>MURRAY, an old timer newshound hurries into the room, grabs his<br>
              notebook and pulls on his coat.</p>
            <p>MURRAY<br>
              Looks like it&#146;s gonna be a long<br>
              night. My wife is gonna kill me.</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              What is it, Murray?</p>
            <p>MURRAY<br>
              The cops got your pal Ipkiss<br>
              staked out at Peninsula Park.<br>
              We just picked it up over the<br>
              police band.</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              Let me cover it, Murray! You go<br>
              on home to Claire.</p>
            <p>MURRAY<br>
              I don't know, Peggy. Ramsey<br>
              said&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>PEGGY<br>
              (grabs her coat)<br>
              I'll take care of Ramsey. Thanks<br>
              a million. I owe you one.</p>
            <p>She gives Murray a quick peck on the cheek and runs out the door.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p>EXT. PENINSULA PARK</p>
            <p>The Mask is all over Tina like a cheap suit, stroking her hair 
              grabbing her bod. She's definitely having second thoughts about 
              him as he backs her up to the bench.</p>
            <p>THE MASK<br>
              Our love is like a red red rose,<br>
              and I'm feeling so thorny already,<br>
              I'd like to nip you in the bud!</p>
            <p>She ducks his grab, but he recovers smoothly, flipping out a pack 
              of cigarettes. He pops one in her mouth.</p>
            <p>THE MASK (CONT.)<br>
              Cigarette?</p>
            <p>His hand is a blur of motion as he sticks dozens of cigarettes 
              in her mouth.</p>
            <p>THE MASK (CONT.)<br>
              Regular? Menthol? Filter?<br>
              Cigar? Cigarette? Tiparillo?</p>
            <p>He produces a huge blow torch from within his jacket and pops on 
              the flame.</p>
            <p>THE MASK (CONT.)<br>
              Let me get that for you!</p>
            <p>He grabs the gigantic wad of cigarettes as if they were one, puts 
              them in his own mouth and applies the blow torch. With one mighty 
              SSSUCK he smokes them all down to gray ash.</p>
            <p>Beat.</p>
            <p>The ash tumbles away.</p>
            <p>THE MASK (CONT.)<br>
              (exhales a huge cloud of smoke)<br>
              Aaaaaah. And now&iexcl;&shy; amore!</p>
            <p>He throws his arms wide and lunges at Tina.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              Freeze!</p>
            <p>The Mask freezes in mid-air, arms outstretched and feet suspended 
              off the ground.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY (CONT.)<br>
              Put your hands up!</p>
            <p>The Mask's lips barely move as he speaks in a tiny voice out the 
              side of his mouth.</p>
            <p>THE MASK<br>
              But eu tol me oo freeze!</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              Alright, alright. Unfreeze!<br>
              You're under arrest!</p>
            <p>The Mask instantly drops to the ground and throws himself into 
              wildly exaggerated expressions of remorse and pain.</p>
            <p>THE MASK<br>
              Under arrest! My god! The Law!<br>
              I knew I'd forgotten something!<br>
              (tears)<br>
              I was so young! So foolish! So<br>
              full of life!</p>
            <p>Tears are gushing from Stanley/Mask's eyes like twin water taps. 
              He puts his hands out and Kellaway slaps on the cuffs.</p>
            <p>THE MASK (CONT.)<br>
              What&iexcl;&shy; What&#146; they do with me,<br>
              Sarge?</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              Sorry, son. That's not my<br>
              department. Search him!</p>
            <p>Doyle reaches into the Mask's zoot suit and starts tossing stuff 
              on the ground.</p>
            <p>DOYLE<br>
              Comb - Flintstones vitamins -<br>
              Sousaphone - Bazooka -<br>
              (pause)<br>
              picture of Kellaway's wife&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>Kellaway looks down at the photo. It really IS a picture of his 
              wife with a handwritten note: &quot;Call me, lover - 555-1234!&quot;</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              What the --?<br>
              (pause)<br>
              Margaret!</p>
            <p>Furious, Kellaway LUNGES at Stanley/Mask's neck. Two other officers 
              restrain him.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              You son of a bitch -- !</p>
            <p>STANLEY/MASK<br>
              Jeez, I figured you had a sense<br>
              of humor!<br>
              (pause)<br>
              After all, you married her!</p>
            <p>Stanley/Mask honks Kellaway's nose which makes a loud AHOOGA noise 
              and runs for it.</p>
            <p>Kellaway starts to follow, but discovers he's now handcuffed to 
              Doyle.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              Get him!</p>
            <p>The other police officers draw their guns and give chase as Stanley 
              RICOCHETS off through the trees hooting laughter.</p>
            <p>EXT. PARK ENTRANCE</p>
            <p>A twelve foot high stone wall surrounds the park. Stanley/Mask 
              races through the entryway, SLAMMING the park's huge wooden gates 
              behind him.</p>
            <p>CLOSER - THE GATE</p>
            <p>The Mask throws an iron bolt, SNAPS on a huge padlock, SLAMS down 
              a steel plate ZZZIPS up a gigantic zipper, HAMMERS in dozens of 
              nails at high speed and throws himself against the gate panting&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>But then his eyes BUG OUT on stalks as he sees what lies on the 
              opposite side of the gate.</p>
            <p>STANLEY'S P.O.V.</p>
            <p>COPS&iexcl;&shy; more COPS than seems humanly possible. They're 
              in cars, armed antipersonnel carriers, hanging from trees, parachuting 
              from helicopters&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>And they're all aiming serious looking guns at HIM.</p>
            <p>BULLHORN VOICE<br>
              It's all over! Put your hands<br>
              over your head or we'll open fire.</p>
            <p>Stanley/Mask looks around, like he's trying to figure a way out 
              of this mess - then -</p>
            <p>STANLEY/MASK<br>
              Hit it!</p>
            <p>With that, a police SPOTLIGHT SNAPS on, and the brightly lit park 
              entry-way becomes a beautifully lit stage. Stanley/Mask strikes 
              a pose, now wearing a straw hat &quot;boater&quot; and weilding 
              a cane.</p>
            <p>Pedestrians with radios and ghetto blasters look down in shock 
              as a RUMBA begins playing from every speaker in town. Stanley/Mask 
              SWAYS seductively in time to the music.</p>
            <p>A FEMALE COP steps forward, a look of surprise spreaading over 
              her face as, against her will, she opens her mouth in song.</p>
            <p>FEMALE COP<br>
              They rave about Sloppy Joe - the<br>
              Latin lothario - but Havana -<br>
              has a new sensation.</p>
            <p>It's &quot;Cuban Pete RUMBA&quot; by Desi Arnaz! (Yes, this is 
              a real song!)</p>
            <p>FEMALE COP (CONT.)<br>
              He's really a modest guy -<br>
              although he's the hottest guy -<br>
              in HavAAAAna - and here's what<br>
              he has to saaaay -</p>
            <p>Stanley/Mask steps up to the &quot;stage&quot; and tilts the boater 
              over his eyes, casting a sly glance toward the crowd.</p>
            <p>STANLEY/MASK<br>
              (&quot;Latin&quot; voice)<br>
              They call me Cuban Pete - I'm<br>
              King of the Rumba beat - every<br>
              time I play the maracas I go chick<br>
              chick chickie boom!</p>
            <p>Gene Kelly on acid, Stanley/Mask punctuates his number with any 
              number of sly gestures - winking, nodding, sliding seductively down 
              a street lamp post, doing repeated &quot;splits&quot; on the sidewalk 
              - it's his big number!</p>
            <p>The cops watch this with open mouthed astonishment.</p>
            <p>ANGLE ON STONE WALL</p>
            <p>Kellaway climbs over two of his men to scale the wall. He can&#146;t 
              believe his eyes. Doyle clamors up beside him.</p>
            <p>DOYLE<br>
              Hey, he's not bad.</p>
            <p>Kellaway shoots him a dirty look.</p>
            <p>STANLEY/MASK</p>
            <p>waltzes into the street, prancing just inches from the heavily 
              armed cops. His legs twine around each other like spaghetti, then 
              his upper torso SPINS until they&#146;re straightened out again.</p>
            <p>STANLEY/MASK<br>
              (still singing)<br>
              Yessir, I'm Cuban Pete! The craze<br>
              of my native street! When I start<br>
              to dance everything goes chick<br>
              chick chickie boom!</p>
            <p>Like some weird, loony case of mass hypnosis, Stanley/Mask waits 
              for the &#147;musical break&quot; to coax the armed cops into JOINING 
              him on the number - as the rough and tumble equivalent of CHORUS 
              GIRLS!</p>
            <p>ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN FROM HELICOPTER</p>
            <p>The street takes the look of a Busby Berkeley musical as the cops 
              HIGH STEP in time to the infectious RUMBA beat.</p>

              PART 9</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. CLUB</p>
            <p>Kellaway exits and walks right past the poster of Tina. Flattened 
              into the poster, with his arm around her, is a cartoon of the Mask. 
              The eyes follow Kellaway as he speaks to TWO COPS guarding the door.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              You're on your own, boys.</p>
            <p>COP<br>
              Don't worry, Lt. If he's in<br>
              there, well get him.</p>
            <p>Kellaway slips the pajamas fabric in his pocket.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              And if he's not, I got a<br>
              feeling I know where to find him.</p>
            <p>As Kellaway heads for his car, the Mask slips out of the poster 
              (still flat as a pancake), slides along the wall behind unsuspecting 
              policemen and around the corner to safety.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p>INT. STANLEY'S BEDROOM - DAWN</p>
            <p>Milo GROWLS, Frisbee in mouth. Stanley wakes up with a massive 
              headache and dark rings under his eyes. The Mask, which lies on 
              the pillow next to him is taking a greater and greater toll. There's 
              a BANGING on the door.</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY (O.S.)<br>
              Police. Open up.</p>
            <p>Stanley runs to the closet to hide the Mask. The instant he opens 
              the door, an avalanche of CASH pours out, suffocating him.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Oh my god!</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY (O.S.)<br>
              Ipkiss! I know you're in there.</p>
            <p>Stanley grabs the Frisbee and starts shoveling the money back into 
              the closet. Now the doorbell starts RINGING.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              All right, I'm coming!</p>
            <p>Stanley tosses the Mask and the Frisbee into the closet and SLAMS 
              it shut. He scoops up a few stray dollars and throws them under 
              the bed.</p>
            <p>He hurries to the door and opens it, an easy smile on his face.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Lieutenant, what a surprise! What<br>
              can I do for you?</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY<br>
              You can answer a few questions.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              I've got to get ready for work.</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY<br>
              Trust me. Your bank's opening<br>
              late today.</p>
            <p>Kellaway steps into the apartment, without waiting for an invitation. 
              Stanley glances nervously back at the closet. Milo is scratching 
              at the door.</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY (CONT.)<br>
              Where were you last night?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Here... mostly. Is something<br>
              wrong?</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY<br>
              Maybe, yes. Maybe, no. Maybe<br>
              it's all just a crazy coincidence<br>
              that this so called &quot;Mask&quot;<br>
              character always seems to be<br>
              wherever you are.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Mask -- who?</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY<br>
              Don't insult my intelligence,<br>
              Ipkiss. First, he's spotted in<br>
              your building, then the bank where<br>
              you work and now I find this at<br>
              the Monkey's Paw.</p>
            <p>He displays the TORN PIECE OF FABRIC. It matches the piece missing 
              in Stanley's pajamas. Stanley wilts.</p>
            <p>Milo YAPS and leaps up, trying to open the closet door.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Milo. No!<br>
              (moves the dog away)<br>
              Okay, so I went out on the town<br>
              last night. A guy's got to have<br>
              a little fun.</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY<br>
              In your jammies?</p>
            <p>Milo is back at the closet door. He's just about got it open as 
              Stanley turns the detective to the door.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Naw, I just took 'em with me in<br>
              case I didn't make it home. I<br>
              don't know about you, Lieutenant.<br>
              But I've got a pretty good track<br>
              record with the ladies.</p>
            <p>Kellaway pulls away from Stanley and begins suspiciously SNIFFING 
              the air around him.</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY<br>
              Wait a second... you smell that?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              What?</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              (sniffs)<br>
              Bullshit. I hate the smell of<br>
              bullshit. Don't even think about<br>
              leaving town, Ipkiss. I'll be<br>
              in touch.</p>
            <p>Kellaway SLAMS the front door, just as the closet door falls open 
              -- spilling all the cash. Milo happily snatches his Frisbee. Stanley 
              sinks back down on his bed.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              What are we gonna do, Milo? What<br>
              are we gonna do?</p>
            <p>C.U. - VIDEO MONITOR</p>
            <p>A replay of the bank robbery, from the bank's grainy videocams. 
              A blurred image of the Mask is visible as he zig-zags around the 
              bank at high speed.</p>
            <p>WIDER</p>
            <p>Kellaway sips a cup of brackish coffee as Oliveras FREEZE-FRAMES 
              the best image of the Mask. There's a wild-eyed look of glee on 
              his face as he stuffs sacks full of money.</p>
            <p>DEPUTY OLIVERAS<br>
              I don't know, boss. That's one<br>
              helluva rubber mask.</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY<br>
              Where's the lab report?</p>
            <p>Oliveras hands it over.</p>
            <p>DEPUTY OLIVERAS<br>
              We got fingerprints on some of<br>
              the currency, but nothing matches<br>
              Tyrel's men. Looks like this guy<br>
              beat them to the punch.</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY<br>
              Get the bank's employee files and<br>
              run down the prints on a guy named<br>
              Ipkiss.</p>
            <p>DEPUTY OLIVERAS<br>
              You figure it was an inside job?</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY<br>
              Yeah, and all I need is a couple<br>
              of prints to lock this wack job<br>
              up till doomsday.</p>
            <p>INT. DORIAN'S OFFICE - DAY</p>
            <p>Dorian's assembled a war council. At the table are Sweet Eddy and 
              assorted Button Men from the city's underworld. An open attache 
              case filled with stacks of money sits before Dorian.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              A fifty thousand dollar reward<br>
              to the man who finds this &quot;Mask&quot;<br>
              character before the cops do.<br>
              Get the word out to every street<br>
              hustler and low life in this town.<br>
              (pounds his fist)<br>
              I want him here. In my office.<br>
              Alive. By tomorrow! Now get<br>
              going!</p>
            <p>Everybody scrambles out of their seats.</p>
            <p>Tina sits in the corner of the room, painting her nails. She glances 
              up at Dorian.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              What are you looking at?</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              You. You're losing it Dorian.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              I'm losing nothing. Except maybe<br>
              some extra baggage I don't need<br>
              around here.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              What's that supposed to mean?</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              You weren't putting up much of<br>
              a fight when that green goon<br>
              kissed you last night.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              C'mon, did it look to you like<br>
              I had a choice?</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Maybe you did and maybe you<br>
              didn't, but I know this, one day<br>
              real soon I'm gonna run this town<br>
              and when I do there's gonna be<br>
              payback for anyone who crossed<br>
              me.<br>
              (glares at her)<br>
              I mean anyone.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p>INT. BANK - DAY</p>
            <p>The place is in general disarray but still functioning, jammed 
              with worried depositors. Stanley makes his way to his desk, his 
              face pale and unshaven. Dark circles ring his eyes.</p>
            <p>MR. DICKEY<br>
              Ipkiss! We have a crisis on our<br>
              hands here and you stroll in over<br>
              an hour late. If I have to put<br>
              up with your slovenly&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>Stanley develops an odd facial TWITCH, then&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              (explodes)<br>
              Back off Monkey-Boy, before I tell<br>
              your daddy how you're running this<br>
              branch like it's your own personal<br>
              piggy bank! If the I.R.S. saw<br>
              some of those files we could<br>
              arrange a little vacation for you<br>
              at Club Fed!</p>
            <p>Dickey is absolutely shocked into silence by this outburst, then&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>MR. DICKEY<br>
              That will be all, Ipkiss.</p>
            <p>Dickey turns on his heels and exits. Charlie Schumacher now appears 
              glowing with new respect for Stanley.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Woah! What side of who's bed did<br>
              you wake up on?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              I'm not sure.<br>
              (twitches)<br>
              I haven't exactly been myself<br>
              lately.</p>
            <p>For a split second, Stanley's entire face CONTORTS into an alarming 
              Mask-like expression.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              (warily)<br>
              Yeah, well you look like you<br>
              could use a little R and R there<br>
              buddy&iexcl;&shy; and as a matter of fact<br>
              I've got just the ticket. Or<br>
              should I say tickets?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              I'm afraid to ask.</p>
            <p>Charlie flashes two tickets.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Saturday night. Grand opening<br>
              of the Valhalla Casino. Serious<br>
              skirt alert. Everybody who's<br>
              anybody will be there. What do<br>
              you say?</p>
            <p>STANELY<br>
              I don't know Charlie, I&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>Stanley suddenly spots Tina making her way across the room to his 
              desk.</p>
            <p>STANLEY (CONT.)<br>
              Excuse me a second.</p>
            <p>ANGLE ON STANLEY'S DESK</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Tina&iexcl;&shy; What are you doing here?</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              I heard about the robbery. I<br>
              guess I just wanted to make sure<br>
              you were okay.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Oh, don't worry about me.<br>
              (twitches)<br>
              I'm fine.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Are you sure? You look a<br>
              little&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              I'm just having a little trouble<br>
              sleeping is all.<br>
              (beat)<br>
              I guess you won't want to open<br>
              that account after all this&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              I'm not so sure I'll have much<br>
              to open an account with anymore.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              What about the nightclub? I<br>
              thought you were doing great.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              I don't know how much longer I<br>
              can stay there Stanley. Things<br>
              are getting a little intense.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Well, there must be plenty of<br>
              other places you could sing.<br>
              Maybe even get a record deal&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              I wish it was that easy. There's<br>
              thousands of girls out there just<br>
              like me who&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Not just like you. You've got<br>
              a voice like&iexcl;&shy; like an angel.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              (lights a cigarette)<br>
              An angel huh? That's the first<br>
              time I've heard that one.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              No, I mean it. You really do.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              I can vamp my way through a tune.<br>
              But that's not really singing.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              What is it with you, Tina? Why<br>
              don't you believe in yourself?</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              (sighs)<br>
              I guess I've just heard a lot of<br>
              promises from a lot of guys. In<br>
              the end they all wanted the same<br>
              thing and it wasn't a song.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              So maybe you've been singing for<br>
              the wrong guys.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              I&#146;m not so sure there's any other<br>
              kind. Not for me, anyway.<br>
              (rises)<br>
              Well, I'm glad nobody got hurt.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Yeah.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              What about this guy, the Mask?<br>
              Do the cops have a line on him?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              I&#146;m not sure. Why are you<br>
              interested?</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Promise you won't say anything?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Sure.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              He came to the club last night<br>
              and he was just so&iexcl;&shy; well,<br>
              different. I haven&#146;t been able<br>
              to get him off my mind.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Really? They say he's pretty<br>
              weird looking.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Yeah. He's ugly&iexcl;&shy; but he's kinda<br>
              cool&iexcl;&shy; y'now, like Mick Jagger.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              You really think so?</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Yeah. If you hear anything about<br>
              him, would you call me at the<br>
              club?</p>
            <p>Stanley nods - unsure of what to say. Tina opens the door, but 
              before she exits&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Actually&iexcl;&shy; I sort of know the<br>
              guy.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              What?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              The Mask. We're - old college<br>
              buddies him and I.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Are you serious?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Oh yeah. To tell you the truth,<br>
              I'm sorta covering for him on this<br>
              bank thing. He's not such a bad<br>
              guy, really. He just gets a<br>
              little carried away.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              I&#146;ll say. Do you think you could<br>
              give him a message?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              I suppose so.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Tell him I want to see him again</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              When? I mean, I'd need to tell<br>
              him exactly.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              How about seven o'clock tonight<br>
              at Peninsula Park.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              I'll be&iexcl;&shy; I mean, I'll make sure<br>
              he's there.</p>

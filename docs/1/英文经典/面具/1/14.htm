            <p><br>
              INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS</p>
            <p>Milo trots down the hall and approaches the key-guard's station. 
              The dog stares and sniffs at the SNORING man.</p>
            <p>INT. STANLEY'S CELL - A MOMENT LATER</p>
            <p>Milo returns, slipping back into the cell.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Good boy&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>He pulls the wedge of cheese out of the dog's mouth.</p>
            <p>STANLEY (CONT.)<br>
              I said &quot;keys&quot; not &quot;cheese&quot;! Keys.<br>
              K-E-Y-S&iexcl;&shy; keys!</p>
            <p>Stanley pushes the dog back out the cell.</p>
            <p>FOLLOWING MILO</p>
            <p>He approaches the guard and stops - staring at the keys dangling 
              from the man's mouth. Milo jumps up on the desk and bites down on 
              the key-chain. He starts to pull when&iexcl;&shy;</p>
            <p>The guard stirs and almost wakes up. Milo freezes. A moment later, 
              the guard starts SNORING again. Milo grabs the keys and trots back 
              to Stanley's cell.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Atta boy, Milo. Now let's see<br>
              if we can get out of here.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p>EXT. VALHALLA CASINO - SUNSET</p>
            <p>Built on pilings at the edge of the marina, the extravagant Vegas-like 
              structure looks like a stylized Viking castle. (Production note: 
              Key mater shots will be matte paintings.)</p>
            <p>REPORTERS and tuxedoed GUESTS crowd around as the Swede and town 
              DIGNITARIES prepare to cut a huge red ribbon and officially open 
              the casino.</p>
            <p>Two statuesque BLONDES in scanty Valkyrie (Viking goddess) costumes 
              present the Swede with a gigantic pair of SCISSORS. The crowd applaudes 
              and flashbulbs POP.</p>
            <p>THE SWEDE<br>
              So, ladies and gentlemen with a<br>
              special thanks to Mayor Tilton<br>
              and everyone else who made this<br>
              possible, I give you... the<br>
              Valhalla Casino.</p>
            <p>With a mighty SNAP of the scissors the Swede cuts the ribbon and 
              the doors of the casino open wide.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p>EXT. STREETS - SUNSET</p>
            <p>Dorian's limo barrels through the streets of Edge City followed 
              by two sedans full of his men.</p>
            <p>C.U. - THE SUN</p>
            <p>as it disappears behind the clouds. CAMERA PULLS BACK as the limo's 
              moon roof slides shut. We tilt down to discover Dorian and Tina, 
              dressed to the nines for the opening. Dorian holds the mask in his 
              lap.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              It&#146;s almost time.</p>
            <p>Tina nervously starts to light a cigarette. Dorian snatches the 
              lighter away from her.</p>
            <p>DORIAN (CONT.)<br>
              I wouldn't do that, Sweetie. We<br>
              don't want to start the<br>
              celebration early.</p>
            <p>Dorian flips back a blanket covering four compact wooden crates 
              marked C-7 - Caution U.S.M.C. Demolition Materials.&quot;</p>
            <p>DORIAN (CONT.)<br>
              Now sit back and try to relax.<br>
              I've got to change for the party.</p>
            <p>Dorian slowly raises the mask to his face as Tina watches in horror.</p>
            <p>EXT. LIMO</p>
            <p>The tinted glass LIGHTS UP from inside like muted fireworks as 
              Dorian&#146;s transformation begins.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p>INT. POLICE STATION - C.U. - SLEEPING GUARD</p>
            <p>CAMERA PANS from his snoring mouth down to his gun as a hand carefully 
              lifts it out of his holster.</p>
            <p>WIDER</p>
            <p>Gun in hand, Stanley silently backs away with Milo at his side.</p>
            <p>The Guard chokes off a snore and begins to wake up. He sees Stanley's 
              cell door standing open and goes for his gun... but grasps air.</p>
            <p>STANLEY</p>
            <p>puts one hand over his eyes and slams the butt of the gun down 
              as hard as he can on the Guard's head. THONK. The Guard drops back 
              down on his chair unconscious.</p>
            <p>Stanley peeks from beneath his hand and regards his work. Not bad. 
              Milo yips happily.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Come on.</p>
            <p>Stanley turns and starts for the door when he bumps straight into 
              Lt. Kellaway.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              Ipkiss!</p>
            <p>Stanley is shocked, but quickly realizes he's got the gun. He points 
              it at Kellaway with greater authority.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Hold it! I warn you! I'm<br>
              seriously stressed out here!</p>
            <p>Kellaway<br>
              Easy, Ipkiss. Don't be an idiot.<br>
              You're in the middle of a police<br>
              station. There is no way you're<br>
              just going to walk out of here.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              (pauses)<br>
              You're right.</p>
            <p>Stanley pockets Kellaway's gun while keeping him covered with the 
              Guard's gun. He pulls the handcuffs from Kellaway's belt and begins 
              to handcuff the two of them together.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              Now what are you doing?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Putting myself in your custody.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              You are certifiable.</p>
            <p>Stanley unbuttons his shirt and holds it open.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Milo!</p>
            <p>Milo immediately jumps inside and Stanley buttons up. He now looks 
              like he has a pretty nasty pot belly, but otherwise okay.</p>
            <p>STANLEY (CONT.)<br>
              Okay. Now we have to hurry or<br>
              we&#146;ll miss the party.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              Of course. We wouldn't want to<br>
              keep Alice and the white rabbit<br>
              waiting.</p>
            <p>Keeping the gun jammed in Kellaway's ribs, Stanley folds his jacket 
              over his gun hand. We hear it cock beneath the jacket. KA-LATCH.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Now move.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p>EXT. CASINO</p>
            <p>The opening is in full swing as the limo and two sedans pull up 
              to the front doors.</p>
            <p>CLOSER - LIMO</p>
            <p>as the CAR HOP attempts to open the passenger door, it EXPLODES 
              off and shoots ten feet from the car taking the unfortunate Car 
              Hop with it. Dorian/Mask steps out of swirling mists within the 
              limo in all his wicked green glory.</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK<br>
              Don&#146;t be shy, Tina. I know how<br>
              you like to make an entrance.</p>
            <p>He pulls her out of the limo.</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK<br>
              And I must say, that's a dress<br>
              to die for. Or should I say in?</p>
            <p>Dorian's men scramble, hauling the C-7 out of the limo and racing 
              off into the darkness with their automatic weapons.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p>INT. POLICE STATION</p>
            <p>Lt. Kellaway and Stanley march past POLICEMEN, FELONS and CITIZENS 
              in the front desk area looking stiff and unnatural as hell. Doyle 
              waves hello from the coffee service as he munches on a chocolate 
              doughnut.</p>
            <p>DOYLE<br>
              Hi Lieutenant. Where are you<br>
              taking Ipkiss?</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              Ixnay! Ehay's otgay an ungay...<br>
              ouch!</p>
            <p>Stanley jams him in the ribs with that hidden gun.</p>
            <p>DOYLE<br>
              What did you say?</p>
            <p>Milo pokes his head up out of Stanley's shirt, but Stanley instantly 
              pushes it back down. Doyle does a double-take wondering what's wrong 
              with this picture as they continue their stiff-legged walk out the 
              door. Doyle gives an uncertain wave with his half-eaten doughnut.</p>
            <p>DOYLE (CONT.)<br>
              ...See ya.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p>INT. CASINO</p>
            <p>CAMERA BOOMS DOWN. The casino is a true Caesar's Palace style show 
              place featuring a dragon-prowed Viking ship that's the centerpiece 
              of the room. The gaming floor is packed with happy PARTY GOERS.</p>
            <p>CAMERA ENDFRAMES on Charlie Schumacher as he snatches a drink off 
              a passing WAITRESS' tray and turns to a gorgeous Valkyrie change 
              girl whose helmet has two large horns sticking out of it.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Hello tall, Nordic and beautiful.<br>
              One look at you and I know how<br>
              your hat feels.</p>
            <p>Suddenly Mrs. Peenman appears, pushing her way past Charlie with 
              a paper bag filled with quarters.</p>
            <p>MRS. PEENMAN<br>
              Out of my way, Buster. Mama feels<br>
              lucky tonight.</p>
            <p>She jams a quarter in a slot machine right behind Charlie and throws 
              her weight behind the handle.</p>
            <p>ANGLE ON THE FRONT DOORS</p>
            <p>as they suddenly EXPLODE inward, blowing Security Man off their 
              feet.</p>
            <p>Dorian/Mask steps through the smoking ruin dragging Tina after 
              him. He&#146;s flanked by a half dozen of his heavily armed men.</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK<br>
              Now... let the games begin!</p>
            <p>Armed Security pull their weapons, but are immediately blown away 
              by the thugs. The crowd is thrown into a panic.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p>INT./EXT. POLICE CAR</p>
            <p>As it tears through the streets of Edge City with its siren BLARING. 
              Kellaway sits in the rear of the car with his hands cuffed behind 
              his back. Stanley's at the wheel with Milo at his side. Kellaway 
              is livid.</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              Ipkiss, I'll have you locked up<br>
              for this so long sex will be safe<br>
              again!</p>
            <p>Kellaway is thrown into the door as Stanley SCREECHES around a 
              corner.</p>
            <p>CUT TO:</p>
            <p>INT. CASINO</p>
            <p>The frightened crowd mills about in terror as Dorian's thugs seal 
              off the exits. They frisk down their captives for loot and jewelry. 
              Orlando runs up to Dorian/Mask with canvas sacks filled with money.</p>
            <p>ORLANDO<br>
              We scored over half a mil from<br>
              the safe!</p>
            <p>A SECURITY GUARD now pops out from behind a mock-stone pillar and 
              opens fire on Dorian. BLAM. BLAM. BLAM.</p>
            <p>Orlando dives for cover. The bullets seem to have no effect as 
              Dorian rips a Viking spear off a wall display and hurls it straight 
              across the room with supernatural force.</p>
            <p>The spear SKEWERS the Security Guard, sends him flying back and 
              PINS him to a slot machine which immediately rings TILT and spills 
              out quarters.</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK<br>
              You can come out now, Orlando.<br>
              I think he got the point.</p>
            <p>Dorian hauls Tina over to the Vikin ship where his men are wiring 
              up boxes of C-7 and sticks of dynamite. He slams her up against 
              the prow as his men lash her in place with coils of rope.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Let me go you bastard!</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK<br>
              What's wrong darling? This is<br>
              your big production number. You<br>
              of all people know how important<br>
              it is to go out with a bang.</p>
            <p>Dorian pulls his walkie talkie out.</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK (CONT.)<br>
              Eddy... How goes it?</p>
            <p>EXT. PIER - PILINGS</p>
            <p>Sweet Eddy and two other Thugs are busy wiring explosives to the 
              pillars that support the pier the casino rests on.</p>
            <p>SWEET EDDY<br>
              All set boss.</p>
            <p>INT. CASINO</p>
            <p>Dorian plugs the timer into the nexus of all the wiring.</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK<br>
              Excellent. The real party starts<br>
              now and ends in...<br>
              (sets timer)<br>
              Thirty minutes.</p>
            <p>EXT. CASINO - PARKING LOT</p>
            <p>Stanley SCREECHES to a halt in the cop car.</p>
            <p>INT. CAR</p>
            <p>He turns to Kellaway, brandishing his gun.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Okay. When I push the red button<br>
              the safety is off, right?</p>
            <p>KELLAWAY<br>
              I'm not helping you, Ipkiss.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Alright, suit yourself.<br>
              (to Milo)<br>
              You stay and be a good boy.</p>
            <p>As soon as Stanley shuts the door Milo starts pawing at the handle.</p>
            <p>INT. CASINO</p>
            <p>The Swede scrambles under a crap table to escape the mayhem and 
              bumps into Mayor Tilton.</p>
            <p>TILTON<br>
              Hey, watch it! Oh, Arnie...</p>
            <p>Suddenly the entire table is lifted away as if it were a child's

            <p>DORIAN/MASK<br>
              Swede... my dear, dear business<br>
              partner. And Mayor Tilton! What<br>
              a surprise. We have just enough<br>
              time left to play my favorite<br>
              game!</p>
            <p>INT. CASINO KITCHEN</p>
            <p>As Stanley sneaks in an employee's door, the coast looks clear. 
              He snaps off the kitchen lights.</p>
            <p>Stanley spots a THUG standing guard outside the kitchen's double 
              doors. He ducks back down behind a barrel and gets an idea. The 
              label on the barrel reads &quot;Olive Oil&quot;.</p>

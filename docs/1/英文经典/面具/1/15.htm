              PART 15</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. CASINO</p>
            <p>The Thug seems to be enjoying the mayhem when he hears an off camera 
              WHISTLE. He pulls out his .45 and cautiously enters the kitchen 
              to investigate.</p>
            <p>INT. KITCHEN</p>
            <p>The Thug enters, brandishing his gun and cautiously makes his way 
              into the kitchen.</p>
            <p>C.U. - FOOT</p>
            <p>He steps into a large slick of olive oil and his legs shoot right 
              out from under him. SLAM.</p>
            <p>THUG P.O.V.</p>
            <p>as he slides across the kitchen floor at high speed.</p>
            <p>THUG<br>
              Whoaaaaa!</p>
            <p>Suddenly Stanley pops up from behind the overturned barrel with 
              a huge frying pan and slams it right into camera. CLANG.</p>
            <p>STANLEY</p>
            <p>plucks the gun from the unconscious Guard and sneaks into the casino.</p>
            <p>INT. CASINO</p>
            <p>Stanley appears out of the kitchen doors and gets the attention 
              of the nearest captive party-goers.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Pssst. You guys. Over here.</p>
            <p>Charlie turns around.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              Stanley! What are you doing here?</p>
            <p>He motions them over to the kitchen and hands Charlie the gun.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Start sneaking people out the<br>
              back. Watch out for the oil.</p>
            <p>Stanley now makes his way deeper into the casino.</p>
            <p>EXT. PARKING LOT - POLICE CAR</p>
            <p>Milo finally manages to pop the lock and the car door opens. He 
              scurries off towards the casino.</p>
            <p>INT. CASINO</p>
            <p>The Swede struggles desperately as he is tied to a spoke of a huge 
              wooden NUMBERS WHEEL, a kind of upright roulette wheel that one 
              of the casino's attractions. Mayor Tilton and two other town dignitaries 
              are tied to the other three spokes.</p>
            <p>SWEDE<br>
              Let me offa this thing, you<br>
              lousy scumbag!</p>
            <p>Dorian/Mask pulls three Viking hand axes off a wall display and 
              casually begins to juggle them.</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK<br>
              Sorry Swede. I've got an ax to<br>
              grind with you. In fact I got<br>
              a couple and I'm afraid they may<br>
              give you a splitting headache!</p>
            <p>He nods to one of his men who gives the wheel a big spin. As the 
              captives SCREAM Dorian prepares to throw his first ax.</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK (CONT.)<br>
              Round and round she goes. Who<br>
              dies first, nobody knows!</p>
            <p>ANGLE ON THE VIKING SHIP</p>
            <p>Stanley pops up behind the dragon-prow and starts untying Tina.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Stanley!</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Hang on, Tina.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Stanley, look out!</p>
            <p>Stanley ducks just as a Viking ax splits the dragonhead right next 
              to him in half.</p>
            <p>Dorian ROARS with rage as he rushes across the room to the boat.</p>
            <p>Stanley pops back up firing his gun. BLAM. BLAM. BLAM.</p>
            <p>Dorian takes the direct hits. He grins horridly at Stanley and 
              he extends his slimy tongue.</p>
            <p>C.U. - TONGUE</p>
            <p>The bullets all stand there on end in a neat little semi-circle.</p>
            <p>Dorian now sucks in a mighty breath. Stanley grabs a Viking shield 
              and protects Tina and himself.</p>
            <p>Dorian blows the bullets back at Stanley.</p>
            <p>RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT.</p>
            <p>They batter the shield. Stanley is knocked backwards from the impact.</p>
            <p>A HUGE GREEN CLAW</p>
            <p>drags Stanley out and SLAMS up against the prow next to Tina. One 
              of his men immediately begins tying Stanley in place.</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK<br>
              How touching! The two love birds.<br>
              Just to show you there is no hard<br>
              feelings, I'm going to let you<br>
              spend the rest of your lives<br>
              together.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              You've got it all wrong! I could<br>
              care less about this creep.<br>
              Nobody could replace you, Dorian.<br>
              Nobody!</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK<br>
              If you think a line like that is <br>
              going to save your life, you are<br>
              dumber than he is.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              (softly)<br>
              Okay. Maybe it is too late. Then<br>
              all I want is... a kiss.</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK<br>
              A kiss?</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              One last kiss.</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK<br>
              (a beat)<br>
              Sure, why not...</p>
            <p>Dorian/Mask sticks out his slimy TWO-FOOT TONGUE, and stick his 
              eyebrows back. Hiss massive lips flutter as he puckers up. But Tina 
              turns her head way.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              No! From the real Dorian. The<br>
              guy I used to love.<br>
              (breathy)<br>
              Nobody ever kissed me like Dorian<br>
              Tyrel.</p>
            <p>ORLANDO<br>
              No time, boss. This building is<br>
              going down any minute...</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK<br>
              I make the decisions! And I've<br>
              decided...</p>
            <p>Tina stares at him dreamily. Ego gets the better of him. He reaches 
              up and RIPS the mask off. SSSSHUPP!</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK TRANSFORMS BACK INTO DORIAN</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              ...to give the girl one last<br>
              thrill.</p>
            <p>He plants his mouth on Tina's -- kissing her roughly. Tina really 
              gets into it. But Stanley watches as Tina slyly positions the leg 
              that he freed up. And...</p>
            <p>TINA DROP-KICKS THE MASK</p>
            <p>right out of Dorian's hand. It flies into the air.</p>
            <p>A SERIES OF SLO-MO SHOTS AS...</p>
            <p>THE MASK SOARS THROUGH THE AIR...</p>
            <p>DORIAN, ORLANDO and SWEET EDDY ON THE RUN...</p>
            <p>THE MASK REACHES ITS SUMMIT THEN TUMBLES DOWN THROUGH THE AIR...</p>
            <p>HANDS REACH HIGH... FINGERTIPS GRAZE IT...</p>
            <p>But then suddenly... shockingly...</p>
            <p>A SNOUT, FLAPPING TONGUE AND BARE TEETH</p>
            <p>soar straight up through thr human hands and...</p>
            <p>MILO GRABS THE MASK</p>
            <p>as though it were a Frisbee. Everyone is stunned.</p>
            <p>REAL TIME</p>
            <p>The dog lands back on the ground -- the mask firmly in his mouth. 
              He starts to run away but... Dorian grabs his hind leg.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Come here, you ugly little mutt...</p>
            <p>MILO</p>
            <p>legs pumping frantically, is losing ground. At the last second, 
              he drops the mask and jams his muzzle into it. Lightning FLASHES.</p>
            <p>DORIAN's eyes widen as MILO TRANSFORMS INTO -- DOG/MASK!</p>
            <p>His pint-sized doggy body now has a giant-sized GREEN HEAD with 
              a double-row of JAGGED CANINE TEETH. The plain collar now sparkles 
              with GLEAMING STUDS. RAZOR-TOENAILS distend. The eyes glow hell 
              fire green.</p>
            <p>DORIAN (CONT.)<br>
              Whoa!</p>
            <p>Reflexively, Dorian lets go. Dog/Mask unleashes an incredibly loud 
              SONIC WOOF that explodes glass front slot machines all around them.</p>
            <p>DORIAN (CONT.)<br>
              Don&#146;t let it get away!</p>
            <p>Sweet Eddy lunges at the Dog/Mask. But the canine-creature runs 
              between his legs and CHOMPS DOWN on his butt. The tiny dog picks 
              big Sweet Eddy up and shakes him back and forth, like a rag doll.</p>
            <p>STANLEY</p>
            <p>watches this, then takes a look at the TICKING DETONATOR. Less 
              than a minute to go. He strains at his bonds -- forcing the rope 
              into a FLAMING VIKING WALL TORCH.</p>
            <p>Tina winces as Stanley's hand-rope begins to burn.</p>
            <p>DOG/MASK</p>
            <p>uses Eddy as a club -- knocking other Thugs down.</p>
            <p>SWEET EDDY<br>
              Get him off me!</p>
            <p>Dorian raises his Uzi and SPRAYS THE AREA WITH GUNFIRE! Dog/Mask 
              leaps away in the nick of time.</p>
            <p>ORLANDO<br>
              Come on! We've got the money.<br>
              Let's get the hell out of here!</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              I gotta have that mask!</p>
            <p>Dorian chases Dog/Mask into the maze of slot machines.</p>
            <p>STANLEY</p>
            <p>burns through his ropes. He frees himself and races to the detonator. 
              15 - 14 - 13 - 12</p>
            <p>IN THE MAZE OF SLOT MACHINES</p>
            <p>Dorian stalks Dog/Mask, whistling for him to come. A stream of 
              WATER now trickles down on him from above.</p>
            <p>Dog/Mask is in the chandelier taking a whiz and snorting doggie 
              laughter. Dorian sprays the ceiling with gunfire, but...</p>
            <p>DOG/MASK</p>
            <p>pounces on Dorian, knocking him flat, then races out of sight.</p>
            <p>VIKING SHIP</p>
            <p>Stanley yanks one wire after another, but the timer still ticks 
              down -- 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 -- Stanley pulls the last wire. The timer 
              stops. Tina exhales, relieved, as Stanley unties her.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              (kissing him)<br>
              You did it...</p>
            <p>C.U. - TIMER</p>
            <p>as it TICKS back to life... 2 - 1 - 0!</p>
            <p>A muffled EXPLOSION rumbles from beneath the floorboards.</p>
            <p>EXT. THE PIER - NIGHT</p>
            <p>The two front support pilings BLOW UP.</p>
            <p>INT. CASINO - SAME TIME</p>
            <p>The entire floor TILTS. Gaming tables and slot machines start to 
              slide by. Stanley grabs Tina and hangs onto the prow of the boat.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Milo! Milo, come!</p>
            <p>Dog/Mask appears racing up the tilting floor and leaps into the 
              boat as...</p>
            <p>THE LAST TWO PILINGS BLOW UP!</p>
            <p>The entire casino floor drops straight down.</p>
            <p>THE SHIP SLIDES</p>
            <p>straight across the gaming floor towards the huge front doors.</p>
            <p>DORIAN</p>
            <p>SCREAMS as the boat slides right over him.</p>
            <p>EXT. HARBOR - NIGHT</p>
            <p>The Viking ship CRASHES through the doors and SPLASHES down in 
              the marina as the entire casino sinks into the water.</p>
            <p>EXT. VIKING SHIP - NIGHT</p>
            <p>It bobs for a moment, then floats! Stanley, Tina and the dog emerge 
              from their hiding place, under one of the dining tables.</p>
            <p>They can't quite believe they're alive. Their faces reflect romantically 
              from the light of the Viking torch sconces.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Stanley... we made it. We're alive!</p>
            <p>Milo lets loose a happy Whoof!&quot; and leaps into Stanley's arms. 
              Stanley removes the mask with a SCHWOOP and Milo transforms back 
              into a regular dog.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              I'll take that.</p>
            <p>They turn as DORIAN clamors over the side of the boat. He's got 
              a gun pointed right at them.</p>
            <p>Stanley slides an iron grappling hook through the mask's eye holes 
              and holds it overboard.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Hold it right there or you'll be<br>
              looking for this on the bottom<br>
              of the harbor.</p>
            <p>Dorian stops in his tracks.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Drop it and I'll kill you all.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              You can have it. But she gets<br>
              to go.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Fine.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              Go where?</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Swimming. We're still close to<br>
              shore.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Five seconds, Ipkiss.</p>
            <p>Stanley tosses a wooden barrel overboard and turns to Tina.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Go ahead. Hurry...</p>
            <p>Tina takes the dog and slips overboard. Dorian moves in.</p>
            <p>DORIAN<br>
              Okay. Put it down. Right over<br>
              there.</p>
            <p>Dorian waves his gun at the nearest dining table. Stanley starts 
              to put down the mask. But at the last instant -- he tosses it</p>
            <p>INTO THE PILE OF TNT</p>
            <p>As Dorian turns to see where it lands, Stanley jumps him. Dorian 
              FIRES but misses. Stanley jumps Dorian -- knocking his gun away.</p>
            <p>Dorian falls into one of the WALL TORCHES -- toppling it.</p>
            <p>The TWO MEN slug it out as a FIRE STARTS. It burns closer and closer 
              to the dynamite -- the mask in the middle of the pile.</p>
            <p>IN THE WATER</p>
            <p>Tina and Milo cling to the floating barrel.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              (sees fire)<br>
              Stanley! The dynamite!</p>
            <p>BACK ON BOARD</p>
            <p>Dorian pummels Stanley with a flurry of jabs to the head as the 
              FIRE SEARS toward the explosives.</p>
            <p>But Stanley counters with a solid right that rocks Dorian back. 
              Dorian grabs him by the collar to retaliate but sees...</p>
            <p>The FIRE licking at the dynamite casing on which the mask lies.</p>
            <p>Dorian lunges for the mask. Stanley jumps overboard. The dynamite 
              explodes!</p>
            <p>FROM THE WATER</p>
            <p>Tina and Milo watch as the ship blows up. The fireball burns bright, 
              smoke everywhere.</p>
            <p>TINA<br>
              ...Stanley?</p>
            <p>Beat. Stanley surfaces gasping for breath. Tina pulls him over 
              to the barrel and Milo licks his face.</p>
            <p>And then the smoke parts revealing...</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK</p>
            <p>standing on the remains of the boat. Like Wile E. Coyote, he is 
              charred pitch black, with singed hair and clothes. But like a cartoon 
              -- he just shakes off the soot and stands there in all his fearsome 
              Dorian/Mask glory.</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK<br>
              What a BLAST! This mask makes<br>
              me a god!</p>
            <p>He picks up the last fizzing, but UNDETONATED STICK OF TNT and 
              laughs.</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK (CONT.)<br>
              I&#146;m immortal...</p>
            <p>He raises his arms and thunders to the heavens. At that moment 
              -- the SUN peaks over the horizon.</p>
            <p>DORIAN/MASK (CONT.)<br>
              Do you hear? I'm immortal!</p>
            <p>The sun's rays hit the Mask. In an instant, he transforms back 
              to regular Dorian. The mask pops off Dorian's face -- useless.</p>
            <p>Dorian stares dumbfounded at the TNT stick in his hand as it --</p>
            <p>KA-BOOM! Dorian is blown to smithereens.</p>
            <p>EXT. MARINA - DAWN</p>
            <p>There are cops everywhere. Lt. Kellaway wraps Tina in a dry blanket. 
              Stanley holds out his arms.</p>
            <p>STANLEY<br>
              Back to jail, Lieutenant?</p>
            <p>LT. KELLAWAY<br>
              Ipkiss, I'd like to lock you up<br>
              for the rest of my life. But the<br>
              mayor and a hundred other witnesses say<br>
              Dorian Tyrel's the bad guy and<br>
              you're the good guy. So no jail.<br>
              Just a downtown parade at noon.<br>
              (resigned)<br>
              And I've got to be your escort.</p>
            <p>Stanley smiles and puts his arms around Tina. They head down the 
              beach. The two young lovers and Milo walk past --</p>
            <p>CHARLIE SCHUMACHER</p>
            <p>standing near the crowd of post-party VICTIMS being helped by the 
              POLICE and MEDICAL PERSONNEL. He's still hitting on that statuesque 
              Valkyrie change girl.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              So I deck this thug, grab his gun<br>
              and tell Stanley, Take cover,<br>
              Buddy. I'll get these folks out<br>
              sae and sound.&quot; You know<br>
              we should go back to my place so<br>
              I can tell you the rest of the<br>
              story.</p>
            <p>ANGLE ON SHORELINE</p>
            <p>Mrs. Peenman is walking along grumbling to herself when she notices 
              the mask floating to shore with some of the wreckage from the boat.</p>
            <p>MRS. PEENMAN<br>
              Just look at this mess...</p>
            <p>She picks it up out of the surf and The Mask FX theme begins to 
              pound in her head.</p>
            <p>Back to Charlie and his Valkyrie.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              So what do you say, sweetheart?<br>
              Let's you and me go back to my<br>
              place and scramble some eggs.</p>
            <p>Suddenly Mrs. Peenman/Mask ZZZIPS up and sweeps Charlie off his 
              feet. She is the most whacked-out Mask creature yet with a huge 
              green Witch Hazel face and Bride of Frankenstein hair.</p>
            <p>MRS. PEENMAN/MASK<br>
              Hello short, dark and handsome!<br>
              Come here and give Momma a kissy-poo!</p>
            <p>She starts SMACKING her king-sized lips horribly.</p>
            <p>CHARLIE<br>
              (terrified)<br>
              Yah! Put me down!</p>
            <p>She jams a hand down the front of Charlie's pants.</p>
            <p>MRS.PEENMAN/MASK<br>
              Let's see what caliber pistol<br>
              you're packing there, soldier boy!</p>
            <p>She gets a grip and squeezes. AHOOGA! AHOOGA! Charlie SCREAMS, 
              ttears himself from her grasp and starts running for his life. CAMERA 
              PANS with Mrs. Peenman as she RICOCHETS after him hooting laughter. 
              We ENDFRAME on Stanley and Tina as they watch the bizarre spectacle 
              pass them by. They turn and embrace for a well deserved kiss as 
              Milo yips happily and squirms up between them.</p>

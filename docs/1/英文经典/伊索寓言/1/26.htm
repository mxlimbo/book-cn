              <b>The One-Eyed Doe</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A DOE blind in one eye was accustomed to graze as near to the</p>
            <p>edge of the cliff as she possibly could, in the hope of securing</p>
            <p>her greater safety. She turned her sound eye towards the land</p>
            <p>that she might get the earliest tidings of the approach of hunter</p>
            <p>or hound, and her injured eye towards the sea, from whence she</p>
            <p>entertained no anticipation of danger. Some boatmen sailing by</p>
            <p>saw her, and taking a successful aim, mortally wounded her. </p>
            <p>Yielding up her last breath, she gasped forth this lament: &quot;O</p>
            <p>wretched creature that I am! to take such precaution against the</p>
            <p>land, and after all to find this seashore, to which I had come</p>
            <p>for safety, so much more perilous.&quot; </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Shepherd and the Sea</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A SHEPHERD, keeping watch over his sheep near the shore, saw </p>
            <p>the Sea very calm and smooth, and longed to make a voyage with 
              a</p>
            <p> view to commerce. He sold all his flock, invested it in a cargo 
              of</p>
            <p>dates, and set sail. But a very great tempest came on, and the</p>
            <p>ship being in danger of sinking, he threw all his merchandise</p>
            <p>overboard, and barely escaped with his life in the empty ship. 
            </p>
            <p>Not long afterwards when someone passed by and observed the</p>
            <p>unruffled calm of the Sea, he interrupted him and said, &quot;It 
              is</p>
            <p>again in want of dates, and therefore looks quiet.&quot; </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Ass, the Cock, and the Lion</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>AN ASS and a Cock were in a straw-yard together when a Lion,</p>
            <p>desperate from hunger, approached the spot. He was about to</p>
            <p>spring upon the Ass, when the Cock (to the sound of whose voice</p>
            <p>the Lion, it is said, has a singular aversion) crowed loudly, and</p>
            <p>the Lion fled away as fast as he could. The Ass, observing his</p>
            <p>trepidation at the mere crowing of a Cock summoned courage to</p>
            <p>attack him, and galloped after him for that purpose. He had run</p>
            <p>no long distance, when the Lion, turning about, seized him and</p>
            <p>tore him to pieces. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>False confidence often leads into danger. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Mice and the Weasels</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>THE WEASELS and the Mice waged a perpetual war with each </p>
            <p>other,in which much blood was shed. The Weasels were always </p>
            <p>the victors. The Mice thought that the cause of their frequent</p>
            <p>defeats was that they had no leaders set apart from the general</p>
            <p>army to command them, and that they were exposed to dangers </p>
            <p>from lack of discipline. They therefore chose as leaders Mice that</p>
            <p>were most renowned for their family descent, strength, and</p>
            <p>counsel, as well as those most noted for their courage in the</p>
            <p>fight, so that they might be better marshaled in battle array and</p>
            <p>formed into troops, regiments, and battalions. When all this was</p>
            <p>done, and the army disciplined, and the herald Mouse had duly</p>
            <p>proclaimed war by challenging the Weasels, the newly chosen</p>
            <p>generals bound their heads with straws, that they might be more</p>
            <p>conspicuous to all their troops. Scarcely had the battle begun,</p>
            <p>when a great rout overwhelmed the Mice, who scampered off as </p>
            <p>fast as they could to their holes. The generals, not being able 
              to</p>
            <p>get in on account of the ornaments on their heads, were all</p>
            <p>captured and eaten by the Weasels. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>The more honor the more danger. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Mice in Council</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>THE MICE summoned a council to decide how they might best </p>
            <p>devise means of warning themselves of the approach of their great</p>
            <p> enemy the Cat. Among the many plans suggested, the one that </p>
            <p>found most favor was the proposal to tie a bell to the neck of 
              the </p>
            <p>Cat, so that the Mice, being warned by the sound of the tinkling, 
            </p>
            <p> might run away and hide themselves in their holes at his approach.</p>
            <p> But when the Mice further debated who among them should thus </p>
            <p>&quot;bell the Cat,&quot; there was no one found to do it. </p>

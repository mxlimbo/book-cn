              <b>The Dog and the Cook</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A RICH MAN gave a great feast, to which he invited many friends</p>
            <p>and acquaintances. His Dog availed himself of the occasion to</p>
            <p>invite a stranger Dog, a friend of his, saying, &quot;My master 
              gives</p>
            <p>a feast, and there is always much food remaining; come and sup</p>
            <p>with me tonight.&quot; The Dog thus invited went at the hour appointed,</p>
            <p> and seeing the preparations for so grand an entertainment, said 
              in </p>
            <p>the joy of his heart, &quot;How glad I am that I came! I do not 
              often get</p>
            <p> such a chance as this. I will take care and eat enough to last 
              me </p>
            <p>both today and tomorrow.&quot; While he was congratulating himself 
            </p>
            <p> and wagging his tail to convey his pleasure to his friend, the 
              Cook</p>
            <p> saw him moving about among his dishes and, seizing him by his 
            </p>
            <p> fore and hind paws, bundled him without ceremony out of the </p>
            <p>window. He fell with force upon the ground and limped away, </p>
            <p>howling dreadfully. His yelling soon attracted other street dogs, 
            </p>
            <p> who came up to him and inquired how he had enjoyed his supper.</p>
            <p> He replied, &quot;Why, to tell you the truth, I drank so much 
              wine that I</p>
            <p> remember nothing. I do not know how I got out of the house.&quot; 
            </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Travelers and the Plane-Tree</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>TWO TRAVELERS, worn out by the heat of the summer's sun, </p>
            <p>laid themselves down at noon under the widespreading branches of</p>
            <p> a Plane-Tree. As they rested under its shade, one of the Travelers</p>
            <p>said to the other, &quot;What a singularly useless tree is the 
              Plane!</p>
            <p>It bears no fruit, and is not of the least service to man.&quot; 
              The</p>
            <p>Plane-Tree, interrupting him, said, &quot;You ungrateful fellows! 
              Do</p>
            <p>you, while receiving benefits from me and resting under my shade,</p>
            <p>dare to describe me as useless, and unprofitable?' </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Some men underrate their best blessings. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p></p>
            <p align="center"><b>The Hares and the Frogs </b></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>THE HARES, oppressed by their own exceeding timidity and </p>
            <p>weary of the perpetual alarm to which they were exposed, with one</p>
            <p> accord determined to put an end to themselves and their troubles 
            </p>
            <p> by jumping from a lofty precipice into a deep lake below. As they</p>
            <p>scampered off in large numbers to carry out their resolve, the</p>
            <p>Frogs lying on the banks of the lake heard the noise of their</p>
            <p>feet and rushed helter-skelter to the deep water for safety. On</p>
            <p>seeing the rapid disappearance of the Frogs, one of the Hares</p>
            <p>cried out to his companions: &quot;Stay, my friends, do not do 
              as you</p>
            <p>intended; for you now see that there are creatures who are still</p>
            <p>more timid than ourselves.&quot; </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Lion, Jupiter, and the Elephant </b></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>THE LION wearied Jupiter with his frequent complaints. &quot;It 
              is</p>
            <p>true, O Jupiter!&quot; he said, &quot;that I am gigantic in strength,</p>
            <p>handsome in shape, and powerful in attack. I have jaws well</p>
            <p>provided with teeth, and feet furnished with claws, and I lord 
              it</p>
            <p>over all the beasts of the forest, and what a disgrace it is,</p>
            <p>that being such as I am, I should be frightened by the crowing 
              of</p>
            <p>a cock.&quot; Jupiter replied, &quot;Why do you blame me without 
              a cause? I</p>
            <p>have given you all the attributes which I possess myself, and</p>
            <p>your courage never fails you except in this one instance.&quot; 
              On</p>
            <p>hearing this the Lion groaned and lamented very much and,</p>
            <p>reproaching himself with his cowardice, wished that he might die. 
            </p>
            <p>As these thoughts passed through his mind, he met an Elephant </p>
            <p>and came close to hold a conversation with him. After a time he</p>
            <p>observed that the Elephant shook his ears very often, and he</p>
            <p>inquired what was the matter and why his ears moved with such a</p>
            <p>tremor every now and then. Just at that moment a Gnat settled on</p>
            <p>the head of the Elephant, and he replied, &quot;Do you see that 
              little</p>
            <p>buzzing insect? If it enters my ear, my fate is sealed. I should</p>
            <p>die presently.&quot; The Lion said, &quot;Well, since so huge a 
              beast is</p>
            <p>afraid of a tiny gnat, I will no more complain, nor wish myself</p>
            <p>dead. I find myself, even as I am, better off than the Elephant.&quot;

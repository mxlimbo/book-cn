              <b>The Ass and the Frogs</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>AN ASS, carrying a load of wood, passed through a pond. As he</p>
            <p>was crossing through the water he lost his footing, stumbled and</p>
            <p>fell, and not being able to rise on account of his load, groaned</p>
            <p>heavily. Some Frogs frequenting the pool heard his lamentation,</p>
            <p>and said, &quot;What would you do if you had to live here always 
              as we</p>
            <p>do, when you make such a fuss about a mere fall into the water?&quot;</p>
            <p></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Men often bear little grievances with less courage than they do</p>
            <p>large misfortunes. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Crow and the Raven</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A CROW was jealous of the Raven, because he was considered a </p>
            <p>bird of good omen and always attracted the attention of men, who</p>
            <p> noted by his flight the good or evil course of future events. 
              Seeing</p>
            <p>some travelers approaching, the Crow flew up into a tree, and</p>
            <p>perching herself on one of the branches, cawed as loudly as she</p>
            <p>could. The travelers turned towards the sound and wondered what</p>
            <p>it foreboded, when one of them said to his companion, &quot;Let 
              us</p>
            <p>proceed on our journey, my friend, for it is only the caw of a</p>
            <p>crow, and her cry, you know, is no omen.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Those who assume a character which does not belong to them, </p>
            <p>only make themselves ridiculous. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Trees and the Axe</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A MAN came into a forest and asked the Trees to provide him a</p>
            <p>handle for his axe. The Trees consented to his request and gave</p>
            <p>him a young ash-tree. No sooner had the man fitted a new handle</p>
            <p>to his axe from it, than he began to use it and quickly felled</p>
            <p>with his strokes the noblest giants of the forest. An old oak,</p>
            <p>lamenting when too late the destruction of his companions, said</p>
            <p>to a neighboring cedar, &quot;The first step has lost us all. If 
              we</p>
            <p>had not given up the rights of the ash, we might yet have</p>
            <p>retained our own privileges and have stood for ages.&quot; </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Crab and the Fox</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A CRAB, forsaking the seashore, chose a neighboring green </p>
            <p>meadow as its feeding ground. A Fox came across him, and being</p>
            <p> very hungry ate him up. Just as he was on the point of being eaten,</p>
            <p>the Crab said, &quot;I well deserve my fate, for what business 
              had I</p>
            <p>on the land, when by my nature and habits I am only adapted for</p>
            <p>the sea?' </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Contentment with our lot is an element of happiness. </p>

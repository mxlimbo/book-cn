              <b>The Lion in a Farmyard</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A LION entered a farmyard. The Farmer, wishing to catch him,</p>
            <p>shut the gate. When the Lion found that he could not escape, he</p>
            <p>flew upon the sheep and killed them, and then attacked the oxen. 
            </p>
            <p>The Farmer, beginning to be alarmed for his own safety, opened</p>
            <p>the gate and released the Lion. On his departure the Farmer</p>
            <p>grievously lamented the destruction of his sheep and oxen, but</p>
            <p>his wife, who had been a spectator to all that took place, said,</p>
            <p>&quot;On my word, you are rightly served, for how could you for 
              a</p>
            <p>moment think of shutting up a Lion along with you in your</p>
            <p>farmyard when you know that you shake in your shoes if you only</p>
            <p>hear his roar at a distance?' </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>MERCURY ONCE DETERMINED to learn in what esteem he </p>
            <p>was held among mortals. For this purpose he assumed the haracter</p>
            <p> of a man and visited in this disguise a Sculptor's studio having 
            </p>
            <p> looked at various statues, he demanded the price of two figures 
              of</p>
            <p> Jupiter and Juno. When the sum at which they were valued was </p>
            <p>named, he pointed to a figure of himself, saying to the Sculptor, 
            </p>
            <p> &quot;You will certainly want much more for this, as it is the 
              statue of </p>
            <p>the Messenger of the Gods, and author of all your gain.&quot; The</p>
            <p>Sculptor replied, &quot;Well, if you will buy these, I'll fling 
              you that into</p>
            <p> the bargain.&quot; </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A CERTAIN rich man bought in the market a Goose and a Swan. </p>
            <p>He fed the one for his table and kept the other for the sake of 
              its</p>
            <p>song. When the time came for killing the Goose, the cook went to</p>
            <p>get him at night, when it was dark, and he was not able to</p>
            <p>distinguish one bird from the other. By mistake he caught the</p>
            <p>Swan instead of the Goose. The Swan, threatened with death,</p>
            <p>burst forth into song and thus made himself known by his voice,</p>
            <p>and preserved his life by his melody. </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A VERY HUNGRY FOX, seeing some bread and meat left by </p>
            <p>shepherds in the hollow of an oak, crept into the hole and made 
              a </p>
            <p>hearty meal. When he finished, he was so full that he was not able 
            </p>
            <p> to get out, and began to groan and lament his fate. Another Fox</p>
            <p>passing by heard his cries, and coming up, inquired the cause of</p>
            <p>his complaining. On learning what had happened, he said to him,</p>
            <p>&quot;Ah, you will have to remain there, my friend, until you become</p>
            <p>such as you were when you crept in, and then you will easily get</p>

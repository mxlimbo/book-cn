              <b>The Laborer and the Snake</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A SNAKE, having made his hole close to the porch of a cottage,</p>
            <p>inflicted a mortal bite on the Cottager's infant son. Grieving 
              over </p>
            <p>his loss, the Father resolved to kill the Snake. The next day, 
              when</p>
            <p> it came out of its hole for food, he took up his axe, but by </p>
            <p>swinging too hastily, missed its head and cut off only the end 
              of its</p>
            <p> tail. After some time the Cottager, afraid that the Snake would 
              bite</p>
            <p> him also, endeavored to make peace, and placed some bread and 
            </p>
            <p> salt in the hole. The Snake, slightly hissing, said: &quot;There 
              can </p>
            <p>henceforth be no peace between us; for whenever I see you I </p>
            <p>shall remember the loss of my tail, and whenever you see me you 
            </p>
            <p> will be thinking of the death of your son.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>No one truly forgets injuries in the presence of him who caused</p>
            <p>the injury. </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>ONCE UPON A TIME a Wolf resolved to disguise his appearance</p>
            <p> in order to secure food more easily. Encased in the skin of a</p>
            <p>sheep, he pastured with the flock deceiving the shepherd by his</p>
            <p>costume. In the evening he was shut up by the shepherd in the</p>
            <p>fold; the gate was closed, and the entrance made thoroughly</p>
            <p>secure. But the shepherd, returning to the fold during the night</p>
            <p>to obtain meat for the next day, mistakenly caught up the Wolf</p>
            <p>instead of a sheep, and killed him instantly. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Ass and the Mule</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A MULETEER set forth on a journey, driving before him an Ass </p>
            <p>and a Mule, both well laden. The Ass, as long as he traveled along</p>
            <p>the plain, carried his load with ease, but when he began to ascend 
            </p>
            <p>the steep path of the mountain, felt his load to be more than he 
            </p>
            <p> could bear. He entreated his companion to relieve him of a small 
            </p>
            <p> portion, that he might carry home the rest; but the Mule paid 
              no </p>
            <p>attention to the request. The Ass shortly afterwards fell down 
              dead</p>
            <p> under his burden. Not knowing what else to do in so wild a region,</p>
            <p> the Muleteer placed upon the Mule the load carried by the Ass 
              in </p>
            <p>addition to his own, and at the top of all placed the hide of the 
            </p>
            <p> Ass, after he had skinned him. The Mule, groaning beneath his 
            </p>
            <p> heavy burden, said to himself: &quot;I am treated according to 
              my </p>
            <p>deserts. If I had only been willing to assist the Ass a little 
              in his </p>
            <p>need, I should not now be bearing, together with his burden, </p>
            <p>himself as well.&quot; </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Frogs Asking for a King</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>THE FROGS, grieved at having no established Ruler, sent</p>
            <p>ambassadors to Jupiter entreating for a King. Perceiving their</p>
            <p>simplicity, he cast down a huge log into the lake. The Frogs were 
            </p>
            <p> terrified at the splash occasioned by its fall and hid themselves 
              in </p>
            <p>the depths of the pool. But as soon as they realized that the huge 
            </p>
            <p> log was motionless, they swam again to the top of the water, </p>
            <p>dismissed their fears, climbed up, and began squatting on it in 
            </p>
            <p> contempt. After some time they began to think themselves ill-</p>
            <p>treated in the appointment of so inert a Ruler, and sent a second 
            </p>
            <p> deputation to Jupiter to pray that he would set over them another 
            </p>
            <p> sovereign. He then gave them an Eel to govern them. When the </p>
            <p>Frogs discovered his easy good nature, they sent yet a third time 
              to</p>
            <p> Jupiter to beg him to choose for them still another King. Jupiter, 
            </p>
            <p> displeased with all their complaints, sent a Heron, who preyed 
            </p>
            <p> upon the Frogs day by day till there were none left to croak upon 
            </p>
            <p> the lake. </p>

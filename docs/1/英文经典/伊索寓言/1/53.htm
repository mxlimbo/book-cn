              <b>The Fishermen</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>SOME FISHERMEN were out trawling their nets. Perceiving them</p>
            <p> to be very heavy, they danced about for joy and supposed that 
            </p>
            <p> they had taken a large catch. When they had dragged the nets to 
            </p>
            <p> the shore they found but few fish: the nets were full of sand 
              and</p>
            <p>stones, and the men were beyond measure cast downso much at </p>
            <p>the disappointment which had befallen them, but because they had</p>
            <p>formed such very different expectations. One of their company,</p>
            <p>an old man, said, &quot;Let us cease lamenting, my mates, for, 
              as it</p>
            <p>seems to me, sorrow is always the twin sister of joy; and it was</p>
            <p>only to be looked for that we, who just now were over-rejoiced,</p>
            <p>should next have something to make us sad.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p></p>
            <p align="center"><b>The Lion and the Three Bulls</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>THREE BULLS for a long time pastured together. A Lion lay in</p>
            <p>ambush in the hope of making them his prey, but was afraid to</p>
            <p>attack them while they kept together. Having at last by guileful</p>
            <p>speeches succeeded in separating them, he attacked them without</p>
            <p>fear as they fed alone, and feasted on them one by one at his own</p>
            <p>leisure. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Union is strength. </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A FOWLER, taking his bird-lime and his twigs, went out to catch</p>
            <p>birds. Seeing a thrush sitting upon a tree, he wished to take</p>
            <p>it, and fitting his twigs to a proper length, watched intently,</p>
            <p>having his whole thoughts directed towards the sky. While thus</p>
            <p>looking upwards, he unknowingly trod upon a Viper asleep just</p>
            <p>before his feet. The Viper, turning about, stung him, and</p>
            <p>falling into a swoon, the man said to himself, &quot;Woe is me! 
              that</p>
            <p>while I purposed to hunt another, I am myself fallen unawares</p>
            <p>into the snares of death.&quot; </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Horse and the Ass</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A HORSE, proud of his fine trappings, met an Ass on the ighway. 
            </p>
            <p>The Ass, being heavily laden, moved slowly out of the way. </p>
            <p>&quot;Hardly,&quot; said the Horse, &quot;can I resist kicking 
              you with my</p>
            <p>heels.&quot; The Ass held his peace, and made only a silent appeal 
              to</p>
            <p>the justice of the gods. Not long afterwards the Horse, having</p>
            <p>become broken-winded, was sent by his owner to the farm. The</p>
            <p>Ass, seeing him drawing a dungcart, thus derided him: &quot;Where, 
              O</p>
            <p>boaster, are now all thy gay trappings, thou who are thyself</p>
            <p>reduced to the condition you so lately treated with contempt?'

              <b>The Crow and Mercury</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A CROW caught in a snare prayed to Apollo to release him, </p>
            <p>making a vow to offer some frankincense at his shrine. But when 
            </p>
            <p> rescued from his danger, he forgot his promise. Shortly </p>
            <p>afterwards, again caught in a snare, he passed by Apollo and made</p>
            <p> the same promise to offer frankincense to Mercury. Mercury soon</p>
            <p> appeared and said to him, &quot;O thou most base fellow? how can 
              I </p>
            <p>believe thee, who hast disowned and wronged thy former patron?'

            <p> </p>
            <p>THE NORTH WIND and the Sun disputed as to which was the </p>
            <p>most powerful, and agreed that he should be declared the victor 
            </p>
            <p> who could first strip a wayfaring man of his clothes. The North 
            </p>
            <p> Wind first tried his power and blew with all his might, but the 
            </p>
            <p> keener his blasts, the closer the Traveler wrapped his cloak around</p>
            <p> him, until at last, resigning all hope of victory, the Wind called</p>
            <p>upon the Sun to see what he could do. The Sun suddenly shone </p>
            <p>out with all his warmth. The Traveler no sooner felt his genial 
              rays</p>
            <p>than he took off one garment after another, and at last, fairly</p>
            <p>overcome with heat, undressed and bathed in a stream that lay in</p>
            <p>his path. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Persuasion is better than Force. </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>TWO MEN, deadly enemies to each other, were sailing in the same</p>
            <p>vessel. Determined to keep as far apart as possible, the one seated</p>
            <p> himself in the stem, and the other in the prow of the ship. A 
              violent</p>
            <p> storm arose, and with the vessel in great danger of sinking, the 
              one</p>
            <p> in the stern inquired of the pilot which of the two ends of the 
              ship </p>
            <p>would go down first. On his replying that he supposed it would 
              be</p>
            <p> the prow, the Man said, &quot;Death would not be grievous to me, 
              if I </p>
            <p>could only see my Enemy die before me.&quot; </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A MAN had two Gamecocks in his poultry-yard. One day by </p>
            <p>chance he found a tame Partridge for sale. He purchased it and 
            </p>
            <p> brought it home to be reared with his Gamecocks. When the </p>
            <p>Partridge was put into the poultry-yard, they struck at it and 
            </p>
            <p> followed it about, so that the Partridge became grievously troubled</p>
            <p> and supposed that he was thus evilly treated because he was a</p>
            <p>stranger. Not long afterwards he saw the Cocks fighting together</p>
            <p>and not separating before one had well beaten the other. He then</p>
            <p>said to himself, &quot;I shall no longer distress myself at being</p>
            <p>struck at by these Gamecocks, when I see that they cannot even</p>
            <p>refrain from quarreling with each other.&quot; </p>

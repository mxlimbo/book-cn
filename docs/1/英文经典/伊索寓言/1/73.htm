              <b>The Viper and the File</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A LION, entering the workshop of a smith, sought from the tools</p>
            <p>the means of satisfying his hunger. He more particularly</p>
            <p>addressed himself to a File, and asked of him the favor of a</p>
            <p>meal. The File replied, &quot;You must indeed be a simple-minded</p>
            <p>fellow if you expect to get anything from me, who am accustomed</p>
            <p>to take from everyone, and never to give anything in return.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p align="center"> </p>
            <p align="center"></p>
            <p align="center"><b>The Lion and the Shepherd</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A LION, roaming through a forest, trod upon a thorn. Soon</p>
            <p>afterward he came up to a Shepherd and fawned upon him, </p>
            <p>wagging his tail as if to say, &quot;I am a suppliant, and seek 
              your aid.&quot;</p>
            <p> The Shepherd boldly examined the beast, discovered the thorn, 
            </p>
            <p> and placing his paw upon his lap, pulled it out; thus relieved 
              of his</p>
            <p>pain, the Lion returned into the forest. Some time after, the</p>
            <p>Shepherd, being imprisoned on a false accusation, was condemned</p>
            <p>&quot;to be cast to the Lions&quot; as the punishment for his imputed</p>
            <p>crime. But when the Lion was released from his cage, he</p>
            <p>recognized the Shepherd as the man who healed him, and instead</p>
            <p> of attacking him, approached and placed his foot upon his lap. 
              The</p>
            <p>King, as soon as he heard the tale, ordered the Lion to be set</p>
            <p>free again in the forest, and the Shepherd to be pardoned and</p>
            <p>restored to his friends. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Camel and Jupiter</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>THE CAMEL, when he saw the Bull adorned with horns, envied </p>
            <p>him and wished that he himself could obtain the same honors. He 
            </p>
            <p> went to Jupiter, and besought him to give him horns. Jupiter, 
              vexed</p>
            <p>at his request because he was not satisfied with his size and</p>
            <p>strength of body, and desired yet more, not only refused to give</p>
            <p>him horns, but even deprived him of a portion of his ears. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Panther and the Shepherds</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A PANTHER, by some mischance, fell into a pit. The Shepherds</p>
            <p>discovered him, and some threw sticks at him and pelted him with</p>
            <p>stones, while others, moved with compassion towards one about </p>
            <p>to die even though no one should hurt him, threw in some food to</p>
            <p>prolong his life. At night they returned home, not dreaming of</p>
            <p>any danger, but supposing that on the morrow they would find him</p>
            <p>dead. The Panther, however, when he had recruited his feeble</p>
            <p>strength, freed himself with a sudden bound from the pit, and</p>
            <p>hastened to his den with rapid steps. After a few days he came</p>
            <p>forth and slaughtered the cattle, and, killing the Shepherds who</p>
            <p>had attacked him, raged with angry fury. Then they who had</p>
            <p>spared his life, fearing for their safety, surrendered to him their 
            </p>
            <p> flocks and begged only for their lives. To them the Panther made 
            </p>
            <p> this reply: &quot;I remember alike those who sought my life with 
              stones,</p>
            <p> and those who gave me food aside, therefore, your fears. I return 
            </p>
            <p> as an enemy only to those who injured me.&quot;</p>

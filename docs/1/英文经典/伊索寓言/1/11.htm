              <b>The Cat and the Cock</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A CAT caught a Cock, and pondered how he might find a </p>
            <p>reasonable excuse for eating him. He accused him of being a </p>
            <p>nuisance to men by crowing in the nighttime and not permitting 
            </p>
            <p> them to sleep. </p>
            <p>The Cock defended himself by saying that he did this for the</p>
            <p>benefit of men, that they might rise in time for their labors. 
            </p>
            <p>The Cat replied, &quot;Although you abound in specious apologies, 
              I</p>
            <p>shall not remain supperless&quot;; and he made a meal of him. </p>
            <p align="center"> </p>
            <p align="center"></p>
            <p align="center"><b>The Piglet, the Sheep, and the Goat</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A YOUNG PIG was shut up in a fold-yard with a Goat and a </p>
            <p>Sheep. </p>
            <p>On one occasion when the shepherd laid hold of him, he grunted</p>
            <p>and squeaked and resisted violently. The Sheep and the Goat</p>
            <p>complained of his distressing cries, saying, &quot;He often handles</p>
            <p>us, and we do not cry out.&quot; To this the Pig replied, &quot;Your</p>
            <p>handling and mine are very different things. He catches you only</p>
            <p>for your wool, or your milk, but he lays hold on me for my very</p>
            <p>life.&quot; </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Boy and the Filberts</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A BOY put his hand into a pitcher full of filberts. He grasped</p>
            <p>as many as he could possibly hold, but when he tried to pull out</p>
            <p>his hand, he was prevented from doing so by the neck of the</p>
            <p>pitcher. Unwilling to lose his filberts, and yet unable to</p>
            <p>withdraw his hand, he burst into tears and bitterly lamented his</p>
            <p>disappointment. A bystander said to him, &quot;Be satisfied with 
              half</p>
            <p>the quantity, and you will readily draw out your hand.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Do not attempt too much at once. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Lion in Love</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A LION demanded the daughter of a woodcutter in marriage. The</p>
            <p>Father, unwilling to grant, and yet afraid to refuse his request,</p>
            <p>hit upon this expedient to rid himself of his importunities. He</p>
            <p>expressed his willingness to accept the Lion as the suitor of his</p>
            <p>daughter on one condition: that he should allow him to extract</p>
            <p>his teeth, and cut off his claws, as his daughter was fearfully</p>
            <p>afraid of both. The Lion cheerfully assented to the proposal. </p>
            <p>But when the toothless, clawless Lion returned to repeat his</p>
            <p>request, the Woodman, no longer afraid, set upon him with his</p>
            <p>club, and drove him away into the forest.</p>

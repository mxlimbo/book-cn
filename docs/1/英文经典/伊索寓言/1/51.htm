              <b>The Seller of Images</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A CERTAIN MAN made a wooden image of Mercury and offered</p>
            <p> it for sale. When no one appeared willing to buy it, in order 
              to</p>
            <p>attract purchasers, he cried out that he had the statue to sell</p>
            <p>of a benefactor who bestowed wealth and helped to heap up iches. 
            </p>
            <p>One of the bystanders said to him, &quot;My good fellow, why do 
              you</p>
            <p>sell him, being such a one as you describe, when you may yourself</p>
            <p>enjoy the good things he has to give?' &quot;Why,&quot; he replied, 
              &quot;I am</p>
            <p>in need of immediate help, and he is wont to give his good gifts</p>
            <p>very slowly.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The Fox and the Grapes </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A FAMISHED FOX saw some clusters of ripe black grapes </p>
            <p>hanging from a trellised vine. She resorted to all her tricks to 
              get at</p>
            <p>them, but wearied herself in vain, for she could not reach them. 
            </p>
            <p>At last she turned away, hiding her disappointment and saying:</p>
            <p>&quot;The Grapes are sour, and not ripe as I thought.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The Man and His Wife A MAN had a Wife who made herself </p>
            <p>hated by all the members of his household. Wishing to find out 
              if </p>
            <p>she had the same effect on the persons in her father's house, he 
            </p>
            <p> made some excuse to send her home on a visit to her father. After</p>
            <p> a short time she returned, and when he inquired how she had got 
            </p>
            <p> on and how the servants had treated her, she replied, &quot;The 
            </p>
            <p> herdsmen and shepherds cast on me looks of aversion.&quot; He 
              said, </p>
            <p>&quot;O Wife, if you were disliked by those who go out early in 
              the</p>
            <p> morning with their flocks and return late in the evening, what 
              must </p>
            <p>have been felt towards you by those with whom you passed the </p>
            <p>whole day!&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Straws show how the wind blows. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The Peacock and Juno THE PEACOCK made complaint to Juno</p>
            <p> that, while the nightingale pleased every ear with his song, he 
            </p>
            <p> himself no sooner opened his mouth than he became a </p>
            <p>laughingstock to all who heard him. The Goddess, to console him,</p>
            <p> said, &quot;But you far excel in beauty and in size. The splendor 
              of the </p>
            <p>emerald shines in your neck and you unfold a tail gorgeous with 
            </p>
            <p> painted plumage.&quot; &quot;But for what purpose have I,&quot; 
              said the bird, </p>
            <p>&quot;this dumb beauty so long as I am surpassed in song?' &quot;The 
              lot of</p>
            <p> each,&quot; replied Juno, &quot;has been assigned by the will 
              of the Fates--to</p>
            <p> thee, beauty; to the eagle, strength; to the nightingale, song; 
              to the </p>
            <p>raven, favorable, and to the crow, unfavorable auguries. These 
              are </p>
            <p>all contented with the endowments allotted to them.&quot;</p>

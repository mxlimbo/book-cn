              <b>The Wolf and the Lamb</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>WOLF, meeting with a Lamb astray from the fold, resolved not to</p>
            <p>lay violent hands on him, but to find some plea to justify to the</p>
            <p>Lamb the Wolf's right to eat him. He thus addressed him:&quot;Sirrah, 
            </p>
            <p> last year you grossly insulted me.&quot; &quot;Indeed,&quot; bleated 
              the Lamb in a</p>
            <p> mournful tone of voice, &quot;I was not then born.&quot; Then 
              said the Wolf</p>
            <p>, &quot;You feed in my pasture.&quot; &quot;No, good sir,&quot; 
              replied the Lamb, &quot;I </p>
            <p>have not yet tasted grass.&quot; Again said the Wolf, &quot;You 
              drink of my</p>
            <p> well.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; exclaimed the Lamb, &quot;I never 
              yet drank water, for as </p>
            <p>yet my mother's milk is both food and drink to me.&quot; Upon which 
            </p>
            <p> the Wolf seized him and ate him up, saying, &quot;Well! I won't 
              remain </p>
            <p>supperless, even though you refute every one of my imputations.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>The tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny. </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A BAT who fell upon the ground and was caught by a Weasel </p>
            <p>pleaded to be spared his life. The Weasel refused, saying that 
              he </p>
            <p>was by nature the enemy of all birds. The Bat assured him that 
              he</p>
            <p> was not a bird, but a mouse, and thus was set free. Shortly</p>
            <p>afterwards the Bat again fell to the ground and was caught by</p>
            <p>another Weasel, whom he likewise entreated not to eat him. The</p>
            <p>Weasel said that he had a special hostility to mice. The Bat assured</p>
            <p> him that he was not a mouse, but a bat, and thus a second time 
            </p>
            <p> escaped. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>It is wise to turn circumstances to good account. </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>AN ASS having heard some Grasshoppers chirping, was highly</p>
            <p>enchanted; and, desiring to possess the same charms of melody,</p>
            <p>demanded what sort of food they lived on to give them such</p>
            <p>beautiful voices. They replied, &quot;The dew.&quot; The Ass resolved 
              that</p>
            <p>he would live only upon dew, and in a short time died of hunger.

            <p>The Lion and the Mouse A LION was awakened from sleep by a </p>
            <p>Mouse running over his face. </p>
            <p>Rising up angrily, he caught him and was about to kill him, when</p>
            <p>the Mouse piteously entreated, saying: &quot;If you would only 
              spare</p>
            <p>my life, I would be sure to repay your kindness.&quot; The Lionlaughed</p>
            <p> and let him go. It happened shortly after this that theLion was 
            </p>
            <p> caught by some hunters, who bound him by st ropes to the round.</p>
            <p> The Mouse, recognizing his roar, came gnawed the rope with his 
            </p>
            <p> teeth, and set him free, exclaim &quot;You ridiculed the idea 
              ofmy ever </p>
            <p>being able to help you,expecting to receive from me any repay </p>

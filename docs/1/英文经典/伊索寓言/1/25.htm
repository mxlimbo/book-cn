              <b>The Eagle and the Arrow</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>AN EAGLE sat on a lofty rock, watching the movements of a Hare</p>
            <p>whom he sought to make his prey. An archer, who saw the Eagle</p>
            <p>from a place of concealment, took an accurate aim and wounded </p>
            <p>him mortally. The Eagle gave one look at the arrow that had ntered</p>
            <p>his heart and saw in that single glance that its feathers had been 
            </p>
            <p> furnished by himself. &quot;It is a double grief to me,&quot; 
              he exclaimed, </p>
            <p>&quot;that I should perish by an arrow feathered from my own wings.&quot;

            <p>A KITE, sick unto death, said to his mother: &quot;O Mother! do 
              not</p>
            <p>mourn, but at once invoke the gods that my life may be </p>
            <p>prolonged.&quot; She replied, &quot;Alas! my son, which of the 
              gods do you</p>
            <p>think will pity you? Is there one whom you have not outraged by</p>
            <p>filching from their very altars a part of the sacrifice offered 
              up to </p>
            <p>them?' </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>We must make friends in prosperity if we would have their help

            <p> </p>
            <p>A LION roaming by the seashore saw a Dolphin lift up its head out</p>
            <p>of the waves, and suggested that they contract an alliance,</p>
            <p>saying that of all the animals they ought to be the best friends,</p>
            <p>since the one was the king of beasts on the earth, and the other</p>
            <p>was the sovereign ruler of all the inhabitants of the ocean. The</p>
            <p>Dolphin gladly consented to this request. Not long afterwards</p>
            <p>the Lion had a combat with a wild bull, and called on the Dolphin</p>
            <p>to help him. The Dolphin, though quite willing to give him</p>
            <p>assistance, was unable to do so, as he could not by any means</p>
            <p>reach the land. The Lion abused him as a traitor. The Dolphin</p>
            <p>replied, &quot;Nay, my friend, blame not me, but Nature, which, 
              while</p>
            <p>giving me the sovereignty of the sea, has quite denied me the</p>
            <p>power of living upon the land.&quot; </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>ON A SUMMER DAY, when the great heat induced a general </p>
            <p>thirst among the beasts, a Lion and a Boar came at the same </p>
            <p>moment to a small well to drink. They fiercely disputed which of 
            </p>
            <p>them should drink first, and were soon engaged in the agonies of 
              a</p>
            <p> mortal combat. When they stopped suddenly to catch their breath 
            </p>
            <p> for a fiercer renewal of the fight, they saw some Vultures waiting 
              in</p>
            <p>the distance to feast on the one that should fall first. They at</p>
            <p>once made up their quarrel, saying, &quot;It is better for us to 
              make</p>
            <p>friends, than to become the food of Crows or Vultures.&quot;</p>

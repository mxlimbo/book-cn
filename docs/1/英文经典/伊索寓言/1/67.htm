              <b>The Hen and the Swallow</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A HEN finding the eggs of a viper and carefully keeping them</p>
            <p>warm, nourished them into life. A Swallow, observing what she</p>
            <p>had done, said, &quot;You silly creature! why have you hatched 
              these</p>
            <p>vipers which, when they shall have grown, will inflict injury on</p>
            <p>all, beginning with yourself?' </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Buffoon and the Countryman</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A RICH NOBLEMAN once opened the theaters without charge to</p>
            <p> the people, and gave a public notice that he would handsomely 
            </p>
            <p> reward any person who invented a new amusement for the </p>
            <p>occasion. </p>
            <p>Various public performers contended for the prize. Among them</p>
            <p>came a Buffoon well known among the populace for his jokes, and</p>
            <p>said that he had a kind of entertainment which had never been</p>
            <p>brought out on any stage before. This report being spread about</p>
            <p>made a great stir, and the theater was crowded in every part. </p>
            <p>The Buffoon appeared alone upon the platform, without any</p>
            <p>apparatus or confederates, and the very sense of expectation</p>
            <p>caused an intense silence. He suddenly bent his head towards his</p>
            <p>bosom and imitated the squeaking of a little pig so admirably</p>
            <p>with his voice that the audience declared he had a porker under</p>
            <p>his cloak, and demanded that it should be shaken out. When that</p>
            <p>was done and nothing was found, they cheered the actor, and</p>
            <p>loaded him with the loudest applause. A Countryman in the crowd,</p>
            <p>observing all that has passed, said, &quot;So help me, Hercules, 
              he</p>
            <p>shall not beat me at that trick!&quot; and at once proclaimed that 
              he</p>
            <p>would do the same thing on the next day, though in a much more</p>
            <p>natural way. On the morrow a still larger crowd assembled in the</p>
            <p>theater, but now partiality for their favorite actor very</p>
            <p>generally prevailed, and the audience came rather to ridicule the</p>
            <p>Countryman than to see the spectacle. Both of the performers</p>
            <p>appeared on the stage. The Buffoon grunted and squeaked away</p>
            <p>first, and obtained, as on the preceding day, the applause and</p>
            <p>cheers of the spectators. Next the Countryman commenced, and</p>
            <p>pretending that he concealed a little pig beneath his clothes</p>
            <p>(which in truth he did, but not suspected by the audience )</p>
            <p>contrived to take hold of and to pull his ear causing the pig to</p>
            <p>squeak. The Crowd, however, cried out with one consent that the</p>
            <p>Buffoon had given a far more exact imitation, and clamored for</p>
            <p>the Countryman to be kicked out of the theater. On this the</p>
            <p>rustic produced the little pig from his cloak and showed by the</p>
            <p>most positive proof the greatness of their mistake. &quot;Look 
              here,&quot;</p>
            <p>he said, &quot;this shows what sort of judges you are.&quot; </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Crow and the Serpent</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A CROW in great want of food saw a Serpent asleep in a sunny</p>
            <p>nook, and flying down, greedily seized him. The Serpent, turning</p>
            <p>about, bit the Crow with a mortal wound. In the agony of death,</p>
            <p>the bird exclaimed: &quot;O unhappy me! who have found in that 
              which</p>
            <p> I deemed a happy windfall the source of my destruction.&quot;

            <p> </p>
            <p>A CERTAIN HUNTER, having snared a hare, placed it upon his</p>
            <p>shoulders and set out homewards. On his way he met a man on</p>
            <p>horseback who begged the hare of him, under the pretense of</p>
            <p>purchasing it. However, when the Horseman got the hare, he rode</p>
            <p>off as fast as he could. The Hunter ran after him, as if he was</p>
            <p>sure of overtaking him, but the Horseman increased more and </p>
            <p>more the distance between them. The Hunter, sorely against his 
            </p>
            <p> will, called out to him and said, &quot;Get along with you! for 
              I will now</p>
            <p>make you a present of the hare.&quot; </p>

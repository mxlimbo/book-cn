              <b>The Shepherd and the Sheep</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A SHEPHERD driving his Sheep to a wood, saw an oak of </p>
            <p>unusual size full of acorns, and spreading his cloak under the 
            </p>
            <p> branches, he climbed up into the tree and shook them down. The</p>
            <p> Sheep eating the acorns inadvertently frayed and tore the cloak. 
            </p>
            <p> When the Shepherd came down and saw what was done, he said, </p>
            <p>&quot;O you most ungrateful creatures! You provide wool to make 
            </p>
            <p> garments for all other men, but you destroy the clothes of him 
              who</p>
            <p> feeds you.&quot;</p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Grasshopper and the Owl</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>AN OWL, accustomed to feed at night and to sleep during the </p>
            <p>day, was greatly disturbed by the noise of a Grasshopper and </p>
            <p>earnestly besought her to stop chirping. The Grasshopper refused 
            </p>
            <p>to desist, and chirped louder and louder the more the Owl </p>
            <p>entreated. </p>
            <p>When she saw that she could get no redress and that her words</p>
            <p>were despised, the Owl attacked the chatterer by a stratagem. </p>
            <p>&quot;Since I cannot sleep,&quot; she said, &quot;on account of 
              your song which,</p>
            <p>believe me, is sweet as the lyre of Apollo, I shall indulge myself 
              in </p>
            <p>drinking some nectar which Pallas lately gave me. If you do not 
            </p>
            <p> dislike it, come to me and we will drink it together.&quot;</p>
            <p>The Grasshopper, who was thirsty, and pleased with the praise of</p>
            <p>her voice, eagerly flew up. The Owl came forth from her hollow,</p>
            <p>seized her, and put her to death. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Monkey and the Camel</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>THE BEASTS of the forest gave a splendid entertainment at which</p>
            <p>the Monkey stood up and danced. Having vastly delighted the</p>
            <p>assembly, he sat down amidst universal applause. The Camel,</p>
            <p>envious of the praises bestowed on the Monkey and desiring to</p>
            <p>divert to himself the favor of the guests, proposed to stand up</p>
            <p>in his turn and dance for their amusement. He moved about in so</p>
            <p>utterly ridiculous a manner that the Beasts, in a fit of</p>
            <p>indignation, set upon him with clubs and drove him out of the</p>
            <p>assembly. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>It is absurd to ape our betters. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Peasant and the Apple-Tree</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A PEASANT had in his garden an Apple-Tree which bore no fruit</p>
            <p> but only served as a harbor for the sparrows and grasshoppers. 
              He</p>
            <p>resolved to cut it down, and taking his axe in his hand, made a</p>
            <p>bold stroke at its roots. The grasshoppers and sparrows</p>
            <p>entreated him not to cut down the tree that sheltered them, but</p>
            <p>to spare it, and they would sing to him and lighten his labors. 
            </p>
            <p>He paid no attention to their request, but gave the tree a second</p>
            <p>and a third blow with his axe. When he reached the hollow of the</p>
            <p>tree, he found a hive full of honey. Having tasted the</p>
            <p>honeycomb, he threw down his axe, and looking on the tree as</p>
            <p>sacred, took great care of it. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Self-interest alone moves some men.</p>

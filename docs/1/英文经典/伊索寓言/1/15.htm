              <b>The Fox Who Had Lost His Tail</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A FOX caught in a trap escaped, but in so doing lost his tail. 
            </p>
            <p>Thereafter, feeling his life a burden from the shame and ridicule</p>
            <p>to which he was exposed, he schemed to convince all the other</p>
            <p>Foxes that being tailless was much more attractive, thus making</p>
            <p>up for his own deprivation. He assembled a good many Foxes and</p>
            <p>publicly advised them to cut off their tails, saying that they 
              would </p>
            <p>not only look much better without them, but that they would get 
              rid</p>
            <p> of the weight of the brush, which was a very great inconvenience. 
            </p>
            <p> One of them interrupting him said, &quot;If you had not yourself 
              lost </p>
            <p>your tail, my friend, you would not thus counsel us.&quot; </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A BOY was stung by a Nettle. He ran home and told his Mother,</p>
            <p>saying, &quot;Although it hurts me very much, I only touched it 
              gently.&quot;</p>
            <p> &quot;That was just why it stung you,&quot; said his Mother. &quot;The 
              next time </p>
            <p>you touch a Nettle, grasp it boldly, and it will be soft as silk 
              to </p>
            <p>your hand, and not in the least hurt you.&quot; </p>

            <p>A MIDDLE-AGED MAN, whose hair had begun to turn gray, courted two 
              women at the same time. One of them was young, and</p>
            <p> the other well advanced in years. The elder woman, ashamed to 
              be</p>
            <p> courted by a man younger than herself, made a point, whenever 
              her</p>
            <p> admirer visited her, to pull out some portion of his black hairs. 
              The</p>
            <p>younger, on the contrary, not wishing to become the wife of an</p>
            <p>old man, was equally zealous in removing every gray hair she</p>
            <p>could find. Thus it came to pass that between them both he very</p>
            <p>soon found that he had not a hair left on his head. </p>

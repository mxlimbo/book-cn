              <b>The Sick Lion</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A LION, unable from old age and infirmities to provide himself</p>
            <p>with food by force, resolved to do so by artifice. He returned</p>
            <p>to his den, and lying down there, pretended to be sick, taking</p>
            <p>care that his sickness should be publicly known. The beasts</p>
            <p>expressed their sorrow, and came one by one to his den, where the</p>
            <p>Lion devoured them. After many of the beasts had thus</p>
            <p>disappeared, the Fox discovered the trick and presenting himself</p>
            <p>to the Lion, stood on the outside of the cave, at a respectful</p>
            <p>distance, and asked him how he was. &quot;I am very middling,&quot;</p>
            <p>replied the Lion, &quot;but why do you stand without? Pray enter</p>
            <p>within to talk with me.&quot; &quot;No, thank you,&quot; said the 
              Fox. &quot;I</p>
            <p>notice that there are many prints of feet entering your cave, but</p>
            <p>I see no trace of any returning.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>He is wise who is warned by the misfortunes of others. </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A GROOM used to spend whole days in currycombing and </p>
            <p>rubbing down his Horse, but at the same time stole his oats and 
            </p>
            <p> sold them for his own profit. &quot;Alas!&quot; said the Horse, 
              &quot;if you really </p>
            <p>wish me to be in good condition, you should groom me less, and</p>
            <p> feed me more.&quot; </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Ass and the Lapdog</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A MAN had an Ass, and a Maltese Lapdog, a very great beauty. </p>
            <p>The Ass was left in a stable and had plenty of oats and hay to 
              eat,</p>
            <p>just as any other Ass would. The Lapdog knew many tricks and </p>
            <p>was a great favorite with his master, who often fondled him and</p>
            <p>seldom went out to dine without bringing him home some tidbit to</p>
            <p>eat. The Ass, on the contrary, had much work to do in grinding</p>
            <p>the corn-mill and in carrying wood from the forest or burdens</p>
            <p>from the farm. He often lamented his own hard fate and</p>
            <p>contrasted it with the luxury and idleness of the Lapdog, till 
              at</p>
            <p>last one day he broke his cords and halter, and galloped into his</p>
            <p>master's house, kicking up his heels without measure, and</p>
            <p>frisking and fawning as well as he could. He next tried to jump</p>
            <p>about his master as he had seen the Lapdog do, but he broke the</p>
            <p>table and smashed all the dishes upon it to atoms. He then</p>
            <p>attempted to lick his master, and jumped upon his back. The</p>
            <p>servants, hearing the strange hubbub and perceiving the danger 
              of</p>
            <p>their master, quickly relieved him, and drove out the Ass to his</p>
            <p>stable with kicks and clubs and cuffs. The Ass, as he returned</p>
            <p>to his stall beaten nearly to death, thus lamented: &quot;I have</p>
            <p>brought it all on myself! Why could I not have been contented to</p>
            <p>labor with my companions, and not wish to be idle all the day</p>
            <p>like that useless little Lapdog!&quot; </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Lioness</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A CONTROVERSY prevailed among the beasts of the field as to </p>
            <p>which of the animals deserved the most credit for producing the</p>
            <p>greatest number of whelps at a birth. They rushed clamorously</p>
            <p>into the presence of the Lioness and demanded of her the</p>
            <p>settlement of the dispute. &quot;And you,&quot; they said, &quot;how 
              many sons</p>
            <p>have you at a birth?' The Lioness laughed at them, and said:</p>
            <p>&quot;Why! I have only one; but that one is altogether a thoroughbred</p>
            <p>Lion.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A MAN who had traveled in foreign lands boasted very much, on</p>
            <p>returning to his own country, of the many wonderful and heroic</p>
            <p>feats he had performed in the different places he had visited. 
            </p>
            <p>Among other things, he said that when he was at Rhodes he had</p>
            <p>leaped to such a distance that no man of his day could leap</p>
            <p>anywhere near him as to that, there were in Rhodes many persons 
            </p>
            <p>who saw him do it and whom he could call as witnesses. One of </p>
            <p>the bystanders interrupted him, saying: &quot;Now, my good man, 
              if </p>
            <p>this be all true there is no need of witnesses. Suppose this </p>
            <p>to be Rhodes, and leap for us.&quot; </p>

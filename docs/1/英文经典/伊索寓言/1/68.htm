              <b>The King's Son and the Painted Lion</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A KING, whose only son was fond of martial exercises, had a </p>
            <p>dream in which he was warned that his son would be killed by a 
            </p>
            <p> lion. </p>
            <p>Afraid the dream should prove true, he built for his son a</p>
            <p>pleasant palace and adorned its walls for his amusement with all</p>
            <p>kinds of life-sized animals, among which was the picture of a</p>
            <p>lion. When the young Prince saw this, his grief at being thus</p>
            <p>confined burst out afresh, and, standing near the lion, he said:</p>
            <p>&quot;O you most detestable of animals! through a lying dream of 
              my</p>
            <p>father's, which he saw in his sleep, I am shut up on your account</p>
            <p>in this palace as if I had been a girl: what shall I now do to</p>
            <p>you?' With these words he stretched out his hands toward a</p>
            <p>thorn-tree, meaning to cut a stick from its branches so that he</p>
            <p>might beat the lion. But one of the tree's prickles pierced his</p>
            <p>finger and caused great pain and inflammation, so that the young</p>
            <p>Prince fell down in a fainting fit. A violent fever suddenly set</p>
            <p>in, from which he died not many days later. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>We had better bear our troubles bravely than try to escape them.

            <p> </p>
            <p>A CAT fell in love with a handsome young man, and entreated</p>
            <p> Venus to change her into the form of a woman. Venus consented 
            </p>
            <p> to her request and transformed her into a beautiful damsel, so 
              that</p>
            <p> the youth saw her and loved her, and took her home as his bride. 
            </p>
            <p>While the two were reclining in their chamber, Venus wishing to</p>
            <p>discover if the Cat in her change of shape had also altered her</p>
            <p>habits of life, let down a mouse in the middle of the room. The</p>
            <p>Cat, quite forgetting her present condition, started up from the</p>
            <p>couch and pursued the mouse, wishing to eat it. Venus was much</p>
            <p>disappointed and again caused her to return to her former shape.

            <p> </p>
            <p>THE SHE-GOATS having obtained a beard by request to Jupiter, </p>
            <p>the He-Goats were sorely displeased and made complaint that the</p>
            <p>females equaled them in dignity. &quot;Allow them,&quot; said Jupiter, 
              &quot;to</p>
            <p>enjoy an empty honor and to assume the badge of your nobler sex,</p>
            <p>so long as they are not your equals in strength or courage.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>It matters little if those who are inferior to us in merit should</p>
            <p>be like us in outside appearances. </p>

            <p>AN ARAB CAMEL-DRIVER, after completing the loading of his</p>
            <p> Camel, asked him which he would like best, to go up hill or down.</p>
            <p> The poor beast replied, not without a touch of reason: &quot;Why 
              do </p>
            <p>you ask me? Is it that the level way through the desert is closed?&quot;</p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Miller, His Son, and Their Ass</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A MILLER and his son were driving their Ass to a neighboring fair</p>
            <p>to sell him. They had not gone far when they met with a troop of</p>
            <p>women collected round a well, talking and laughing. &quot;Look</p>
            <p>there,&quot; cried one of them, &quot;did you ever see such fellows, 
              to be</p>
            <p>trudging along the road on foot when they might ride?' The old</p>
            <p>man hearing this, quickly made his son mount the Ass, and</p>
            <p>continued to walk along merrily by his side. Presently they came</p>
            <p>up to a group of old men in earnest debate. &quot;There,&quot; 
              said one of</p>
            <p>them, &quot;it proves what I was a-saying. What respect is shown 
              to</p>
            <p>old age in these days? Do you see that idle lad riding while his</p>
            <p>old father has to walk? Get down, you young scapegrace, and let</p>
            <p>the old man rest his weary limbs.&quot; Upon this the old man made 
              his</p>
            <p>son dismount, and got up himself. In this manner they had not</p>
            <p>proceeded far when they met a company of women and children:</p>
            <p>&quot;Why, you lazy old fellow,&quot; cried several tongues at 
              once, &quot;how</p>
            <p>can you ride upon the beast, while that poor little lad there can</p>
            <p>hardly keep pace by the side of you?' The good-natured Miller</p>
            <p>immediately took up his son behind him. They had now almost</p>
            <p>reached the town. &quot;Pray, honest friend,&quot; said a citizen, 
              &quot;is</p>
            <p>that Ass your own?' &quot;Yes,&quot; replied the old man. &quot;O, 
              one would</p>
            <p>not have thought so,&quot; said the other, &quot;by the way you 
              load him. </p>
            <p>Why, you two fellows are better able to carry the poor beast than</p>
            <p>he you.&quot; &quot;Anything to please you,&quot; said the old 
              man; &quot;we can but</p>
            <p>try.&quot; So, alighting with his son, they tied the legs of the 
              Ass</p>
            <p>together and with the help of a pole endeavored to carry him on</p>
            <p>their shoulders over a bridge near the entrance to the town. </p>
            <p>This entertaining sight brought the people in crowds to laugh at</p>
            <p>it, till the Ass, not liking the noise nor the strange handling</p>
            <p>that he was subject to, broke the cords that bound him and,</p>
            <p>tumbling off the pole, fell into the river. Upon this, the old</p>
            <p>man, vexed and ashamed, made the best of his way home again,</p>
            <p>convinced that by endeavoring to please everybody he had pleased</p>
            <p>nobody, and lost his Ass in the bargain.</p>

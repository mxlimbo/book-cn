              <b>The Jackdaw and the Doves</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A JACKDAW, seeing some Doves in a cote abundantly provided </p>
            <p>with food, painted himself white and joined them in order to share</p>
            <p>their plentiful maintenance. The Doves, as long as he was</p>
            <p>silent, supposed him to be one of themselves and admitted him to</p>
            <p>their cote. But when one day he forgot himself and began to</p>
            <p>chatter, they discovered his true character and drove him forth,</p>
            <p>pecking him with their beaks. Failing to obtain food among the</p>
            <p>Doves, he returned to the Jackdaws. They too, not recognizing</p>
            <p>him on account of his color. expelled him from living with them. 
            </p>
            <p>So desiring two ends, he obtained neither. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Horse and the Stag</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>AT ONE TIME the Horse had the plain entirely to himself. Then a</p>
            <p>Stag intruded into his domain and shared his pasture. The Horse,</p>
            <p>desiring to revenge himself on the stranger, asked a man if he</p>
            <p>were willing to help him in punishing the Stag. The man replied</p>
            <p>that if the Horse would receive a bit in his mouth and agree to</p>
            <p>carry him, he would contrive effective weapons against the Stag. 
            </p>
            <p>The Horse consented and allowed the man to mount him. From </p>
            <p>that hour he found that instead of obtaining revenge on the Stag, 
              he</p>
            <p>had enslaved himself to the service of man. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Kid and the Wolf</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A KID, returning without protection from the pasture, was pursued</p>
            <p>by a Wolf. Seeing he could not escape, he turned round, and</p>
            <p>said: &quot;I know, friend Wolf, that I must be your prey, but 
              before</p>
            <p>I die I would ask of you one favor you will play me a tune to</p>
            <p>which I may dance.&quot; The Wolf complied, and while he was piping</p>
            <p>and the Kid was dancing, some hounds hearing the sound ran up</p>
            <p> and began chasing the Wolf. Turning to the Kid, he said, &quot;It 
              is just</p>
            <p>what I deserve; for I, who am only a butcher, should not have</p>
            <p>turned piper to please you.&quot; </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A WIZARD, sitting in the marketplace, was telling the fortunes 
              of</p>
            <p>the passers-by when a person ran up in great haste, and</p>
            <p>announced to him that the doors of his house had been broken </p>
            <p>open and that all his goods were being stolen. He sighed heavily 
            </p>
            <p> and hastened away as fast as he could run. A neighbor saw him</p>
            <p>running and said, &quot;Oh! you fellow there! you say you can foretell</p>
            <p>the fortunes of others; how is it you did not foresee your own?'

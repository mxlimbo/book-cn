              <b>The Thief and His Mother</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A BOY stole a lesson-book from one of his schoolfellows and </p>
            <p>took it home to his Mother. She not only abstained from beating 
            </p>
            <p> him, but encouraged him. He next time stole a cloak and brought 
              it</p>
            <p> to her, and she again commended him. The Youth, advanced to</p>
            <p>adulthood, proceeded to steal things of still greater value. At</p>
            <p>last he was caught in the very act, and having his hands bound</p>
            <p>behind him, was led away to the place of public execution. His</p>
            <p>Mother followed in the crowd and violently beat her breast in</p>
            <p>sorrow, whereupon the young man said, &quot;I wish to say something</p>
            <p> to my Mother in her ear.&quot; She came close to him, and he quickly</p>
            <p>seized her ear with his teeth and bit it off. The Mother</p>
            <p>upbraided him as an unnatural child, whereon he replied, &quot;Ah! 
              if</p>
            <p>you had beaten me when I first stole and brought to you that</p>
            <p>lesson-book, I should not have come to this, nor have been thus</p>
            <p>led to a disgraceful death.&quot; </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>AN OLD MAN was employed in cutting wood in the forest, and,</p>
            <p> in carrying the faggots to the city for sale one day, became very</p>
            <p>wearied with his long journey. He sat down by the wayside, and</p>
            <p>throwing down his load, besought &quot;Death&quot; to come. &quot;Death&quot;</p>
            <p>immediately appeared in answer to his summons and asked for </p>
            <p>what reason he had called him. The Old Man hurriedly replied, </p>
            <p>&quot;That, lifting up the load, you may place it again upon my 
            </p>
            <p> houlders.&quot; </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A FIR-TREE said boastingly to the Bramble, &quot;You are useful 
              for</p>
            <p>nothing at all; while I am everywhere used for roofs and houses.&quot;</p>
            <p>The Bramble answered: 'You poor creature, if you would only call</p>
            <p>to mind the axes and saws which are about to hew you down, you</p>
            <p>would have reason to wish that you had grown up a Bramble, not 
              a</p>
            <p>Fir-Tree.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Mouse, the Frog, and the Hawk</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A MOUSE who always lived on the land, by an unlucky chance </p>
            <p>formed an intimate acquaintance with a Frog, who lived for the 
            </p>
            <p> most part in the water. The Frog, one day intent on mischief, 
            </p>
            <p> bound the foot of the Mouse tightly to his own. Thus joined </p>
            <p>together, the Frog first of all led his friend the Mouse to the 
            </p>
            <p> meadow where they were accustomed to find their food. After this,</p>
            <p> he gradually led him towards the pool in which he lived, until</p>
            <p>reaching the very brink, he suddenly jumped in, dragging the</p>
            <p>Mouse with him. The Frog enjoyed the water amazingly, and swam</p>
            <p>croaking about, as if he had done a good deed. The unhappy </p>
            <p>Mouse was soon suffocated by the water, and his dead body </p>
            <p>floated about on the surface, tied to the foot of the Frog. A Hawk</p>
            <p> observed it, and, pouncing upon it with his talons, carried it 
              aloft. </p>
            <p>The Frog, being still fastened to the leg of the Mouse, was also</p>
            <p>carried off a prisoner, and was eaten by the Hawk. </p>

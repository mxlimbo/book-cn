              <b>The Two Soldiers and the Robber</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>TWO SOLDIERS traveling together were set upon by a Robber. </p>
            <p>The one fled away; the other stood his ground and defended </p>
            <p>himself with his stout right hand. The Robber being slain, the 
              timid</p>
            <p>companion ran up and drew his sword, and then, throwing back </p>
            <p>his traveling cloak said, &quot;I'll at him, and I'll take care 
              he shall learn </p>
            <p>whom he has attacked.&quot; On this, he who had fought with the</p>
            <p>Robber made answer, &quot;I only wish that you had helped me just</p>
            <p> now, even if it had been only with those words, for I should have</p>
            <p> been the more encouraged, believing them to be true; but now put 
            </p>
            <p>up your sword in its sheath and hold your equally useless tongue,</p>
            <p>till you can deceive others who do not know you. I, indeed, who</p>
            <p>have experienced with what speed you run away, know right well</p>
            <p>that no dependence can be placed on your valor.&quot; </p>

            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>THE GODS, according to an ancient legend, made choice of </p>
            <p>certain trees to be under their special protection. Jupiter chose 
              the</p>
            <p>oak, Venus the myrtle, Apollo the laurel, Cybele the pine, and</p>
            <p>Hercules the poplar. Minerva, wondering why they had preferred</p>
            <p>trees not yielding fruit, inquired the reason for their choice. 
            </p>
            <p>Jupiter replied, &quot;It is lest we should seem to covet the honor 
              for the</p>
            <p> fruit.&quot; But said Minerva, &quot;Let anyone say what he will 
              the olive is</p>
            <p> more dear to me on account of its fruit.&quot; Then said Jupiter, 
              &quot;My </p>
            <p>daughter, you are rightly called wise; for unless what we do is 
            </p>
            <p> useful, the glory of it is vain.&quot; </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A FAMISHED WOLF was prowling about in the morning in </p>
            <p>search of food. As he passed the door of a cottage built in the 
            </p>
            <p> forest, he heard a Mother say to her child, &quot;Be quiet, or 
              I will </p>
            <p>throw you out of the window, and the Wolf shall eat you.&quot; 
              The </p>
            <p>Wolf sat all day waiting at the door. In the evening he heard the 
            </p>
            <p> same woman fondling her child and saying: &quot;You are quiet 
              now, </p>
            <p>and if the Wolf should come, we will kill him.&quot; The Wolf, 
              hearing </p>
            <p>these words, went home, gasping with cold and hunger. When he </p>
            <p>reached his den, Mistress Wolf inquired of him why he returned 
            </p>
            <p> wearied and supperless, so contrary to his wont. He replied: &quot;Why,</p>
            <p>forsooth!</p>
            <p>use I gave credence to the words of a woman!&quot; </p>

            <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the Horse; &quot;if any remains out of what

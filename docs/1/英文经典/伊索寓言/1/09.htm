              <b>The Thirsty Pigeon</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A PIGEON, oppressed by excessive thirst, saw a goblet of water</p>
            <p>painted on a signboard. Not supposing it to be only a picture,</p>
            <p>she flew towards it with a loud whir and unwittingly dashed</p>
            <p>against the signboard, jarring herself terribly. Having broken</p>
            <p>her wings by the blow, she fell to the ground, and was caught by</p>
            <p>one of the bystanders. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Zeal should not outrun discretion. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Raven and the Swan</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A RAVEN saw a Swan and desired to secure for himself the same</p>
            <p>beautiful plumage. Supposing that the Swan's splendid white</p>
            <p>color arose from his washing in the water in which he swam, the</p>
            <p>Raven left the altars in the neighborhood where he picked up his</p>
            <p>living, and took up residence in the lakes and pools. But</p>
            <p>cleansing his feathers as often as he would, he could not change</p>
            <p>their color, while through want of food he perished. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Change of habit cannot alter Nature. </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A GOATHERD had sought to bring back a stray goat to his flock. 
            </p>
            <p>He whistled and sounded his horn in vain; the straggler paid no</p>
            <p>attention to the summons. At last the Goatherd threw a stone,</p>
            <p>and breaking its horn, begged the Goat not to tell his master. 
            </p>
            <p>The Goat replied, &quot;Why, you silly fellow, the horn will speak</p>
            <p>though I be silent.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Do not attempt to hide things which cannot be hid. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Miser</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A MISER sold all that he had and bought a lump of gold, which he</p>
            <p>buried in a hole in the ground by the side of an old wall and</p>
            <p>went to look at daily. One of his workmen observed his frequent</p>
            <p>visits to the spot and decided to watch his movements. He soon</p>
            <p>discovered the secret of the hidden treasure, and digging down,</p>
            <p>came to the lump of gold, and stole it. The Miser, on his next</p>
            <p>visit, found the hole empty and began to tear his hair and to</p>
            <p>make loud lamentations. A neighbor, seeing him overcome with</p>
            <p>grief and learning the cause, said, &quot;Pray do not grieve so; 
              but</p>
            <p>go and take a stone, and place it in the hole, and fancy that the</p>
            <p>gold is still lying there. It will do you quite the same</p>
            <p>service; for when the gold was there, you had it not, as you did</p>
            <p>not make the slightest use of it.&quot;</p>

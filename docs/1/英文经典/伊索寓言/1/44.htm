              <b>The Fox and the Hedgehog</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A FOX swimming across a rapid river was carried by the force of</p>
            <p>the current into a very deep ravine, where he lay for a long time</p>
            <p>very much bruised, sick, and unable to move. A swarm of hungry</p>
            <p>blood-sucking flies settled upon him. A Hedgehog, passing by,</p>
            <p>saw his anguish and inquired if he should drive away the flies</p>
            <p>that were tormenting him. &quot;By no means,&quot; replied the 
              Fox; &quot;pray</p>
            <p>do not molest them.&quot; &quot;How is this?' said the Hedgehog; 
              &quot;do you</p>
            <p>not want to be rid of them?' &quot;No,&quot; returned the Fox, 
              &quot;for these</p>
            <p>flies which you see are full of blood, and sting me but little,</p>
            <p>and if you rid me of these which are already satiated, others</p>
            <p>more hungry will come in their place, and will drink up all the</p>
            <p>blood I have left.&quot; </p>
            <p align="center"> </p>
            <p align="center"></p>
            <p align="center"><b>The Eagle, the Cat, and the Wild Sow </b></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>AN EAGLE made her nest at the top of a lofty oak; a Cat, having</p>
            <p>found a convenient hole, moved into the middle of the trunk; and</p>
            <p>a Wild Sow, with her young, took shelter in a hollow at its foot. 
            </p>
            <p>The Cat cunningly resolved to destroy this chance-made colony. 
            </p>
            <p>To carry out her design, she climbed to the nest of the Eagle,</p>
            <p>and said, &quot;Destruction is preparing for you, and for me too,</p>
            <p>unfortunately. The Wild Sow, whom you see daily digging up the</p>
            <p>earth, wishes to uproot the oak, so she may on its fall seize our</p>
            <p>families as food for her young.&quot; Having thus frightened the 
              Eagle</p>
            <p>out of her senses, she crept down to the cave of the Sow, and</p>
            <p>said, &quot;Your children are in great danger; for as soon as you 
              go</p>
            <p>out with your litter to find food, the Eagle is prepared to</p>
            <p>pounce upon one of your little pigs.&quot; Having instilled these</p>
            <p>fears into the Sow, she went and pretended to hide herself in the</p>
            <p>hollow of the tree. When night came she went forth with silent</p>
            <p>foot and obtained food for herself and her kittens, but feigning</p>
            <p>to be afraid, she kept a lookout all through the day. Meanwhile,</p>
            <p>the Eagle, full of fear of the Sow, sat still on the branches,</p>
            <p>and the Sow, terrified by the Eagle, did not dare to go out from</p>
            <p>her cave. And thus they both, along with their families,</p>
            <p>perished from hunger, and afforded ample provision for the Cat</p>
            <p>and her kittens. </p>
            <p> </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Thief and the Innkeeper</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A THIEF hired a room in a tavern and stayed a while in the hope</p>
            <p>of stealing something which should enable him to pay his</p>
            <p>reckoning. When he had waited some days in vain, he saw the</p>
            <p>Innkeeper dressed in a new and handsome coat and sitting before</p>
            <p>his door. The Thief sat down beside him and talked with him. As</p>
            <p>the conversation began to flag, the Thief yawned terribly and at</p>
            <p>the same time howled like a wolf. The Innkeeper said, &quot;Why 
              do</p>
            <p>you howl so fearfully?' &quot;I will tell you,&quot; said the Thief, 
              &quot;but</p>
            <p>first let me ask you to hold my clothes, or I shall tear them to</p>
            <p>pieces. I know not, sir, when I got this habit of yawning, nor</p>
            <p>whether these attacks of howling were inflicted on me as a</p>
            <p>judgment for my crimes, or for any other cause; but this I do</p>
            <p>know, that when I yawn for the third time, I actually turn into 
              a</p>
            <p>wolf and attack men.&quot; With this speech he commenced a second 
            </p>
            <p> fit of yawning and again howled like a wolf, as he had at first. 
              The</p>
            <p>Innkeeper. hearing his tale and believing what he said, became</p>
            <p>greatly alarmed and, rising from his seat, attempted to run away. 
            </p>
            <p>The Thief laid hold of his coat and entreated him to stop,</p>
            <p>saying, &quot;Pray wait, sir, and hold my clothes, or I shall tear</p>
            <p>them to pieces in my fury, when I turn into a wolf.&quot; At the 
              same</p>
            <p>moment he yawned the third time and set up a terrible howl. The</p>
            <p>Innkeeper, frightened lest he should be attacked, left his new</p>
            <p>coat in the Thief's hand and ran as fast as he could into the inn</p>
            <p>for safety. The Thief made off with the coat and did not return</p>
            <p>again to the inn. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Every tale is not to be believed. </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A MULE, frolicsome from lack of work and from too much corn,</p>
            <p>galloped about in a very extravagant manner, and said to himself:</p>
            <p>&quot;My father surely was a high-mettled racer, and I am his own</p>
            <p>child in speed and spirit.&quot; On the next day, being driven 
              a long</p>
            <p>journey, and feeling very wearied, he exclaimed in a disconsolate</p>
            <p>tone: &quot;I must have made a mistake; my father, after all, could</p>
            <p>have been only an ass.&quot; </p>

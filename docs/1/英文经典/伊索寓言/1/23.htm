            <p> </p>
            <p>A FISHERMAN, engaged in his calling, made a very successful </p>
            <p>cast and captured a great haul of fish. He managed by a skillful</p>
            <p>handling of his net to retain all the large fish and to draw them 
              to </p>
            <p>the shore; but he could not prevent the smaller fish from falling</p>
            <p> back through the meshes of the net into the sea. </p>

            <p>A HUNTSMAN, returning with his dogs from the field, fell in by</p>
            <p>chance with a Fisherman who was bringing home a basket well </p>
            <p>laden with fish. The Huntsman wished to have the fish, and their 
            </p>
            <p> owner experienced an equal longing for the contents of the game-</p>
            <p>bag. </p>
            <p>They quickly agreed to exchange the produce of their day's sport. 
            </p>
            <p>Each was so well pleased with his bargain that they made for some</p>
            <p>time the same exchange day after day. Finally a neighbor said to</p>
            <p>them, &quot;If you go on in this way, you will soon destroy by 
              frequent</p>
            <p> use the pleasure of your exchange, and each will again wish to 
            </p>
            <p> retain the fruits of his own sport.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>AN OLD WOMAN found an empty jar which had lately been full</p>
            <p>of prime old wine and which still retained the fragrant smell of 
              its</p>
            <p>former contents. She greedily placed it several times to her nose, 
            </p>
            <p> and drawing it backwards and forwards said, &quot;O most delicious! 
            </p>
            <p> How nice must the Wine itself have been, when it leaves behind 
              in </p>
            <p>the very vessel which contained it so sweet a perfume!&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A CROW having stolen a bit of meat, perched in a tree and held 
              it</p>
            <p>in her beak. A Fox, seeing this, longed to possess the meat</p>
            <p>himself, and by a wily stratagem succeeded. &quot;How handsome 
              is </p>
            <p>the Crow,&quot; he exclaimed, in the beauty of her shape and in 
              the</p>
            <p>fairness of her complexion! Oh, if her voice were only equal to</p>
            <p>her beauty, she would deservedly be considered the Queen of</p>
            <p>Birds!&quot; This he said deceitfully; but the Crow, anxious to 
              refute</p>
            <p>the reflection cast upon her voice, set up a loud caw and dropped</p>
            <p>the flesh. The Fox quickly picked it up, and thus addressed the</p>
            <p>Crow: &quot;My good Crow, your voice is right enough, but your 
              wit is</p>
            <p>wanting.&quot; </p>

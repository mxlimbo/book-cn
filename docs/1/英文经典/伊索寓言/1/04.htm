              <b>The Traveler and His Dog</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A TRAVELER about to set out on a journey saw his Dog stand at</p>
            <p> the door stretching himself. He asked him sharply: &quot;Why do 
              you </p>
            <p>stand there gaping? Everything is ready but you, so come with me</p>
            <p>instantly.&quot; The Dog, wagging his tail, replied: &quot;O, master! 
              I am</p>
            <p>quite ready; it is you for whom I am waiting.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>The loiterer often blames delay on his more active friend. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Dog and the Shadow</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A DOG, crossing a bridge over a stream with a piece of flesh in</p>
            <p>his mouth, saw his own shadow in the water and took it for that</p>
            <p>of another Dog, with a piece of meat double his own in size. He</p>
            <p>immediately let go of his own, and fiercely attacked the other</p>
            <p>Dog to get his larger piece from him. He thus lost both: that</p>
            <p>which he grasped at in the water, because it was a shadow; and</p>
            <p>his own, because the stream swept it away. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Mole and His Mother</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A MOLE, a creature blind from birth, once said to his Mother: &quot;I</p>
            <p>am sure than I can see, Mother!&quot; In the desire to prove to 
              him</p>
            <p>his mistake, his Mother placed before him a few grains of</p>
            <p>frankincense, and asked, &quot;What is it?' The young Mole said, 
              &quot;It</p>
            <p>is a pebble.&quot; His Mother exclaimed: &quot;My son, I am afraid 
              that you</p>
            <p>are not only blind, but that you have lost your sense of smell.

            <p align="center"><b>The Herdsman and the Lost Bull</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A HERDSMAN tending his flock in a forest lost a Bull-calf from</p>
            <p>the fold. After a long and fruitless search, he made a vow that,</p>
            <p>if he could only discover the thief who had stolen the Calf, he</p>
            <p>would offer a lamb in sacrifice to Hermes, Pan, and the Guardian</p>
            <p>Deities of the forest. Not long afterwards, as he ascended a small 
            </p>
            <p> hillock, he saw at its foot a Lion feeding on the Calf. </p>
            <p>Terrified at the sight, he lifted his eyes and his hands to heaven, 
            </p>
            <p> and said: &quot;Just now I vowed to offer a lamb to the Guardian 
            </p>
            <p> Deities of the forest if I could only find out who had robbed 
              me; </p>
            <p>but now that I have discovered the thief, I would willingly add 
              a </p>
            <p>full-grown Bull to the Calf I have lost, if I may only secure my 
              own</p>
            <p> escape from him in safety.&quot; </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Hare and the Tortoise</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A HARE one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the</p>
            <p>Tortoise, who replied, laughing: &quot;Though you be swift as the</p>
            <p>wind, I will beat you in a race.&quot; The Hare, believing her 
              assertion to</p>
            <p> be simply impossible, assented to the proposal; and they agreed 
            </p>
            <p> that the Fox should choose the course and fix the goal. On the 
              day</p>
            <p> appointed for the race the two started together. The Tortoise 
              never</p>
            <p> for a moment stopped, but went on with a slow but steady pace 
            </p>
            <p> straight to the end of the course. </p>
            <p>The Hare, lying down by the wayside, fell fast asleep. At last</p>
            <p>waking up, and moving as fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise</p>
            <p>had reached the goal, and was comfortably dozing after her</p>
            <p>fatigue. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Slow but steady wins the race. </p>

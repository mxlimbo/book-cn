              <b>The Fox and the Woodcutter</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A FOX, running before the hounds, came across a Woodcutter</p>
            <p>felling an oak and begged him to show him a safe hiding-place. 
            </p>
            <p>The Woodcutter advised him to take shelter in his own hut, so the</p>
            <p>Fox crept in and hid himself in a corner. The huntsman soon came</p>
            <p>up with his hounds and inquired of the Woodcutter if he had seen</p>
            <p>the Fox. He declared that he had not seen him, and yet pointed,</p>
            <p>all the time he was speaking, to the hut where the Fox lay hidden. 
            </p>
            <p> The huntsman took no notice of the signs, but believing his word, 
            </p>
            <p> hastened forward in the chase. As soon as they were well away, 
              the</p>
            <p> Fox departed without taking any notice of the Woodcutter: </p>
            <p>whereon he called to him and reproached him, saying, &quot;You 
            </p>
            <p> ungrateful fellow, you owe your life to me, and yet you leave 
              me </p>
            <p>without a word of thanks.&quot; The Fox replied, &quot;Indeed, 
              I should </p>
            <p>have thanked you fervently if your deeds had been as good</p>
            <p>as your words, and if your hands had not been traitors to your</p>
            <p>speech.&quot; </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Birdcatcher, the Partridge, and the Cock</b> 
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A BIRDCATCHER was about to sit down to a dinner of herbs </p>
            <p>when a friend unexpectedly came in. The bird-trap was quite </p>
            <p>empty, as he had caught nothing, and he had to kill a pied </p>
            <p>Partridge, which he had tamed for a decoy. The bird entreated </p>
            <p>earnestly for his life: &quot;What would you do without me when 
              next </p>
            <p>you spread your nets? Who would chirp you to sleep, or call for 
            </p>
            <p> you the covey of answering birds?' The Birdcatcher spared his 
              life,</p>
            <p> and determined to pick out a fine young Cock just attaining to 
              his </p>
            <p>comb. But the Cock expostulated in piteous tones from his perch: 
            </p>
            <p>&quot;If you kill me, who will announce to you the appearance of 
              the </p>
            <p>dawn? </p>
            <p>Who will wake you to your daily tasks or tell you when it is time</p>
            <p>to visit the bird-trap in the morning?' He replied, &quot;What 
              you say</p>
            <p>is true. You are a capital bird at telling the time of day. But</p>
            <p>my friend and I must have our dinners.&quot; </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Necessity knows no law. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Monkey and the Fishermen</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A MONKEY perched upon a lofty tree saw some Fishermen </p>
            <p>casting their nets into a river, and narrowly watched their </p>
            <p>proceedings. </p>
            <p>The Fishermen after a while gave up fishing, and on going home 
              to</p>
            <p>dinner left their nets upon the bank. The Monkey, who is the</p>
            <p>most imitative of animals, descended from the treetop and</p>
            <p>endeavored to do as they had done. Having handled the net, he</p>
            <p>threw it into the river, but became tangled in the meshes and</p>
            <p>drowned. With his last breath he said to himself, &quot;I am rightly</p>
            <p>served; for what business had I who had never handled a net to</p>
            <p>try and catch fish?' </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>A FLEA settled upon the bare foot of a Wrestler and bit him,</p>
            <p>causing the man to call loudly upon Hercules for help. When the</p>
            <p>Flea a second time hopped upon his foot, he groaned and said, &quot;O</p>
            <p>Hercules! if you will not help me against a Flea, how can I hope</p>
            <p>for your assistance against greater antagonists?'</p>

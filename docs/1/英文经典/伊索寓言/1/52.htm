              <b>The Hawk and the Nightingale</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A NIGHTINGALE, sitting aloft upon an oak and singing </p>
            <p>according to his wont, was seen by a Hawk who, being in need of 
            </p>
            <p> food, swooped down and seized him. The Nightingale, about to </p>
            <p>lose his life, earnestly begged the Hawk to let him go, saying 
              that </p>
            <p>he was not big enough to satisfy the hunger of a Hawk who, if he 
            </p>
            <p> wanted food, ought to pursue the larger birds. The Hawk, </p>
            <p>interrupting him, said: &quot;I should indeed have lost my senses 
              if I </p>
            <p>should let go food ready in my hand, for the sake of pursuing birds</p>
            <p> which are not yet even within sight.&quot; </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Dog, the Cock, and the Fox</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A DOG and a Cock being great friends, agreed to travel together. 
            </p>
            <p>At nightfall they took shelter in a thick wood. The Cock flying</p>
            <p>up, perched himself on the branches of a tree, while the Dog</p>
            <p>found a bed beneath in the hollow trunk. When the morning</p>
            <p>dawned, the Cock, as usual, crowed very loudly several times. A</p>
            <p>Fox heard the sound, and wishing to make a breakfast on him, </p>
            <p>came and stood under the branches, saying how earnestly he </p>
            <p>desired to make the acquaintance of the owner of so magnificent 
              a</p>
            <p> voice. </p>
            <p>The Cock, suspecting his civilities, said: &quot;Sir, I wish you 
              would</p>
            <p>do me the favor of going around to the hollow trunk below me, </p>
            <p>and waking my porter, so that he may open the door and let you 
            </p>
            <p> in.&quot;</p>
            <p>When the Fox approached the tree, the Dog sprang out and caught</p>
            <p>him, and tore him to pieces. </p>
            <p> </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Wolf and the Goat</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A WOLF saw a Goat feeding at the summit of a steep precipice,</p>
            <p>where he had no chance of reaching her. He called to her and</p>
            <p>earnestly begged her to come lower down, lest she fall by some</p>
            <p>mishap; and he added that the meadows lay where he was tanding,</p>
            <p>and that the herbage was most tender. She replied, &quot;No, my 
              friend,</p>
            <p> it is not for the pasture that you invite me, but for yourself, 
              who are</p>
            <p> in want of food.&quot; </p>

            <p align="center"><b>The Lion and the Bull</b> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>A LION, greatly desiring to capture a Bull, and yet afraid to</p>
            <p>attack him on account of his great size, resorted to a trick to</p>
            <p>ensure his destruction. He approached the Bull and said, &quot;I 
              have</p>
            <p>slain a fine sheep, my friend; and if you will come home and</p>
            <p>partake of him with me, I shall be delighted to have your </p>
            <p>company.&quot; The Lion said this in the hope that, as the Bull 
              was in</p>
            <p>the act of reclining to eat, he might attack him to advantage,</p>
            <p>and make his meal on him. The Bull, on approaching the Lion's</p>
            <p>den, saw the huge spits and giant caldrons, and no sign whatever</p>
            <p>of the sheep, and, without saying a word, quietly took his</p>
            <p>departure. The Lion inquired why he went off so abruptly without</p>
            <p>a word of salutation to his host, who had not given him any cause</p>
            <p>for offense. &quot;I have reasons enough,&quot; said the Bull. 
              &quot;I see no</p>
            <p>indication whatever of your having slaughtered a sheep, while I</p>
            <p>do see very plainly every preparation for your dining on a bull.&quot;</p>

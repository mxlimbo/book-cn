              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> Neo looks at Morpheus whose body is covered with a cold sweat.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              What are they doing to him?</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              They're cracking his mind.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              How?</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              They inject virus-like serums to break down the system. It's like<br>
              cracking a computer. All it takes is time.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              How much time?</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              Depends on the mind. But eventually, it will crack and his<br>
              alpha pattern will change from this to this.</p>
            <p> Tank punches several commands on Morpheus' personal unit.<br>
              The monitor waves change from a chaotic pattern to an orderly symmetrical 
              one.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              The access codes to Zion.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              If an agent got inside Zion's mainframe he could do anything.<br>
              Disable the defense system. It would be the end of us.</p>
            <p> He looks up at Trinity who is pacing relentlessly.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              We can't let that happen. We have to do it, Trinity. Zion has to 
              be<br>
              protected.</p>
            <p> Trinity sees Cypher's dead body. Rage overtakes her and she starts 
              kicking hin.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Goddamnit! Goddamnit!</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              We have to pull the plug.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              No!</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              We don't have any other choice.</p>
            <p> Those words are like using gasoline to put out a fire and we watch 
              the pain in her eyes burn into a blaze. She walks past him and gets 
              into her chair.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              Trinity, what are you doing?</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              I'm going in after him.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              Morpheus could conform at any minute --</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              If he does I'm sure you'll do what has to be done.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              You saw that place. It's suicide.</p>
            <p> She glares at him.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              I know what Morpheus means to you --</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              No. No, I don't think you do. If you did, then you would know that<br>
              I'm not letting him go. Not without a fight, Tank.She yanks her 
              harness tight.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Not without a fight.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Agent Smith stands in the bedroon of the enormous suite, staring 
              out the windows at the city, below, shimmering with brilliant sunlight.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Have you ever stood and stared at it, Morpheus? Marveled at its<br>
              beauty. Its genius. Billions of people just living out their<br>
              lives... oblivious.</p>
            <p> Agent Brown sucks a serum from a glass vial, filling a<br>
              hypodermic needle.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect 
              human world? Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy. 
              It was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops 
              were lost.</p>
            <p> Agent Brown jams the needle into Morpheus' shoulder, and plunges 
              down.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Some believed we lacked the programming language to describe<br>
              your perfect world. But I believe that, as a species, human beings<br>
              define their reality through suffering and misery.</p>
            <p> Agent Brown studies the screens as the life signs react<br>
              violently to the injection.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept<br>
              trying to wake up from. Which is why the Matrix was re-designed 
              to<br>
              this: the peak of your civilization.</p>
            <p> He turns from the window.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              I say 'your civilization' because as soon as we start thinking for<br>
              you, it really becomes our civilization, which is, of course,<br>
              what this is all about.</p>
            <p> He sits down directly in front of Morpheus.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Evolution, Morpheus. Evolution.</p>
            <p> He lifts Morpheus' head.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Like the dinosaur. Look out that window. You had your time.</p>
            <p> Morpheus stares hard at him, trying hard not to show the pain 
              racking his mind.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              The future is our world, Morpheus.<br>
              The future is our time.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> Neo goes to his chair and begins strapping in.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              What do you think you're doing?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              You need help. I'm coming with you.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              No. No way. Morpheus sacrificed himself so you could escape.<br>
              There's no way you're going back in.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something<br>
              that I'm not.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              I'm not the One, Trinity. The Oracle told me.</p>
            <p> Trinity is stunned.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              She said I had a gift but I still had a lot to learn. She told me<br>
              maybe next life.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Did you tell Morpheus?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Why? It wouldn't mean anything. He'd still believe what he wanted<br>
              to believe. But Morpheus is the one that matters. He's more<br>
              important than me and we both know it.</p>
            <p> He straps in.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              I may not be what Morpheus thinks I am, but if I don't try to help<br>
              him, then I'm not even what I think I am.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              What are you?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              His friend.</p>
            <p> INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Agent Smith sits casually across from Morpheus who is hunched 
              over, his body leaking and twitching.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here.<br>
              It came to me when I tried to classify your species. I've<br>
              realized that you are not actually mammals.</p>
            <p> The life signs continue their chaotic patterns.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural<br>
              equilibrium with the surrounding environment. But you humans do<br>
              not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every<br>
              natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is 
              to<br>
              spread to another area.</p>
            <p> He leans forward.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              There is another organism on this planet that follows the same<br>
              pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus.</p>
            <p> He smiles.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You are a<br>
              plague. And we are... the cure.</p>

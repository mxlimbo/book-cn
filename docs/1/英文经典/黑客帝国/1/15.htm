              INT. WALL (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Neo pulls Cypher free just as the Cop OPENS FIRE --</p>
            <p> BULLETS PUNCHING shafts of light like swords into the box<br>
              of soot-black space.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> The Cop keeps FIRING, his flashlight strapped to his gun<br>
              barrel, lighting up the wall until --</p>
            <p> A BULLET spits out his forehead. Agent Smith watches the<br>
              BODY fall with a THUD.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Are orders that hard to follow?<br>
              I'll say it again. Morpheus must<br>
              be taken alive. Understand?</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. WALL (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> They're almost falling, they're climbing so fast.</p>
            <p> Above them, plaster is smashed open as crunbling bits<br>
              shower down on them, filling the crawlway with dust.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Agent Smith looks into the open wall, at the exposed<br>
              intestines of the building, and realizes where they are<br>
              going.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              How like a rodent.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. WALL (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Just below, a RIFLE-BUTT SMASHES open the WALL, light<br>
              raking across the lathe.</p>
            <p> COP<br>
              I got him! I got him!</p>
            <p> Trinity finds her gun first. BULLET-HOLES POP out the<br>
              WALL as she STRAFES the room, sending cops diving for<br>
              cover.</p>
            <p> They continue, Trinity exposed for a roment, when a<br>
              creeping cop smashes a fist through and grabs a fistful<br>
              of her hair.</p>
            <p> He starts to yank her out when Neo kicks, his boot<br>
              bursting through plaster and splintering lathe, knocking<br>
              the Cop out.</p>
            <p> They then quickly sink out of sight.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> This part of the basement, a dark concrete cavern, was<br>
              the main mechanical room. There are four enormous<br>
              boilers, dinosaur-like technology that once pumped hot<br>
              water like arteries.</p>
            <p> Black and bloody, they squeeze out from the ceiling into<br>
              the tangled web of pipes.</p>
            <p> Their enemies are waiting for them.</p>
            <p> Blinding lights cut open the darkness as gas-masked<br>
              figures FIRE GRENADE LAUNCHERS.</p>
            <p> Smoke blossoms from the green-metal canisters.</p>
            <p> Morpheus never stops moving. Searching the floor, he<br>
              finds what.he needs; the cover of the catch basin.</p>
            <p> Cypher watches him pry open the grate, when a gas can<br>
              bounces near him.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Come on!</p>
            <p> Cypher seems to trip as the cloud envelops him.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> Cypher's body begins to shiver uncontrollably.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              Nerve gas.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Morpheus watches Cypher disappear into the smoke then<br>
              follows the others down the wet-black hole.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. CATCH BASIN (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> They crawl through greasy black water in a three foot<br>
              diameter pipe that feeds into the sewer main.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Gas-masked apparitions find the open hole.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Cypher is carried out, hand-cuffed, his body still<br>
              shaking, mucus bubbling out his nose. As he is led past<br>
              Agent Smith, it almost seems that both men smile.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              We have them now.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. SEWER MAIN (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Neo punches out the screen and then spills down into the<br>
              main water trough.</p>
            <p> Oily water forms around them as they wade across the man-<br>
              made underground river, towards the service catwalk.</p>
            <p> Neo is about to pull himself out when he sees them coming.</p>
            <p> Flashlights and laser sites sweep at them as cops in<br>
              helmets and heavy armor, looking more nachine than human,<br>
              fill both ends of the tunnel.</p>
            <p> There is a single manhole cover above them.</p>
            <p> Morpheus whispers to Trinity.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              You have to get Neo out. Understand? That's all that<br>
              matters now.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Morpheus, don't --</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              He must get out. Do you understand me?</p>
            <p> She nods.</p>
            <p> A font of water erupts as Morpheus leaps for the manhole<br>
              ladder, his coat flying open like the wings of a manta ray.</p>
            <p> COPS<br>
              There he is! That's him!</p>
            <p> Pools of light wash over him as he hauls himself to the<br>
              surface.</p>
            <p> COP<br>
              He's heading for the street!</p>
            <p> Trinity urges the others to follow her. Grabbing Neo,<br>
              they wade quietly away from the chaos.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Morpheus shoots out of the sewer but the police are<br>
              waiting for him. The closest cop is armed with a<br>
              tranquilized gun. He fires --</p>
            <p> But Morpheus' is too fast, using the manhole cover as a<br>
              shield, blocking the darts, then --</p>
            <p> Frisbee-ing it into the cop's armored chest, knocking him<br>
              off his feet.</p>
            <p> The cops lunge at him but every part of his body is a<br>
              deadly weapon moving with impossible speed.</p>
            <p> It seems he might fight his way out when he throws a<br>
              spinning back fist that is caught by --</p>
            <p> Agent Smith.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              So, we meet at last.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              And you are?</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Smith. I am Agent Smith.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              You all look the same to me.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              I've been waiting for this noment.</p>
            <p> Faster than a snake spits, Morpheus cracks Smith with a<br>
              jaw-breaking right.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Oh, so have I.</p>
            <p> Agent Smith smiles.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. SEWER MAIN (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Trinity leads the others, fading into the darkness of the<br>
              tunnel, lit only with shafts of lights streaming through<br>
              the street drains as we RISE TOWARDS them --</p>
            <p> THROUGH a grate INTO the fight.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Smith and Morpheus exchange a furious serious of blows<br>
              that is witnessed but not believed by the surrounding<br>
              police.</p>
            <p> Agent Smith delivers a punishing kick that staggers<br>
              Morpheus.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              You can't win.</p>
            <p> Morpheus smiles.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              I already have.</p>
            <p> He stands up and drops his fists; a steely resolve in his<br>
              eyes.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Take him.</p>
            <p> Cops swarm over Morpheus.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> Tank reaches out to the screen as if reaching for<br>
              Morpheus.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              No!</p>

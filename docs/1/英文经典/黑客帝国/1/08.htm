            <p><br>
              INT. ROOM 1313</p>
            <p> Across the room, a dark figure stares out the tall<br>
              windows veiled with decaying lace. He turns and his<br>
              smile lights up the room.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              At last.</p>
            <p> He wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible<br>
              behind circular mirrored glasses.</p>
            <p> He strides to Neo and they shake hands.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Welcome, Neo. As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              It's an honor.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Please. Come. Sit.</p>
            <p> He nods to Trinity.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Thank you, Trinity.</p>
            <p> She bows her head sharply and exits through a door to an<br>
              adjacent room.</p>
            <p> They sit across from one another in cracked, burgundy-<br>
              leather chairs.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling<br>
              down the rabbit hole?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              You could say that.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              I can see it in your eyes. You have the look of a man who accepts<br>
              what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.</p>
            <p> A smile, razor-thin, curls the corner of his lips.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Ironically, this is not far from the truth. But I'm getting ahead<br>
              of myself. Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet<br>
              you.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Yes. Thank you. But I think we both know there's more to it than<br>
              that. Do you believe in fate, Neo?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Why not?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              I know exactly what you mean.</p>
            <p> Again, that smile that could cut glass.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Let me tell you why you are here. You are here because you have 
              the gift.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              What gift?</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              I've watched you, Neo. You do not use a computer like a tool. You<br>
              use it like it was part of yourself. What you can do inside<br>
              a computer is not normal. I know. I've seen it. What you do is<br>
              magic.</p>
            <p> Neo shrugs.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              It's not magic.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              But it is, Neo. It is. How else would you describe what has been<br>
              happening to you?</p>
            <p> He leans forward.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              We are trained in this world to accept only what is rational and<br>
              logical. Have you ever wondered why?</p>
            <p> Neo shakes his head.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              As children, we do not separate the possible from the impossible<br>
              which is why the younger a mind is the easier it is to free while 
              a<br>
              mind like yours can be very difficult.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Free from what?</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              From the Matrix.</p>
            <p> Neo locks at his eyes but only sees a reflection of himself.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Do you want to know what it is, Neo?</p>
            <p> Neo swallows and nods his head.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              It's that feeling you have had all your life. That feeling that<br>
              something was wrong with the world. You don't know what it is<br>
              but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad,<br>
              driving you to me. But what is it?</p>
            <p> The LEATHER CREAKS as he leans back.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this 
              room.<br>
              You can see it out your window, or on your television. You feel 
              it<br>
              when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes. It is<br>
              the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from<br>
              the truth.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              What truth?</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              That you are a slave, Neo. That you, like everyone else, was born<br>
              into bondage...<br>
              ... kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. 
              A<br>
              prison for your mind.</p>
            <p> Outside, the WIND BATTERS a loose PANE of glass.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to<br>
              see it for yourself.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              How?</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Hold out your hands.</p>
            <p> In Neo's right hand, Morpheus drops a red pill.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              This is your last chance. After this, there is no going back.</p>
            <p> In his left, a blue pill.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              You take the blue pill and the story ends. You wake in your bed<br>
              and you believe whatever you want to believe.</p>
            <p> The pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              You take the red pill and you stay in Wonderland and I show you 
              how deep the rabbit-hole goes.</p>
            <p> Neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, with the<br>
              moisture growing in his palms.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Remember that all I am offering is the truth. Nothing more.</p>
            <p> Neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill. The<br>
              Cheshire smile returns.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Follow me.</p>
            <p> He leads Neo into the other room, which is cramped with<br>
              high-tech equipment, glowing ash-bliie and electric green<br>
              from the racks of monitors.</p>
            <p> Trinity, Apoc and Cypher look up as they enter.</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              Shit.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              I knew he would.</p>
            <p> Cypher saddles up to Morpheus, talking in a hushed tone<br>
              away from, Neo.</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              Morpheus, I know what you believe but I think this is a mistake.<br>
              We're rushing him. He's old. I'm afraid he might pop.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Haven't I always told you, Cypher, not to let fear control your 
              life.<br>
              Apoc, are we on-line?</p>
            <p> Neo recognizes the large man from the El train.</p>
            <p> APOC<br>
              Almost.</p>
            <p> He and Trinity are working quickly, hardwiring a complex<br>
              system of monitors, modules and drives.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Apoc? You wrote the Four Horsemen Virus.</p>
            <p> APOC<br>
              That's right.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Neo, time is always against us. Will you take a seat there?</p>
            <p> In the center of the room sits a chair. Near the chair<br>
              is an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              I imagine you know sonething about virtual reality.</p>
            <p> Neo sits and Trinity begins gently fixing white electrode<br>
              disks to his head, arns, and the back of his neck.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              A little.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Tell me about it.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Essentially, it's a hardware system that uses an apparatus;<br>
              headgear, gloves and whatever to make you feel that you are in a<br>
              computer program.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              If the virtual reality apparatus, as you called it, was wired to 
              all<br>
              of your senses and controlled them completely, would you be able 
              to tell the difference between the virtual world and the real world?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              You might not, no.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              No, you wouldn't.</p>
            <p> Neo whispers to Trinity.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              You did all this?</p>
            <p> She nods, placing a set of headphones over his ears.<br>
              They are wired to an old hotel phone.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              The pill you took is part of a trace program. It's going to make<br>
              things feel a bit strange.</p>
            <p> Distantly, through the ear phones, he hears Apoc POUNDING<br>
              on a KEYBOARD. Sweat beads his face. His eyes blink and<br>
              twitch when he notices the mirror.</p>
            <p> Wide-eyed he stares as it begins to heal itself, a<br>
              webwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the<br>
              mirror were becoming liquid.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Shit...</p>
            <p> Cypher works with Apoc checking reams of phosphorescent<br>
              data. Trinity monitors Neo's electric vital signs.</p>
            <p> Neo reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers<br>
              disappear beneath the rippling surface.</p>
            <p> Quickly, he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror<br>
              stretches in long rubbery strands like mirrored-taffy<br>
              stuck to his fingertips.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              What is this? Mescaline?</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Just relax, Neo.</p>
            <p> The strands thin like rubber cement as he pulls away,<br>
              until the fragile wisps of mirror thread break.</p>
            <p> With the TINKLING of GLASS, shimmering snowflakes<br>
              of electric-blinking mercury fall, hit the ground, and<br>
              fade.</p>
            <p> He looks at his hand; fingers distended into mirrored<br>
              icicles that begin to melt rapidly, dripping, running<br>
              like wax down his fingers, spreading across his palms<br>
              where he sees his face reflected.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Uh-oh...</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              It's going into replication.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Apoc?</p>
            <p> APOC<br>
              Still nothing.</p>
            <p> Morpheus takes out a cellular phone and dials a number.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Tank, we're going to need the signal soon. Stay calm, Neo.</p>
            <p> The mirror gel seems to come to life, racing, crawling up<br>
              his arns like hundreds of insects.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              It's cold.</p>
            <p> The mirror creeps up his neck as Neo begins to panic,<br>
              tipping his head as though he were sinking into the<br>
              mirror, trying to keep his mouth up.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              It's all over me --</p>
            <p> Morpheus is right next to him, with the phone.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              I got a fibrillation!</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              I knew it, I knew it...</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Shit! Apoc?</p>
            <p> Streams of mercury run from Neo's nose.</p>
            <p> APOC<br>
              Targeting... almost there.</p>
            <p> An ALARM, on Trinity's monitor ERUPTS.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              He's going into arrest!</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              He's gonna pop!</p>
            <p> APOC<br>
              Lock! I got him!</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Now, Tank now!</p>
            <p> His eyes tear with mirror, rolling up and closing as a<br>
              high-pitched ELECTRIC SCREAM ERUPTS in the headphones --</p>
            <p> It is a piercing SHRIEK like a computer calling to<br>
              another computer --</p>
            <p> Neo's body arches in agony and we are pulled like we were<br>
              pulled into the holes of the phone</p>
            <p> Sucked into his SCREAM and swallowed by darkness.</p>
            <p></p>

              EXT. SKYSCRAPER</p>
            <p> The agents lead a handcuffed Neo out of the revolving<br>
              doors, forcing his head down as they push him into the<br>
              dark sedan.</p>
            <p> Trinity watches in the rear view mirror of her motorcycle.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Shit.</p>
            <p> INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - CLOSE ON CAMERA MONITOR</p>
            <p> A wide angle view of a white roon, where Neo is sitting at<br>
              a table alone.</p>
            <p> We MOVE INTO the monitor, ENTERING the room as if the<br>
              monitor were a window.</p>
            <p> At the same moment, the door opens and the agents enter.</p>
            <p> Smith sits down across from Neo. A thick manila envelope<br>
              slaps down on the table between them.</p>
            <p> Neo glances at the name on the file: &quot;Anderson, Thomas<br>
              A.&quot;</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              As you can see, we've had our eye on you for some time now, Mr.<br>
              Anderson.</p>
            <p> He opens the file. Paper rattle marks the silence as he<br>
              flips several pages. Neo cannot tell if he is looking at<br>
              the file or at him.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              It seems that you have been living two lives. In one life, you are<br>
              Thomas A. Anderson, program writer for a respectable software<br>
              company. You have a social security number, you pay your<br>
              taxes and you help your land lady carry out her garbage.</p>
            <p> The pages continue to turn.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              The other life is lived in computers where you go by the<br>
              hacker alias Neo, and are guilty of virtually every computer crime<br>
              we have a law for, including the unauthorized use of the D.M.V.<br>
              system for the removal of automobile boots.</p>
            <p> Neo feels himself sinking into a pit of shit.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              One of these,lives has a future.<br>
              One of them does not.</p>
            <p> He closes the file.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              I'm going to be as forthcoming as I can be, Mr. Anderson. You are<br>
              here because we need your help.</p>
            <p> He removes his sunglasses; his eyes are an unnatural ice- blue.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              We know that you have been contacted by a certain individual.<br>
              A man who calls himself Morpheus. Whatever you think you know about 
              this man is irrelevant to the fact that he is wanted for acts of<br>
              terrorism in more countries than any other man in the world. He 
              is<br>
              considered by many authorities to be the most dangerous man alive.</p>
            <p> He leans closer.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              My colleagues believe that I am wasting my time with you, but I<br>
              believe you want to do the right thing. It is obvious that you are<br>
              an intelligent man, Mr. Anderson, and that you are interested in 
              the<br>
              future. That is why I believe you are ready to put your past<br>
              mistakes behind you and get on with your life.</p>
            <p> Neo tries to match his stare.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              We are willing to wipe the slate clean, to give you a fresh start<br>
              and all we are asking in return is your cooperation in bringing 
              a<br>
              known terrorist to justice.</p>
            <p>Neo nods to himself.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Yeah. Wow. That sounds like a real good deal. But I think I<br>
              have a better one. How about I give you the finger --</p>
            <p> He does.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              And you can cram that file up your Secret Service sphincter.</p>
            <p> Agent Smith puts his glasses back on.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              You disappoint me, Mr. Anderson.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              You ain't seen nothing yet.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              The irony of your situation is that you have no choice.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              You can't scare me with this gestapo crap. I know my rights.<br>
              I want my phone call.</p>
            <p> Agent Smith smiles.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              And tell me, Mr. Anderson, what good is a phone call iy you are<br>
              unable to speak?</p>
            <p> The question unnerves Neo and strangely, he begins to<br>
              feel the muscles in his jaw tighten.</p>
            <p> The standing agents snicker, watching Neo's confusion<br>
              grow into panic.</p>
            <p> Neo feels his lips grow soft and sticky as they slowly<br>
              seal shut, melding into each other until all trace of his<br>
              mouth is gone.</p>
            <p> Wild with fear, he lunges for the door but the agents<br>
              restrain him holding him in the chair.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              You are going to help us, Mr. Anderson, whether you want to or<br>
              not.</p>
            <p> Smith nods and the other two rip open his shirt.</p>
            <p> From a case taken out of his suit coat, Smith removes a<br>
              long, fiber-optic wire tap.</p>
            <p> Neo struggles helplessly as Smith dangles the wire over<br>
              his exposed abdomen. Horrified, he watches as the<br>
              electronic device animates, become an organic creature<br>
              that resembles a hybrid of an insect and a fluke worm.</p>
            <p> Thin, whisker-like tendrils reach out and probe into<br>
              Neo's navel. He bucks wildly as Smith drops the creature<br>
              which looks for a moment like an uncut umbilical cord --</p>
            <p> Before it begins to burrow its, tail thrashing as it<br>
              worms its way inside.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. NEO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
            <p> Screaming, Neo bolts upright in bed.</p>
            <p> He realizes that he is home. Was it a dream? His mouth<br>
              is normal. His stomach looks fine. He starts to take a<br>
              deep, everything-is-okay breath, when --</p>
            <p> The PHONE RINGS.</p>
            <p> It almost stops his heart. It CONTINUES RINGING,<br>
              building pressure in the room, forcing him up out of bed,<br>
              sucking him in with an almost gravitational force.</p>
            <p> He answers it, saying nothing.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.).<br>
              This line is tapped, so I must be brief.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              The agents --</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.)<br>
              They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important 
              you<br>
              are. If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.</p>
            <p> Neo feels sick.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.)<br>
              I don't know what you are thinking right now but I want you to<br>
              understand that I will not give up on you until you give up on me.</p>
            <p> Neo's throat cracks, dry as the Sahara.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.)<br>
              Do you still want to meet?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              ... Yes.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS (V.O.)<br>
              Take the Howard line south.</p>
            <p> CLICK. He closes his eyes, unsure of what he has done.</p>

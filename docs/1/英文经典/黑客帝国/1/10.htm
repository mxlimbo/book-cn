              INT. NEO'S ROOM</p>
            <p> Neo wakes up from a deep sleep, feeling better. He is<br>
              wearing a black tank top and shorts.</p>
            <p> He begins to examine himself. There is a futuristic IV<br>
              plugged into the jack in his forearm. He pulls it out,<br>
              staring at the grafted outlet.</p>
            <p> He feels his bald head. His fingers find and explore the<br>
              large outlet in the base of his skull.</p>
            <p> Just as he starts to come unglued, Morpheus opens the<br>
              door.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Morpheus, what's happened to me?<br>
              What is this place?</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              More important than what is when?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              When?</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.<br>
              I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not<br>
              know.</p>
            <p> The wind is knocked from Neo's chest.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              That's not possible.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              I promised you the truth, Neo, and the truth is that the world you<br>
              were living in was a lie.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              How?</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              I'll show you.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HOVERCRAFT</p>
            <p> Like a sleepwalker, Neo follows Morpheus through the ship.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              This is my ship, the Nebuchadnezzar. It's a hovercraft. Small like 
              a<br>
              submarine. It's dark. It's cramped and cold. But it's home.</p>
            <p> They climb a ladder up to the main deck.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> Everyone is there.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              This is the main deck. You know most of my crew.</p>
            <p> Trinity smiles and nods.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              The ones you don't know. That's Mouse and Switch. The two big<br>
              guys are Tank and Dozer.</p>
            <p> The names and faces wash meaninglessly over Neo.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              And this, this is the Core. This is where we broadcast our pirate<br>
              signal and hack into the Matrix.</p>
            <p> It is a swamp of bizarre electronic equipment. Vines of<br>
              coaxial hang and snake to and from huge monolithic<br>
              battery slabs, a black portable satellite dish and banks<br>
              of little systems and computer monitors.</p>
            <p> At the center of the web, there are six ectoskeleton<br>
              chairs made of a poly-alloy frame and suspension harness.</p>
            <p> Near the circle of chairs is the control console and<br>
              operator's station where the network is monitored.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Help him, Trinity.</p>
            <p> Neo allows himself to be helped into one of the chairs.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Do you remember when I asked you about an apparatus that could turn 
              a virtual reality into reality?</p>
            <p> Neo nods.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              It's right here.</p>
            <p> He touches Neo's head.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              And it's accessed here.</p>
            <p> Neo feels Morpheus guiding a coaxial line into the jack<br>
              at the back of his neck. The cable has the same kind of<br>
              cerebellum chip we saw inside the plant.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              This will feel a little weird.</p>
            <p> There are several disturbing NOISES as he works the<br>
              needle in.</p>
            <p> We MOVE IN as Neo's shoulders bunch and his face tightens<br>
              into a grimace until a loud CLICK fires and his ears pop<br>
              like when you equalize them underwater.</p>
            <p> He relaxes, opening his eyes as we pull back to a feeling<br>
              of weightlessness inside another place --</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. CONSTRUCT</p>
            <p> Neo is standing in an empty, blank-white space.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              This is the Construct.</p>
            <p> Startled, Neo whips around and finds Morpheus now in the<br>
              room with him.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              It is our loading program. We can load anything from clothes, to<br>
              weapons, to training simulations. Anything we need.</p>
            <p> Morpheus walks past Neo and when Neo turns he sees the<br>
              two leather chairs from the hotel set up in front of a<br>
              large-screen television.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Sit down.</p>
            <p> Neo stands at the back of the chair as Morpheus sits.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Right now, we're inside a computer program?</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Wild, isn't it?</p>
            <p> Neo's hands run over the cracked leather.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              This isn't real?</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              What is real? How do you define real? If you're talking about<br>
              your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're<br>
              talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.</p>
            <p> He picks up a remote control and clicks ON the<br>
              TELEVISION. We drift through the Windy City circa 1996.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              This is the Chicago you know. Chicago as it was at the end of<br>
              the twentieth century. This Chicago exists only as part of a<br>
              neural-interactive simulation that we call the Matrix.</p>
            <p> We GLIDE AT the television as he changes the channel.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              You have been living inside Baulliaurd's vision, inside the<br>
              map, not the territory. This is Chicago as it exists today.</p>
            <p> The sky is an endless sea of black and green bile. The<br>
              earth, scorched and split like burnt flesh, spreads out<br>
              beneath us as we ENTER the television.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              'The desert of the real.'</p>
            <p> In the distance, we see the ruins of a future Chicago<br>
              protruding from the wasteland like the blackened ribs of<br>
              a long-dead corpse.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              We are, right now, miles below the earth's surface. The only place<br>
              humans can survive outside the Matrix is underground.</p>
            <p> Still MOVING, we TURN and find Neo and Morpheus; the<br>
              chairs now sitting in the middle of the black desert.<br>
              Dizzy, Neo holds onto the chair.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              What happened?</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              It started early in the twenty- first century, with the birth of<br>
              artificial intelligence, a singular consciousness that<br>
              spawned an entire race of machines.</p>
            <p> In his sunglasses, we see storm clouds gather.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              At first all they wanted was to be treated as equals, entitled to 
              the<br>
              same human inalienable rights. Whatever they were given, it was 
              not enough.</p>
            <p> In the circular window of the glasses, EXPLOSIONS light<br>
              up a bloody battle field.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              We don't know who struck first. Us or them. But sometime at the<br>
              end of the twenty-first century the battle was joined.</p>
            <p> We MOVE INTO his glasses and the war surrounds us.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              The war raged for generations and turned the face of our planet 
              from green and blue to black and red.</p>
            <p> At last we see the Sentinels; killing machines that are<br>
              at once terrifying and beautiful. They have an organic<br>
              architecture like a microbiotic organism, that is<br>
              perpetually in motion.</p>
            <p> The Sentinel cracks the body armor of a soldier,<br>
              splitting open the soft, stearing meat inside.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              It scorched and burned the sky. Without the sun, the machines<br>
              sought out a new energy source to survive.</p>
            <p> The Sentinel locks up, as heat lightning of black ink<br>
              bursts against the sky, spreading into a permanent cloud<br>
              of stain.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              They discovered a new form of fusion. All that was required to<br>
              initiate the reaction was a small electric charge. Throughout human<br>
              history we have been dependent on machines to survive. Fate, it<br>
              seems, is not without a sense of irony.</p>
            <p> We return to the power plant that Neo escaped from where<br>
              we see human beings looking almost blissful in their<br>
              gelatin cocoons.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              The human body generates more bio- electricity than a 120-volt<br>
              battery and over 25,000 B.T.U.'s of body heat.</p>
            <p> Outside, spreading all around the power plant, beneath a<br>
              breathing greenhouse, are the growing fields.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              We are, as an energy source, easily renewable and completely<br>
              recyclable, the dead liquified and fed intravenously to the living.</p>
            <p> Huge farm-like reapers are harvesting the crop.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              All they needed to control this new battery was something to<br>
              occupy our mind.</p>
            <p> We see inside a clear tubular husk. Floating in viscous<br>
              fluid, there is a human fetus; its soft skull already<br>
              growing around the brain-jack.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              And so they built a prison out of our past, wired it to our brains<br>
              and turned us into slaves.</p>
            <p> We PULL BACK to find the image is now on the television<br>
              and we are again inside the white space of the Construct.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              No! I don't believe it! It's not possible!</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo. I just said that it<br>
              would be the truth.</p>
            <p> The room without walls begins to spin.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Stop! Let me out! I want out!</p>

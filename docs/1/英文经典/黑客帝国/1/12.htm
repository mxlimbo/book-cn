              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> Everyone is gathered behind Tank, watching the fight,<br>
              like watching a game of Mortal Combat.</p>
            <p> CABLE<br>
              Jeezus Keerist! That boy is fast!</p>
            <p> MOUSE<br>
              You ever seen anyone that fast that soon, Tank?</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              Never.</p>
            <p> APOC<br>
              Morpheus is right. He's got to be the one.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. DOJO</p>
            <p> The speed of the blows rises like a drum solo that seems<br>
              impossible to sustain. Neo's face sheds its mask of calm<br>
              with a scream.</p>
            <p> He wants to beat Morpheus bad.</p>
            <p> Finally a single blow catches Morpheus on the side of the<br>
              head, knocking his glasses off.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> There are several gasps.</p>
            <p> MOUSE<br>
              I don't believe it!</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. DOJO</p>
            <p> Morpheus rubs his face.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              You are angry with me.</p>
            <p> Neo pants.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              I, uh... maybe.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              It's all right. It's natural.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              I feel better.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Good, good. Anger is a gift, Neo, but it's a heavy one.</p>
            <p> Morpheus smiles.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Tank, load the jump program.</p>
            <p> Neo straightens as the dojo DISSOLVES away like a curtain<br>
              lifting, leaving the two men now standing on a building<br>
              rooftop in a city skyline.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              You have to learn to let go of that anger. You must let go of<br>
              everything.</p>
            <p> A WIND HOWLS, whipping Morpheus' long coat to the side.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              You must empty yourself to free your mind.</p>
            <p> Morpheus spins, running hard at the edge of the rooftop.<br>
              And jumps. He sails through the air, his coat billowing<br>
              out behind him like a cape --</p>
            <p> Somersaults once and lands on the rooftop across the street.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Shit.</p>
            <p> Neo looks down at the street twenty floors below, then at<br>
              Morpheus an impossible fifty feet away.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Okie dokie.</p>
            <p> He takes a deep breath.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Yeah. Free my mind. Right. No problem.</p>
            <p> He concentrates. Runs.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> They are transfixed.</p>
            <p> CABLE<br>
              He's gonna make it.</p>
            <p> APOC<br>
              No way. Not possible.</p>
            <p> MOUSE<br>
              No one's ever made their first jump.</p>
            <p> SWITCH<br>
              What if he does?</p>
            <p> APOC<br>
              He won't.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              It's never been done.</p>
            <p> Trinity stares at the screen, her fists clenching as she whispers.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Come on.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. ROOFTOP</p>
            <p> Summoning every ounce of strength in his legs, Neo<br>
              launches himself into the air in a single maniacal shriek<br>
              --</p>
            <p> But comes up drastically short.</p>
            <p> His eyes widen as he plummets. Stories fly by, the<br>
              ground rushing up at him, but as he hits --</p>
            <p> The ground gives way, stretchinp like a trapeze net.</p>
            <p> He bounces and flips, slowly coming to a rest, flat on<br>
              his back.</p>
            <p> He laughs, a bit unsure, wiping the wind-blown tears from<br>
              his face.</p>
            <p> Morpheus exits the building and helps him to his feet.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Everyone falls the first time.</p>
            <p> Neo nods quietly.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              If you never know failure, how can you know success?</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> They break up.</p>
            <p> MOUSE<br>
              What does it mean?</p>
            <p> CABLE<br>
              It doesn't mean anything.</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              Everyone falls, right, Trinity?</p>
            <p> But Trinity has left.</p>
            <p> Neo's eyes open as Tank eases the plug out. He tries to<br>
              move and groans, cradling his ribs.</p>
            <p> While Tank helps Morpheus, Neo spits blood into his hand.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              I thought it wasn't real.</p>
            <p> Neo stares at the blood.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              The body cannot live without the mind.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. NEO'S ROOM</p>
            <p> Trinity enters from the hall, carrying a try of food.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Neo, I saved you some dinner --</p>
            <p> She sees him passed out on the bed. She sets the tray<br>
              down and pulls the blanket over him.</p>
            <p> She pauses, her face close to his, then inhales lightly,<br>
              breathing in the scent of him, before slowly pulling away.</p>
            <p> It seems the moment she closes the door, he wakes with a<br>
              start, unsure of where he is. After a moment, he gets<br>
              out of bed.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HALL</p>
            <p> The ship is quiet and dark. Everyone is asleep.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> The core glows with monitor light. Cypher is in the<br>
              operator's chair as Neo cones up behind him.</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              Whoa! Shit, Neo, you scared the bejeezus out of ne.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Sorry.</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              No, it's all right.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              What are you doing?</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              Midnight watch.</p>
            <p> Neo's eyes light up as he steps closer to the screens<br>
              that seem alive with a constant flow of data.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Is that... ?</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              The Matrix? Yeah.</p>
            <p> The monitors are packed with bizarre codes and equations.</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              You want a drink?</p>
            <p> He pours Neo a drink from a large plastic jug.</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              I'll tell you, I feel for you, man. I really do. Most of us<br>
              were still young, just punks, when Morpheus jacked us. But you, 
              you had a real life.</p>
            <p> Neo takes a sip and it almost kills him. Cypher pounds on his 
              back.</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              Good shit, huh? Dozer makes it. It's good for two things:<br>
              degreasing engines and killing brain cells.</p>
            <p> Red-faced, Neo finally stops coughing.</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              Did he tell you why he did it?</p>
            <p> Neo nods.</p>
            <p> CYPHER,<br>
              I'll be the didn't tell you that this wasn't the first time he<br>
              thought he found the One.</p>
            <p> Neo shakes his head as Cypher fills his cup and laughs.</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              Let me give you a piece of advice. Between you and me, if Morpheus 
              says you can fly, I wouldn't go jumping out any windows to find 
              out if he's right. Understand?</p>
            <p> Cypher raises his drink. Neo swallows another throat-<br>
              scorching mouthful.</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              Welcome to the real world!</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. RESTAURANT (MATRIX) - NIGHT</p>
            <p> CHAMBER MUSIC and the ambiance of wealth soak the room as<br>
              we watch a serrated knife saw through a thick, gorgeous steak.</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              That's what he said to me nine years ago.</p>
            <p> The meat is so perfect, charred on the outside, oozing<br>
              red juice from the inside, that it could be a dream.</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              The real world. Ha, what a joke.</p>
            <p> We recognize the grating voice, the insidious laugh.</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              You know what real is? I'll tell you what real is.</p>
            <p> A fork stabs the cube of meat and we FOLLOW it UP TO the<br>
              face of Cypher.</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              Real is just another four-letter word.</p>
            <p> He laughs, shoving the steak into his mouth.</p>
            <p> The restaurant is located on the top floor of a Chicago skyscraper 
              where the view is breathtaking and the menu has no prices.</p>
            <p> Sitting across from Cypher is Agent Smith.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?</p>
            <p> Cypher chews the steak loudly, smacking it between his<br>
              teeth.</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              Mmm, so, so fucking good.</p>
            <p> Smith watches him shovel another hunk of meat into his mouth.</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              You know, I know that this steak doesn't exist. I know when I put<br>
              it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy<br>
              and delicious. After nine years, do you know what I've realized?</p>
            <p> Pausing, he examines the meat skewered on his fork. He<br>
              pops it in, eyes rolling up, savoring the tender beef melting in 
              his mouth.</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              Ignorance is bliss.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Then we have a deal?</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              I don't want to remember nothing. Nothing! You understand? And I<br>
              want to be rich. Someone important. Like an actor. You can do that, 
              right?</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.</p>
            <p> Cypher takes a deep drink of wine.</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              All right. You get my body back in a power plant, reinsert me into<br>
              the Matrix and I'll get you what you want.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Access codes to Zion.</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              I told you, I don't know them. But I can give you the man who<br>
              does.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Morpheus.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> Sweat dapples his lip as Neo snaps out of the construct coma.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Jeez, I was wondering about that.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Why I was bald here but not in the<br>
              Matrix.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              R.S.I.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Residual self image.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              Good. Now what's this?</p>
            <p> He points to one of Neo's monitors.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Life systems monitor, glucose levels.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              What's that?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Main power supply to the core.</p>
            <p> He follows Tank to the operator's station where he points<br>
              to a red key-switch.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              How about this?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Mainframe self-destruct. Uses all remaining power to generate an...<br>
              E.M.P?</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              Electromagnetic pulse. Our best weapon against the machines. The<br>
              problem is if someone is still in the Matrix when that thing goes<br>
              off, they're not coming back.</p>
            <p> Neo nods as Morpheus comes up behind them.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              How's he doing?</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              We just finished the operation programs and he's showing great<br>
              retention.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Good. I want everyone alerted to 12-hour stand-by. We're going in.<br>
              Neo, it's time for you to know why you're here.</p>
            <p> Morpheus walks away.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              What's he talking about?</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              He's taking you into the Matrix to see her.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              See who?</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              The Oracle.</p>
            <p> Neo looks down at the monitor teeming with Matrix data<br>
              that seems to coalesce, equations giving way to images as<br>
              a METAL SCREAM RISES BECOMING --</p>

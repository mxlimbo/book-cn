            <p><br>
              EXT. FIRE E5CAPE</p>
            <p> In the alley below, Trinity sees Agent Smith staring at<br>
              her. She can only go up.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. ROOF</p>
            <p> On the roof, Trinity is running as Agent Brown rises over<br>
              the parapet, leading the cops in pursuit.</p>
            <p> Trinity begins to jump from one roof to the next, her<br>
              moverents so clean, gliding in and out of each jump,<br>
              contrasted to the wild jumps of the cops.</p>
            <p> Agent Brown, however, has the same unnatural grace.</p>
            <p> The METAL SCREAM of an EL TRAIN is heard and Trinity<br>
              turns to it, racing for the back of the building.</p>
            <p> The edge falls away into a wide back alley. The next<br>
              building is over 40 feet away, but Trinity's face is<br>
              perfectly calm, staring at some point beyond the other<br>
              roof.</p>
            <p> The cops slow, realizing they are about to see something<br>
              ugly as Trinity drives at the edge, launching herself<br>
              into the air.</p>
            <p> From above, the ground seems to flow beneath her as she<br>
              hangs in flight</p>
            <p> Then hitting, somersaulting up, still running hard.</p>
            <p> COP<br>
              Motherfucker -- that's impossible!</p>
            <p> They stare, slack-jawed, as Agent Brown duplicates the<br>
              move exactly, landing, rolling over a shoulder, up onto<br>
              one knee.</p>
            <p> Just below the building are the runbling tracks of<br>
              riveted steel. The TRAIN SCREECHES beneath her, a<br>
              rattling blur of gray metal. Trinity junps, landing<br>
              easily.</p>
            <p> She looks back just as Agent Brown hurls through the air<br>
              barely reaching the last car</p>
            <p> Agent Brown stands, yanking out a gun.</p>
            <p> Trinity is running hard as BULLETS WHISTLE past her head.</p>
            <p> Ahead she sees her only chance, 50 feet beyond the point<br>
              where the train has begun to turn, there is --</p>
            <p> A window; a yellow glow in the midst of a dark brick<br>
              building.</p>
            <p> Trinity zeroes in on it, running as hard as she can, her<br>
              speed compounded by the train. The SCREAM of the STEEL<br>
              rises as she nears the edge where the train rocks into the<br>
              turn.</p>
            <p> Trinity hurtles into the empty night space, her body<br>
              leveling into a dive. She falls, arms covering her head<br>
              as --</p>
            <p> The whole world seems to spin on its axis --</p>
            <p> And she crashes with an EXPLOSION of GLASS and WOOD, then falls 
              onto a back stairwell, tumbling, bouncing down<br>
              stairs bleeding, broken --</p>
            <p> But still alive.</p>
            <p> Through the smashed window, she glimpses Agent Brown,<br>
              still on the train, his tie and coat whipping in the<br>
              wind; stone-faced, he touches his ear piece as the train<br>
              slides him past the window.</p>
            <p> Trinity tries to move. Everything hurts.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Get up, Trinity. You're fine.<br>
              Get up -- just get up!</p>
            <p> She stands and limps down the rest of the stairs.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. STREET</p>
            <p> Trinity emerges from the shadows of an alley and, at the<br>
              end of the block, in a pool of white street light, she<br>
              sees it.</p>
            <p> The telephone booth.</p>
            <p> Obviously hurt, she starts down the concrete walk,<br>
              focusing in completely, her pace quickening, as the PHONE<br>
              begins to RING.</p>
            <p> Across the street, a garbage truck suddenly u-turns, its<br>
              TIRES SCREAMING as it accelerates.</p>
            <p> Trinity sees the headlights on the truck arcing at the<br>
              telephone booth as if taking aim.</p>
            <p> Gritting through the pain, she races the truck --</p>
            <p> Slamming into the booth, the headlights blindingly<br>
              bright, bearing down on the box of Plexiglas just as --</p>
            <p> She answers the phone.</p>
            <p> There is a frozen instant of silence before the hulking<br>
              mass of dark metal lurches up onto the sidewalk --</p>
            <p> Barreling through the booth, bulldozing it into a brick<br>
              wall, smashing it to Plexiglas pulp.</p>
            <p> After a moment, a black loafer steps down from the cab of<br>
              the garbage truck. Agent Smith inspects the wreckage.<br>
              There is no body. Trinity is gone.</p>
            <p> His jaw sets as he grinds his molars in frustration.<br>
              AGENT JONES walks up behind him.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Did you get anything from the room?</p>
            <p> AGENT JONES<br>
              Their next target. The name is Neo.</p>
            <p> The handset of the pay phone lays on the ground,<br>
              separated in the crash like a severed limb.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              We'll need a search running.</p>
            <p> AGENT JONES<br>
              It's already begun.</p>
            <p> We are SUCKED TOWARDS the mouthpiece of the phone, CLOSER<br>
              and CLOSER, UNTIL the smooth gray plastic spreads out<br>
              like a horizon and the small HOLES WIDEN until we fall<br>
              through one --</p>
            <p> Swallowed by the darkness that becomes --</p>
            <p> A computer screen.</p>
            <p> We are on-line, inside a chat room called &quot;The Matrix.&quot;<br>
              It is an exklusive web-site where hackers hang out.</p>
            <p> SCREEN<br>
              JACKON: I heard Morpheus has been on this board.</p>
            <p> SUPERASTIC: Morpheus doesn't even exist and the Matrix is nothing 
              but an advertising gimmick 4 a new game.</p>
            <p> TIMAXE: All I want to know is Trinity really a girl?</p>
            <p> LODIII: 87% of all women on line are really men.</p>
            <p> QUARK: The Matrix is a euphemism for the government.</p>
            <p>UPERASTIC: No, The Matrix is the system controlling our lives.</p>
            <p> TIMAXE: You mean MTV.</p>
            <p> SUPERASTIC: I mean Sega.</p>
            <p> FOS4: ALL HAIL SEGA!!!</p>
            <p> We drift back from the electric conversation entering --</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. NEO'S APARTMENT</p>
            <p> It is a studio apartirent that seems overgrown with<br>
              technology.</p>
            <p> Weed-like cables coil everywhere, duct-taped into<br>
              thickets that wind up and around the legs of several<br>
              desks.</p>
            <p> Tabletops are filled with cannibalized equipment that lay<br>
              open like an autopsied corpse.</p>
            <p> We turn towards the center of this rat-nest of<br>
              technology, following the slurping and crunching of<br>
              cereal. We pass an open box of Capln Crunch as we find --</p>
            <p> NEO, a younger man who knows more about living inside a<br>
              computer than living outside one.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Fuckin' idiots don't know shit.</p>
            <p> He finishes his cereal and is about to disconnect when an<br>
              anonynous message slices onto the screen.</p>
            <p> SCREEN<br>
              Do you want to know what the Matrix is, Neo?</p>
            <p> Neo is frozen when he reads his name.</p>
            <p> SCREEN<br>
              SUPERASTIC: Who said that?<br>
              JACKON: Who's Neo?<br>
              GIBSON: This is a private board.</p>
            <p> If you want to know, follow the white rabbit.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              What the hell...</p>
            <p> SCREEN<br>
              TIMAXE: Someone is hacking the hackers!<br>
              FOS4: It's Morpheus!!!!!<br>
              JACKON: Identify yourself.</p>
            <p> Knock, knock, Neo.</p>
            <p> A chill runs down his spine and when someone KNOCKS on<br>
              his door he almost jumps out of his chair.</p>
            <p> He looks at the door, then back at the computer but the<br>
              message is gone.</p>
            <p> He shakes his head, not completely sure what happened.<br>
              Again, someone knocks.</p>
            <p> Cautiously, Neo approaches the door.</p>
            <p> VOICE (O.S.)<br>
              Hey, Tommy-boy! You in there?</p>
            <p> Recognizing the voice, he relaxes and opens it. ANTHONY,<br>
              who lives down the hall, is standing outside with a group<br>
              of friends.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              What do you want, Anthony?</p>
            <p> ANTHONY<br>
              I need your help, man. Desperate. They got me, man. The shackles 
              of fascism.</p>
            <p> He holds up the red notice that accompanies the Denver<br>
              boot.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              You got the money this time?</p>
            <p> He holds up two hundred dollars and Neo opens the door.<br>
              Anthony's girlfriend, DUJOUR, stops in front of Neo.</p>
            <p> DUJOUR<br>
              You can really get that thing off, right now?</p>
            <p> ANTHONY<br>
              I told you, honey, he may look like just another geek but this<br>
              here is all we got left standing between Big Brother and the New<br>
              World Order.</p>

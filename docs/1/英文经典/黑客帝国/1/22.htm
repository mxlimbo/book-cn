            <p> Trinity blinks, shivering as her conscious exits the<br>
              Construct.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Neo!</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              What the hell just happened?</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              An Agent! You have to send me<br>
              back!</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              I can't!</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. &quot;EL&quot; STATION (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> GUN REPORT THUNDERS through the underground, both men<br>
              BLASTING, moving at impossible speed.</p>
            <p> For a blinking noment we enter BULLET-TIME.</p>
            <p> Gun flash tongues curl from Neols gun, bullets float<br>
              forward like a plane noving across the sky, cartridges<br>
              cartwheel into space.</p>
            <p> An instant later they are nearly on top of each other,<br>
              rolling up out of a move that is almost a mirrored<br>
              reflection of the other --</p>
            <p> Each jamming their gun tight to the other's head.</p>
            <p> They freeze in a kind of embrace; Neo sweating, panting,<br>
              Agent Smith machine-calm.</p>
            <p> Agent Smith smiles.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              You're empty.</p>
            <p> Neo pulls the TRIGGER. CLICK.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              So are you.</p>
            <p> The smile falls. Agent Smith yanks his TRIGGER.</p>
            <p> CLICK.</p>
            <p> Agent Smith's face warps with rage and he attacks, fist<br>
              flying at furious speed, blows and counters, Neo<br>
              retreating as --</p>
            <p> A knife-hand opens his forearm, and a kick sends him<br>
              slamming back against a steel column.</p>
            <p> Stunned, he ducks just under a punch that crunches into<br>
              the beam, STEEL CHUNKS EXPLODING like shrapnel.</p>
            <p> Behind him, Neo leaps into the air, delivering a neck-<br>
              snapping reverse round-house. Agent Smith's glasses fly<br>
              off and he glares at Neo; his eyes, ice blue.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              You can't win.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              I already have.</p>
            <p> He attacks with a vicious series of blows but the Agent<br>
              seems to absorb them, waiting for his opening.</p>
            <p> And this time Agent Smith's attack is too much, an<br>
              unrelenting fury, fists pounding like jackhammers.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HOVERCRAFT</p>
            <p> Trinity watches Neo as his body jerks, mouth coughing<br>
              blood, his life signs going wild.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Jesus, he's killing him!</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. &quot;EL&quot; STATION (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Agent Smith grabs hold of him, lifting him into the air,<br>
              hurling him against the curved wall of the train tunnel,<br>
              where he falls inches from the electrified third-rail.</p>
            <p> The Agent is about to jump down, and press his attack<br>
              when he hears sonething. From deep in the tunnel, like<br>
              an animal cry; a burst of high-speed METAL GRINDING<br>
              against METAL.</p>
            <p> The sound of an ON-COMING TRAIN.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HOVERCRAFT</p>
            <p> Tank is trying to find another entrance.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Send me back, Tank! Anywhere!</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              I'm looking, Trinity! I'm looking!</p>
            <p> From the cockpit, an ALARM sounds. Morpheus hurries to<br>
              the front console, typing, bringing up the radar.</p>
            <p> Trinity follows him.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              What is it... oh no.</p>
            <p> In every pipe surrounding them, they see the Extermination Unit.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Sentinels.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. SEWER MAIN</p>
            <p> The killing machine we saw in the History Program blister<br>
              by us like tracer bullets shot down the throat of the abyss.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. &quot;EL&quot; STATION (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Neo tries to get up. Agent Smith jumps down onto the<br>
              tracks and drop-kicks him in the face.</p>
            <p> The world begins to shake, RUMBLING as the TRAIN NEARS.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Do you hear that, Mr. Anderson?</p>
            <p> Agent Smith grabs Neo in a choke-hold, forcing him to<br>
              look down the tracks, the train's headlight burning a<br>
              hole in the darkness.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              That is the sound of inevitability.</p>
            <p> Neo sees it coming and he starts to fight.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              It is the sound of your death.</p>
            <p> There is another METAL SCREECH, MUCH LOUDER, closer, as<br>
              Agent Smith tightens his hold. Neo is unable to breathe.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.</p>
            <p> The TRAIN ROARS at them, swallowing Agent Smith's words.</p>
            <p> The veins bulge in Neo's head, as he grits through the pain.</p>
            <p> He is not ready to die.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              My name is Neo.</p>
            <p> Impossibly, he hurls himself straight up, smashing Smith<br>
              against the concrete ceiling of the tunnel.</p>
            <p> They fall as the sound and fury of the TRAIN EXPLODES<br>
              INTO the station.</p>
            <p> Neo back-flips up off the tracks just as --</p>
            <p> The train barrels over Agent Smith.</p>
            <p> Neo stands, knees shaking, when the train slams on its<br>
              emergency brake. With an ear-splitting SHRIEK of<br>
              TORTURED RAILS, the train slows, part of it still in the<br>
              station.</p>
            <p> Neo turns, limping, starting to run, racing for the<br>
              escalator --</p>
            <p> As the train comes to a stop and the doors of the last<br>
              car open; Agent Smith bursts out in furious pursuit, his<br>
              glasses again intact.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HOVERCRAFT</p>
            <p> Morpheus checks the ship's self destruct key.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              You can't use that until Neo is out!</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              I know. Don't worry, he'll make it.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> A man sits in his Mercedes, talking on his car phone when<br>
              his door is thrown open. Neo yanks him out and jumps in.</p>
            <p> Further down the street, Agent Smith slows, calmly<br>
              touching his ear-piece.</p>
            <p> Neo throws the car across traffic, rocketing down a side-<br>
              street.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. CAR (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Driving like a demon with one hand, he grabs the car<br>
              phone and dials long distance.</p>
            <p> INT. HOVERCRAFT</p>
            <p> Tank answers.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              Operator.</p>
            <p> NEO (V.O.)<br>
              Mr. Wizard, Get me the fuck out of here!</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. CAR (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Looking over his shoulder, watching the mirrors, Neo<br>
              drives almost unconsciously.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Hurry, Tank! I got some serious pursuit!</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HOVERCRAFT</p>
            <p> The keyboard clicking, Tank searches for an exit.<br>
              Trinity screams into the headset.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Neo, you better get your ass back here!</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. CAR</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              I'm trying, Trinity. I'm trying.</p>
            <p> TANK (V.O.)<br>
              I got one!</p>
            <p> Neo glances to his right and sees Agent Brown, now<br>
              driving the car beside his. Agent Brown swerves,<br>
              slamming into him.</p>
            <p> TANK (V.O.)<br>
              Wabash and Lake. A hotel.</p>
            <p> Neo fights the steering wheel as Agent Brown pushes the<br>
              car up over the median.</p>
            <p> TANK (V.O.)<br>
              Room 303.</p>
            <p> Neo drops the phone as his car bucks into the opposing<br>
              lane --</p>
            <p> Directly into the charging path of an enormous truck<br>
              driven by Agent Smith.</p>
            <p> Neo dives from the Mercedes as the truck plows into it,<br>
              rending metal and GLASS, crushing through, totaling other<br>
              cars, as it EXPLODES.</p>
            <p> Neo is up and running even as orange and black clouds<br>
              billow up behind hin.</p>

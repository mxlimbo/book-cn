              EXT. ROOF (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> The roof-access tower is now engulfed in flames as Neo<br>
              and Trinity lay waste to a dozen more Marines.</p>
            <p> Guns and knives, like extensions of their bodies used<br>
              with the same deadly precision as their feet and their<br>
              fists.</p>
            <p> Across the roof, the pilot inside the army helicopter<br>
              watches the ferocious onslaught.</p>
            <p> PILOT<br>
              I repeat, we are under attack!</p>
            <p> Suddenly his face, his whole body dissolves, consumed by<br>
              spreading locust-like swarm, of STATIC as --</p>
            <p> Agent Jones emerges.</p>
            <p> Just as she drops the last Marine, Trinity sees what's<br>
              coming.</p>
            <p> Neo sees her, the fear in her face, and he knows what is<br>
              behind him.</p>
            <p> Screaming, he whirls, GUNS filling his hands with<br>
              thought-speed.</p>
            <p> Fingers PUMPING, SHELLS ejecting, dancing up and away, we<br>
              look through the sights and gun smoke at --</p>
            <p> The Agent blurred with motion --</p>
            <p> Until the HAMMERS CLICK against empty metal.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Trinity!</p>
            <p> Agent Jones charges.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              ... help.</p>
            <p> His GUN BOOMS as we enter the liquid space of --</p>
            <p> Bullet-time.</p>
            <p> The AIR SIZZLES with wads of lead-like angry flies as Neo<br>
              twists, bends, ducks just between them.</p>
            <p> Agent Jones still running, narrows the gap, the BULLETS<br>
              coming faster until --</p>
            <p> Neo bent impossibly back, one hand on the ground as a<br>
              spiraling gray ball shears open his shoulder.</p>
            <p> He starts to scream as another digs a red groove across<br>
              his thigh.</p>
            <p> He has only time to look up, to see the barrel when Agent<br>
              Jones, standing over him, pulls the TRIGGER the final<br>
              time.</p>
            <p> CLICK. Empty.</p>
            <p> Neo rolls, reaching for another gun when around-house<br>
              kick snaps his jaw. Agent Jones grabs the gun and levels<br>
              it at Neo.</p>
            <p> AGENT JONES<br>
              Only human...</p>
            <p> Suddenly Agent Jones stops. Something is wrong. He<br>
              scans the roof. Trinity is gone.</p>
            <p> Immediately, he whirls around and turns straight into the<br>
              muzzle of her .45 --</p>
            <p> Jammed right into his head.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Dodge this, motherfucker!</p>
            <p> BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The body flies back with a flash of<br>
              mercurial light and when it hits the ground --</p>
            <p> It is the pilot.</p>
            <p> Trinity helps Neo up.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Thanks.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              You're hit --</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              I'm fine.</p>
            <p> Neo is already looking at the helicopter.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Can you fly that thing?</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Not yet.</p>
            <p> She pulls out a cellular phone.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HOVERCRAFT</p>
            <p> Tank is back at the controls.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              Operator.</p>
            <p> TRINITY (V.O.)<br>
              Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.</p>
            <p> Tank is immediately searching the disk drawers.</p>
            <p> TRINITY (V.O.)<br>
              Hurry!</p>
            <p> His fingers flash over the gleaming laser disks, finding<br>
              one that he feeds into Trinityls supplement drive,<br>
              punching the &quot;load&quot; cormands on her keyboard.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. ROOF (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Trinity's eyes flutter as information surges into her<br>
              brain, all the essentials of flying a helicopter absorbed<br>
              at light-speed.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Let's go.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Marines, trying to communicate with the men on the roof,<br>
              are beginning to panic when Agent Jones comes around the<br>
              corner.</p>
            <p> SERGEANT<br>
              Sir! Sir! There was gunfire --<br>
              we've lost communication with the roof!</p>
            <p> AGENT JONES<br>
              Remain at your posts.</p>
            <p> SERGEANT<br>
              But, sir -- the fire -- we should evacuate!</p>
            <p> AGENT JONES<br>
              You will do as you are ordered!</p>
            <p> SERGEANT<br>
              Yes, sir.</p>
            <p> Agent Jones marches into the Presidential Suite.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Agent Jones throws open the bedroom door and enters,<br>
              walking through the puddles pooling in the carpet.</p>
            <p> Over the RUSHING WATER and the ALARMS, Agent Smith hears<br>
              a SOUND and understands the seriousness of the attack.</p>
            <p> He turns to the wall of windows as the helicopter drops<br>
              INTO VIEW --</p>
            <p> Neo is in the back bay, aiming the mounted .50 machine<br>
              gun.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> The GUN jumps and BULLETS EXPLODE through the WINDOW in a cacophony 
              of CRASHING GLASS --</p>
            <p> As the Agents go for their weapons.</p>
            <p> But Neo is too close, the .50 CALIBER too fast and<br>
              BULLETS are everywhere, perforating the room.</p>
            <p> Agent Smith is hit first, his body jack-knifing back,<br>
              blood arcing out with a sudden flash of light --</p>
            <p> Then Agent Brown, his GUN still FIRING as his body falls.</p>
            <p> And finally Agent Jones.</p>
            <p> Neo stares at Morpheus, trying to will him into action.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Get up, Morpheus! Get up!</p>
            <p> Morpheus sits unmoving, his head still down.</p>
            <p> Neo grabs the climbing rope just as marines burst into<br>
              the adjoining room.</p>
            <p> He attaches only one end to his harness when they OPEN<br>
              FIRE.</p>
            <p> Quickly he swings the GUN, SPRAYING the other room,<br>
              WINDOWS SHATTERING, FURNITURE EXPLODING, marines diving for cover.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Just outside the Presidential Suite, three marines<br>
              blister with snow-static.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Morpheus lifts his face into the room's rain. His eyes,<br>
              still white, begin to blink, twitch, then close.</p>
            <p> And when he opens them, they are again dark and flashing<br>
              with fire.</p>
            <p> The Agents knife into the room, FIRING even as Neo's<br>
              BULLET TRAILS chase them.</p>
            <p> Morpheus strains at his handcuffs.</p>
            <p> The Agents and the marines turn the tide, BLASTING LEAD,<br>
              RICOCHETING, POCK-MARKING the COPTER.</p>
            <p> FIRING wildly, Neo turns to see Morpheus rising, snapping<br>
              the handcuffs, starting for the window.</p>
            <p> Agent Smith stops and sees Morpheus run past the open<br>
              bedroom door.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Nooo!</p>
            <p> He FIRES, sweeping across the sheetrocked wall in a<br>
              perfect line.</p>
            <p> For an instant, we see the BULLETS SHRED, PUNCTURING the<br>
              WALL, searing through the wet air with jet trails of<br>
              chalk.</p>
            <p> And as Morpheus starts to dive for the window, a bullet<br>
              buries itself in his leg --</p>
            <p> Knocking him off balance.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              He won't make it.</p>
            <p> Morpheus lunges, out of control --</p>
            <p> As Neo spins, every move a whip crack --</p>
            <p> Snapping the other rope-end onto a bolted bar.</p>
            <p> Morpheus begins to fall when Neo hurls himself into the<br>
              wide blue empty space --</p>
            <p> Flying for a moment.</p>
            <p> The rope snaking out behind him; an umbilical cord<br>
              attached to a machine.</p>
            <p> As their two bodies, set in motion, rushing at each other<br>
              on a seemingly magnetic course until --</p>
            <p> They collide.</p>
            <p> Almost bouncing free of each other, arms, legs,<br>
              scrambling, hands searching in furious desperation,<br>
              finding hold and clinging.</p>
            <p> Until the line ends, snapping taut, cracking their<br>
              fragile embrace. Morpheus tumbles, legs flipping over,<br>
              falling down --</p>
            <p> The ground deliriously distant --</p>
            <p> As Neo snatches hold of his mentor's still handcuffed wrist.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Gotcha!</p>
            <p> Trinity is already pulling the copter up and away.</p>
            <p> As Agent Smith grabs the M-16 from the nearest marine.</p>
            <p> He'll bring them all down. Targeting the helicopter, he<br>
              aims at something only he can see: the oil line.</p>
            <p> PONK. PONK. PONK. The rear HULL is PUNCHED full of<br>
              holes and smoke and oil pours out like black blood.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Shit-shit-no!</p>
            <p> Neo is pulling Morpheus up to him when he hears the<br>
              HELICOPTER BEGIN TO DIE.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Oh fuck.</p>
            <p> Trinity throws the helicopter towards the roof of the<br>
              nearest building.</p>
            <p> Morpheus and Neo cling to one another as they and the<br>
              machine above them begin to fall.</p>
            <p> The ENGINE GRINDS, the CHOPPING BLADES start to slow<br>
              while --</p>
            <p> The Agents stand in the open shattered window, watching<br>
              the helicopter disappear behind taller buildings.</p>
            <p> Carried by its nomentum, Trinity guides the parabolic<br>
              fall over the nearest roof where --</p>
            <p> Neo and Morpheus drop safely, rolling free as the rope<br>
              goes slack. Neo gets to his feet, trying to detach<br>
              himself but --</p>
            <p> The helicopter is falling too fast, arcing over the roof<br>
              like a setting sun --</p>
            <p> The coils of slack snap taught --</p>
            <p> Yanking Neo off his feet, dragging him with ferocious<br>
              speed towards the edge even as --</p>
            <p> Trinity lunges for the back door, her gun in one hand,<br>
              grabbing for the rope with the other --</p>
            <p> Neo flies like a skipping stone, hurtling straight AT us,<br>
              when his feet hit the rain gutter --</p>
            <p> A fulcrum that levers him up just as --</p>
            <p> Trinity FIRES, severing the cord from the HELICOPTER,<br>
              falling free of it as it SMASHES, blades first into a<br>
              glass skyscraper.</p>
            <p> Holding onto the rope she swings, connected to Neo, who<br>
              stands on the building's edge watching her arc beneath<br>
              him as the HELICOPTER EXPLODES --</p>
            <p> She bounces against a shatterproof window that spider-<br>
              cracks out while FLAMES ERUPT behind her.</p>

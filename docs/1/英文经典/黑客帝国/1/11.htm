              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> His eyes snap open and he thrashes against the chair,<br>
              trying to rip the cable from the back of his neck.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Get this thing out of me!</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Easy, Neo. Easy.</p>
            <p> Dozer holds him while Trinity unlocks it. Once it's out,<br>
              he tears away from them, falling as he trips free of the<br>
              harness.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Don't touch me! Get away from me!</p>
            <p> On his hands and knees, he reels as the world spins.<br>
              Sweat pours off him as a pressure builds inside his skull<br>
              as if his brian had been put into a centrifuge.</p>
            <p> CYPHER<br>
              He's going to pop!</p>
            <p> Vomiting violently, Neo pitches forward and blacks out.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. NEO'S ROOM</p>
            <p> He blinks, regaining consciousness. The room is dark.<br>
              Neo is stretched out on his bed.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              I can't go back, can I?</p>
            <p> Morpheus sitting like a shadow on a chair in the far<br>
              corner.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              No. But if you could, would you really want to?</p>
            <p> Neo isn't sure of that answer.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              I feel that I owe you an apology. There is a rule that we do not<br>
              free a mind once it reaches a certain age. It is dangerous.<br>
              They have trouble letting go.. Their mind turns against them.<br>
              I've seen it happen. I broke the rule because I had to.</p>
            <p> He stares into the darkness, confessing as much to<br>
              himself as Neo.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              When the Matrix was first built there was a man born inside that<br>
              had the ability to change what he wanted, to remake the Matrix as 
              he saw fit. It was this man that freed the first of us and taught<br>
              us the secret of the war; control the Matrix and you control the<br>
              future.</p>
            <p> He pauses.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              When he died, the Oracle at the temple of Zion prophesied his<br>
              return and envisioned an end to the war and freedom for our<br>
              people. That is why there are those of us that have spent our<br>
              entire lives searching the Matrix, looking for him.</p>
            <p> Neo can feel his eyes on him.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              I did what I did, because I believe we have been brought here<br>
              for a reason, Neo. You are here to serve a purpose, just as I am<br>
              here to serve mine.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              I told you I don't believe in fate.</p>
            <p> Morpheus smiles, leaning towards hin.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              But I do, Neo. I do.</p>
            <p> He stands up.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Get some rest. You're going to need it.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              For what?</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Your training.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p> INT. HOVERCRAFT</p>
            <p> There is no morning; there is only darkness and then the<br>
              fluorescent light sticks flicker on.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. NEO'S ROOM</p>
            <p> Neo is awake in his bed, staring up at the lights. The<br>
              door opens and TA.NK steps inside.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              Morning. Did you sleep?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              No.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              You will tonight. I guarantee it. I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.</p>
            <p> He offers his hand and Neo shakes it. He notices that Tank doesn't 
              have any jacks.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              You don't have...</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              Any holes? Nope. Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent<br>
              pure, old fashioned, home-grown human. Born free. Right here in<br>
              the real world. Genuine child of Zion.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Zion?</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              Zion is the place, man. You'll see it one day. Last human city.<br>
              All we got left.</p>
            <p> Tank smiles.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              Goddamn, I got to tell you I'm fairly excited to see what you are<br>
              capable of. I mean if Morpheus is right and all. We're not supposed<br>
              to talk.about any of that, but if you are, well then this is an<br>
              exciting time. We got a lot to do so let's get to it.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> Neo is plugged in, hanging in one of the suspension chairs.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              We're supposed to load all these operations programs first, but<br>
              this is some major boring shit. Why don't we start something a<br>
              little fun?</p>
            <p> Tank smiles as he plops into his operator's chair. He begins flipping 
              through a tall carousel loaded with micro discs.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              How about sore combat training?</p>
            <p> Neo reads the label on the disk.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Jiujitsu? I'm going to learn jujitsu?</p>
            <p> Tank slides the disk into Neo's supplement drive.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              No way.</p>
            <p> Smiling, Tank punches the &quot;load&quot; code.</p>
            <p> His body jumps against the harness as his eyes clamp<br>
              shut. The monitors kick wildly as his heart pounds,<br>
              adrenaline surges, and his brain sizzles.</p>
            <p> An instant later his eyes snap open.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Holy shit!</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              Hey, Mikey, he likes it! Ready for more?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Hell yes!</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK - CLOSE ON COMPUTER MONITOR - LATER</p>
            <p> as grey pixels slowly fill a small, half-empty box. It<br>
              is a meter displaying how much download time is left.</p>
            <p> The title bar reads: &quot;Combat Series 10 of 12,&quot; file<br>
              categories flashing beneath it: Savate, Jujitsu, Ken Po,<br>
              Drunken Boxing...</p>
            <p> Morpheus walks in.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              How is he?</p>
            <p> Tank looks at his watch, rubs his eyes.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              Ten hours straight. He's a machine.</p>
            <p> Neo's body spasms and relaxes as his eyes open, breath<br>
              hissing from his lips. He looks like he just orgasmed.</p>
            <p> He locks at Morpheus.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              This is incredible. I know Kung Fu.</p>
            <p> Morpheus sits in the drive chair next to hin. He nods to Tank.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Show me.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. DOJO</p>
            <p> They are standing in a very sparse japanese-style dojo.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              This is a sparring program, similar to the programmed reality<br>
              of the Matrix. Consider this your first lesson.</p>
            <p> He assumes a fighting stance.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Attack me.</p>
            <p> Neo assumes a similar stance, cautiously circling until<br>
              he gives a short cry and launches a furious attack.</p>
            <p> It is like a Jackie Chan movie at high speed, fists and<br>
              feet striking from every angle as Neo presses his attack<br>
              --</p>
            <p> But each and every blow is blocked by effortless speed.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> While their minds battle in the programmed reality, the<br>
              two bodies appear quite serene, suspended in the drive<br>
              chairs.</p>
            <p> Tank monitors their life systems noticing that Neo is<br>
              wildly and chaotically lit up as opposed to the slow and<br>
              steady rhythm of Morpheus.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. MESS HALL</p>
            <p> Dinner is up. Everyone is eating bowls of single-cell<br>
              protein. It has a cottage cheese consistency.</p>
            <p> MOUSE bursts in the room.</p>
            <p> MOUSE<br>
              Morpheus is fighting Neo!</p>
            <p> All at once they bolt for the door.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. DOJO</p>
            <p> Neo's face is knotted, teeth clenched, as he hurls<br>
              himself at Morpheus.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Good. Adaption. Improvisation. But your weakness isn't your<br>
              technique.</p>
            <p> Morpheus attacks him and it is like nothing we have seen.<br>
              His feet and fists are everywhere taking Neo apart. For<br>
              every blow Neo blocks, five more hit their marks until --</p>
            <p> Neo falls.</p>
            <p> Panting, on his hands and knees, blood spits fror, his<br>
              mouth speckling the white floor of the Dojo.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              How did I beat you?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              You -- You're too fast.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with<br>
              my muscles in this place?</p>
            <p> Neo is frustrated, still unable to catch his breath.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Do you believe that's air you are breathing now?</p>
            <p> Neo squints at him.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              If you can free your mind, the body will follow.</p>
            <p> Neo stands, nodding.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Again.</p>
            <p> Their fists fly with pneumatic speed.</p>
            <p></p>

              EXT. CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Three figures silhouette by the burning wreckage become<br>
              the three agents.</p>
            <p> Further down the street, Neo hauls his broken, bleeding<br>
              ass.</p>
            <p> Agents Brown and Smith slow, touching their ear-pieces as<br>
              Agent Jones continues chasing full-bore.</p>
            <p> Neo spins around a corner, racing toward a hotel called:<br>
              the Heart of Chicago Hotel.</p>
            <p> Only Agent Jones is behind him now.</p>
            <p> Neo dives into the alley. At the far end he sees Agent<br>
              Brown charging. Neo leaps for the fire escape and begins<br>
              to climb.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. SEWER MAIN</p>
            <p> Sentinels open and shift like killer kaleidoscopes as<br>
              they ready their weapons, swarming around the<br>
              Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HOVERCRAFT</p>
            <p> The hovercraft booms as machines drop onto it.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              I'm going to make the call.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Do it!</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. &quot;HEART OF CHICAGO&quot; HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Agent Snith is in the elevator when he hears the DISTANT<br>
              RING of a PHONE.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. ALLEY (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> The agents chase him, FIRING, BULLETS SPARKING and<br>
              RICOCHETING even as Neo jumps for the third-floor<br>
              platform.</p>
            <p> Neo kicks in the window, jumping into the hall. The<br>
              doors count backwards: 310... 309...</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HOVERCRAFT</p>
            <p> Morpheus grabs the biggest gun he can find. The lasers<br>
              begin to slice through the hull.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Where is he?</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              Almost there.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              He's going to make it.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Hurry, Neo.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Neo can hear the PHONE RINGING.</p>
            <p> 305... 304...</p>
            <p> Agent Brown reaches the broken window behind him just as<br>
              Neo grabs the handle of 303, throwing open the door to<br>
              find --</p>
            <p> Agent Sniith, waiting, .45 cocked.</p>
            <p> Neo can't move -- can't think --</p>
            <p> BOOM.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HOVERCRAFT</p>
            <p> Neo's body jerks, and everyone hears it as the life<br>
              monitors snap flat-line.</p>
            <p> Trinity screams. Morpheus is frozen in disbelief.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Three holes in his chest, Neo falls to the blue shag<br>
              carpeting, blood smearing down the wallpaper.</p>
            <p> Agent Smith stands over him, still aiming, taking no<br>
              chances.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Check him.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HOVERCRAFT</p>
            <p> Through the lasered opening, Morpheus screams, blasting<br>
              away at the machines; comet-wads of plasma burning holes<br>
              in their armored housings.</p>
            <p> Trinity collapses onto Neo's body.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              No-no-no! Neo, you're not dead!<br>
              You can't be dead!</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Kneeling beside him, Agent Brown checks his vital signs.</p>
            <p> AGENT BROWN<br>
              He's gone.</p>
            <p> Agent Smith smiles, standing over him.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              I told you, you couldn't win.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HOVERCRAFT</p>
            <p> Tank is hit, a laser bolt knocking him to the ground.<br>
              They can't hold them off any longer. Morpheus lunges for<br>
              the self destruct --</p>
            <p> As Trinity whispers in Neo's ear.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              You're right here. I'm holding you, Neo. I'm not letting you go.<br>
              Do you hear me? I won't let you go.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> The agents walk to the elevator, leaving Neo's body<br>
              behind.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HOVERCRAFT</p>
            <p> Morpheus flicks the Plexiglas shield of the self-<br>
              destruct.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Goddamnit, Neo! Don't give it up!<br>
              Not now!</p>
            <p> She pounds on his chest.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Not now!</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HOTEL HALL (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> The BLOW ECHOES deep in his mind.</p>
            <p> His eyes snap open.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HOVERCRAFT</p>
            <p> Trinity screams as the monitors jump back to life. Tank<br>
              and Morpheus stare, unbelieving.</p>
            <p> It is a miracle.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Now get up!</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Neo struggles, holding his chest, sitting up. Down the<br>
              hall, he sees the elevator closing and --</p>
            <p> Agent Smith staring at him as if he were looking at a<br>
              Cypher.</p>
            <p> Neo gives him the finger.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Nooooo!</p>
            <p> Agent Smith pounds on the elevator door.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HOVERCRAFT</p>
            <p> A sentinel BLOWS a hole in Morpheus' right arm and he<br>
              screams, refusing to let go of the detonator.</p>
            <p> INT. ROOM 303 (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Neo dives for the RINGING PHONE.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HOVERCRAFT</p>
            <p> Machines split open the craft, pouring in, lasers<br>
              targeting everywhere.</p>
            <p> A beat finds the center of Morpheus' forehead and he<br>
              screams, ready to die.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Now!</p>
            <p> He turns the key.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. OVERFLOW PIT</p>
            <p> A blinding shock of white lights flood the chamber;<br>
              sentinels blink and fall instantly dead, filling the pit<br>
              with their cold, metal carcasses.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HOVERCRAFT</p>
            <p> In the still darkness, only the humans are alive.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Neo?</p>
            <p> His eyes open. Tears pour from her smiling eyes as he<br>
              reaches up to touch her.</p>
            <p> And she kisses hin; it seems like it might last forever.</p>
            <p> FADE TO BLACK.</p>
            <p><br>
              FADE IN:</p>
            <p> ON COMPUTER SCREEN</p>
            <p> as in the opening. The cursor beating steadily, waiting.</p>
            <p> A PHONE begins to RING.</p>
            <p> It is answered and the screen fills instantly with the<br>
              trace program. After a long beat, we recognize Neo's<br>
              voice.</p>
            <p> NEO (V.O.)<br>
              Hi. It's me. I know you're out there. I know you're working as<br>
              fast as you can to catch me.</p>
            <p> We CLOSE IN ON the racing columns of numbers shimmering<br>
              across the screen.</p>
            <p> NEO (V.O.)<br>
              I thought I should call and let you know how things stand.</p>
            <p> We DIVE THROUGH the numbers, surging UP THROUGH the<br>
              darkness, sucked TOWARDS a tight constellation of stars.</p>
            <p> NEO (V.O.)<br>
              I know you're real proud of this world you've built, the way it<br>
              works, all the nice little rules and such, but I've got some bad<br>
              news.</p>
            <p> We realize that the constellation is actually the holes<br>
              in the mouthpiece of a phone. Seen from inside.</p>
            <p> NEO (V.O.)<br>
              I've decided to make a few<br>
              changes.</p>
            <p> We SHOOT THROUGH the holes as Neo hangs up the phone.</p>
            <p> He steps out of the phone booth and starts walking,<br>
              wearing a long black coat and dark glasses. He passes a<br>
              mother dragging her little BOY, who cranes his neck as --</p>
            <p> Neo takes off, flying up into the air.</p>
            <p> BOY<br>
              Mommy! Mommy!</p>
            <p> MOMMY<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> BOY<br>
              That man! That man flies!</p>
            <p> MOMMY<br>
              Don't be silly, honey. Men don't fly.</p>
            <p> There is a RUSH of AIR as the Boy stares up as Neo shoots<br>
              overhead. His coat billowing like a black leather cape<br>
              as he soars up, up, and away.</p>
            <p> FADE OUT.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p> THE END</p>

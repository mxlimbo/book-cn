              INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> Trinity and Neo hang motionless in the suspension unit.<br>
              Tank is at the operations station.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              Okay. Store's open. What do you<br>
              need?</p>
            <p> TRINITY (V.O.)<br>
              Guns. Lots of guns.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              Coming right up.</p>
            <p> He loads the weapons disk.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. CONSTRUCT</p>
            <p> Racks of weapons appear and Neo and Trinity arm<br>
              themselves.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              No one has ever done anything like this.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Yeah?</p>
            <p> He snap cocks an Uzi.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              That's why it's going to work.</p>
            <p> INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Agent Smith is again at the window.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Why isn't the serum working?</p>
            <p> AGENT BROWN<br>
              Perhaps we are asking the wrong<br>
              questions.</p>
            <p> AGENT JONES<br>
              Or he doesn't know.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Of course he knows. He's<br>
              resisting.</p>
            <p> AGENT BROWN<br>
              How?</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              I don't know. If I knew...</p>
            <p> Agent Smith hides his knotting fist. He is becoming<br>
              angry. It is something that isn't supposed to happen to<br>
              agents.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Leave me with him.</p>
            <p> Agent Brown and Jones look at each other.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Now!</p>
            <p> INT. MAIN DECK</p>
            <p> Tank sits down beside Morpheus whose face is ashen like<br>
              someone near death. He takes hold of his hand.</p>
            <p> TANK<br>
              Hold on, Morpheus. They're coming for you. They're coming.</p>
            <p><br>
              EXT. NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> A dark wind blows.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> In long, black coats, Trinity and Neo push through the revolving 
              doors.</p>
            <p> Neo is carrying a duffel bag. Trinity has a large metal suitcase. 
              They cut across the lobby drawing nervous glances.</p>
            <p> Dark glasses, game faces.</p>
            <p> Several plainclothes cops try to stop them. They are met<br>
              by the MUTED SPIT of a SILENCED GUN and the RAZORED<br>
              WHISTLE of THROWING STARS.</p>
            <p> The cops slump down to the marbled floor while Neo and<br>
              Trinity do not even break stride.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Agent Smith leans close to Morpheus, whispering to him.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Can you hear me, Morpheus? I'm going to be honest with you.</p>
            <p> He removes his earphone, letting it dangle over his shoulder.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              I hate this place. This zoo. This prison. This reality,<br>
              whatever you want to call it, I can't stand it any longer. It's<br>
              the smell, if there is such a thing. I feel saturated by it. I<br>
              can taste your stink and every time I do, I fear that I've<br>
              somehow been infected by it.</p>
            <p> He wipes sweat from Morpheus' forehead, coating the tips<br>
              of his fingers, holding them to Morpheus' nose.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Repulsive, isn't it?</p>
            <p> He lifts Morpheus' head, holding it tightly with both hands.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              I must get out of here, I must get free. In this mind is tlie key.<br>
              My key.</p>
            <p> Morpheus sneers through his pain.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Once Zion is gone, there's no need for me to be here. Do you<br>
              understand? I need the codes. I have to get inside Zion. You have<br>
              to tell me how.</p>
            <p> He begins squeezing, his fingers gouging into his flesh.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Tell me! Tell me!</p>
            <p> The skull is about to shatter when Agents Jones and Brown<br>
              burst into the room. Agent Smith releases Morpheus.</p>
            <p> AGENT BROWN<br>
              What were you doing?</p>
            <p> Agent Smith recovers, replacing his ear piece.</p>
            <p> AGENT JONES<br>
              You don't know.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Know what?</p>
            <p> Agent Smith listens to his earphone, not believing what<br>
              he is hearing.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. ELEVATORS (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> They get in. Trinity immediately drops and opens the<br>
              suitcase, wiring a plastique and napalm bomb.</p>
            <p> Beneath their trench coats is an arsenal of weapons slung<br>
              from climbing harnesses.</p>
            <p> Neo hits the emergency stop. He pulls down part of the<br>
              false ceiling and finds the elevator shaft access panel.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Agent Jones looks at Morpheus.</p>
            <p> AGENT JONES<br>
              I think they're trying to save<br>
              him.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Neo ratchets down a clamp onto the elevator cable. Both<br>
              of them lock on. He looks up the long, dark throat of<br>
              the building and takes a deep breath.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              There is no spoon.</p>
            <p> Neo whips out his gun and presses it to the cable, lower<br>
              than where they attached themselves.</p>
            <p> BOOM! The CABLE SNAPS.</p>
            <p> The counter-weights plummet, yanking Trinity and Neo up<br>
              through the shaft as --</p>
            <p> The elevator falls away beneath them, distending space,<br>
              filling it with the sound of WHISTLING METAL as they soar<br>
              to the top.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. LOBBY (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> The ELEVATOR hits the botton.</p>
            <p> BA-BOOM!</p>
            <p> The massive EXPLOSION blows open the doors, fire clouds<br>
              engulfing the elevator section of the lobby.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> The Agents hear the BLAST AND FIRE ALARMS.</p>
            <p> AGENT JONES<br>
              Lower level --</p>
            <p> AGENT BROWN<br>
              They are actually attacking.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Hanging by a rope, Trinity hot-wires the panel for the door.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. TOP FLOOR (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> Nervous, the Marines watch as the ELEVATOR &quot;DINGS&quot; softly<br>
              and slides open.</p>
            <p> Black smoke rises out of the exposed shaft.</p>
            <p> The nearest Marine eases to the edge, peering down at the<br>
              churning blaze engulfing the lower levels.</p>
            <p> He does not see Trinity and Neo above him until it is too<br>
              late.</p>
            <p> Krack! Neo kicks, knocking the Marine flying down into<br>
              the shaft.</p>
            <p> Before the others can react, Trinity flips out into the<br>
              hall, decking the nearest Marine. Neo cracks another.</p>
            <p> The fight is over before it begins.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY</p>
            <p> An enormous EXPLOSION THUNDERS above them, shaking the<br>
              building. The ALARM SOUNDS, emergency sprinklers begin<br>
              showering the room.</p>
            <p> Agent Smith smashes a table.</p>
            <p> AGENT SMITH<br>
              Find them and destroy them!</p>
            <p> Agent Jones nods and touches his ear piece.</p>

              INT. POWER PLANT - CLOSE ON MAN'S BODY</p>
            <p> Floating in a womb-red amnion.</p>
            <p> His body spasms, fighting against the thick gelatin.</p>
            <p> Metal tubes, surreal versions of hospital tubes, obscure<br>
              his face. Other lines like IVs are connected to limbs<br>
              and cover his genitals.</p>
            <p> He is struggling desperately now. Air bubbles into the<br>
              Jell-O but does not break the surface.</p>
            <p> Pressing up, the surface distends, stretching like a red<br>
              rubber coccon.</p>
            <p> Unable to breathe, he fights wildly to stand, clawing at<br>
              the thinning elastic shroud --</p>
            <p> Until it ruptures, a hole widening around his mouth as he<br>
              sucks for air. Tearing himself free, he emerges from the<br>
              cell.</p>
            <p> It is Neo.</p>
            <p> He is bald and naked, his body slick with gelatin.<br>
              Dizzy, nauseous, he waits for his vision to focus.</p>
            <p> He is standing in an oval capsule of clear alloy filled<br>
              with red gelatin, the surface of which has solidified<br>
              like curdled milk.</p>
            <p> The IVs in his arms are plugged into outlets that appear<br>
              to be grafted to his flesh.</p>
            <p> He feels the weight of another cable and reaches to the<br>
              back of his head where he finds an enormous coaxial<br>
              plugged and locked into the base of his skull.</p>
            <p> He tries to pull it out but it would be easier to pull<br>
              off a finger.</p>
            <p> To either side he sees other tube-shaped pods filled with<br>
              red gelatin; beneath the wax-like surface, pale and<br>
              motionless, he sees other human beings.</p>
            <p> Fanning out in a circle, there are more. All connected<br>
              to a center core, each capsule like a red, dimly glowing<br>
              petal attached to a black metal stem.</p>
            <p> Above him, level after, level, the stem rises seemingly<br>
              forever. He moves to the foot of the capsule and looks<br>
              out.</p>
            <p> The image assaults his mind.</p>
            <p> Towers of glowing petals spiral up to incomprehensible<br>
              heights, disappearing down into a dim murk like an<br>
              underwater abyss.</p>
            <p> His sight is blurred and warped, exaggerating the<br>
              intensity of the vision. The sound of the PLANT is like<br>
              the sound of the ocean heard from inside the belly of<br>
              Leviathan.</p>
            <p> Below Neo, a petal detaches from the stem, bearing away<br>
              the body of an old man like an automated barge even as a<br>
              new pod rises up and plugs itself into the empty space.</p>
            <p> Inside the new capsule, its surface more translucent and<br>
              pinkish in color, Neo sees a small baby.</p>
            <p> From above, a machine drops directly in front of Neo.</p>
            <p> He swallows his scream as it seems to stare at him.</p>
            <p> It is almost insect-like in its design; beautiful<br>
              housings of alloyed metal covering organic-like systems<br>
              of hard and soft polymers.</p>
            <p> A black particle beam washes over Neo, he reacts in pain<br>
              as the scanner seems to expose the nervous system wired<br>
              to the coaxial cable at his cerebral cortex.</p>
            <p> At the back of the neck, the cable lock spins and opens,<br>
              disengaging.</p>
            <p> The cable pulls itself free, a long clear plastic needle<br>
              and cerebrum-chip slides from the anterior of Neols skull<br>
              with an ooze of blood and spinal fluid. The other<br>
              connective hoses snap free and snake away as --</p>
            <p> The back of the unit opens and a tremendous vacuum, like<br>
              an airplane door opening, sucks the gelatin and then Neo<br>
              into a black hole.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. WASTE LINE</p>
            <p> The pipe is a waste disposal system and Neo falls,<br>
              sliding with the clot of gelatin.</p>
            <p> Banking through pipe spirals and elbows, flushing up<br>
              through grease traps clogged with cily clunps of<br>
              cellulite.</p>
            <p> Neo begins to drown when he is suddenly snatched from the<br>
              flow of waste.</p>
            <p> The metallic cable then lifts, pulling him up into the<br>
              belly of the futuristic flying nachine, hovering inside<br>
              the sewer main line.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. HOVERCRAFT</p>
            <p> The metal harness opens and drops the half-conscious Neo<br>
              onto the floor.</p>
            <p> Human hands and arms help him up as he finds himself<br>
              looking straight at Morpheus.</p>
            <p> Trinity and Apoc. And others, dressed in bizarre, high-<br>
              tech combat gear.</p>
            <p> Morpheus smiles.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Welcome to the real world, Neo.</p>
            <p> Neo passes out.</p>
            <p> FADE TO BLACK.</p>
            <p> We have no sense of time. We hear VOICES whispering.</p>
            <p> MAN (O.S.)<br>
              Do you think Morpheus is right?<br>
              Do you think he could be the One?</p>
            <p> WOMAN (O.S.)<br>
              It doesn't matter now. But if he's wrong...</p>
            <p> FADE IN:</p>
            <p> NEO'S POV</p>
            <p> Neo's eyes flutter open. We see Trinity's face above us,<br>
              angelic in the fluorescent glow of a light stick.</p>
            <p><br>
              ANGLE ON NEO</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              ... am I dead?</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Far from it.</p>
            <p> FADE TO BLACK.</p>
            <p><br>
              FADE IN:</p>
            <p><br>
              ANGLE ON NEO</p>
            <p> He opens his eyes again, something tingling through him.<br>
              He focuses and sees his body pierced with dozens of<br>
              acupuncture-like needles wired to a strange device.</p>
            <p> DOZER<br>
              He needs a lot of work.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              I know.</p>
            <p> Dozer and Morpheus are operating on Neo.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              What are you doing?</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Your muscles have atrophied. We're rebuilding them.</p>
            <p> Fluorescent light sticks burn unnaturally bright.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Why do my eyes hurt?</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              You've never used them before.</p>
            <p> Morpheus takes his sunglasses off and puts them on Neo.<br>
              Neo lays back.</p>
            <p> MORPHEUS<br>
              Rest, Neo. The answers are coming.</p>
            <p></p>

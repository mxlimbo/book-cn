              EXT. STREET</p>
            <p> A police officer unlocks a yellow metal boot from the<br>
              wheel of an enormous oldsmobile.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. NEO'S APARTMENT</p>
            <p> They watch from the window as the cops, silently,<br>
              robotically, climb into their van.</p>
            <p> ANTHONY<br>
              Look at 'em. Automatons. Don't think about what they're- doing or<br>
              why. Computer tells 'em what to do and they do it.FRIEND #l<br>
              Thc banality of evil.</p>
            <p> He slaps the money in Neo's hand.<br>
              <br>
              ANTHONY<br>
              Thanks, neighbor.</p>
            <p> DUJOUR<br>
              Why don't you come to the party with us?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              I don't know. I have to work tomorrow.</p>
            <p> DUJOUR<br>
              Come on. It'll be fun.</p>
            <p> He looks up at her and suddenly notices on her black<br>
              leather motorcycle jacket dozens of pins: bands,<br>
              symbols, slogans, military medals and --</p>
            <p> A small white rabbit.</p>
            <p> The ROOM TILTS.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Yeah, yeah. Sure, I'll go.</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. APARTMENT</p>
            <p> An older Chicago apartment; a series of halls connects a<br>
              chain of small high-ceilinged rooms lined with heavy<br>
              casements.</p>
            <p> Smoke hangs like a veil, blurring the few lights there are.</p>
            <p> Dressed predominantly in black, people are everywhere,<br>
              gathered in cliques around pieces of furniture like<br>
              jungle cats around a tree.</p>
            <p> Neo stands against a wall, alone, sipping from a bottle<br>
              of beer, feeling completely out of place, he is about to<br>
              leave when he notices a woman staring at him.</p>
            <p> The woman is Trinity. She walks straight up to him.</p>
            <p> In the nearest room, shadow-like figures grind against<br>
              each other to the pneumatic beat of INDUSTRIAL MUSIC.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Hello, Neo.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              How did you know that --</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              I know a lot about you. I've been wanting to meet you for some time.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Who are you?</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              My name is Trinity.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Trinity? The Trinity? The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S.<br>
              Kansas City D-Base?</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              That was a long time ago.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Gee-zus.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              What?</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              I just thought... you were a guy.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Most guys do.</p>
            <p> Neo is a little embarrassed.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Do you want to go sorewhere and<br>
              talk?</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              No. It's safe here and I don't have much time.</p>
            <p> The MUSIC is so loud they must stand very close, talking<br>
              directly into each other's ear.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              That was you on the board tonight. That was your note, wasn't it?</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              I had to gamble that you would see and they wouldn't.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Who wouldn't?</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              I can't explain everything to you. I'm sure that it's all going 
              to<br>
              seem very strange, but I brought you here to warn you, Neo. You<br>
              are in a lot of danger.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              What? Why?</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              They're watching you. Something happened and they found out about 
              you. Normally, if our target is exposed we let it go. But this<br>
              time, we can't do that.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              I don't understand --</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              You came here because you wanted to know the answer to a hacker's 
              question.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              The Matrix. What is the Matrix?</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              Twelve years ago I met a man, a great man, who said that no one<br>
              could be told the answer to that question. That they had to see<br>
              it, to believe it.</p>
            <p> Her body is against his; her lips very close to his ear.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              He told me that no one should look for the answer unless they have 
              to because once you see it, everything changes. Your life and<br>
              the world you live in will never be the same. It's as if you wake<br>
              up one morning and the sky is falling.</p>
            <p> There is a hypnotic quality to her voice and Neo feels<br>
              the words like a drug, seeping into him.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              The truth is out there, Neo. It's looking for you and it will find<br>
              you, if you want it to.</p>
            <p> She takes hold of him with her eyes.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              That's all I can tell you right now. Good-bye, Neo. And good<br>
              luck.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>
              Wait. Who was it? Who was the<br>
              man?</p>
            <p> She leans close, her lips alrost touching his ear as she<br>
              whispers.</p>
            <p> TRINITY<br>
              You know who.</p>
            <p> She turns and he watches her melt into the shifting wall of bodies.</p>
            <p> A SOUND RISES steadily, growing out of the music,<br>
              pressing in on Neo until it is all he can hear as we --</p>
            <p> CUT TO:</p>
            <p><br>
              INT. NEO'S APARTMENT</p>
            <p> The sound is an ALARM CLOCK, slowly dragging Neo to<br>
              consciousness. He strains to read the clock face:<br>
              9:15 A.M.</p>
            <p> NEO<br>

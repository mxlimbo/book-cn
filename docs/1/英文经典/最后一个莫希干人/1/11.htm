              EXTERIOR FRENCH LINES - MUNRO, HEYWARD, BEAMS - DAY</p>
            <p> The drums are from Munro's honor guard. They stop. </p>
            <p> REVERSE: FRENCH SOLDIERS</p>
            <p> Marquis de Montcalm, immaculate, backed by his guard of honor 
              in white, grey and medium blue with six foot by eight foot regimental 
              colors and the French flag (gold fleur-de-lis on a field of blue). 
            </p>
            <p> FACES</p>
            <p> They carried two hundred and forty-five bateaux across a ten mile 
              portage, all their supplies and artillery, and then rowed down the 
              length of Lake George to get here. To them, assaulting this fort 
              is the easy part. The drummers of the honor guard play a tattoo 
              behind them. </p>
            <p> INDIAN FACES</p>
            <p> Huron, Ottawa, Osage, Choctaw, Fox ... hear the drum of the honor 
              guard and wait. They're in war paint. Many tattoos. Split ears. 
              The Osage scalping locks are hennaed red. Canadiens among them are 
              bearded, dirty, half savage ... At their head ... </p>
            <p> MAGUA</p>
            <p> in full war paint, with a coterie of Huron warriors, silent, waiting. 
              Drums. </p>
            <p> INTERIOR FORT - ENGLISH TROOPS (TABLEAUX)</p>
            <p> grim, silent, watchful. </p>
            <p> COLONIAL MILITIA &amp; MOHAWK INDIANS IN WAR PAINT (TABLEAUX)</p>
            <p> watching the parlay from a blown apart battery. Silent. </p>
            <p> WIDE: FRENCH &amp; ENGLISH</p>
            <p> and their honor guards. Montcalm steps forward and sweeps his 
              plumed hat to the ground in a courtly bow. Munro bows coldly. </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy 
              to make your acquaintance as a friend. </p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis. </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense 
              of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have 
              <br>
              fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material ... mere 
              chance has allowed me to array against you ... </p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called 
              this parlay for a reason. </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor 
              of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance 
              <br>
              has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But 
              now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you 
              to <br>
              consider my terms for your surrender. </p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort 
              William Henry is strong and stands. </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy 
              ... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your 
              works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition 
              as you are yourselves. </p>
            <p> Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by 
              duplicity before British reinforcements arrive? </p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows 
              the size and imminence of the army of Webb ...? </p>
            <p> Montcalm takes a moment to reply and appears genuinely sympathetic 
              to Munro. </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              (quietly)<br>
              My scouts intercepted this dispatch intended for you. </p>
            <p> Munro is puzzled, suspicious. </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              (to Bougainville)<br>
              Read the dispatch. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD &amp; MUNRO]</p>
            <p> BOUGAINVILLE <br>
              (O.S. - reading)<br>
              &quot;Colonel Munro - Fort William Henry. I have no men available 
              to send to your rescue. It is impossible. I advise you to seek terms 
              for <br>
              surrender. Signed Webb.&quot; </p>
            <p> Munro is rocked, as if struck by a blow. Bougainville hands Heyward 
              the letter. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              (confirming)<br>
              This is the signature of Webb. <br>
              (to Munro)<br>
              And I know the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a 
              French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end. </p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              (to Montcalm)<br>
              You have heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis. <br>
              (salutes) </p>
            <p> Munro starts off. Montcalm stops him. </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              Sir. <br>
              (challengingly)<br>
              I am incapable of mistreating brave men. I beg you not to sign the 
              death warrant of so many until you have listened to my <br>
              terms. </p>
            <p> Munro turns. </p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              Such as ...? </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              My master requires the fort be destroyed. But, for you and your 
              comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of <br>
              your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to 
              go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this<br>
              continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms. </p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              Their arms? </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition 
              ... Other than that, ask what you wish. </p>
            <p> Munro's impressed with Montcalm's generosity. </p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              The honors of war? </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              Granted. </p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              My colors? </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              Carry them to England to your King with pride. </p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              Allow me to consult with my officers. </p>
            <p> As he turns away something's been disconnected inside Munro that 
              can never get put back together. As the men move away from the French 
              ... </p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              I have lived to see two things I never expected. An Englishman afraid 
              to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that 
              advantage. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves 
              behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight. </p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              (flares)<br>
              Death and honor are sometimes thought to be the same. Today I have 
              learned that they are not. </p>
            <p> Munro looks at the fortress behind him. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Sir! </p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              (stops him with his eyes)<br>
              The decision is final. </p>
            <p> A beat. Then Munro turns toward Montcalm. Their eyes meet across 
              the churned, scarred earth of the battlefield. </p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity ... 
              The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until <br>
              dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march 
              and turn our wounded over to your surgeon. </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              Granted, Monsieur. </p>
            <p> And Montcalm bows deeply and as he does so ... </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FRENCH LINES - CLOAKED MAN - NIGHT</p>
            <p> passes away from the little city of tents in the direction of 
              the beach and towards William Henry. He seems to head towards a 
              vantage point from which to observe the fort. As he approaches a 
              sentry: </p>
            <p> SENTRY<br>
              Qui vive? </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              France. </p>
            <p> SENTRY<br>
              Le mot d'ordre? </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              La victoire. </p>
            <p> SENTRY<br>
              C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur! </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant. </p>
            <p> The cloak parts. By the light of the moon the man's face is dimly 
              perceived by us and the soldier as General Montcalm. The soldier 
              snaps erect as Montcalm continues walking out beyond the line to 
              a small stand of trees. </p>
            <p> ANOTHER ANGLE: MONTCALM</p>
            <p> The moon is broken into pieces of light on the water and behind 
              Montcalm; from the front of the stand of trees emerges a tall figure.</p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father? 
            </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              Yes. </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends. </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive 
              off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So <br>
              now he calls them enemies no longer. </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood. It is still bright. 
              Only when it is red, then it will be buried. </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is 
              he not tired? </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill. It is dark and 
              cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the 
              animals and sell <br>
              all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always 
              greedy for more than they need. <br>
              (threatening)<br>
              And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have <br>
              been many clouds and many mountains. But now<br>
              he has come to lead his nation. </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              That Le Renard has the power to lead his people <br>
              into the light, I know well. </p>
            <p> Magua grabs the hand of the French commander. Imperceptible surprise 
              in Montcalm's eyes. Magua jams Montcalm's fingers to his chest. 
            </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              Does my father know that? </p>
            <p> MAGUA'S CHEST</p>
            <p> A deep indentation and scar. </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              That's where a lead bullet has torn you. </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              And this? </p>
            <p> Magua turns his naked back to Montcalm and puts Montcalm's hand 
              on his back ... deep ridges of a scar a half inch wide.] </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              My son has been sadly injured. Who did <br>
              this? </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              (laughs; sardonic)<br>
              Magua slept hard in the English wigwams. And the sticks left their 
              mark ... <br>
              (pause; for real)<br>
              Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed 
              by the English. Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks <br>
              who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead 
              and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of 
              all this. <br>
              (pause)<br>
              In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In 
              his heart he always was Huron. And his heart will be whole again 
              on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead! </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              My son Magua's pain is my pain. </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the 
              terms? </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across 
              the salt lake. Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the 
              same men again when I move south.<br>
              (pause; shrugs)<br>
              And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully 
              the lilies of France ... </p>
            <p> Long pause, wheels turn. Then: </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can. </p>
            <p> Montcalm reacts as if he hadn't thought of that. </p>
            <p> MONTCALM<br>
              As the English march away, our soldiers and the Canadiens will be 
              drawn to the looting of the fort ... except for a small <br>
              guard ... </p>
            <p> Magua abruptly leaves Montcalm. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>

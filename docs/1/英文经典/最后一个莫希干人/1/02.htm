              Now Mohawk will fight Huron and Les Francais. My brothers have asked 
              me to lead them in this war so I speak for the Twin River Council. 
            </p>
            <p> The importance of this commitment is apparent to the lieutenant. 
            </p>
            <p> LIEUTENANT<br>
              His Majesty King George II is very grateful for your support. </p>

              To Fort William Henry. </p>
            <p> COLONIAL #1<br>
              ... two days from here. </p>
            <p> Some don't like this.</p>
            <p> LIEUTENANT<br>
              It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Your enemy ... </p>
            <p> Heads turn to Hawkeye at the periphery of the crowd.</p>
            <p> LIEUTENANT<br>
              What did you say? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (loud)<br>
              I said ... France is your enemy. Not ours. </p>
            <p> LIEUTENANT<br>
              Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims 
              to the head waters of the Ohio. <br>
              (smiles) <br>
              Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands ... </p>
            <p> LIEUTENANT<br>
              (ignoring Hawkeye)<br>
              Will you men help us stop the French? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              ... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French 
              send war parties to raid their homes? </p>
            <p> IAN<br>
              What then, Lieutenant? </p>
            <p> LIEUTENANT<br>
              For your own homes, for king, for country, that's why you men ought 
              to join this fight! </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              You do what you want with your own scalp. Do not be tellin' us what 
              to do with ours. </p>
            <p> LIEUTENANT<br>
              (furious; to Hawkeye)<br>
              You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              ... No ... Do not call myself much of a subject at all. </p>
            <p> Light laughter.</p>
            <p> COLONIAL #2<br>
              Nathaniel's right. But if I got to fight, figure I'll try and do 
              it fifty miles north of here instead of my bean field. </p>
            <p> AD LIBS<br>
              Yes. Yeah. No ... </p>
            <p> CAMERON<br>
              I am stayin' on my farm. And any man who goes, his family is welcome 
              to fort-up with us 'til he comes back. </p>
            <p> JACK<br>
              Boys. My sense of it is enough of us will join-up to fill the county's 
              levy. But only if General Webb accepts a few terms I got in mind 
              ... </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE &amp; UNCAS</p>
            <p> cross through the people. A few men drift off to their women at 
              the tables. It is apparent two-thirds of the men will join. A couple 
              of jokes, light banter, no hostility. </p>
            <p> AD LIBS <br>
              (O.S.) <br>
              Webb? what's that, Jack ...? </p>
            <p> As they cross through they start removing their shirts and weapons.</p>
            <p> IAN<br>
              You boys marchin' with us? What do you say? </p>
            <p> UNCAS<br>
              We had our say, Ian. </p>
            <p> They approach the Lacrosse field. Chingachgook stands with Cameron 
              in the background, watching. </p>
            <p> LACROSSE FIELD</p>
            <p> Uncas joins James. Hawkeye goes on the other side. A couple of 
              young Mohawks and a young blonde farmer shout hallo's and as the 
              bodies crash into each other ... </p>

            <p> EXTERIOR BRITISH ENCAMPMENT, PARADE GROUND - SIX HUNDRED 62nd 
              REGIMENT OF FOOT - DAY</p>
            <p> in two rows. At each command the crack troops respond en masse. 
              Their hands slap the stocks of their brown bess muskets in unison. 
              These men are drilling in preparation for war.<br>
              We witness a state-of-the-art, 18th century, precision killing machine.</p>
            <p> REGIMENTAL SGT. MAJOR<br>

              (muskets returned to shoulder)<br>
              Fire! </p>
            <p> Like a single shot, two hundred fifty black powder muskets fire 
              .65 caliber lead shot at chest height in a scythe of death. </p>
            <p> SERGEANT MAJOR<br>
              Prime! Load! </p>
            <p> The Dutch roof lines of Albany are in the distance. Nearer, a 
              coach races past. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> EXTERIOR ROAD - HORSES GALLOP - DAY</p>
            <p> Six horses, wide with dumb, mute strain. Foam, manes fly, their 
              hooves pound the yellow road into dust. Military outriders are on 
              the three left side horses. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> INTERIOR COACH - MAJOR DUNCAN HEYWARD - DAY</p>
            <p> sits erectly in the brilliant scarlet coat of the First Royal 
              Regiment of Foot with gold braid, blue-black facing and blue-black 
              breeches, cavalry boots, spurs, a tricorn, white wig (?) and a gorget 
              (large medallion) around his neck. He's 28-30 and tough. He is self-sure, 
              principled reactionary. He believes human society is static &amp; 
              layered into hierarchies of class and they are absolutely impermeable. 
              He opens a simple gold- clasped case &amp; contemplates its contents 
              ... </p>
            <p> HEYWARD'S POV: CASE</p>
            <p> an enameled portrait of a dark-haired young woman. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD</p>
            <p> as a soldier is militarily first-rate in his milieu: the open 
              battlefields of Europe. Right now, however, he is about to enter 
              the forests of North America. He closes his clasp and glances out 
              the window as we enter Albany and as a facade of buildings &amp; 
              people pass. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> INTERIOR BRITISH HQ, ASSEMBLY ROOM - DOOR - DAY</p>
            <p> Four Grenadiers come to attention as Heyward enters mid-scene.</p>
            <p> JACK<br>
              (O.S.)<br>
              ... if they are not allowed leave to defend their <br>
              families if the French or Hurons attack the <br>
              settlements, no colonial militia is goin' to Fort <br>
              William Henry.</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              (low)<br>
              You, there. Help my man outside with the baggage. </p>
            <p> GENERAL JEROME WEBB sees Heyward and nods. Three of Webb's Adjutants 
              are on either side. Three remaining Grenadiers in bearskin-covered 
              mitred caps are at the door. Facing Webb are a half dozen colonial 
              representatives, including Captain Jack Winthrop. Heyward watches 
              Jack ... </p>
            <p> LIEUTENANT<br>
              They will report or be pressed into service! </p>
            <p> LARGE COLONIAL REP<br>
              Any of the boys worth havin' can disappear into <br>
              forest ... time it takes you to blink. Where's that <br>
              leave ya, then? </p>
            <p> Heyward, preparing to hand over dispatches, is interrupted by 
              the insubordinate tone.<br>
              Equally wound tightly is the Lieutenant.</p>
            <p> LIEUTENANT<br>
              They will be found! Arrested ... </p>
            <p> WEBB<br>
              (cuts in)<br>
              I cannot imagine his Majesty, in his benevolence, would ever object 
              to his American subjects defending their hearth &amp; home, their 
              women &amp; children, if threatened by the &quot;scourge&quot; of 
              attack from savages, <br>
              aroused to such excess by our enemy, the ever-perfidious French. 
            </p>
            <p> JACK<br>
              Does that mean they will be granted leave to defend their homes 
              if the settlements are attacked? </p>
            <p> WEBB<br>
              Of course. </p>
            <p> Heyward's more amazed by what he's just heard from Webb. These 
              Americans, including Jack, are streaming past him on their way out.</p>
            <p> JACK<br>
              You got yourself a colonial militia, General. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Major Duncan Heyward reporting, Sir! </p>
            <p> Webb's pouring gin.</p>
            <p> WEBB<br>
              Duncan. How was your journey? </p>
            <p> The door closes. Dispatches are passed. They are now alone except 
              for the General's two Adjutants and a shadowy form waiting patiently 
              in a corner. He's MAGUA. In the dim light, he's motionless. Webb 
              slides a glass across to Heyward.</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany 
              as what I witnessed here today. </p>
            <p> WEBB<br>
              And what is that? </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              The Crown &quot;negotiating&quot; the terms of service? </p>
            <p> WEBB<br>
              I know.<br>
              (assuming a co-commiserator)<br>
              One has to give Americans &quot;reasons&quot; and make agreements 
              to get them to do anything at all. Tiring, isn't it? <br>
              (throws up his hands)<br>
              But that's the way of it here. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              (tight)<br>
              I thought British policy is 'Make the World ... England', sir. </p>
            <p> A chill. Majors don't upbraid Generals.</p>
            <p> WEBB<br>
              You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William 
              Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward. 
            </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Sir! ... Might I enquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel 
              Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort 
              them to the fort. </p>
            <p> WEBB<br>
              Yes. You may.<br>
              (to Magua, after a glance at Heyward)<br>
              You there. What does Munro call you?<br>
              (to Heyward) <br>
              The &quot;Scotsman&quot; has sent one of his Indian allies to guide 
              you. </p>
            <p> MAGUA</p>
            <p> rises and slowly walks into the light. He is reserved and over 
              six feet tall. His head is shaved into a mohawk. Rings, beads &amp; 
              feathers pierce his ears. A blanket is worn as a shawl over his 
              left shoulder exposing his right arm and heavy tattooing. A long 
              tomahawk is in the belt of his breechcloth.</p>
            <p> WEBB<br>
              The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company 
              of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way. 
            </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              By your leave, sir. </p>
            <p> Webb holds Heyward a moment</p>
            <p> WEBB<br>
              (to Adjutants)<br>
              Explain to the Major we care little about toying with colonial militia 
              because we have little to fear from the French. They have not the 
              nature for war. Their Latinate voluptuousness combines with <br>
              their Gallic laziness and the result is: they would rather make 
              love with their faces than fight. </p>
            <p> Webb's Adjutants laugh uproariously at his wit. Heyward's stiff, 
              perfunctory smile. He's been made the butt of the joke. He does 
              not share Webb's derisive view of the French. Webb doesn't like 
              Heyward's manner. We don't like Webb. Then:</p>
            <p> WEBB<br>
              (continuing) <br>
              Dismissed. </p>
            <p> Heyward stiffly salutes. Webb casually, perfunctorily salutes 
              the younger man in return.</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              (to Magua)<br>
              Dawn. At the encampment. Six a.m. sharp. See to it you're there.</p>
            <p> Beneath Magua's barely deferential manner we sense intelligence 
              &amp; menace. None of these Brits see it. We do. </p>

              MAGUA<br>
              (laughs)<br>
              It made our French father happy to never have to fight the same 
              Yengeese again. He told me this without telling me this. </p>
            <p> Hawkeye realizes this is true.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              So the Huron are the servants of the French? To do what the French 
              are shamed to do? </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              No. <br>
              (to Sachem)<br>
              Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because 
              he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it <br>
              is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one ... 
              Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the <br>
              Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade 
              with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take 
              land <br>
              from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk &amp; Fox. And make the 
              Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong 
              <br>
              as the whites. </p>
            <p> Hawkeye appears to be losing his debate with Magua.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (to Sachem)<br>
              Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese ... </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              (to Sachem)<br>
              The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became 
              the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish with brandy 
              and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man? Would 
              the <br>
              Huron have greed for more land than a man can use? Like Francais 
              Black Robes do? Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would <br>
              the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the animals in the forest 
              for beads &amp; brandy? But sell the fur to the white man for gold? 
              ... <br>
              (to Sachem)<br>
              Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les Francais masters. Are they 
              the ways of Huron men who hunt &amp; work the land? Or of dogs? 
              <br>
              ... Magua's heart is twisted. He would make himself into what twisted 
              him. A Dog, become Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs? <br>
              ... Magua's way is false. It is like the white sickness. Magua's 
              way will bring only sadness and shame. Is there another way? I don't 
              know. <br>
              (pauses)<br>
              I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye, adopted son of Chingachgook, 
              of the Mohican people ... Let the children of the dead Munro go 
              free ... I speak the truth. </p>
            <p> Magua starts to rebut. Sachem holds up his hand and stops him. 
              Nobody talks. Sachem whispers to the older men on either side of 
              him. </p>
            <p> MAGUA</p>
            <p> waits for the decision. </p>
            <p> CORA</p>
            <p> looks to Alice, then to Hawkeye. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> exchanges a desperate look with Cora and then senses the Sachem 
              is staring at him from the perspective of nearly a century of laws 
              &amp; judgments. Then ... to every word. </p>
            <p> SACHEM<br>
              The white man comes like a day that has passed. And night enters 
              our future with him ... <br>
              (pause)<br>
              Our council talks since I was a boy: <br>
              What is the Huron to do? <br>
              (pause)<br>
              But Magua would lead Huron down paths that make us not Hurons. <br>
              (the judgment)<br>
              Dark girl burn in fire to heal the twisted heart of Magua. </p>
            <p> Cora, hearing the sentence ... Hawkeye's losing her.</p>
            <p> SACHEM<br>
              (continuing)<br>
              Munro daughter with moon in her hair must be Magua's wife so Munro's 
              seed doesn't die. </p>
            <p> Alice is gone, living in some dark recess of her mind.</p>
            <p> SACHEM<br>
              (continuing; dissolves back to French)<br>
              ... and Yengeese officer not go to Les Francais, but back to Yengeese 
              so their hatred burns less bright. La Longue Carabine, <br>
              go in peace. </p>
            <p> People move, start to implement the sentence. Hawkeye's panicked. 
              Cora is jerked upright. She looks at Hawkeye in terror: Sachem is 
              starting to depart.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              No! listen. <br>
              (to Heyward)<br>
              Tell him I'll trade him! Me for her! Tell him!! </p>
            <p> Heyward translates into rapid-fire French. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              (shouts)<br>
              I am La Longue Carabine! My death is a great honor to the Huron. 
              Take me! </p>
            <p> Cora is jerked forward by three Hurons. Magua grabs Alice. Cora 
              strikes at Magua. He knocks her aside. Chaos &amp; confusion. Meanwhile: 
            </p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              (French; subtitled)<br>
              This is not the voice of wisdom. I go to the Hurons of the Lakes! 
              You are women. Send your arrows and guns to the Seneca, <br>
              beg from them venison to eat, corn to grind. Slaves, dogs, rabbits, 
              thieves ... I spit on you! </p>
            <p> Those Hurons who hear, do so in deadly, boding silence. Magua 
              and his fourteen hard core braves start out as ... </p>
            <p> SACHEM</p>
            <p> heard Heyward's translation. He looks at Heyward, then looks at 
              Hawkeye and he nods his head. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> sees this. His eyes go to Cora. They've stopped dragging her towards 
              the fire pit. Hawkeye steps forward to surrender. Cora is thrown 
              at him. Cora looks around wildly. Instead of taking Hawkeye, two 
              warriors grab Heyward. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD</p>
            <p> is immediately hamstrung and his legs collapse. He gasps. He's 
              caught under the arms and dragged forward.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              I said to trade me! </p>
            <p> Hawkeye's holding Cora. Heyward struggles to be seen.</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              ... compliments, Mr. Poe. <br>
              (pause)<br>
              Take her and get out. </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              (standing)<br>
              What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan! </p>
            <p> He's gone. They start to ease away from the mass of Hurons.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE <br>
              (low to himself)<br>
              And my compliments to you ... </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              Alice? </p>
            <p> Hawkeye's concentration is on backing out of the Huron mob. Will 
              the Sachem's judgment be honored? Will some warriors hack down Hawkeye 
              &amp; Cora? As they go ... </p>
            <p> CORA</p>
            <p> moves towards her sister. But Hawkeye holds her tightly as they 
              retreat. </p>
            <p> CORA'S POV: ALICE</p>
            <p> with Magua's group crosses the path. He drags Alice behind him 
              like baggage. She regains her feet. Magua is oblivious to her. He's 
              heading towards the plateau. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ... </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FOREST, TREE LINE - CHINGACHGOOK &amp; UNCAS - DAY</p>
            <p> Uncas sees Magua's direction. Uncas touches his father, grabs 
              his musket and races off. Chingachgook reaches to stop him, but 
              he's too late. Chingachgook's hand in the air ... </p>
            <p> TWO-SHOT: HAWKEYE &amp; CORA</p>
            <p> near the tree line. Hawkeye has eyes only for ... </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE'S POV: HURONS</p>
            <p> moving towards fire pit. One turns to watch Hawkeye &amp; Cora 
              depart. Will he arouse others to attack? Behind him, others are 
              doing something to Heyward and flames leap up. </p>
            <p> CORA'S EYES</p>
            <p> are on Alice, off to the right in the meadow. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> tense. They're almost there. </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> holding Killdeer. </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK'S POV: MASSED HURON</p>
            <p> Sky &amp; flames. Suddenly, Heyward's stood upright into the fire, 
              bound to a bracket by his arms. As the flames start devouring him 
              ... </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE &amp; CORA</p>
            <p> close to Chingachgook and the tree line ... </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> tosses Hawkeye Killdeer. As fast as he jams it into his shoulder 
              he FIRES. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD</p>
            <p> among the hollering Hurons, is shot dead. It goes unnoticed. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - UNCAS - DAY</p>
            <p> half-way up the rock face. He's approaching an overhang. He climbs 
              with a reckless desperation ... </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR STREAM - HAWKEYE &amp; CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> pound across the (sic) to the meadow towards Magua's path ... 
            </p>
            <p> CORA</p>
            <p> trying to stay with them, scrambles up ... </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - UNCAS</p>
            <p> reaches the overhang. It juts away from the face six feet. </p>
            <p> THE CEILING OF THE OVERHANG</p>
            <p> Uncas' hand jams into a crack in the granite, forms a fist and 
              twists, making a wedge. He swings out, dangling in space by the 
              hand wedged into the rock. His right hand reaches out and up, searching 
              the vertical face for ... </p>
            <p> UNCAS' HAND</p>
            <p> ... a rock flake. An indentation. Anything ... His fingers find 
              a diagonal crevice and ... </p>
            <p> UNCAS</p>
            <p> swings out, now hanging by the vertical face above the overhang. 
              His features are distorted with determination. Nothing will stop 
              him. His right hand grabs another rock. His arms snap him up. Then 
              push. He's on the ledge. Moving fast ... </p>
            <p> CUT TO ... </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - HURONS - DAY</p>
            <p> on point are approaching the path above the promontory. Five warriors 
              are ahead of Magua. One behind him drags Alice. </p>
            <p> FIRST</p>
            <p> Huron starts up the narrow path. Suddenly ... </p>
            <p> UNCAS</p>
            <p> slams him off the rock with the butt of his musket. </p>
            <p> WIDE ANGLE</p>
            <p> Two's musket coming up. Uncas swings. FIRES. Before he's fallen, 
              Uncas bayonets Three. </p>
            <p> FOURTH</p>
            <p> FIRES, misses, swings. Uncas slips the swung musket, but it catches 
              his elbow. Uncas' musket falls. Before it hits the ground his tomahawk 
              is out and hacks Four over the edge ... </p>
            <p> MAGUA</p>
            <p> running forward past Five, confronts Uncas head on. It's incredibly 
              fast. </p>
            <p> UNCAS'</p>
            <p> three tomahawk swings are dodged by Magua whose own knife streaks 
              like silver flashes. Uncas, gashed on arms and chest, feints right 
              and slams Magua with an open hand, closes and the men are intertwined 
              steel and muscle ... and Magua throws Uncas.<br>
              Going with him and rolling off Uncas, Magua's knife flashes into 
              his armpit. Uncas' right arm is useless. He scrambles up. Next to 
              the expertise of a mature warrior like Magua, Uncas' raw, young 
              determination may not be enough. </p>

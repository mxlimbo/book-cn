              EXTERIOR WOODS - MAGUA - NIGHT</p>
            <p> walking back to the Huron camp. Reveal a Huron sub-chief has been 
              in the woods, waiting for Magua. Now he joins him. They walk in 
              silence. Then ...</p>
            <p> MAGUA<br>
              (in Iroquois; re: Montcalm)<br>
              I wonder at the blindness and pride of the white man. He believes 
              only he knows how to speak falsely to make other men do <br>
              his bidding. </p>
            <p> Magua exhales in derision. </p>
            <p> CUT TO ...</p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FORT, MAIN GATE - MUNRO - DAY</p>
            <p> at the end of the column, rides out on his horse. Both sides of 
              the gate are jammed with armed French troops standing at attention. 
              The French colors and honor guard are just outside the gate along 
              with Bougainville, Chevalier de Levis, both on horseback as is - 
              at the head - Montcalm. </p>
            <p> CLOSER: MUNRO</p>
            <p> trots past his walking column out the gate. He does not look at 
              the French. </p>
            <p> MONTCALM</p>
            <p> salutes Munro and bows gravely from the saddle. </p>
            <p> CLOSER: MUNRO</p>
            <p> salutes Montcalm.</p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              (eyes forward)<br>
              Monsieur, the fort is yours. </p>
            <p> MID-COLUMN - ON HEYWARD</p>
            <p> marching with his 33rd Regiment of Foot well beyond the fort. 
              The French troops have thinned out. Repressing shame, his backbone 
              is rigid, his face is straight ahead. The 33rd marches in perfect 
              cadence to the drum. In the B.G. Munro on his horse passes Heyward 
              as he rides towards the front of his column. Heyward does not look 
              at him. </p>
            <p> FRONT OF COLUMN - CORA WITH ALICE</p>
            <p> on the back of a mare. Alice, living through a wide-awake nightmare, 
              is huddled under the arm of her sister. They ride behind the standard 
              bearers. In the B.G. her father is seen approaching and takes his 
              position at their side. Cora looks down the column, sheilding her 
              eyes against the sun. We know who she's looking for ... Hawkeye. 
            </p>
            <p> CORA'S POV: THE COLUMN</p>
            <p> The 62nd and 42nd Highlanders including Heyward ... thirty to 
              forty women and a number of children - for safety - in the middle, 
              some frontiersmen, Ongewasgone and many Mohawk, walking wounded. 
              The column is still snaking its way out of the fort.<br>
              No Hawkeye. </p>
            <p> CORA</p>
            <p> straining to see. </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FORT - PRISONERS</p>
            <p> being assembled, their hands shackled. Hawkeye is among twelve 
              or thirteen. He stands erect, walking out of the gate. The French 
              are starting to pour in to loot the interior. Hawkeye looks to his 
              left about twenty paces in front of him and sees ... </p>
            <p> UNCAS &amp; CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> on the other side of the column. Chingachgook cradles Killdeer 
              as well as his own musket. They fall back to walk beside the prisoners 
              on the other side of Hawkeye. Their eyes connect... We don't expect 
              Hawkeye to stay shackled for the duration. </p>
            <p> RANK AND FILE FRENCH</p>
            <p> A few insults. The British soldiers answer. Nobody breaks rank. 
              It's just talk. </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR ROAD - HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> His eyes sweep the column snaking its way into the v-shaped valley. 
              The path cuts through the forested hills ahead. He sees ... </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE'S DISTANT POV: CORA</p>
            <p> riding near the front where there are no more French soldiers. 
              Only a few scattered and curious Huron and Ottawa. She does not 
              see him. </p>
            <p> PROFILE OF COLUMN - HIGH &amp; WIDE</p>
            <p> as it passes left to right below like a long snake through the 
              narrow valley. We're shooting from inside the dark woods. Lower, 
              in the light, we see a scattering on both slopes of a couple of 
              hundred Ottawa and Huron. They are in no order, are spread out and 
              don't constitute a threat. They watch the column. </p>
            <p>SLOWLY THE CAMERA ... slides across the shoulders and back of a 
              large man wearing black plumes in his scalp-lock and other than 
              a breechcloth is almost naked. He is heavily war-painted ... </p>
            <p> FRONTAL - MAGUA</p>
            <p> and the left two-thirds of his face is painted red. The right 
              third is painted black. Much silver is in his ears. His tomahawk 
              is in his left hand. His cut-down musket in his right fist. Magua's 
              attention is all focused to one point. </p>
            <p> MAGUA'S LONG &amp; TIGHT POV: MUNRO &amp; CORA &amp; ALICE</p>
            <p> at the head of the column. This is the focus of Magua's attention. 
            </p>
            <p> WIDE FRONTAL: COLUMN, STANDARD BEARERS &amp; MUNROS</p>
            <p> Cora turns again to look for Hawkeye. </p>
            <p> CLOSER: CORA</p>
            <p> doesn't see him, but something else has caught her eye. </p>
            <p> YOUNG HURON</p>
            <p> running toward the column. Just one man. No musket. He's running 
              and whooping like a dog charging from his master's front yard. Why? 
            </p>
            <p> CLOSER</p>
            <p> the Huron arrives at the column, his tomahawk swings into his 
              hand and he brains a British trooper who falls dead. The single 
              Huron never breaks stride. He simply runs off again ... </p>
            <p> CORA</p>
            <p> horrified, holds Alice tighter. </p>
            <p> MUNRO</p>
            <p> has seen it too. And now he sees ... </p>
            <p> 62ND REGIMENT OF FOOT</p>
            <p> fixing bayonets. A large sergeant unsheathes a two-handed claymore, 
              facing the Hurons and other Indians ... </p>
            <p> TROOPERS</p>
            <p> of the 33rd present arms. Did they violate the surrender by carrying 
              ammunition? Locks are cocked. There's the answer. </p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              Steady! No one fires! </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FORESTED HILLSIDES - OTHER TRIBES</p>
            <p> are watching what happens. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD</p>
            <p> scanning them. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              (to Sergeant Major)<br>
              Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major! </p>
            <p> SERGEANT MAJOR<br>
              Yes sir! </p>
            <p> Drums beat the cadence.</p>
            <p> TROOPERS</p>
            <p> step over the fallen soldier. Heads turn, they're on edge ... 
            </p>
            <p> END OF COLUMN - HAWKEYE, UNCAS &amp; CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> watching. They exchange looks. This is not good. Chingachgook 
              cocks both Killdeer and his own musket. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE'S POV: FORESTED SLOPES</p>
            <p> Hold. We start to make out details in the shadow. Tree trunks. 
              We become accustomed to the dimness. Now in the lower light we see 
              deeper in the forest. </p>
            <p> CLOSER</p>
            <p> Many Huron and Ottawa are hidden in the shadows. They're moving 
              along parallel to the column, stalking it. Waiting ... </p>
            <p> ANOTHER BRAVE</p>
            <p> racing down the hill from the opposite flank towards the 62nd. 
            </p>
            <p> TWO SOLDIERS</p>
            <p> look at their sergeant. He nods. They wait until he's within ten 
              feet of the column. Both bayonet the Indian. He's dead. </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR HILLSIDES - HURON &amp; OTTAWA</p>
            <p> saw what happened. But, they hold their ranks. </p>
            <p> MOHAWKS</p>
            <p> among the British are slipping tomahawks into their hands, surreptitiously. 
              Some are cocking flintlocks. </p>
            <p> MUNRO</p>
            <p> gallops his horse away from Cora and Alice towards the scene of 
              the last attack. We hear him from the distance ordering ...</p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              Do not break ranks! I want these ranks to hold ...! </p>
            <p> Cora's frightened.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE'S</p>
            <p> frustrated. He saw Munro leave Cora. He knows events have a momentum 
              and it's accelerating. </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK &amp; UNCAS</p>
            <p> move next to the sergeant with the shackle keys who looks at them 
              curiously as ... </p>
            <p> WOMEN</p>
            <p> with children nervously search the threatening trees, hoping against 
              hope these are isolated incidents. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD</p>
            <p> draws his sword and is passing orders to his sergeant major, scanning 
              the hills ... </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FORESTED SLOPE - MAGUA</p>
            <p> His eyes see Munro. </p>
            <p> WIDER &amp; LOWER: MAGUA</p>
            <p> raises his musket in his fist and emits a war whoop. WE NOW SEE 
              ... hundreds have been stalking the column, hidden in the trees, 
              maybe thousands. Then ... </p>
            <p> WIDE: ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE</p>
            <p> FIRE from the trees crescendos within seconds revealing a spontaneous 
              and massive ambush of mostly Hurons. They appear from behind every 
              tree and it turns to a ROAR of musket fire, war whoops and screams 
              as ... </p>
            <p> SOLDIERS &amp; CIVILIANS</p>
            <p> dropping like flies and seemingly thousands of Hurons attack down 
              both slopes. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> is being unshackled by Uncas. The sergeant is rising from the 
              ground where Chingachgook knocked him. Chingachgook throws Hawkeye 
              Killdeer and Hawkeye shrugs into his pouch and powder horn as he 
              races with Uncas for the head of the column ... </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR FORESTED SLOPE - MAGUA</p>
            <p> charging down the hill ... with his coterie of twenty Huron warriors, 
              heading for the area in which he saw Munro. </p>
            <p> CORA &amp; ALICE</p>
            <p> at the head of the disintegrating column. Cora's holding Alice's 
              head to her bosom, covering her ears as if to protect her from the 
              sounds. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD</p>
            <p> shouting orders. </p>
            <p> SERGEANT MAJOR<br>
              Right - about face! March! First rank present! </p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Fire! </p>
            <p> REVERSE:</p>
            <p> The volley knocks down fifteen of a horde of attacking Hurons. 
            </p>
            <p> SERGEANT MAJOR<br>
              Prime! Load! Second rank six paces forward! Present! </p>
            <p> Hurons are twenty yards away and closing.</p>
            <p> HEYWARD<br>
              Fire! </p>
            <p> As the line of muskets belch smoke and fire ... </p>
            <p> WIDE: THE HILLS &amp; PATH</p>
            <p> We're shooting into the &quot;v&quot; of the valley with Hurons 
              and other tribes pouring down from both sides. (IMPORTANT: the combined 
              musket fire of Hurons, English and Mohawks generates tremendous 
              clouds of smoke which obscure action, close off views, isolate pockets 
              of combat into surreal tableaux that we'll move in and out of.</p>
            <p> BRITISH TROOPERS</p>
            <p> using their useless muskets as clubs or with fixed bayonets - 
              as the smoke and fog swirls among the men - fighting for their lives 
              ... </p>
            <p> MAGUA</p>
            <p> glides through the scenes, striking and hunting. Some of his coterie 
              of braves near him. He sees ... </p>
            <p> BLONDE WOMAN</p>
            <p> hugging the ground in fear. Magua throws her over. It's not Alice 
              Munro. It's a woman protecting her baby. Magua walks on. One of 
              the braves behind Magua raise his tomahawk. On his downswing ... 
            </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> running through surreal patches, thinks he glimpses Cora two hundred 
              yards away. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Cora! </p>
            <p> Chingachgook, on Hawkeye's left, slams down two Hurons with his 
              war club. </p>
            <p> CORA &amp; ALICE</p>
            <p> running through the chaos and murder and British troopers and 
              Mohawks locked in struggle with Hurons. Cora's dress is torn. She 
              holds Alice to her. There's a pistol in Cora's hand. </p>
            <p> ONE HURON</p>
            <p> scalping a prone soldier, rips the trophy from his head, turns 
              and faces us. </p>
            <p> CORA</p>
            <p> shoots him in the face. </p>
            <p> EXTREMELY CLOSE: ALICE</p>
            <p> and her eyes take it all in. And her affect starts to flatten. 
              A blankness suffuses her expression and the girl withdraws from 
              this reality into a deep dark cave inside her head. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> locked in combat. He tomahawks one Huron's arm with a slashing 
              downstroke and comes right back into the face of the second with 
              his backswing while his right hand fires Killdeer at ... </p>
            <p> HURON</p>
            <p> six feet from Uncas and about to shoot him in the back. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> free for a moment, spins. He has no idea of direction any more. 
              Everything is death in strange tableaux. Meanwhile: </p>
            <p> MUNRO</p>
            <p> hollering</p>
            <p> MUNRO<br>
              Cora! Alice! </p>
            <p> He cuts down a Huron with his sword who is trying to leap at him 
              from the right. An Osage warrior with red scalp-lock leaps on the 
              back of Munro's horse, reaching over to stab down into Munro's neck. 
              The old man's left hand grabs the warrior's knife hand in<br>
              an iron grip. His right hand pulls his horse pistol and under his 
              upraised arm fires backward, point blank, blowing the Osage off 
              the back of his horse. </p>
            <p> WIDER</p>
            <p> Just then Munro's mount is shot. His horse rears up, throws Munro 
              and falls on him. </p>
            <p> HEYWARD</p>
            <p> shouting orders over the deafening noise.</p>

              EXTERIOR - MEADOW - CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> freezes. </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - UNCAS</p>
            <p> closing, swings. Magua moves inside, stabs Uncas twice, turns 
              him to face the edge, ripping his head left to expose the right 
              underside of his throat. </p>
            <p> CLOSE: MAGUA'S</p>
            <p> knife arm punches forward. </p>
            <p> WIDE: PROMONTORY</p>
            <p> Uncas falls down the face onto to the rocks. </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> seeing his boy killed, CRIES out and is charging up the path, 
              Hawkeye following. </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - ALICE</p>
            <p> backs to the edge. </p>
            <p> MAGUA</p>
            <p> moves on Alice. His knife is low, about to strike. She stares 
              at him. Her eyes are like pools of deep water, calm, open, almost 
              beatific. It stops Magua ... </p>
            <p> MAGUA</p>
            <p> inexplicably, drops his knife hand. He's riveted by her. About 
              him, there's a glimmer of something else. He wears a human face 
              for this one moment. He reaches out with his other hand to offer 
              her safety. To bring her back from the edge ... </p>
            <p> ALICE</p>
            <p> looks down at Uncas, her lover, dead on the rocks below. She turns 
              to Magua with enigmatic calm. Her eyes seem to see into him. She 
              steps off the edge. She falls to her death next to Uncas ... </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR MEADOW - CORA</p>
            <p> collapses to her knees on the ground and her face falls forward 
              into her hands ... </p>
            <p> HURON WARRIORS</p>
            <p> are running down the path to intercept Chingachgook, charging 
              uphill, fueled by a father's rage, and Hawkeye. One Huron aims at 
              the center of Chingachgook's chest ... </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> FIRES past his father's side. The Huron's blown off the path. 
              Hawkeye races to reload on the run ... </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - MAGUA</p>
            <p> sees the approach of Chingachgook. </p>
            <p> TO CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> Huron warriors are an irrelevance. He slams one aside with his 
              musket. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE FIRES. </p>
            <p> HURON</p>
            <p> with tomahawk, about to blindside Chingachgook, is SHOT DOWN. 
            </p>
            <p> MAGUA</p>
            <p> charging Chingachgook. </p>
            <p> VERY WIDE</p>
            <p> Two men, like dots, race to collide at the center of the promontory. 
              Now the others fall back... It's one-on-one. Hawkeye slows ... </p>
            <p> COMBATANTS</p>
            <p> Magua - confident, pumped up - feints with his left, his tomahawk 
              appearing in his right, sweeping backhand, while his left, magically 
              holding his blade, is jamming up to gut Chingachgook. Chingachgook's 
              dead. Except ... </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> isn't there. He rolled and, on one knee with his back to Magua, 
              his arm slams rearward. The massive war club crashes into Magua's 
              back. </p>
            <p> MAGUA</p>
            <p> stunned, turns to hatchet Chingachgook ... </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> now up and towering - slams his club right into Magua's assault 
              ... destroying it, breaking Magua's right arm. And ... </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> ... with his momentum, spins like a shot-putter and the next blow 
              cripples Magua's left side and crushes part of his chest. </p>
            <p> ANOTHER BLOW</p>
            <p> destroys Magua's collar and shoulder. </p>
            <p> MAGUA</p>
            <p> amazed. His body is broken and crippled, but he still stands. 
              He looks into the eyes of the last warrior of the Mohicans. </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK<br>
              UNCAS!!! </p>
            <p> And he spins and swings. The blade side of the war club punches 
              into Magua's chest, caving him in two. </p>
            <p> WIDE</p>
            <p> Magua dies in the dust. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE</p>
            <p> watching Chingachgook's heaving back. It's over. </p>
            <p> CORA</p>
            <p> alone, kneeling in the meadow. Her eyes downcast ... </p>
            <p> FADE OUT ...</p>
            <p> FADE IN </p>
            <p> EXTERIOR - MOUNTAIN TOP - WIDE REAR SHOT - NEXT DAY</p>
            <p> Chingachgook's at the edge, facing the endless rolling forests 
              to the west. A haze of sunlight illuminates silver and lead clouds. 
              Hawkeye is a little apart, watching his father. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE'S POV: CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> speaks to the sky.</p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK<br>
              (Mohican)<br>
              Great Spirit and the Maker of all Life ... </p>
            <p> ON HAWKEYE &amp; CHINGACHGOOK</p>
            <p> We HEAR Hawkeye's English translation in VOICE OVER: </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK/<br>
              HAWKEYE (V.O.): <br>
              (in English)<br>
              ... a warrior goes to you swift and straight <br>
              as an arrow shot into the sun. Welcome him <br>
              and let him take his place at the council fire <br>
              of my people. <br>
              (pause)<br>
              He is Uncas, my son. <br>
              (pause)<br>
              Bid them patience and ask death for speed; <br>
              for they are all there but one<br>
              - I, Chingachgook - Last of the Mohicans. </p>
            <p> Chingachgook's hands drop to his sides. He lets out his breath 
              with a weariness. His eyes seek Hawkeye's. They hold ... </p>
            <p> CORA</p>
            <p> is standing, her back to us, in front of a rock-covered grave 
              with a wooden cross. Next to it is Uncas' burial platform. Cora 
              [says a] silent prayer. Then she pauses, crosses herself. Her emotions 
              are spent. She moves next to Hawkeye. He takes her hand. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE &amp; CORA]</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Will you go back to England? </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              I have nothing to go back for. </p>
            <p> Long pause. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Then will you stay in America? </p>
            <p> She turns to face him.</p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              And will you be my wife? </p>
            <p> Pause. </p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              Yes. </p>
            <p> They hold each other's eyes. She searches his face.</p>
            <p> CORA<br>
              Where will we go? </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              Winter with the Delaware, my father's <br>
              cousins. And in the spring, cross the <br>
              Ohio and look for land to settle with my <br>
              father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee. </p>
            <p> They move next to Chingachgook. He senses they're beside him. 
              Hawkeye's arm is around her shoulders.</p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK<br>
              The frontier moves with the sun and pushes <br>
              the red man of the wilderness forests in front <br>
              of it. Until one day there will be nowhere left. <br>
              Then our race will be no more, or be not us ... <br>
              The frontier place is for people like my white <br>
              son and his woman and their children. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              That's my father's sadness talking. </p>
            <p> Hawkeye puts a hand on his shoulder.</p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK<br>
              No. It is true ... One day ... there will be no <br>
              more frontier. Then men like you will go, too. <br>
              Like the Mohicans. <br>
              (pause)<br>
              And new people will come. Work. Struggle <br>
              to make their light ... One mystery remains. </p>
            <p> HAWKEYE<br>
              What is that? </p>
            <p> Cora, listening to Chingachgook, takes Hawkeye's hand. </p>
            <p> CHINGACHGOOK<br>
              Will there be anything left to show the world <br>
              that we ever did exist? </p>
            <p> REAR SHOT</p>
            <p> Cora stands next to her man. Hawkeye puts his arm around his father. 
              They stare out over the wilderness. </p>
            <p></p>
